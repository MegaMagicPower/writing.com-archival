Height and more will be announced beforehand, while there is no maximum height I will set a minimum to keep things interesting. The smallest height any girl could start out at is 100 feet tall, keep in mind I've never done a Giantess story, only shrinking stories in the past so this will be a nice test and it will allow me to step out of my own comfort zone slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I'm sure you don't come here to read about me talking about myself. So on to the first choices. Which anime do you wanna see a girl get giant in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto Shippuden, Dragon Ball Super, Fairy Tail, and Pokemon(only Gen's one through five for now), Gen Six and Seven options will be available in a later chapter in 'More Choices' where there are less options.</span></div></div>",

I'm looking forward to seeing her get bigger, making her problems, and everyone else around her smaller by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the first Scenarios in this line up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Korra stands up against Kuvira as she attempts to invade Republic City in her Colossus Mecha. However, in this timeline a beam fired from the Mecha's cannon strikes Korra, effectively supercharging her Avatar spirit Raava. This causes Korra to suddenly grow to five hundred feet tall, now she can take the fight back to Kuvira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. A technical malfunction at Future Industries causes Asami to become two hundred feet tall, over 30 times her normal height. Will she be able to reverse the process or will she have to adjust to living life at her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of these choices to your liking, you can always make your own in the 'More Scenarios' tab below.</span></div></div>",

Naruto is obviously the main character so I'm sure he's the most likely to be shrunk as for the girls we could see him with the show has Sakura, Hinata, Ino, Tenten, Lady Tsunade, Hanabi, Temari, Moegi, Kurenai, (Breathe, breathe)....Karin, Konan, and Shizune. So plenty of girls to work with and that's still not all of them(the main ones at least) so I'm hoping to get some great additions in this story line. Towards that goal I'll start off with four ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Sakura is finally ready to complete her training with Lady Tsunade, but for the last stage of her training she must be shrunk in order to push her body to the limit so that she can learn all of Lady Tsunade's techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. After his battle with Pain to save the Hidden Leaf Village, Naruto continues training himself to perfect his Sage Mode Jutsu. However an unforeseen complication causes him to shrink as he absorbs the energy of nearby bugs. Moegi soon finds him hoping to get an interview from the Village's hero for her newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Shikamaru decides to blow off his training with Ino for the day so that he can take a relaxing power nap underneath a tree instead. Unfortunately while he's asleep he ends up shrinking down to an inch tall, even worse Ino soon passes by looking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Lady Tsunade develops a plan to keep Naruto save from the Akatsuki, by shrinking him down to an inch tall so they can easily hide him until the group is defeated. Entrusting his safety to Sakura as a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so I still haven't used a few people yet, for the purpose I included a 5th option labels 'More Choices' which you guessed it will lead to more story ideas. Please feel free to add your own or send it to me directly. Thank you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been three days since Naruto's fateful battle with the Akatsuki member known as Pain, and Naruto, as the hero who saved the village from total annihilation had become something of a celebrity. People from all over wanted to thank him or show their appreciation, from verbally thanking him too buying him Ramen at the temporary establishment of Ichiraku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, Naruto had to change the location of his training twice due to constant interruptions. He only told Konohamaru where he was going, so he could reach out if something of importance happened. Naruto then headed out to the mountain range behind the Hidden Leaf Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, he found a large tree stump with a smooth surface, as if it had been chopped down in one swing, making it an ideal spot for him to meditate and train his mind. His power is Sage Mode was substantial, but only allowed him to produce two Rasen-Shuriken. Since he wouldn't always have the time to prepare for battle as he did against Pain, Naruto decided to find a way to make that power last longer through training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started by clearing his mind of all thoughts(which wasn't too difficult) and just listened to the sound of the leaves rustling in the wind, the sounds of birds flapping their wings in the air. It was so quiet that he could even hear the rustling in the grass as bugs brushed them aside. Naruto made himself one with Nature, creating a vessel within himself for the energy to travel through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Naruto didn't realize was that there were different types of Nature Energy in the world, each with different effects. Naruto had only used the Frog variant during his training at Mount My\u014dboku and once since at a local waterfall outside the Hidden Leaf Village. Both times there were frogs and Toads present to draw power from, among other sources such as trees and rivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this time, the only living creatures that Naruto had to draw power from were insects, meaning he'd take on their properties instead, ignorant of this detail as his body began to shrink to match their size. It made even worse as he tried to accumulate as much Nature Energy as possible, not only shrinking himself smaller but faster as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed, and Naruto was still unaware that he'd been shrunk to only an inch tall on top of the stump. However, that was quickly about to change as someone else from the village approached the opening. The vibrations of her footsteps shaking the ground, getting Naruto's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, could have sworn Konahamaru said Big Bro Naruto would be right here.\" Boomed the voice of Moegi, leaving Naruto stunned after half an hour of absolute silence. Why was she yelling? She couldn't have been more than five feet away by the sound of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his eyes, still looking down and holding his head to compensate for his headache. Losing focus as he turned his head to the right, shocked by the scale of his surroundings. He was seeing the world through the eyes of a bug for the first time, and it was honestly more than a little intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/71/a9/af71a98db0346c1e8df9b649e142294c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/71/a9/...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what is this?\" Moegi boomed again, suddenly bringing Naruto's attention back to her. She was massive compared to him, her confused face hovering in the sky above him, in the same way, the Hokage's stone faces hovered above the village. She was holding a notepad in her hand, likely looking for a story for the village newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's spit pooled in the back of his mouth before being nervously swallowed as Moegi squinted to see his tiny body. \"Is that...Big Bro Naruto?\" Moegi asked, shocked by the fact that he was so puny compared to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second. That makes perfect sense. Of course, you shrunk yourself. That way, your training has a strong impact, defending yourself from giant animals would prove more difficult than training by yourself.\" Moegi explained it to herself a matter of factly, unable to believe that Naruto was dumb enough to shrink himself accidentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait, you're trying to get stronger. I know, you obviously wanted to keep this a secret, but since I know now, I can be your training partner. Don't worry, I know how to keep a secret.\" Moegi said, perking up, not letting Naruto get a word in edgewise as she did all the talking.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLike everyone else in the village, she wanted to help repay Naruto somehow for saving them from Pain, and while she was no good to him as a training partner at his normal size, she was sure that she could help him while he was so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Moegi have in mind for a warm-up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.Moegi notes that the stump Naruto's standing on is a perfect sitting height for her, turning around to give Naruto a good look at her panty-clad butt under her skirt. She gives Naruto little time to prepare, giving him a brief explanation that his training is to attempt holding her over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.Moegi picks Naruto up and sits on the stump in his place, taking a moment to think of a way she can help him train. Eventually, dropping him on the ground between her knee-high sandals and removing them to show her bare feet. She then squeezes him between her feet, telling him to hold them off without a timer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.Moegi compares herself to one of Pain's giant summonings compared to Naruto, thinking that she would make an excellent practice partner for the one-inch tall ninja. Spicing up their battle with the condition that the winner will become the loser pupal, not believing she will win, but progressively becomes more confident during the fight.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno arrive at Lady Tsunade's office to receive their next mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, Sakura, thank you for coming on such short notice. I'm afraid we may have underestimated the Akatsuki. The members we've fought against so far have been stronger than we originally anticipated. In fact, Shikamura collected data during his fight against the Akatsuki member Hidan that suggests the remaining members are even more powerful.\" Tsunade explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? Bring them on! I'll flatten them with my new jutsu.\" Naruto said, acting as confident in his abilities as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you listening, you were hardly able to defeat one member of the Akatsuki, and that was with Kakashi Sensei's help. There's no way you can be this reckless.\" Sakura said, chiming into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly my point, we can't forget that the Akatsuki is hunting all of the Jinchuriki and that includes you Naruto! We can't afford to have you captured by the enemy, especially when we don't even know what plans they have for the Tailed Beasts. I'm sorry, but you're forbidden to fight them again. It's too risky.\" Tsunade explained, already knowing Naruto probably wouldn't listen to reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if, I haven't been training all these years just to run away now! I'm out of here!\" Naruto yelled, turning to face the door only to find Sakura blocking his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, we have no choice. Do it Sakura.\" Tsunade ordered her apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, do what?\" Naruto asked confused, turning his gaze back between Tsunade and Sakura. Meanwhile, Sakura formed several hand signs in the following order, Boar, Ox, Bird, Snake, and finally a sign he couldn't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninja Art: Shrinking Jutsu!\" Sakura announced, causing a cloud of smoke to appear around Naruto. The blonde ninja panicked, hoping he'd misheard Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the smoke cloud cleared Naruto realized he wasn't so lucky. Instead of seeing his teammate standing before, Naruto now saw five massive toes resting on a large platform. His gaze shifted upwards, following Sakura's tall sandals up the pink-haired kunoichi's legs. Followed by her shorts and skirt, and eventually leading up to Sakura's face. Her green eyes staring down at her now inch tall teammate, who took a strong resemblance to insect standing in front of her sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now bring Naruto here, and I'll explain your mission.\" Tsunade announced, taking Naruto's attention off Sakura for a moment. Having said that, when Naruto turned his attention back to Sakura he was surprised to see his field of vision dominated by her gloved fingers. They surround him, inching his body between her thumb and index fingers before whisking him off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura brought him up to about chest level before walking towards Lady Tsunade's desk, forcing Naruto attention to be focused on her now gigantic breasts. She was only about a larger A to lower B cup at normal size, but shrinking Naruto had made them over 50 times larger. From his current distance, he could see every little movement they made. Swaying slightly from side to side and bouncing with each step forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough she reached Tsunade's desk, dropping Naruto on the surface. However, without calculating the length of the fall from Naruto's perspective, Sakura released him from a higher height than she anticipated. Naruto acted quickly on this, landing in such a way that caused him to roll forward upon landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw next was surprising, Tsunade's breasts resting on her desk. The massive mammaries undoubtedly dwarfing Sakura's breasts by leaps and bounds. If the younger girl's breasts were the size of hills, then the Hokage's bosom could easily be compared with mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, Now for the details of your mission. Sakura, you are to keep Naruto safe and hidden from the Akatsuki. You have full permission from me too use whatever means necessary and involve anyone else you see fit.\" Tsunade announced, looking down at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an A-Rank mission. We can't allow the Nine-Tails to fall into enemy hands. Sakura will be acting as your guardian, and you will remain hidden in public places at all times.\" Tsunade continued, motion to Sakura to take Naruto away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes milady, I understand.\" Sakura said, accepting her mission and reaching down to pick up Naruto. He threw his hand up in a feeble attempt to protect himself, Sakura's strong finger's easily breaking his stance and trapping him between her thumb and index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, put me down! Sa-Ku-Ra! Put me down!\" Naruto yelled, trying to break himself free of Sakura's fingers. During which the cherry blossom ninja brought naruto under her green eyes gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Naruto, Lady Tsunade's right. We can't allow you to be captured. The Akatsuki already have 4 tailed beasts, and another has been reported missing. Trust me this is for the best.\" Sakura said gently, trying to calm Naruto down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing, originally I'd planned to have a special necklace made to contain Naruto. One with a seal placed on it to contain the Nine-Tailed Fox's Chakra. Unfortunately, the Anbu Black Ops unit hasn't been able to figure it out yet, so you'll just have to get by carrying him inside your clothing for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Naruto both turned to Tsunade blushing. \"Wait, what?\" they asked, both for different reasons. That when Naruto started to think this arrangement wasn't going to be so bad after all. He'd wanted to get close to Sakura for years now, and now Lady Tsunade had given him an opportunity to see her private areas up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me Sakura, keep him in something your wearing. Put him somewhere before you leave so nobody outside this building sees him like this.\" Tsunade said firmly, not wanting to be questioned by her apprentice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, forgive me.\" Sakura said, preparing to put Naruto___________.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Down her sandal- Sakura unzips her knee tall sandals and drops Naruto down the shaft of her boot like footwear and infusing the insole with Charka to stick Naruto back to the surface so he doesn't slide out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Between her butt-cheeks- Sakura decides Naruto will be least annoying if she drops him down the back of her panties, wedging him between her buttcheeks as a way to keep him secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Inside of her cleavage- Sakura grudgingly accepts to put Naruto between her breasts, pushing him into the depths of her cleavage before leaving Tsunade's office. However, the intense heat of the village quickly causes Sakura to sweat, making Naruto regret his desire to be close to Sakura's boobs.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure this will be a storyline everyone can come to enjoy honestly, I don't know how much DB Super content is out there. I have seen quite a bit of fanart but unfortunately not as much writing and fanfictions so hopefully this will change all of that. Since most of the show does take place around the Tournament of Power I'd like to see storylines happen during and after the fighting. I'll put out four ideas to start and hopefully more come to increase the number of options in 'More Choices'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. During his fight against Kefla in the Tournament of Power Goku's Ultra Instinct backfires, causing him to shrink down to an inch tall before the fused female Saiyan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Bulma tells Vegeta and Goku that they're not leaving Earth again to go train on Lord Beerus's world, using her microband to shrink the two saiyan warriors to a manageable size of one centimeter tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Caulifa calls in a favor with Vados and asks that she bring Goku to their Universe to help her train, Vados would then teleport Goku to the palm of her hand at an inch tall. Caulifa would be bummed that he's so small at first but decide to make the best of it and train with him anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. We find Goku and Krillin hanging out inside of Krillin's house, the two would shrink mysteriously and end up on the couch. Goku would suggest that they were the perfect size not to cause any damage to Krillin's stuff and attempt to start a fight. After hitting him off the couch Krillin pulls Goku down with him into Android 18's sneakers only to realize they can't fly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Awe, pretty please Bulma. We have to start training again so we can get stronger.\" Goku whined, after being told by Bulma that he and Vegeta were not allowed to go back to Lord Beerus's world for training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the last time you left Earth. Frezia attacked, and we almost died.\" Bulma stated, making her case that they should continue their training on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, we can always have Kararot teleport us back here.\" Vegeta said, rationalizing why they should be allowed to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but last time it took all of Gohan's energy just to reach you.\" Bulma countered, waving her fist at the two Saiyans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, call Whis to Earth. We'll be leaving tomorrow. \" Vegeta replied, leaving with Goku to go spare in preparation to continue their training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with those two? I mean, aren't they strong enough? If only I had a way to make them listen to me.\" Bulma said to herself,  forming an idea in the back of her mind. There was an invention she could use that would make Goku and Vegeta listen to her. One she built many years ago when she was only 16. Of course, she'd have to make a few adjustments first before it was ready to be used on Goku and Vegeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I make the necessary modifications, then that could work.\" Bulma told herself, though she couldn't even remember the last time she used it or where it was. The blue haired woman then proceeded towards her lab, preparing for a full night of technological experimentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---The Next Day---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku and Vegeta were waiting impatiently for Bulma and Whis to arrive, standing out on the Capsule Corp Building's lawn. Goku was excited for any excuse to get back to his training so he could make himself stronger, while Vegeta was determined not to allow his longtime rival to advance ahead of him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bulma was hiding around the curved corner of the Capsule Corp sphere building. She looked at her wrist, adjusting the setting on her new and improved version of the microband. Once,  when she first set off on her journey to find the seven Dragonballs nearly 30 years ago, Bulma used this device to shrink herself down to 5 inches tall. However, thanks to some improvements she's made not only can Bulma use the watch to shrink others, but she can also control the size to make them much smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't run any human or Saiyan tests for that matter, just shrinking boxes and machinery in her lab. Luckily, she had two test subjects close by that she could experiment on. Bulma peeked around the corner, adjusting the device for distance and the size she wanted Goku and Vegeta to become. Just under half an inch tall should be about the right size for her to control them, they were still powerful fighters and could prove troublesome at a larger measurement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma double checked her wrists and clicked the button that would bring Goku and Vegeta down to size, literally. Within moments Bulma found herself watching in awe as the two alien warriors shrunk before her very eyes. Losing half their height each in the blink of an eye, now they were not taller than Trunks or Goten. But their shrinking didn't stop there, not by a long shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vegeta, what's going on?\" Goku asked as the world around them grow several times over in size, their surroundings becoming gigantic in comparison to their shrinking bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakarot, what have you done?\" Vegeta asked, just as confused as Goku for once. Blaming his longtime rival for this turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of Saiyans continued shrinking in size until they heads were well below the grass line of the Capsule Corporation's front lawn. Now they were as tiny as ants compared to someone like Bulma, slinking around the corner as the two finished shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny Saiyans began too feel strong vibrations, moving through the earth beneath their feet. Each one more powerful than the last, something or someone was coming. \"Kakarot, do you feel that?\" Vegeta asked, taking a fighting stance with Goku back to back. \"Yeah, feels like footsteps.\" Goku answered, their warrior instincts taking over and assuming they'd been shrunk by a new enemy. However, nothing could prepare them for what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boom, BOom, BOOm, BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrations continued to get even stronger, just how massive was this opponent they were supposed to do battle with? A large shadow presents itself over their bodies, casting itself over them a mile long. The two were awestruck, unable to move a muscle as they looked up to see an 850-foot tall Bulma towering overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey boys, I hope your ready for some special training.\" Bulma teased, feeling as if she were talking down to bugs now that she'd made them so tiny. The same was true for them, though they didn't exactly see Bulma as a bug, more like a goddess 3 times taller than Shenron himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulma! What is the meaning of this?\" Vegeta asked, pulling himself together after coming to terms with the new size difference between him and his wife. Meanwhile Goku just stood there saying nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma bent down to get a closer look at Goku and Vegeta, almost losing them in the grass at her full height. \"Well, I couldn't let you two leave to go to Lord Beerus's world, and since you wouldn't listen to reason I decided to take matter's into my own hands.\" Bulma said confidently, reaching down to scoop Goku and Vegeta up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma's hand hit the ground dragging along the dirt, nearly knocking the tiny pair off their feet as she picked them up in the palm of her hand. She lifted them up to about chest level, keeping them just under her now massive breasts, each about equal in size to the Capsule Corp building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so we're not gonna be able to train?\" Goku asked, not seeming to bother by the fact that Bulma shrunk them and having one track mind towards getting stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can still train, that's why I shrunk you. You'll just have to get used to training under me instead of Whis.\" Bulma teased, winking at the micro Saiyans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what do you know about fighting?\" Vegeta asks, skeptical about being trained by someone who's never been in an actual fight herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots actually, I've been watching Goku for almost thirty years. I can think of more than a few ways to train you that are almost guaranteed to make you stronger.\" Bulma says back. Vegeta however, wasn't buying it, him and Goku both have reached Super Saiyan Blu and attained the power of the gods. What could a human woman like Bulma possibly teach them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of training does Bulma have in store for them first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Bulma suggests that she put Vegeta's worries to rest with a sparring match, confident that she'll come out as the winner she offers a scenario where the one who performs best gets a reward, while the one who performs worst gets punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Bulma takes off her boots and drops one of the shrunken Saiyans in each, telling them that their first task is to endure the rest of the day living under her full weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.Bulma brings Goku and Vegeta inside where she reveals that by shrinking them, she's neutralized their ability to go Super Saiyan. Placing them on a seat(Chair, couch, ect...) She tells them she wants to see if they can hold her over their heads while she sits on top of them. Can they handle it? Probably not.</span></div></div>",

Besides making small talk.\" Vados smiled, preparing to leave Planet Sadala after being treated to local delicacy by the ruffian Saiyan. Already having a pretty good idea about what the young woman was hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you? A mind-reader or something? Well, since you asked I was hoping you could bring that Goku guy here for me so I can learn how to reach Super Saiyan 3.\" Caulifla answers, intending to get stronger a quickly as possible through training with the Universe 7 Saiyan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A simple task.\" Vados stated confidently, holding one hand out flat between her and Caulifla, before pulling her staff out of thin air with the other. The angel quickly spun the staff around, causing the black orb at it's end to shine brightly, turning it's light on the center of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light then moved into her cupped hand, taking a humanoid form and transforming into Goku within seconds right in front of Caulifla. Only problem was that he was only an inch tall, disappointing Caulifla greatly, wondering what she could learn from the bug sized Saiyan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on her?\" Goku asked dumbfounded, looking up at the angel who had summoned him, she kinda looked like Whis and was wearing similar clothes. Vados smiled, nodding with closed eyes to acknowledge Goku's presence in the palm of her hand, before Goku noticed a lingering shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sensed an odd presence, along with a powerful godly aura emanating from directly behind him. Quickly turning around to see Caulifla's face blown up to immense proportion, brought within mere centimeters of Goku's tiny frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah!\" Goku yelled in shock, falling onto his butt at the very sight of the rebellious Saiyan woman, enacting a joyous giggle from Vados as she watched the scene unfold. \"Oh, hello there. You're that Saiyan from universe 6, right? Cauliflower?\" Goku asked, having forgotten her in only a few short weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Caulifla!\" she yelled, outraged by the fact that she hadn't made a more lasting impression on someone who she'd thrashed so thoroughly, at least while she was merged with Kale as Kefla before his Ultra Instinct saved him. Her defiant scream forcing Goku to cover his ears, the sound echoing in his eardrums even after she'd already closed her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, alright lady.\" Goku apologized, pulling down his hands in the hopes of getting an answer as to what exactly was going on here. However, when he looked back to where Cauilifa's face was, all he saw was her bare midriff as she had returned to her full height and had begun a new conversation with Vados.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me Vados, is this a joke or something?\" Caulifla asked, not finding it very funny if it was. Completely ignoring Goku as she shoved her fists down in anger, stomping her foot into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, instant transportation between universe's requires some compartmentalization, in Goku's case that means shrinking down to the size he is now. All the same he should still assist you greatly in the task at hand, With his Super Saiyan Blue form and Ultra Instinct techniques, he's too powerful an opponent for you to overcome. This new size should afford you the chance to tip the scales in your favor.\" Vados explained, leading Caulifla to believe that she'd been underestimated. At her size, she could stomp Goku into the dirt with little to no effort on her part whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, but does he have to be so pint-sized?\" Caulifla asked, wondering what she had to gain from all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could send him back if this form displeases you. However, it could be weeks before we can arrange for him to come back at proper size.\" Vados clarified, creating a strobing ball of light around Goku, preparing to send him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance, now hand him over!\" Caulifla objected, holding out her hands together in front of Vados to accept Goku. Willing to take any help she could get in reaching the next level of her training, if nothing else Goku would serve as a well of information for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVados smiled as her ploy reached the exact conclusion she'd expected, the shell encasing Goku vanishing into thin air before tilting her hand sideways, allowing Goku to fall into the female Saiyan's embrace. He tried to fly up, but found himself unable to stop his decent before being caught by Caulifla's waiting hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you take good care of him, I'll be back at the end of your training to send him home.\" Vados announced, taping her staff twice and taking off in a ray of light off world, leaving Caulifla to her own devices. Now in charge of Goku, Caulifla mused over several different ways she could integrate the bug-sized Saiyan into her training schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first path involved finding out how strong Goku actually was at his new size, forcing him into a sparring match where he has to go all out against her, seeing just how well he could hold his own. Another path involved Goku undergoing some special training of his own to toughen up in preparation to help her, testing his resilience and durability along the way to see if what Vados said was true. Finally, she considered bringing Kale into the mix, so they could both reach Super Saiyan 3 together through training with Goku. Will their combined might prove too much for Goku to endure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Not entirely convinced that Goku is up to the job of training her, Caulifla challenges Goku to a duel, with the winner becoming the other's master. Making him promise not to hold back against her. But will she be the one to underestimate him solely due to his small size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Caulifla says there is no time to waste, acclimating Goku to his new size by forcing him into her shoe, turning him into her personal insole for the duration of a full length training session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Caulifla flies over to where Kale is to shows the tiny Goku to her best friend and honorary sister. Explaining to the nervous woman her plans to fight Goku in a two on one battle, but could Goku still get the best of them with Super Saiyan Blue and the Kaioken?</span></div></div>",

While reading a request from the board inside the Fairy Tail guild hall Natsu is shrunk, caused by a spell similar to the body swapping spell that caused him to trade bodies with Loke. Soon after he is found at an inch tall by his new teammate and the newest member of Fairy Tail Lucy Heartfilla.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Lucy shrinks during the Grand Magic Games just before her battle with the fire mage from Raven Tail Flare Corona. Unfortunately for Lucy she shrunk after agreeing to the match and is unable to back out. How long will she last against an opponent forty or more times her size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. While agreeing to help Wendy in a training match Natsu gets too fired up and scares Wendy into using one of her Sky Dragon Slayer Secret Arts, pulling his attack into a vortex and shrinking it so it doesn\u2019t harm her, unfortunately Natsu gets caught up in her defense and ends up shrinking as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Ezra decides to shrink Grey in order to scare him out of his obsessive desire to strip while using his Ice Maker Magic. The only question you have too answer is how far she will go in order to achieve her goal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there are plenty of girls in Fairy Tail not listed above and I\u2019m sure we all wanna see them in this story.

After taking on the Dark Guild Eisenwald and stealing an S Class Quest from the second floor Natsu felt as if he could handle anything so his only goal was to take the request off the board with the highest reward. His attention was first drawn to one posted right on top of all the others, the reward listed at the top in bold lettering was <b>Five Million Jewel</b>. With a reward that high he must have been expected to fight off a seriously tough monster like a Wyvern or as much as a hundred Vulcans, either way he was excited to put his skills to the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Natsu this didn't seem to be a physical task, according to this piece of paper they were looking for someone to translate the ancient text depicted on the surface. Normally this wasn't Natsu's strong suit but the language on this paper was the same kind as Igneel had taught Natsu growing up. Maybe if he finished this request and claimed the reward he could ask for information that might lead him to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oggo daru Kir zanna rinko kner\" Natsu read aloud, all but forgetting their instance with the Changeling spell that cause him and Loke to swap bodies. Suddenly the page began to glow brightly, exuding a blinding blue light forcing Natsu to shield his eyes as he dropped the paper. He could hear it being blown around by the wind until it hit the ground, a familiar feeling soon overtook Natsu's body. Was it that Changeling spell again? If so what would happen? There was nobody around for him to swap bodies with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded and Natsu was able to open his eyes again he found himself faced with a big surprise, literally. The entire Guild Hall was absolutely gigantic, big enough to cover the entire town of Magnolia under its roof. Natsu had been shrunk down to only an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the? How the hell did this happen to me?\" Natsu asked himself, having little time to answer the questions he had before the front door of the guild opened for the next member of Fairy Tail to arrive that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/powerrangersfanon/images/1/1a/IbtPzvoXTzE2Ru.png/revision/latest?cb=20141102073052\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/powe...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the guild Natsu realised that it was Lucy Heartfilia his teammate that he'd come here to pick a job for that had entered the building, she must have been here too meet up with him. Only problem was that he was the size of a bug compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering blonde's knee tall heeled boots send powerful vibrations through the guild's floorboards, felt by Natsu even at a distance. She continued walking in the direction of the request board, not seeing Dragon Slayer fang or pink hair of Natsu anywhere. Did he forget about their plan to meet up and grab the first request? She picked the last one so it was Natsu's turn to pick a job request. Of course knowing Natsu he'd probably just pick the job that would allow him to cause the maximum amount of destruction possible to some poor town plagued by monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy laughed at her thoughts before noticing a piece of paper on the floor, she placed her feet on either end of the page before reaching down to pick it up. Natsu saw this as his best chance to gain his new teammate\u2019s attention before it was too late. The pick haired mage ran towards the piece of paper before him, yelling up at the blonde Celestial Wizard towering overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lucy it\u2019s me. Down here!\u201d he called at the top of his lung, although Lucy didn\u2019t seem to hear him as she lifted it off the ground. She brought it to level with her ample bosom, reading it and mouthing the words to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t read that Lucy, you\u2019ll end up small like me.\u201d Natsu warned, his words not even coming close to reaching Lucy\u2019s eardrums from the floor. However strangely enough nothing happened, Lucy remained a giant through the eyes of the shrunken Dragon Slayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird, this must be the shrinking spell I\u2019ve heard so much about. According to Sorcerers Weekly more than half the members of Blue Pegasus were shrunk when a member accidentally cast the spell. But what\u2019s it doing on the floor, I mean who would be stupid enough to fall\u2026for\u2026this.\u201d Lucy paused, spacing out her words as she developed an idea in the back of her mind, she only hoped she was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as Lucy looked down she saw exactly as imagined, a pink haired bug standing before her tall boots. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me! Natsu?\u201d Lucy scolded, realizing Natsu had accidentally shrunk himself. Not that she was surprised by this turn of events in the slightest. Only Natsu could be that stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Lucy, um do you think I could get a hand down here?\u201d Natsu said, believing himself to be saved. Instead Lucy decided to go another route, lifting her foot off the ground and bring it over Natsu, casting a large shadow over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy wait, what are you..?\u201d Was all Natsu could ask before Lucy decided to bring her foot down hard into the floorboards below, the tiny Dragon Slayer narrowly avoiding her powerful stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy, what the hell was that? There\u2019s people walking down here you know!\u201d Natsu yelled, looking up to see an angry Lucy staring back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it serves you right, that spell is dangerous. I mean we\u2019re lucky it was just you, everyone in the guild could have been shrunk.\u201d Lucy announced, placing her hands on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Erza won\u2019t be too happy to hear about this, even I\u2019m a little scared to think of what she might do to you at that size.\u201d Lucy said, much to Natsu\u2019s dismay. Natsu began to sweat, a normal sized Erza was already as scary as a mountain sized monster so he could only imagine how terrifying a gigantic Erza would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Lucy, I\u2019m begging you here. Anything but that, I\u2019d never survive Erza\u2019s wrath.\u201d Natsu requested of Lucy, hoping to appeal to her nice side. That is if she had one. \u201cCan\u2019t you just bring me to Levy, she can reverse this right? We don\u2019t have to tell Erza about any of this.\u201d Natsu said, hoping to take the easy way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a chance, she already wasted enough time helping use reverse that Changeling spell mess. Which you caused might I add.\u201d Lucy said, wanting Natsu to spend some time at this size before she even thought about returning him to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t bring you to Erza but you still deserve to be punished, otherwise I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll never learn your lesson.\u201d Lucy announced, and with nobody around to assign Natsu\u2019s punishment besides her it was clear that Lucy would be deciding his penalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she have in mind for the shrunken Dragon Slayer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Lucy decides that Natsu's punishment should be carried out inside of a jail cell, however since he's too small for any conventional prison Lucy decides to stuff him in between her toes for the foreseeable future. Sure that he'll learn his lesson sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Lucy decides to use Natsu's motion sickness against him, driving him into the center of her cleavage and going for a long walk around the town of Magnolia with him entombed inside of her breast flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Lucy decides to drop Natsu down the back of her panties during her walk home, telling him his punishment will begin once they get to her apartment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We find Natsu and Wendy in the mountain ranges on the outskirts of the town of Magnolia where the Fairy Tail Guild Hall and it's member's reside. After recent battles in the Grand Magic Games Wendy decided that she needed to get stronger as a member of Fiore's number one guild, turning to her fellow Dragon Slayer Natsu Dragneel for guidance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up to the pink haired mage for his mastery of the Dragon Slayer arts, particularly his combat abilities which were so strong he'd managed to beat two other Dragon Slayers at the same time. Naturally, this would be the primary focus of her training with Natsu as the two set off without their Exceed partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy, I hope you're ready for some serious combat training!\" Natsu said excitedly, getting pumped up to raise Wendy's skill level and asses her current powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-Yeah, I'm ready!\" Wendy confirmed, trying to sound as confident as possible as the two Dragon Slayers got into their respective fighting stances. A gust of wind kicked up dust between the two mages, each wondering who would be the first to declare an attack. Of course, it didn't take a genius to figure out that Natsu would make the first move. He leaped into the air, using the sun as a backdrop to disguise his first attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire Dragon Iron Fist!\" Natsu declared, coating his fist in flames and thrusting his fist towards Wendy. The young Sky Maiden, not confident in her ability to directly block Natsu's attack took a different approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, swift winds that run the heavens. Vernier!\" Wendy chanted, casting an enchantment on herself that would increase her overall speed. Shortly after taking evasive actions to dodge Natsu's strike, his flaming fist meeting with the dirt as Wendy maneuvered around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she focused on a counter-attack \"I call upon thee, the starward fight to claim the heavens. Arms!\" Wendy chanted, adding a strength enhancement on top of her boosted speed to increase the power of her attacks. \"Sky Dragon Roar!\" She yelled, attacking from Natsu's right side with a massive gust of wind shot from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire Dragon Roar!\" Natsu yelled, responding to Wendy's counterstrike with his variation of her breath attack. Fire and wind met between the two Dragon Slayers, their magic power duking it out before Natsu's flames overpowered Wendy's magic. Even with her enchantments, there was a clear difference in their abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy moved to dodge, landing off balance and creating an opening for Natsu to attack. He dashed towards the young girl, coating his entire body in flames.  Natsu then raised his hands over his head, gathering the fire into a single point. \"Fire Dragon Brilliant Flame!\" Natsu yelled as he tossed a giant fireball in Wendy's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy froze for a brief moment, thinking she couldn't possibly deflect or repel Natsu's attack. That's when she remembered a third Dragon Slayer Secret Art that Grandeeney had left her along with the Sky Drill and Milky Way. However, she'd never before pulled off the move in her training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy stood up tall, gathering her magic power she planted her feet firmly at her sides. \"Sky Dragon Secret Arts, Act of Compression!\" Wendy yelled, creating a massive vortex that swallowed Natsu's magic in seconds. Unfortunately, the giant twister expanded so much that Natsu himself got sucked into the vortex she created. He tried to stand his ground but with nothing to hold onto he was helpless before Wendy's sudden power up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Natsu's magic trapped and no knowledge of her friend's predicament, Wendy began controlling the vortex with her hands. Making it smaller and smaller she suffocated Natsu's flame attack, shrinking it down to an ember in moments before it completely disappeared within Wendy's tornado of magic power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter successfully defending herself Wendy released the spell and the vortex unraveled into thin air. She was so proud of herself, pulling off an advanced technique she didn't even believe possible. She turned to Natsu, looking to thank him for drawing this power out of her. But he was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu, where did you go?\" Wendy asked, stepping out into the clearing to look for him. Meanwhile, Natsu sat up rubbing his head after getting caught in Wendy's spell. That's when he noticed strange vibrations traveling through the ground, almost like miniature earthquakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the contrary, they were footsteps. Most likely originating from some giant magical creature like a Wyvern or giant Vulcan. Natsu turned to towards the source of the vibrations, shocked when he saw a giant human's foot land at his side. He instantly recognized the footwear and thought it was impossible, looking up to see a massive Wendy Marvell towering over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy, down here! Wendy!\" Natsu yelled, repeating the young girl's name as she looked at her surroundings. She seemed to be confused, reacting to his call for her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu! Wait, where are you?\" She asked, her ears picking up on his voice enhanced by her Dragon Slayer magic. Finally, she looked down, turning her attention on what appeared to be a bug between her sandal-clad feet. \"Is that you Natsu?\" Wendy asked, shocked by how tiny he'd become. He was barely an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Wendy, how'd you get so big?\" Natsu asked, surprised by the young girl's size. Easily dwarfing him at over fifty times his size. Her black thigh high socks alone reached heights taller than the Fairy Tail Guild Hall, leading up to her cotton white panties hidden from the rest of the world under her skirt. Wendy still not realizing that she'd left herself exposed to the bug-sized Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I'm not taller Natsu. You've shrunk.\" Wendy clarified, forcing Natsu to observe his surroundings to see that she was right. It wasn't just Wendy, but everything surrounding him was gigantic, absolutely enormous. \"Really, but how did this happen?\" Natsu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, it must have been my magic. The spell I used concentrates high force winds to compress magic power and makes it smaller. You must have gotten swept up and shrunk with your attack.\" Wendy explained sadly, her voice full of regret. Still not understanding how a spell that shrinks magic power could also make a person smaller. Forgetting that on Earthland all living things contain magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Wendy. I'm sure somebody can fix this. But first, do you think you can give me a lift back to the guild.\" Natsu asked, not wanting to walk all the way back to Magnolia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy cheered up, Natsu was right she thought. Fairy Tail was home to all kinds of powerful mages, surely someone from the guild could reverse what she'd done to him. There was just one small problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu, if you don't mind could we keep this between as few people as possible? I still want to get stronger, but I'm worried that people won't want to train with me if they think I'll accidentally shrink them everytime they spare against me .\" Wendy responded, not that it would scare off too many members in Fairy Tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure thing Wendy. Do what you have to, I'd rather not have Erza see me like this anyways.\" Natsu shivered, the thought of a three hundred foot tall Erza terrifying him. She was already as scary as any monster at her current height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy giggled nervously, agreeing with Natsu's sentiment. She wouldn't want to end up on the wrong side of a gigantic Erza either. Wendy reached down and picked Natsu up between her fingers, before dropping him into her palm, lifting him to chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Wow, I can't believe how tiny he is. It almost feels like I'm holding an insect, I better be careful with him.~ Wendy thought to herself as she looked down at Natsu. Then she realized that she didn't exactly have a plan to hide him from her guildmates or the people of Magnolia for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Natsu, if we're gonna keep you shrinking a secret then I'll have to hide you somewhere. I don't have any pockets n this outfit so I can't guarantee what I have in mind will be very pleasant.\" Wendy announced nervously, but Natsu was unphased by her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine Wendy! Just take me out as soon as you can.\" Natsu announced, willingly subjecting himself to being kept wherever the young Sky Maiden choose. Likely somewhere she could feel him constantly moving, so he doesn't accidentally slip out. She didn't want to risk losing him, preparing to deposit him inside her ________ so he can't fall out by mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Bra, Wendy takes advantage of her small boobs. Not taking into full account how massive the orbs the flesh might appear to someone of Natsu's current stature. She then walks back towards Magnolia, thinking about what it would be like to have bigger boobs, deciding to take Natsu back to Lucy's Apartment for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Thigh Highs, Wendy slips Natsu down one of her tight high socks, trapping him inside the fabric while she searches the town of Magnolia for Levy at her usual hangouts such as the library and the park. Hoping her knowledge gather from books can help wendy reverse the effects of the shrinking. Meanwhile, Natsu sinks deeper and deeper down her thigh highs until he falls under Wendy's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Panties(back), while it's not her first choice, Wendy admits that it would be easiest to keep Natsu close to her skin, with a lack of better options she drops him down the back of her underwear to feel him against her soft buttcheeks. Meanwhile, she makes the decision to try using her healing magic on Natsu once her magic power recovers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy looked over her body, unable to find a place where she could put her tiny friend. She was wearing a red shirt and a mini skirt. The same dress she had at the time of the events in Edolas world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, a strong wind rushed by her, nearly blowing Natsu away as it left. Wendy, acting quickly was barely capable of catching Natsu and completely covered his tiny body in her palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy knew she couldn't make it too Magnolia like this, she had to think about how she could hide Natsu, not only from the other members of the guild but also from the forces of nature. The little girl looked at her body again. Her legs were dressed in dark blue knee socks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe ... I'm sorry Natsu-san, I don't think that you will like my idea...\u201d Wendy laughed nervously when she came up with a strange plan to keep Natsu safe and secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her two fingers of left hand, she pulled back the edge of her knee socks at the thigh-high level, thereby making a small gap between her skin and the fabric of the sock. However, this little gap looked more like a black hole to nowhere for tiny Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry to hold out and not fall down to my foot, because I will not be able to pull you out until we return to the guild.\u201d Explained Wendy, slowly pushing Natsu into her knee socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He looks so insignificant compared to me. Natsu...who always was like a big brother to me, now nothing more than insect compare to me..who knows...maybe with this power I can become the strongest wizard in Fairy Tail...' Wendy mused, keeping her thoughts private as she put Natsu in her tall sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy, I don't think this is a good idea!\u201d Natsu tried to protest, clinging to the edge of a knee sock with both hands. But his strength was minimal compared to Wendy's now, he has no power here. His fate was completely dependent on the young Dragon Slayer\u2019s will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Natsu! But I don\u2019t have any other choice! \u201dWendy said, and without waiting for another response from Natsu release the edge of her sock. Because of the frivolity of the child, Wendy didn\u2019t think that she had stretched the edge of her sock strongly enough, from which realizing it at one moment would be like a shot from a bow. Like an arrow tiny Natsu immediately flew towards Wendy's thigh and crashed into her skin, beginning to quickly fall down her stocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy!\" Natsu screamed but Wendy didn't hear him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu had time to grab the fabric of the sock during the fall. He could hardly determine his location. Inside the sock was dark and Natsu could hardly see the outside world through the fabric of Wendy\u2019s sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm....at knee level...I should....climb,\" said Natsu as he decided to climb as high as possible as too not to fall into the place where there was the terrible smell of foot sweat. At such a ridiculous size, the fabric of the sock looked completely different. Natsu saw every thread that makes this sock. These threads were a nice ledge for which Natsu could cling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Wendy stretched a bit after the fight with Natsu. <br>\r\n\"Alright! I should find a way to help Natsu now!\" said Sky Dragon Slayer and made her first step with a tiny passenger inside her knee socks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy took a step. The just single step of little girl shook the whole foundation of Natsu's world and he fell again. This time he fell on Wendy\u2019s foot. But the tiny dragon slayer had no chance to stabilize his position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one of Wendy's steps was accompanied by a loud rumble and a strong earthquake. Natsu slowly sliding down over Wendy's ankle until he found himself under her sole. Realizing the hopelessness of his position, he waited until Wendy took another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the force from her step Natsu quickly crawled to the only safe place he could find, under the arch of her sole. Now all that remained was for one of the most powerful wizards in Fairy Tail was to wait until this little girl removed her sweaty socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Wendy passes Lucy's apartment on the way to the guild, deciding to stop in to see if the celestial mage could be of any help returning Natsu to normal size. But how will Wendy react when Lucy decides to take advantage of Natsu's new size. Forcing him to serve them for always being such a pain in her butt, breaking into her apartment, and so on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Wendy makes it to the guild hall with no problems posed to her whatsoever. She finds Levy exactly where expected in the guild's Library downstairs and asks for her assistance in bringing Natsu back to his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. On her way to the Guild Hall, Wendy encounters Chelia who she battled during the Grand Magic Games. Afterward, they became friends and Chelia suggests they go on a walk to catch up on what's been going on. Wendy can't think of a good excuse and agrees, thinking Natsu will just have to endure the afternoon under her foot. Assuring herself it can't be that bad as the two girls walk around town.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a very hot day in the kingdom the Fiore in the heights of its summer season, so after 5 minutes of walking, Wendy had already begun to work up a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Natsu had moved far away from the guild for their sparring match. Therefore, it would be about a 15-minute walk back into town before she could reach the guild. Moreover, due to the fact that Wendy was afraid of accidentally crushing Natsu under her foot, she moved slower than normal and more carefully as well. Thereby increasing the length of her journey to the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough not vocal about it, Wendy actually loved to feel Natsu's tiny body under her foot. Every time his body squirmed under her sole it brought Wendy a lot of pleasure. Deep down, she whispered \"Yes ... go on, Natsu! Don't stop!\" ... although she quickly scolded herself for such thoughts because Natsu was her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! He shouldn't move under my foot in order for me to be pleased! It gives me a sign that he is still alive! Yes!\" Wendy thought, justifying her selfless thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, the little dragon slayer enters in the guild with an even smaller dragon slayer still in hiding. As always, there was a lot of people around and it was very noisy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was looking for the smartest woman in the guild - Levy. But of all her close friends, only Erza was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Wendy! Have you already returned from your training duel? Where is Natsu?\" Erza asked after noticing that Wendy came back alone. Wendy was glad she had met Ezra and could ask her for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is right here-owwwww!\" Wendy screams when she felt something bite her foot. It was Natsu, he reminded Wendy that he wouldn't like for Erza to see him at such a small size. He had to bite Wendy's sole because inside her sock was too wet for him to use his magic. Her sweat was actually strong enough to extinguish his flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy?\" Erza asked, looked questioningly at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After our duel, he decided to swim in the river....hehehe\" Quickly spoke Wendy hopping on one foot and holding the other foot that Natsu bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is swimming in the river? here?\" Erza interrupted, finding wendy's behavior a bit strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More importantly, he left a weak little girl alone! He is so irresponsible!\" said Erza shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not a little girl! And I'm not weak! In fact, I defeated Natsu! He is right there! Helpless, under my foot! But I can't tell you this now...' With a little anger mused Wendy. Unable to vocalize her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, Erza-san, do you know where Levy is?\" asked Wendy, able to stand on both her feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always she's reading books in the library. Okay, Wendy, I have to go on a mission! bye!\" Erza said, leaving the guild hall in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy waved her hand to Erza and went downstairs to the library on the second sublevel. On the first table at the entrance, there was a girl with magic glasses for quick reading. On the table, there were many different books, that the girl was going to read or had already read. It was Levy Mcgarden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Wendy,\" Levy said without interrupting her reading session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Levy....sorry I need your help!\" Wendy blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...what is it,\" said Levi cheerfully, putting the book down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy retold everything that happened half an hour ago. Although she was ashamed to say that Natsu was inside her sock, so Wendy kept silent about this fact. After a couple of minutes of silence, Levy finally spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds unusual! Your magic is air but for some reason it allows you to shrink people. By the way, where is Natsu?\" Levy asked, not seeing him in either Wendy's hand or on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...he is....inside my sock...I...I don't have any pockets and I had to hide Natsu somewhere...so...it was the first place that came to my mind\" - Said Wendy slowly and uncertainly, blushing like a tomato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will get him out,\" The little girl said and sat down on the chair. She took off her shoe and then her knee sock. But somehow, Natsu was not there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Natsu-san? Natsu-san! Where are you! Natsu!\" Wendy fell to her knees and looked into her shoe, then turned her sock inside out, but Natsu wasn't there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon slayers began to panic, various terrible thoughts visited her head: 'What if he fell out of my sock! And what if he got lost in the grass! But something bit my foot! But...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy, who remained calm, wanted to go up to her friend and console her, but suddenly noticed something small and pink stuck to Wendy's sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy, what is on your foot?\" asked Levy, pointing to the pink dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" without getting up from her knees, Wendy turned and saw a tiny dot on her sole ... it was Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....told ...you...it was...b...bad idea...!\" Natsu croaked ... he was tired but everything was fine with him, not counting his height of course. Levy and Wendy looked at each other and then started laughing loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! W...What's so funny!\" Natsu was indignant. He was already able to speak normally but still couldn't unstick himself from Wendy\u2019s sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, Sorry...Natsu...we can't do anything about it\" Levy said clutching at the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, the girls stopped laughing. Wendy unsticks Natsu from her sole and put him on top of the table, at which time Levy brought many heavy books and placed them next to Natsu; for him, they looked like tall mountains. Both girls sit at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 and a half centimeters...hmmm,\" Said Levy measuring Natsu's height and writing all data in a notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the notebook Levy gave a speech in a monotonous voice: \"After an hour of research, I have good news and bad news. The good news is that according to the results of the research, I came to the conclusion that Natsu will become normal again.\" Natsu and Wendy smiled broadly \"But...but the bad news is that we can't determine for sure when Natsu will grow back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Natsu spoke first: \"What do you mean we can't!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I explained very clearly. You can become normal tomorrow, maybe in a week, in a month or maybe in a year. Also, I don't know how the process of your growth will occur, whether you will grow gradually or become big instantly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One...year...\" said Natsu falling to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one year is unlikely, most likely you will be so small for a maximum of a month. But it is impossible to say for sure until I see whether your growth changes further or not,\" said Levy adjusting glasses and removing books from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Levy...maybe there is an antidote, another magic?\" asked Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely there is no antidote! It will take a lot of time to explain ... time is the best healer, Wendy! But not other magic in our guild, there is no one who could help Natsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter explanations, Natsu and Wendy were silent for a long time<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's too late! Wendy, bring Natsu to your apartment. Don't worry, I will keep this situation a secret ... oh and yes Wendy, I would like you to help me too, but let's discuss it tomorrow, okay?\" said Levy as she said goodbye to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, they spent the majority of the day in the library. It was already evening, so this time Wendy did not hide Natsu in her socks. There were no people in the guild this late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Wendy faced another problem at home. Namely, where should Natsu sleep?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy quickly decided on a means of concealing Natsu from the world inside her clothing, choosing to keep him in a place where she could continuously feel him moving. That way should wouldn't lose him due to his tiny size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this decision also left her with very few viable options. The least invading of which was to keep Natsu either inside of her shoe or having him hide between her stockings and her thighs. Although Wendy, as a kind-hearted girl, turned both of these options down. Against taking the risk of walking around on top of Natsu, afraid that she might hurt him if he ended up in the wrong spot under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a soft place, on with sufficient padding to keep him safe from harm. Lacking large breasts to reach this goal, Wendy turned to her third and final option. Quickly pulling up the back of her skirt, Wendy stretched out her panties and dropped Natsu inside. Her face flushed bright red as she felt his tiny body's weight tug on her underwear, rolling down the fabric towards her hill-sized cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu, taken back completely by Wendy's surprising actions, screamed the entire way down, only silenced when his body slammed into Wendy's rear cheek, her soft skin absorbing the impact and sticking Natuso to her left cheek like a starfish. Thanks in no small part to the layer of sweat that covered Wendy's body from head to toe after their fight earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry Natsu, I promise I'll get you out of there as soon as I can. But first, I need to think of a plan for returning you to normal.\" Wendy added as Natsu peeled himself away from the sweaty Dragon Slayer's backside. Though his efforts quickly turned out to be in vain as she released her panties, allowing them to hit Natsu from behind and trap him against Wendy's bare flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeeeeeendy!\" Natsu screamed, his voice muffled through Wendy's well-upholstered fanny. His screams for help quickly silenced as Wendy began her walk back to Magnolia, his underwear prison tightening up and loosening with each subsequent step that the young Dragon Slayer took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, did you say something Natsu? I'm sorry, but I can't hear you that well. Please stay quiet until we get back home, you're tickling me.\" Wendy laughed, her embarrassment beginning to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, Wendy was approaching the front gate to the town of Magnolia. She'd also become quite accustomed to feeling Natsu's movements against her soft flesh, almost finding his struggles somewhat enjoyable. Of course, she'd never admit such a thing to Natsu or anyone else for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Nastu, the sweat the had been sticking him to Wendy's ass up to this moment was starting to fade and dissipate, freeing up his body to move more. Of course, this development sounded like a positive turn of events, but at Natsu's size, it was quite the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, Wendy's sweat no long held her panties in place, allowing her butt to chew on them with each step she took heading uphill. Furthermore, Natsu was still too weak to fight against the pull of her cotton undergarments, following them towards Wendy's buttcrack. Her cheeks swallowed more fabric with each step, resulting in a powerful wedgie. And it didn't take long for Wendy to get the wrong idea about what was happening inside of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu, just where do you think you're going?\" Wendy asks under her breath, only able to focus on the fact that Natsu was getting closer to her petite butthole with each step. Was he doing it on purpose? Sure, she'd gotten used to feeling Natsu against her butt and found it somewhat enjoyable. But she found it hard to believe that Natsu would have felt the same way given his current position. Then she remembered a conversation she had with Carla, where the exceed explained how all men were perverted by nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow dare Natsu tries to take advantage of her when she was trying to help him, he was only even back there because Wendy allowed it. His actions tempting the young Sky Maiden to punish him properly, but her gentle nature made it difficult to consider such actions. Maybe she could use her Sky Dragon Healing Magic to try and reverse the effects, would that even work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Wendy considered her options, Natsu continued his struggles, only making it easier for his body to slide along the inner curves of Wendy's buttcheek. And given the fact that Natsu wasn't very far from Wendy's buttcrack, to begin with, this served as the perfect catalyst for his body to end up wedged right between her buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy reacted to this by clenching her butt muscles very tightly, her glutes hitting Natsu harder than one of Gajeels iron-based attacks. She stopped dead in her tracks, what could she do now? The Guildhall was still all the way across town, but Fairy Hills was only around the corner. Her choice was clear, heading to her apartment at the member's only hotel. But what will she do with Natsu one she gets there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Wendy forgives Natsu despite thinking he's a pervert now, taking him out of her buttcrack and placing him on the floor in front of her stocking clad feet, using her magic to try and fix what she did to him. However, her magic caused him to shrink in the first place and only intensifies the effects, making him even smaller. Now he's only 1cm tall, less than half an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Wendy decides that Natsu must be punished before anything else with a taste of his own medicine. Since he climbed into her buttcrack, Wendy chooses to enact this by forcing him up to her butthole and then pushes him inside for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Wendy comes home to find Carla waiting for her, taking Natsu out and placing him between there feet. Explaining everything, including what she believed Natsu was up to. Carla becomes furious and stomps her paw down in front of Natsu, yelling at him and threatening to step on him for Wendy's sake. But when Wendy saves him, Carla insists that Wendy punishes Natsu instead.</span></div></div>",

I'll be sure to visit again real soon!\" Lucy announced to her spirits, as she prepared to exit the celestial world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the war with the Alverez Empire, Lucy had become powerful enough to transport herself between the two worlds with little effort. However, she could not slow down the passage of time. So three weeks had passed in the material world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew one of her Zodiac keys from her belt and used it to draw a portal large enough for her to walk through. Taking one last look over her shoulder, Lucy noted the absence of Aquarius, reminded of her mission to track down the mermaid's Gate key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy took a step forward, her surrounding turning dark as the portal closed behind her, then a dazzling flash of light blinded her. The wind rushed from below as she began to fall, blowing her hair wildly as she let out a short high pitched scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What going on?\" Lucy asked only herself frantically, never having such an experience while traveling between worlds before. She looked down, only too be greeted by the sight of two pale, spherical mountains waiting to catch her falling body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly they didn't look like mountains at all, they looked more like \"Boobs!\" Lucy yelled in disbelief, blushing as the supple orbs stopped her from falling any further. Finding herself wedged up to her chest in the breast flesh of another woman. Did that mean she had shrunken down, again? Was this Brandish's doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple glance upwards revealed the answer to her questions as 'yes' to the former, and 'no' to the latter. She had shrunk, but this was not the work of the shrinking mage from Alvarez.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukina!\" she yelled in shock and awe, her fellow celestial spirit mage looking down at the bug sized woman that had mysteriously appeared inside her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, is that you? How did you get so tiny\u203d And what around doing between my tits?\" Yukina asked bashfully, while an equally shocked Lucy maintained her silence at the size of the white-haired mage. Even the castle of Crocus paled in comparison to her massive size. Lucy wasn't just bug-sized either, she couldn't have been much larger than a puny ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy? I'm not hallucinating, am I?\" Yukina asked, responding for the second time in a row, as she carefully tried to raise her breasts using her forearms so she could better see the miniaturized blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy meanwhile struggled with not sliding deeper into Yukina's cleavage, using her arms as a brace to keep herself steady as her breasts pulled away from her. \"Wait, I'm slipping. Please stop.\" Lucy blushed, not wanting to fall any lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukina let out a gasp as Lucy spoke, her mind wasn't playing tricks on her, looking down at her senior as a Celestial Mage Yukina doubted that this situation was an intentional development. She wanted to help Lucy. But first, she needed to get some answers about how this happened in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Yukina, and what does she do to help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. In her own town, Yukina realizes that Lucy is still large enough to be seen by someone, deciding it's best to keep the author's shrinking a secret, for the time being, given her recent fame, driving her between her tits with a gentle nudge from her finger until she gets home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. At her home, Yukina scoops Lucy out of her cleavage on the tip of her finger to have a conversation face to face. Coming to understand the situation, she realized that what happened to Lucy somehow involves the Celestial Spirit Realm, making her the best person to help Lucy get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Outside of Magnolia, Yukina decides it's best to seek help from someone in Lucy's guild, bumping into Wendy on the street and asking for her assistance. Remembering that the Blue Haired Dragon Slayer specialized in healing magic.</span></div></div>",

Quit it!\" Ed yelled, still not used to the pain that came with reattaching his Automail arm after all these years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man up Ed.\" Winry chided, turning the final screw. The blonde Automail mechanic smiled down at her childhood friend. Of course, she was used to smiling down at him, considering she was a couple inches taller than him even when he was standing upright. \"Now just wait one second Ed. I've got one more thing I need to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd wondered what his friend could possibly mean by this as she exited the room. He shrugged and laid back, deciding he would find out sooner or later. Despite his frequent complaints, he trusted his friend wholeheartedly. Perhaps this was a mistake on his part, as when she re-entered the room she was holding some sort of gun in her hand. Before he could ask about it she had already fired on him, shrinking him with a bolt of what looked like lightning. Ed blacked out instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally awoke, Ed immediately noticed something had changed. Namely, he had shrunk! Now the table he was laying on was now the size of a football field and the stadium that surrounded it (not that Ed would know what football was). However, his focus was more on the enormous face of his friend hanging a few inches above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Ed! And I thought you were tiny before!\" Winry giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO ARE YOU CALLING SO TINY HE COULD FIT IN THE TREADS OF YOUR BOOT?!?!\" Ed yelled, though for once his description of his size was quite accurate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your so silly Edward! I didn't say that and we're the only ones here. Anyway, I guess I owe you an explanation. First thing's first, I shrunk you.\" Winry explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you go and do something like that?\" Ed demanded, stamping his foot in his best attempt at being threatening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Mustang's idea. He figured that if you were tiny, you could be kept hidden from Father and he wouldn't be able to go through with his plan. Meanwhile, Hohenheim and Al could stop Father! Isn't that a great idea?\" Winry said, excited that her crush was safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean hide me?\" Ed asked, not liking where this was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry replied... \"Well, ___________\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"You'll be staying with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"You're coming back with me to Resembool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"I'm gonna give you to May Chang.\"</span></div></div>",

As Winry opened it the shrunken alchemist was surprised not to see the face of an adult but a young child at the door, did she really trusted a child with his safety?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you thinking Winry? Are you really gonna trust this little brat to hide me!\u201d Ed yelled as the towering blonde woman and small black haired child approached him. However Ed soon realized that the girl standing next to Winry looked familiar, he remembered meeting her twice while she was with Scar. Although they must have been separated if she was working with Mustang. That\u2019s right, her name was May Chang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you calling a \u2018brat\u2019 you human microbe!\u201d She yelled, slamming her palms onto the table next to Ed. Suddenly the little girl didn\u2019t look so small, but rather like a giant statue. The eleven year old princess from Zing had been disappointed by Ed ever since she saw how tall he was under central, and now he was even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a lot bigger than you are now. So I\u2019d shut my mouth if I was you, pipsqueak!\u201d May said, looking down at Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, Pipsqueak?!? Who are you calling a little ant so puny he could fit inside your shoe!\u201d Ed yelled, outraged by the word \u2018pipsqueak\u2019 escaping the young girl's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that, but now that you mention it that might be useful for hiding you later.\" May joked, unnerving the tiny boy on the table as she hovered overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that's okay with you Mrs. Winry?\" She continued, suddenly shifting the conversation to Winry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess as long as your hiding him you can do anything you want.\" Winry laughed, not seeming to care what May had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who said you could decide that? I don't wanna end up trapped under this brat's sweaty feet.\" Ed yelled, pointing up at May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry smiled and rolled her eyes, pinching Ed's body between her fingers and lifting him up to her giant smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ed. I highly doubt her feet are that smelly.\" Dropping Ed onto the expansive plain of the Xing princesses palm. The shrunken alchemist staggered to his feet to continue his conversation with Winry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The jokes over Winry, now tell this little girl too give me back to you!\" Edward barked, hoping Winry was just pulling his chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a joke Edward, I'm not a fighter so I can't protect you if one of these Homunculus finds us That's why we're giving you to May, Alphonse told me that her Alkahestry is different than you're Alchemy and worked when yours didn't. She's the only person who could defend you. So if that means spending a few days under her feet then I'd suggest you get used to it.\" Winry said, angered by<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Days? You walked through the desert to get here didn't you?\" Ed asked, knowing the smell couldn't be too pleasant after days passed of walking in the desert heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh little Edward, we can't stay here too long or the Homunculi might figure out what we're up too.\" May said, changing her open palm into a closed fist with Ed at the center looking up at her. \"Ok little munchkin man, now where should I hide you?\" May asked, not really caring one way or the other about what Ed had to say about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"I kind of like your idea of hiding in my shoe, it will be the perfect place to hide you while I travel home to Xing.\" May Chang drops Ed into her flat and begins a long journey to Xing where nobody, not even the Homunculi could find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"I know just the place you can hide till we get to my new home just outside Amestris, don't worry I'll make sure you have a soft trip.\" May deposits Ed down the back of her pants between her butt-cheeks right in-front of Winry, before taking a train to her home outside the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"They'll never look for you in here.\" May say's, forcing Edward to turn around to see her mouth opened wide behind him. However she's not planning to eat him as she pushes him into her mouth, pushing him under her tongue with her nimble fingers.</span></div></div>",

The shrunken Alchemist's vision completely dominated by the face of the preteen princess from Xing, her eyes narrowed in order to focus on the inch tall boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, hold on a minute. Don\u2019t I get a say in this?\u201d Ed asked, not wanting anyone\u2019s protection in the fight against Father. Less from an eleven year old girl who called him short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve already explained this to you once before. Now shut up and do as we tell you!\u201d Winry yelled, standing over Ed from behind. Her very presence unnerving the tiny alchemist as she angrily slapped a wrench against her palm to intimidate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma'am!\u201d Ed yelped, fearful of what Winry might do if he continued disobeying her. Though it was hard to trust her when she assigned the task of watching over him to a child. Even if she was skilled in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you see things our way, now I can show you where you\u2019ll be spending the train ride.\u201d May announced, swinging Ed around her body. Bringing him just above her hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd hoped the Xingese Princess was simply teasing him, or that she had a secret compartment in her clothing that would allow her to carry him. However, these optimistic expectations were quickly put to rest as she tugged on the pants from her homeland. Revealing her bare bottom to the shrunken alchemist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Winry was left speechless by May Chang\u2019s decision of where she should hide Ed, she was only teasing Ed with her comment about the young girl\u2019s feet earlier. But this took things a step further, even passed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what you get for toying with the feelings of a maiden.\u201d May announced, referring to when the two first met in Father\u2019s lair. Having been infatuated with the young alchemist until she realized how short he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy butt is royalty, you really should feel honored. There\u2019s plenty of people back in Xing who would do anything to be in your predicament.\u201d May teased, leaving Ed doubtful that anyone from her home country would willingly dive head first into this spoiled brat\u2019s ass at his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, that didn\u2019t stop May from dropping him without a second thought. Allowing him to fall towards the pale white cheeks below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to get any closer to the young girl\u2019s butt, Ed attempted to clap his hands together in the hopes that he could transmute her underwear into something he could use to escape. His glance crossing Winry\u2019s as she watched the boy she loved fall head first into a child\u2019s buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl began to wonder if Ed had been right about May, perhaps Ed would be better off under her own protection. But it was too late for second thoughts now, May had already accepted her offer. It\u2019s not like Winry could take Ed back by force from a skilled Alkahist on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ed continued to fall he attempted to transmute May\u2019s underwear, only to find that it had no effect. Clearly her clothing was made from some kind of material not available here in Amestris, meaning Alchemy would have zero effect on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay pulled on her pants, securing them against her bottom with Edward held firmly under her right cheek. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m off to the train station now!\u201d May said, excitedly running out of the house with Ed in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Winry watched on speechless as a result of what she\u2019d just seen, unable to formulate a response in time. Her eyes focused on the rise and fall of the young Xingese girl\u2019s butt, wondering if it was really so bad from Ed\u2019s point of view. She told herself that it wasn\u2019t, a lie she quickly convinced herself of to make herself feel better as May disappeared from her line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Edward Elric was in a constant state of motion, being pummeled from all sides with each step the Xingese Princess took. The wall of butt flesh engulfing his body seemingly attacking from multiple directions at once, it was so embarrassing for him to be so easily tossed around like this. It was almost enough to make him feel smaller than he actually was. Though it was the first time his size actually reflected what people said about him, calling him a shorty, a midget, or a shrimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after May left Winry's house in Resembool Ed could hear the faint sound of a train whistle close by, meaning that May was preparing to board the train. Her young butt slamming into the minuscule boy as she jumped across the platform to board, nearly causing him to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it weren't for the law of equivalent exchange Ed feared he might have been reduced to the form of a pancake beneath May's rear soon as she searched for a place to sit, though he was reminded of a lesson Izumi Curtis had taught him and Ed early on. In order to make materials shrink they must also become more dense, and in order to grow become more fragile. Hence the reason Edward never used Alchemy to make himself taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. May can't find a place to sit, meaning that Edward is safe from being sat on for the duration of the train ride till her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. May Chang quickly finds a seat and takes it as fast as she can, almost forgetting that Ed was plastered against her hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Edward Manages to escape, forcing May to chase after him quietly without trying to make a scene. Knowing that rumors would quickly spread and the Homunculi would have no trouble finding them. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After clearing the dungeon on the floor 68 with the Assault Team Kirito decided to take a break from the front lines for the day, in order to dedicate his day to grinding EXP on floor 55 which had one of the best known dungeons for the higher level players to improve their sword skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd already been there for about 5 hours defeating monster after monster until he gained enough EXP to power himself up from level 78 to level 79. It was at that point in time where a rather unusual phenomena occurred, the last creature he defeated drops an item marked as *ultra rare*. It's inventory name was listed as a \"Magnitude Crystal\" something he'd never seen before on the info brokers item list. Great, first he received a unique sword skill with Dual Wielding and now a unique item as well. At least he could appraise this one and sell it later on if he had no use for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his inventory and the orange crystal block materialized in his hand, unfortunately what Kirito failed to realized was that this particular item had a self activation feature that was triggered by the surrounding air. A glowing orange light expanded into a sphere around him, starting at his left hand and growing until it covered his entire body and part of the area around him. It was so blinding and brilliant that he was forced to cover his eyes until it began to dissipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t a long period of time, maybe five or six seconds at most. But in that time Kirito\u2019s life would be changed forever, or at least until they defeated Sword Art Online. \u201cWhat was that? Some kind of in game flash grenade?\u201d Kirito asked, still unaware of what had just happened to him. Although as he unshielded his eyes the truth quickly became apparent to him. Everything on the trail surrounding him was gigantic by comparison, the trees, the flowers, even the grass was taller than him now. The famed Black Swordsman had been reduced to the size of a bug inside the world of SAO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t good, at this size there was no way he could fight against the enormous monsters inside this virtual world. He\u2019d have a hard enough time trying to slay a virtual bee, little own a floor boss. Hell, normal players would even be too much for him to handle in his current state. Even the weakest ones still left behind in the town of beginnings would be able to take on the so called strongest player in the game and win with relative ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then someone arrived through the warp gate via teleport crystal, sending them directly to Kirito\u2019s location. Something that could only be done by someone he had added to his friends list, he imagined himself facing down a towering 300 foot tall Asuna. However instead the short and sweet Silica appeared a few feet away from him. Though she didn\u2019t appear to be quite as short as he\u2019s remembered her to be, in fact she appeared to be rather gigantic by comparison given his new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still wearing the same outfit Kirito had given her during their quest together, a pair of asymmetrically shoes, long black socks that ended halfway up her thighs, along with a red skirt and robe. From his position on the floor in front of her Kirito could even vaguely see her panties, barely covered by her skirt. Not that she made an effort to hide them from the eyes of bugs. They were plain white, with a red trim going around her waist. The same style she usually wore in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes scanned the nearby area for any sign of Kirito but saw nothing, he was still on the map so it\u2019s doubtful his HP dropped to zero. \u201cThat\u2019s odd, it says here I should be standing directly on top of him.\u201d Silica said to herself walking towards Kirito, one misstep away from literally standing on top of him. Kirito took actions to evade Silica\u2019s falling foot as it stomped onto the ground where he\u2019d been standing. If he'd moved even a second later he would've been as good as dead, Silica really had to watch where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd?\" Silica said to herself, looking up to make sure Kirito wasn't in a tree above her. \"Maybe it's some kind of bug?\" she thought out loud, f course she meant it in a different context but it didn't stp Kirito from feeling any smaller. The young girl then turned her attention downwards in sadness, how was she supposed to find Kirito now? She just wanted to talk to him, with no other reason for her to seek him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before she noticed a tiny bug at her feet, waving up at her. It was something that stuck her as off, the bugs in SAO were familiars similar to NPC's they always behaved in a certain way, so it was weird that this one was acting different. \"Wait, is that...?\" She said putting her map data together with the appearance of this little black bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirito!\" She yelled, immediately covering her nether regions, not wanting to expose Kirito to what was under her skirt any more that she probably already had. \"This is so embarrassing, how much did he see?\" she asked herself, still she couldn't just leave him on the floor too be stepped on by another player or killed by some monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito watched as Silica covered herself, glad that she had noticed him as a person rather than a bug that got too close to her giant feet. Hopefully now she just didn't think he was being a pervert trying to see up her skirt, only time would tell as she got down on one knee to pick Kirito up, moving one hand away from her crotch to pick him up. Effortlessly pinching him between her thumb and pointer finger and lifting him into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really you Kirito?\" she asked, bringing him under her face. To think of all people a thirteen year old girl would be his savior. He gave a nod as his response and yelled up to Silica for her assistance, she needed to get him to a safe zone and fast. He explained everything to Silica, the weird item in his inventory, him shrinking and the massive danger he was in so long as he was so tiny. At least in the safe zone his HP bar couldn't go down, even if he was stepped on he could survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilica agreed to help her friend, but was still worried about his safety until she could get him there. \"I'll bring you back to my place on floor 39, but there's something I have to do first...\" Silica blushed, realizing something she'd have to do to ensure Kirito's wellbeing till she got home. \"..I need to hide you inside of my clothes!\" Silica blurted out, she knew it wouldn't be ideal for Kirito to get too close to certain parts of her body at his size, and this wasn't exactly hope she imagined it happening herself but if she were attacked then she couldn't fight back because one hand would be holding Kirito. Another reason for her decision was that she couldn't allow other players to see him as that might spread panic about other players shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito was no idiot, he saw the logic in what Silica was thinking. Yet still he knew there was no other way. \"Okay, do what you have to. I trust you completely.\" Kirito said as confidently as he possibly could given the situation, trying his best to help put Silica at ease. But in truth it only made her more embarrassed, where did Kirito think she was going to put him? Was he expecting to be dropped down her panties? Her mind beginning to swell with lewd thoughts about her shrunken friend's situation. Silica hadn't actually given any thought to where in her clothes she should keep him, she didn't expect him to say yes so quickly. She could drop him inside one of her shoes, easily enough to put on and take off. She could even dematerialize them when she got home. Aside from that there was too other options, her bra and her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was worried that his health might fall too fast in her shoes and he could be killed after experiencing her full weight. The other two options were much safer but also so embarrassing for her. Finally she had to make a decision.Kirito was to small to fight back anyways as she shoved him inside of her _________.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Shoe, Silica takes the modest route and teleports home shortly after, being careful not to step on Kirito too hard until she's in the safe zone. However afterwards she begins to apply more and more pressure until she's able to walk normally. Stomping on Kirito over and over again until she gets home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Panties, Silica opens her panties below Kirito preparing herself for what came next. However before Kirito can object he finds himself tossed inside her underwear for safe keeping. unable to be seen by anyone. Still he tries to fight back as Silica walks home, causing her to get aroused by the time she finally makes it to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Bra, Silica opens her bra and pushes Kirito on top of her breast, finding the spunk to tease him about this before closing her bra over him. However in this choice she decides to seek help from someone else. Bringing Kirito straight to Lisbeth and Asuna and telling them everything that happened. Now Kirito is in big trouble.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kirito woke up, rubbing his head as he rolled over on top of a large flat surface, the last thing he remembered was falling through a trapdoor on the 72nd floor while grinding to level up. Safe to say he passed out somewhere between then, but where was he now? The surrounding area was much too bright to be part of a dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he stood up, Kirito realized the truth of his situation. He had left the dungeon behind and was now inside the home of another player. Only now, for some reason, he was the size of a fly! Even more shocking was the fact that he recognized this house, it belonged to Asuna, but why would he be teleported into her home? Could it have something to do with her forcing him to join a party with her the other night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the high-level player could make sense of his situation, his head turned to the familiar sound of a closing door, eyes wide at the sight of Asuna herself as she casually strolled into the living room. The second in command of the Knights of The Blood Oath wearing her usual outfit, the white and red uniform leaving little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirito jumped up and down, trying to get her attention. The black swordsman called her name over and over again, but it was little use. He was too small to be heard and even harder to see dressed in all black. He might as well have been a piece of lint on her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Asuna stopped in front of the chair, looking around the room after swearing she heard something, but brushed it off since nobody could enter her place without her permission. A gentle breeze blew her skirt up just enough to reveal her white panties to Kirito, laced with red fabric to match the rest of her attire. Kirito blushed and tried to avert his eyes, which would soon prove to be a near-fatal mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, Asuna turned around in a manner befitting her nickname of \"Lightning Flash\" catching Kirito off guard as her panty clad ass hung in the air over the shrunken boy. The fabric of her underwear hugging her ass tightly, absorbed by her buttcrack as she leaned back, there was no time to react. Kirito fell onto his back, helpless to stop what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boing*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuna bounced gracefully on top of the sofa cushion. At least that's how any normal-sized person would have seen it. For Kirito, it was a much different experience, akin to being hit by a falling meteorite made of cotton candy. Tonnes of soft flesh directly contradicting the immense weight her body put on the shrunken player. It didn't hurt either, especially when compared to being stabbed in this crazy game. However, he couldn't move a muscle, immobilized completely by Asuna's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she ground her ass in a downward spiral, twisting her fanny from left to right in an attempt to become comfortable. Turning Kirito into an unwilling cushion for her behind, burying him under her panty clad ass. He winced in discomfort as he was pulled around in multiple directions, the virtual booty of his crush dominating his entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Asuna feels a little prick on one of her buttcheeks, standing up to examine her seat only to find it empty and with Kirito stuck to her asscheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Kirito fights back the only way he can, biting Asuna to force a reaction and speed up the clock on being found, but will Asuna understand or even believe the reason he's shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Kirito gets dragged under Asuna as she scoots back in her seat, finding himself trapped under her panty covered crotch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aang froze as he saw Toph standing high above him. He had been attempting to get into the Avatar state, and it had...backfired. Horribly. Now he was the size of a bug in front of the now-gargantuan blind girl. She took a few booming steps in Aang's general direction, and he tried to avoid looking at her massive feet and imagining what they would do to him if he wasn't fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't have to imagine for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's foot came crashing down a few more times, then suddenly stopped when she was right over him. The Avatar looked up at her glassy, unseeing eyes, and saw that they were looking directly at him. A puzzled frown formed on her face. \"Twinkle Toes, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot lifted off the ground, and slowly glided over Aang. The last Airbender was mesmerized by its size -- he craned his head back, following the path of Toph's toes as they swept above him, until he lost his balance and fell on his back into the packed earth below. The young Earthbender's foot kept moving until her sole hovered above the spot where Aang was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still, pipsqueak,\" she said. \"I want to get a good look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her foot stomped into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avatar was caught unprepared, and he was rammed head first even deeper into the dirt by Toph's sole. What little room he had to breathe in was polluted by the stench of her foot, and it was hard enough not to suffocate, let alone for him to Airbend his way out of the situation. Aang started to suck in air through his mouth -- it did little to dilute the horrible smell, but it was a start. Then Toph mashed her foot backwards, and Aang was given no time to react before he found his open mouth pressed against her sole. In an instant, he could taste it all -- all the accumulated grime and sweat caked onto the bottom of Toph's foot -- and he desperately began to bang on the thick skin of the blind girl's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph retracted her foot, and Aang gratefully swallowed lungfuls of fresh air as he pulled himself up to a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is you, huh, Twinkle Toes?\" she said. \"I dunno how you got this way, but it sure is perfect for our training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stomped the ground. The earth started to shake and rumble. Aang looked around, and saw a huge wall of soil and rock rising up to form a ring around them. He looked back at Toph. She was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll start off with some Airbending exercises to warm you up.\" Just as Aang breathed a sigh of relief, the gigantic blind girl slammed her foot right next to him. \"Try and dodge my feet, pipsqueak. Trust me, you don't wanna be caught under them when I'm through with you, because then things are gonna get a <i>whole</i> lot worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang backed away a few steps, then made an air scooter and leapt on it. Toph raised her foot right above where the Avatar was and slammed down. But Aang had darted away, just out of her reach. She raised her foot and stomped the ground again... but by now Aang was racing circles around her in the ring, zipping between her legs, across her feet, and over her sanded-down and scratched-up toenails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Toph went on the offensive, lumbering around the ring but routinely failing to squish the bug-sized Airbender. Aang, on the other hand, couldn't escape the arena -- he would have to move in a straight line for long enough that the giantess would surely catch him -- but he knew that all he had to do was outlast her. Unfortunately, at his tiny size, Aang would tire much faster than his much larger trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Toph had a trick up her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, the young Earthbender raised her foot and stomped the ground, and Aang zipped away to safety... or so he thought. He was so focused on not getting caught beneath Toph's foot that he backed away without looking and slammed into a newly-created wall of rock. As he slid to the ground, temporarily stunned, Toph took the initiative and moved her foot over to him. When she finally brought her weight down on him, it was not with enough force to break his tiny body, but the crushing pain on his chest jarred Aang to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head was stuck between her toes, but the rest of his body was pinned under her gargantuan foot. Toph was very carefully not applying enough pressure to pop him like an insect, but the sheer force at work made even the simple act of breathing an agonizing endeavor. And the horrible stench was just as bad between her toes as it was beneath her sole -- Aang couldn't take it much longer. He tried to squirm, but there was no space for him to use as leverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Toph leaned over him, more likely to show off the wide smile on her now-enormous face than any other reason. \"Well then, Twinkle Toes, it looks like you've failed at basic training. I guess I'll need to toughen you up if you have any hope of becoming an Earthbender like me... but lucky you, I know the best place to get some endurance training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph then went back to standing straight, thankfully relieving some of the weight on Aang's body as she did so, and for a while he could only hear his captress as she muttered under her breath and as something moved against the fabric that she was wearing. Then something monumental in size landed next to her foot with a heavy THUNK! Aang struggled to look behind him, but he was still pinned and could only make out a vast dark band. Then the hand of the blind girl reached down and plucked the Avatar from between her toes, her fingers curling into a fist around his puny torso as she effortlessly lifted him into the air. As he sped upwards, he managed to get a glimpse at what had dropped next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Toph's belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang would have little time to wonder at what she had planned for him, though, as she quickly maneuvered him to her backside and the meaning became obvious. With her free hand, she pulled up the the light strip of cloth hanging behind her to reveal her green pants. Toph then leaned forward and jutted her rear in the unfortunate Avatar's direction. Her ass was titanic, large enough that there was a tight round outline of either buttock on her otherwise very loose pants. Aang gulped. Toph's foot was already so large that when it was flat on the dirt, the Avatar was only about half as tall as the distance between the ground and the pinky toenail -- and even just one of her butt cheeks seemed at least twice as large as her foot. \"Ready for your endurance training, Twinkle Toes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Aang could respond, she hooked open her pants and panties with her free thumb and chucked him into the waiting chasm of her butt crack. The last Airbender rolled down between the two massive orbs of flesh as they came closer together, eventually bringing his slide to a neat, if embarrassing, stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph withdrew her hand and let her panties settle back snugly against her rear as Aang desperately tried to clamber out of her crack, to no avail. Her muscles held his left leg in a vice-like grip just above the knee, which prevented him from either climbing out or bending his way out. He was stuck, so he tried the only method left open to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avatar started banging on the unyielding, massive walls of Toph's butt, yelling, \"Toph! Toph! Let me out! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have kept going, but suddenly her ass contracted, slamming him between her twin cheeks and muffling his cries still further as Toph bent over to pick up her belt and refastened it, then grabbed something else... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang couldn't see the smile on the blind girl's face, but he heard her gloating. \"Hey, Twinkle Toes, guess what I got -- a new nutcracker!\" She gave a few experimental swishes with Aang's abandoned, normal-sized staff, and almost immediately felt the tingling sensation of her tiny captive shouting and trying to get free again. Toph straightened up, relaxing her rear muscles just enough to hear a tiny voice screaming \".-n antique! Let-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she quickly clenched her ass again, and the voice went silent, but the squirming picked back up. Toph grinned. She was definitely going to have fun with this, but first she had to get back to camp. So the young Earthbender started walking back, while the unfortunate Avatar was being tossed back and forth between her powerful glutes, occasionally getting squished when she paused to squeeze them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a long walk, Toph made it back to the camp. She walked over to her tent and tossed Aang's staff unceremoniously over her sleeping bag, out of sight from the rest of the camp. Then she walked over to the campfire and leaned over, causing her buttocks to spread wide. Aang, unprepared for his prison to open so suddenly, dropped like stone out of Toph's butt. He landed on the soft fabric of her panties, and came tumbling to a stop beneath her right butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the giantess sat down, and Aang was flung against her rear by the momentum, until finally she landed with a powerful WHUMP! As the blind girl reclined, Aang squirmed. An avalanche of assflesh barreled over him and settled above, giving him enough room to breathe but trapping him for the third time since he'd shrunk. Only the wider area stopped his friend's weight from pulverizing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone else came into the camp; Katara. \"Alright, as soon as the boys get back we can eat. Toph, have you seen Aang anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath her, the Avatar started squirming, but Toph just shifted her weight back a bit and clenched her cheeks, effectively silencing him. \"I did, but he said he's going to fly ahead to scout the area. He said we'll meet him again in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara paused. \"Hmm... I hope he'll be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph silently sighed in relief. \"Yeah, me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she had an idea. She slowly reached into her ass and fished out Aang, muffling him with her fist as she looked around. What to do with the pipsqueak?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. She tosses him into her mouth for \"waterbending\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She throws him down Katara's bra when she's not looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. She decides Aang will be staying in her ass for the rest of the day and night.</span></div></div>",

The two were seeking some well-earned relaxation, as well as a distraction from the war with the Fire Nation. However, things were rarely so simple for Team Avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was already in the water, doing a leisurely backstroke while humming a song sung by his people in the Southern Water Tribe. Meanwhile, an energetic Aang sought fun and entertainment by running vertically up the mountain alongside the waterfall with the use of Airbending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out below!\" The bald monk yelled, jumping high up and doing several flips before falling towards the lake. Bracing himself in the form of a cannonball for impact, Aang tried to cause a big splash. Sokka noticed this very late, frantically paddling out of the way moments before impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Aang, give a guy some warning next time would you!\" Sokka called out, before realizing that Aang had yet to surface. Looking down, he noticed his friend close to the bottom of the lake, seemingly trapped with his leg caught between some rocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Sokka could swim down to save him, Aang's tattoos began to glow ominously, and suddenly the whole lake was enveloped in bright light. An odd shiver worked it's way up Sokka's spine, catching the warrior off-guard as something strange began to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes passed before Katara arrived at the side of the lake, hoping to join the boys and maybe practice her Waterbending a little. Only when she got there, it appeared deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aang, Aang? Where are you?\"Sokka yelled, so focused on searching for his friend that he failed to notice the change in his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka, I'm all right. I'm over here.\" Aang replied, announcing his location after rising back to the surface. The two swimming towards the shore to catch their breath, when something odd happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka, Aang? Are you out here?\" Katara asked, her voice so loud that it resounded in their eardrums, almost like she had screamed directly into their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez! Katara you don't have to yell! We're right, here.\" Sokka paused for a moment, before turning around to see a three-hundred-foot tall version of his sister standing at the edge of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/art/Katara-s-Swimwear-738598818\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.deviantart.com/art/Katara-s-...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing her usual swimsuit, made up of primarily white cloth that contrasted her brown skin. The titanic-sized Waterbender failed to notice the two inch-tall boys floating on the water's surface only a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara heard no response and figured the two must have gone off to collect firewood and berries or had taken a separate path back to their campsite. She certainly never would have guessed that they were swimming around directly in front of her, at the size of bugs no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene before her eyes was so serene and peaceful, a lake full of sparkling clear water, and even a waterfall for her to practice her skills. She couldn't pass up such a perfect opportunity, breaking into a basic Waterbending stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaves appeared at first around Aang and Sokka, alerting them to what was about to happen. \"Aang move!\" Sokka warned, not wanting to get caught in his sibling's Waterbending stream. But, it was too late, Katara lifted them both into the air inside a bubble of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka, hold on!\" Aang yelled, instinctively putting his Waterbending skills to use as well. Unfortunately, the pull of Katara's strength was too strong for Aang to fight completely. The bald monk falling back towards the lake below while Sokka was left behind at Katara's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka watched in horror as Aang feel to safety without him, landing with a splash before disappearing underneath the surface. Meanwhile, Katara began her practice session, bending the water into the form of a river and moving the stream towards herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Sokka, this experience was similar to riding down a water slide at over sixty miles per hour. The rushing waters traveling down around Katara's waist and behind her butt, giving Sokka a mountainside view of gigantic cheeks before traveling down her thigh. Continuing down to her knees, Sokka made a futile effort to fight the current completely under Katara's control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that didn't even slow Katara down as she failed to notice the pebble-sized boy's movements. Sending the water further down her body, around her other knee and down to his sister's feet. While Aang watched from the lake, unable to believe how beautiful she looked, like a giant goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelpless to stop her Aang called out the giantess Waterbender's name over and over again, using his Airbending abilities to raise his voice higher and higher with each failed attempt. \"Katara, KAtara, KATara, KATAra, KATARa, KATARAAAAA!\" he yelled, but she was too focused on her training to hear his squeaks for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could break her intensive focus. Meanwhile, Sokka was assaulted by wave after wave of recycled water as he tried to escape the stream, trying to catch his breath rather than yell out for help so he wouldn't drown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Katara hadn't planned on practicing for long. It was more of a habit she developed over the past few months to always bend water whenever she was near any lake or river. It helped to bolster her skills and make her a more powerful bender.

You have to bring me to Kya so she can reverse this!\" Tenzin begged, not wanting to spend another minute alone with the giant Avatar now that she'd cut him down to size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll bring you to someone alright. But not to Kya. I think it'd be more fun to introduce you to Jinora and Ikki. I bet they'd have some fun with you at this size.\" Korra said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! But they won't go along with whatever you have planned. They'll help me!\" Tenzin exclaimed, hoping his faith in his daughters was not misplaced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when I explain to them that you agreed to be shrunken down in order to be trained by me they won't.\" Korra replied. \"And if you try to tell them the truth, you'll find yourself between my buttcheeks before you even get a chance to blink. And if that happens, you won't be getting out for a long time. I might even try keeping you back there for a few pro-bending matches.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin gulped at Korra's threat, not wanting to find out if she was bluffing. He had a sinking feeling in his stomach that she would take the opportunity to put him between her cheeks if he gave her the slightest excuse to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra could tell from Tenzin's silence that he was going to go along with her demands. Smiling at her domination over the tiny airbender, Korra strode out of her bedroom with Tenzin in hand, headed for the room shard by Jinora and Ikki as she worked out a plan to make sure that Tenzin had a lot of \"fun\" with them. Fortunately, both Jinora and Ikki were already in the room when she entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls, I've got something to show you.\" Korra said, itching to reveal her shrunken toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Korra?\" Jinora asked, standing up and walking towards the dark skinned girl. Ikki followed close behind, equally excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that dad? How'd he get so tiny?\" Ikki asked, as she saw her shrunken father in the Avatar's hand, her eyes wide with wonder at the sight of the shrunken monk. Jinora looked equally surprised, but not in an excited way the way Ikki did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Your dad shrunk himself with some spirit world magic as part of a new training routine. He has to avoid getting stomped on by my giant feet while I try to pin him. It's all about dodging and moving quickly. Improving agility and stuff.\" Korra explained to the enraptured Airbender girl, still unable to take her eyes off her shrunken father. Ikki was buying every word Korra was saying, but Jinora on the other hand looked skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this true Dad? You really shrunk yourself to get stomped on? Is that safe?\" Jinora asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin considered telling Jinora the truth, but did not dare risk Korra's wrath. He could almost feel the young Avatar's muscular glutes squeezing around his body, and couldn't imagine what it'd be like during one of Korra's matches. \"Yes Jinora. It's a little, err... unconventional, but we have to be willing to try new things to prepare to face the next threat when the day finally comes.\" Tenzin replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Tenzin actually did pretty well dodging my feet earlier. But we figured that to really test his speed, he'd need a master airbender to try to pin him. Someone smaller and quicker than me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo! Ooo! Pick me! I'll do it! My feet are the perfect size!\" Ikki said, jumping herself up onto an air scooter so she could show her bare feet to Korra and her father. It was clear she had not been wearing shoes all day, as her soles were littered with dirt and crumbs from around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a great idea Ikki! Can't believe I didn't think of it.\" Korra exclaimed, loving how easy it was to manipulate the young girl. \"The training itself is pretty simple. All you have to do is catch your dad under your foot. If you pin him three times in the next five minutes, then we know he needs more work on this.\" Korra explained, placing the tiny man down on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his position on the floor, Tenzin could truly appreciate the massive scale of his daughter. The young airbender who usually only came up to his hip, but now he was only standing at the height of her big toe. It and its 9 comrades stood before him menacingly, bouncing and wiggling with excitement as Ikki anxiously awaited the beginning of the game. Looking up the hundred or so feet to her innocently smiling face, Tenzin realized he couldn't blame his daughter for what was about to happen. It was clear that all she wanted to do was help. Her only mistake was trusting Korra, something he'd made the mistake of doing as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready daddy?\" Ikki asked, itching to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin took one last look up at Korra, hoping she would show mercy and spare him from this. The dark skinned water bender simply smiled and winked, making it clear she would not help him. Behind her, Jinora was watching with some combination of anxiety and anticipation. It seemed she still wasn't convinced this was a good idea, but she also seemed interested in seeing how it went down. Either way, she had no intention of interrupting what Korra and Ikki were planning. Not wanting to risk the hellish punishment Korra had threatened him with, Tenzin gulped and turned back to face his younger daughter. \"Ready.\" He said, gritting his teeth and preparing to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second's hesitation Ikki had literally leapt into action, her bare sole on a beeline for Tenzin as she quickly descended from above. Thinking quickly, Tenzin hopped onto an air scooter and started charging away, hoping he was a small enough target at his new size to keep his daughter on her toes. As he sped across the room, he couldn't help but stay focused on the giant girl behind him, always looking over his shoulder to keep track of his giantess daughter's ever approaching feet. Unfortunately, he spent so much time looking over his shoulder that he failed to notice he had sped his air scooter into the corner of the room. He stopped just short of crashing head on into the wall, hopping off his scooter and putting his back to the wall, leaving him cornered before Ikki's gigantic feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're trapped daddy. Hope my feet don't smell too bad.\" Ikki said with a giggle, preparing to stomp her father into the hard wood floor of her room. Meanwhile, Tenzin was looking for a way out. He figured if he moved fast enough, he might be able to leap past her and get some space between them once again. Not having any time to waste as Ikki began to lift her foot, Tenzin picked a spot between his daughter's pillar like legs and took an air bending propelled leap, hoping to come out safely on the other side of the human arch. Ikki had other plans. With impressive speed, the young girl swung her foot into the leaping Tenzin's path, displaying her bare sole to the master airbender as he hurtled directly into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin had no time to react as his daughter's sole swung into his path. Before he could begin to think of another path, he'd slammed head on into the soft underside of her foot, inadvertently burying his face in the soft skin of her foot just in time for her to slam it back down to the floor, pinning him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tenzin lay in smothering darkness beneath his daughter's foot, he swore that as soon as he grew back, he'd make his first priority ensuring Ikki bathed more frequently. The scent of her foot was worse than anything he'd ever experience in his life, and that was including the time he'd spent in Korra's ass earlier that day. He tried to struggle free from his position, but that only seemed to make Ikki press down harder on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop moving so much dad! Your beard tickles!\" Ikki said between giggles, twisting her foot on top of her father like she was grinding a bug out of existence. She was just being playful, but it certainly didn't feel that way for Tenzin. After a few seconds though, Ikki realized she still had two more stomps to get in and kicked her dad away, sending him sliding away from her feet across the slick wooden floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Tenzin caught his breath, he jumped right back onto his air scooter, resolving to learn from his last mistake. Now, he focused entirely on the terrain in front of him, ensuring he did not inadvertently corner himself once again. He weaved between and dodged under furniture in an attempt to always keep something between him and Ikki, hoping the obstructions would slow her down. Unfortunately, being under the couch just meant he lost track of his giantess daughter. He found her again before long. Just as he was about to pop out from under the couch, Ikki's barefoot swung into his path once more, this time toes first. The 8 year old girl effortlessly snagged her shrunken father off the floor between her massive first and second toe, wrapping him in a particularly unpleasant embrace. Tenzin tried to push himself free, but Ikki's toes clamped tightly around him, forcing all the air from his lungs in the process. As he gasped for air, he found his lungs filled with the unbearable stench radiating out from the crevice between his daughter's toes. As Tenzin struggled to stay conscious in spite of her feet, Ikki just laughed. \"I guess you're my toe jam now huh dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Ikki pins Tenzin a third time, so Korra suggests Ikki keep her dad in her shoe for \"endurance training\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Ikki narrowly misses pinning Tenzin underneath her toes a third time, annoying her as she wanted to feel her dad between her toes one more time. Korra then suggests that Tenzin build up his strength by massaging Jinora's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Korra Intervenes telling Ikki she's too good at this game, stepping in herself to try and capture Tenzin underfoot in the final round.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tenzin's day started unremarkably. He woke up at dawn, far too early for his young children to bother with. He spent three hours in focused Airbending training, aware that it was one of the few times he could do so without interruption. When he finished, he headed into the meditation room, ready to relax his tired body and focus instead on sharpening his mind. He sat down on in the center of an orange meditation mat and prepared to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin had been meditating for decades, ever since his father Avatar Aang taught him as a boy. But meditating into the Spirit World was still quite new to him. He had tried for years, but only recently accomplished with the help of his daughter Jinora. He could now do it without her, but it still wasn't easy, and he didn't always succeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowed his breathing and closed his eyes, allowing his mind to reach out towards the Spirit World. But this time, something was different. Rather than the usual warm feeling that slowly overtook his body when he entered the Spirit World, he instead encountered a sharp jolt, as though he was shocked by a lighting bender. His eyes snapped open as he reeled back from the shock, only to find the world around him looked very different now. Sure, it was the same meditation room he had started in, but everything was enormous! Whatever spiritual magic he had encountered, it had shrunken him down to no more than an inch tall. He inspected his body and found himself otherwise unharmed, though a quick attempt at Airbending showed him that his bending was somehow gone as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tenzin could decide on the best course of action, he heard a noise next to him. Looking to his side, he saw that the glass of water he had brought into the room with him was shaking. Ripples that were now the size of waves to him blew across the water's surface in response to some distant vibration. Before long, Tenzin began to feel the ground shaking as well. This was accompanied by the rhythmic banging sound of footsteps approaching. He wondered who it could be. Korra usually meditates this time of day, and she might be able to help him with her connection to the spirit world. Jinora would also be of assistance. However, when the door to the meditation room finally opened, the source of the shaking was revealed as his daughter Ikki walked into the room. He never even considered the earthquakes he was feeling could be caused by someone as petite as his youngest daughter. Then again, the young girl was now as tall as the Avatar Aang statue in Republic City Bay. Shel was dressed in her typical orange and yellow robes, with no shoes to speak of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I thought Jinora said dad was in here...\" Ikki muttered. \"Ah well, meditation will be easier without him constantly interrupting anyway,\" Ikki muttered, her eyes scanning the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin would normally have been annoyed that Ikki called his suggestions and lessons \"interruptions\", but this was no time for little annoyances like that. He had a giant daughter to deal with. He began to muse about how best to get her attention, stroking his beard furtively as he mused about his options. He looked back up at the giant Airbender, only to see her eyes now fixed on his position. He rejoiced internally, thinking she had spotted him. She had come in here looking for him after all. He watched as she strode towards him, evoking his memory of Korra's giant astral form fighting Unalaq as she approached, seeming taller and taller the closer she got. He jumped up and down and waved his arms, trying to get Ikki to bend down so she could hear him. He certainly found it strange that she had not said anything yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what Tenzin didn't realize is that his orange robes blended in quite well to the orange meditation mat he was currently occupying. Combined with his small size, this made him too small for his giant daughter to notice. So while she was looking down at her father, all she saw was a comfy looking mat to begin her meditation on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis became clear to Tenzin when he saw Ikki turn around, replacing her view of his face with one of her butt, clad in the typical baggy yellow air bender pants her whole family wore. He reacted quickly, breaking out into a sprint away from his giantess daughter as he realized she saw him as little more than a seat. He looked over his shoulder to see that she had begun to squat, her giant butt hanging over the mat and covering him in its shadow like the moon eclipsing the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Tenzin thought he had escaped, he suddenly felt himself beginning to be pulled backward by a strong wind. He planted his feet and braced against this unexpected obstacle, not yet sure what he was facing. However, a strong gust at ground level swept his feet out from under him, sending him spiraling into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking anything of it, Ikki had subconsciously summoned a temporary air scooter to break her fall. She didn't wanna fall butt first on the ground without some air resistance, and these mediation cushions offered much less support than she would have liked. The air scooter lasted just long enough for her butt to be slowed down almost to a stop, then disappeared as quickly as it had arrived, allowing her butt to finish its descent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Tenzin, this quick air scooter had a much more unfortunate effect. He was pulled into its center as it formed, thrown around and twisted in the middle of it like he was trapped in a tremendous tornado. He knew the truth though. This was nothing more than a little air ball designed to slow his daughter's butt down. It wasn't enough to force to stop a small girl's butt, but it was more than enough to completely dominate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly though, the wind of Ikki's airball threw him in a new direction, and with all the grace of a fly smashing into the windshield of a Sato Mobile Tenzin face planted directly into Ikki's right butt cheek. The soft fabric of her Airbender attire as well as the squishiness of her butt cheek absorbed the collision, keeping Tenzin from splattering into a puddle against her cheek. Instead, he was sprawled out like a starfish, arms and legs spread as the jiggly round object he found himself attached to came crashing downward towards his inevitable demise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki's butt touched down hard on the ground, slamming Tenzin back into the meditation cushion as she barreled down on top of him. His back hits the cushion and sinks into it, his weight augmented by the force of Ikki's descending cheek. The cushion can only sink so far though, and once he reaches its breaking point, the soft fabric pushes him back upwards, causing him to sink into his daughter's fleshy cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki had no notion of the drama going on beneath her. All she had done was sit on a perfectly normal cushion, just as she had done many times in the past and now she was ready to begin her meditation. She did briefly feel a slight bump under her right cheek, but as she settled into the cushion it mostly dissipated. She shook the thought out of her head, reminding herself not to get distracted with things around her, and to focus inward, just as Jinora and her father had taught her. She began to rhythmically inhale and exhale, focusing on her breathing and on staying calm. She closed her eyes and allowed her mind to drift towards the spiritual plane...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin now more than ever wished he had not taught his daughter so we'll to ignore earthly distraction. He screamed into and pounded against her butt, but the child's cheek easily absorbed the blows, and the giant girl above showed no sign of even noticing. She was completely still and unmoving as she meditated. Tenzin could have been stuck under some kind of fleshy boulder for all the difference it would make. He resolved to add a step to Ikko's meditation ritual once he was back to normal size: always check your seat for shrunken people. She adjusted slightly in her seat as she got comfortable, grinding her ass back and forth on the mat as she settled in. This had the unfortunate side effect of dragging Tenzin's face across her ass cheek, literally rubbing his face in the humiliation of being dominated by his daughter's backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally settled into her routine, it was almost a relief for Tenzin. At the very least, the tremendous weight bearing down on him was uniform and constant. Of course, he still wanted nothing more than to be free of it. For the entirety of her 30-minute meditation session, he screamed, wriggled, and punched at her cheek, doing his best to get her to notice him. For Ikki, the rebellion of the world's greatest Airbender under her cheek did little more than cause a tiny itch on her butt, one that was too insignificant for her to notice as her mind wandered in meditation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Ikki finishes meditating and notices a frequent itch under her butt. She gets up to investigate and finds Tenzin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Tenzin is left sprawled on the matt as Ikki stands up, just in time for Korra's meditation to begin on top of Tenzin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Ikki finishes and stands up, still not noticing Tenzin stuck to the back of her pants by sweat after 30 minutes. Now he must try getting her attention while stuck to her butt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nearly forty-five minutes had passed since Ikki entered her meditative state, not that Tenzin could gauge that from his current whereabouts under his daughter's butt. Still pinned firmly underneath her right butt cheek Tenzin tried everything he could to get her attention. But no matter how much he kicked, struggled, or screamed for help under Ikki's bottom the young girl remained stagnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikki, get up this instant or your grounded!\" Tenzin yelled, becoming increasingly frustrated. Unable to believe the situation he found himself in, his bones slowly beginning to crack under the immense weight of Ikki's hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to count himself lucky that it was only Ikki who sat on him. Knowing that if it was Korra or Jinora who'd sat on him instead he might not have survived this long under their bigger butts. However, none of these thoughts made the circumstances more pleasant or less humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin completely realized that Ikki was unaware of the fact that he'd been shrunk, at the moment he was nothing more than some extra padding. Making her pillow only slightly more comfortable for her butt, luckily his suffering would not continue much longer as Ikki slowly opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, meditation sure is boring!\" Ikki's voice boomed as she lifted her arms over her head. Stretching her body as if she'd just awoken from a long nap, driving her butt hard onto the cushion below her. Subconsciously, she was trying to eliminate the source of an itch that had been bothering her body for some time now while her brain was on a spiritual journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin screamed for help as the weight of Ikki's butt on top of his body seemed to double in an instant, his voice silenced as all the air exited his lungs. Meanwhile, his limbs remained immobilized by the massive onslaught of loosely contained butt flesh. At this moment Ikki's conscious mind became aware of the itch plaguing her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what that?\" Ikki asked herself out loud. It almost felt like she was sitting on top of something(or someone).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwatting her arms towards the ground, Ikki quickly created two gusts of wind the propelled her to her feet. Meanwhile, Tenzin was suddenly blinded by an intense light after being surrounded by darkness for over half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see.\" Ikki announced, turning to her attention to her former seat and bending down to get a closer look. Her eyes scanned every inch of the cushion for anything out of the ordinary but found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time Tenzin regained his sight, expecting to look up and once again see his giantess daughter. Instead, he found himself looking down from above bringing him to a shocking conclusion. After being sat on for an extended time, Tenzin's body was stuck to Ikki's pants by a combination of sweat and static cling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikki, down here!\" Tenzin yelled, relieved to be breathing fresh air. Now all he had to do was get Ikki's attention so she could bring him to Korra or Jinora for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what the...?\" Ikki asked, trailing off as she looked up between her legs, pushing her butt upwards. She could have sworn she heard something, and strangely enough, the sound originated near her butt. She knew she didn't make the noise, but maybe she sat on something that did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching behind her without a precise location on her butt in mind Ikki tapped her hand against her rear end a few times before feeling something very tiny on her right cheek. Oddly enough it was smaller than her fingertips, and moving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki quickly peeled Tenzin from her backside, thinking she'd sat on a bug. It never even crossed her mind that she'd been sitting on another human being, little own her father. Although he didn't realize it a the time, Tenzin was very lucky. Most girls in Republic City would have panicked, knocking the assumed bug to the ground and squishing it for good measure. But Ikki, on the other hand, was intrigued to find out what kind of bug could survive being sat on for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought Tenzin under her gaze, squinting to get a better look at this bug she'd captured. \"Wait, Dad is that you?\" she asked confused. What was he doing here and why was he so tiny? She asked herself,  beginning to think that her extended period of meditation was messing with her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikki, please I need your help. Bring me to Korra, or Jinora.\" Tenzin begged, the giant Airbender girl realizing that she wasn't hallucinating or seeing things at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, first off how did you manage to get so tiny?\" Ikki asked, more interested in the method that Tenzin used to shrink himself down than bringing him to her sister or Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure, to be honest. I was just here waiting for Korra to arrive before you got here, now please help me find her.\" Tenzin explained. It didn't matter much how he shrunk as long as he could reverse the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ikki's interpretation of the events played out differently than how they transpired in the real world. Rather than thinking of Tenzin's shrinking as an accidental occurrence, she believed that he did this to himself on purpose. But why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(These three choices will play out it two separate forms of dialogue, labeled \"1\" and \"2-3\" below to mark the choices for the direction the story will take next.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"You must have shrunk yourself in order to train and get much stronger, but you don't have to worry. We won't need Korra or Jinora's help because I've been practicing a lot and I've gotten very good. I can probably even beat you when you're this tiny.\" Ikki insists that Tenzin spares with her to see where he stand in his training, but without his Airbending, he doesn't have the tiniest chance against his giantess daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2-3(Separate Dialogue). \"I know what's going on here! You must have shrunk yourself because you wanted Korra to sit on you instead of me. You're such a pervert! You're lucky I'm not going to tell mom about this! Although, you will need to be punished...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"I think Jinora's sandal could use a new insole, luckily for her you're the perfect little size to ride under her foot without being felt.\" Ikki sneaks into Jinora's room and finds her sandals in the corner, dropping Tenzin inside before running off. Without his Airbending, Tenzin is unable to escape and Jinora soon returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"Since you wanted to get under Korra's butt I'll let you, well see how much you enjoy yourself when I use one of Asami's adhesive patches to tie you down on her saddle. She should be going for a ride any minute now.\" Ikki makes a quick stop to the dining room on her way find Naga(Korra's Polar Bear Dog) grabbing the patch mentioned in the text to glue Tenzin to Korra's saddle. Just as she finishes Korra arrives and Ikki must make up a lie on the spot.</span></div></div>",

The Hundred Years War had ended. Peace had come to the land. But there were still remnants of the old Fire Nation. Prince Zuko -- no, now Fire Lord Zuko -- was bound to face challenges as he restructured his nation. The government in particular -- a century of conflict had bred a militant disposition in the elite. These people had flourished under Sozin, Azulon, Ozai. They would not budge for an exiled prince, a traitor, a teenager disowned and scarred by his father. Not while there was another option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prison was in the capital. Nowhere else, not even Boiling Rock, could be trusted with this prisoner. She was the reason for numerous attempted break-ins, and had nearly started civil wars several times over her claim. Azula. It didn't matter that her brief reign displayed paranoia and megalomania on a scale grander than even her father. She represented the Old Ways, and at the present she was a liability. Irredeemable, vengeful, unstable... and unkillable -- by order of the Fire Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cell door creaked open, and the prisoner, chained to the floor, sat as upright as she could. Azula was a mess -- hair unkempt, eyes glittering, fingernails long. She smiled viciously at the figure. \"Come to gloat, peasant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure stepped forward, revealing herself as Katara of the Southern Water Tribe. Her voice was as hard as ice. \"Azula, Princess of the Fire Nation, by official decree of Fire Lord Zuko-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother is no Fire Lord! It should be me! ME!!\" spat Azula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to be imprisoned indefinitely, not by bars of iron, but by sheets of ice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad princess drew back, confused. What could she mean by this? Then, Katara drew a pouch from the folds of her robe. \"Spirit water has many properties,\" she said. \"Beyond healing, it can also change people -- people like you.\" With that, she started to waterbend a cocoon of glowing water around Azula. The princess staggered; her head was pounding, like her skull was too small for her brain. Her eyes bulged. She grew dizzy, and her legs gave out from under her. The last thing she saw before unconsciousness was the room growing larger around her, with Katara at it center, looming up and up and up and up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara took the small ball of ice -- no larger than a fist -- and looked inside. There was Azula, asleep. Katara breathed on the ice, and the ball went from clear to opaque with her breath. Then she put it in the pouch she had brought the water in, and was escorted out. She knew, as she left the confines of the prison, what would happen. There would be a rumor that Azula had escaped, been spirited away to some island beyond the western ends of the Fire Nation. As the guessing and speculations grew to fever pitch, Zuko, apparently bowing to pressure, would check and find her missing. His critics would be silenced, and he could sleep without fear at night. Meanwhile, Katara would head back home, back to the Southern Water Tribe where the ice never melts, and hide away the little ball of ice until sometime in the distant future, when the Hundred Years War was little more than legend, when the world had moved on. Maybe then she could release the Fire Princess onto the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, always maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\nMany Years Later<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra and the Airbenders had stopped by the Southern Water Tribe to meet with Katara. As Oogi, Tenzin's air bison, landed on the packed snow fields, the elderly Katara came out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma!\" shrieked the children as they ran to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mother\" said Tenzin, looking frazzled. \"I'm sorry we can't stay long, but we've got a celebration to get to -- even Lord Zuko will be there! So sorry for the short notice, but the kids demanded-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. that all right.\" said Katara, waving a hand dismissively. \"I do have something for Korra, though. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra followed the old waterbender into her igloo. Katara grabbed an old sealskin pouch, reached inside, and took out a ball of ice. \"I want you to give this to the Fire Lord.\" she whispered, handing it to the Avatar. \"This...amulet...holds great meaning to him. I'm sorry I can't come myself, but these old bones aren't meant for air bison anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra inspected the amulet, then pocketed it. \"Thanks!\" she said loudly. \"Will do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple days later, they reached Air Temple Island. When they landed in the sweltering hot sun, Pema came forward to her husband. \"I'm sorry dear, but it looks like Lord Zuko won't be attending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" gasped Tenzin. \"He won't? Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something came up in the Fire Nation that required his attention. Now as for your other guests...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Korra came up to her room. It was beastly hot, and all she could do was set the amulet on the table and flop down on the bed, hoping she wasn't sweating as hard as she felt she was. As she lay there, the first few drops of water came off the ball of ice, and a dark spot at the center became clear. The thing in the center was still asleep, asleep as it had been for decades, but now its bonds were loosening. For the first time in more than eighty years, Azula, Princess of the Fire Nation, began to stir. More drops began to run off as the heat steadily melted the ice. By now, Korra had gotten up and was about to start with preparations for the party, when she noticed the amulet and the growing puddle of water surrounding it. She was about to attempt to refreeze it when she noticed something in the center. Something dark, something not water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in nearly a century Azula opened her eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra bent down closer to get a better view, but then she heard a insistent knocking at the door -- Ikki and Jinora. \"Mom says you need to come down to help -- now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second!\" replied the Avatar. She knew she really should get to helping, but there was something captivating about that spot in the center...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was awake. In the glaring sunlight that pierced through the ice, she knew how to escape. She breathed fire into her prison, which began to glow, and turn white-hot. Suddenly it burst, and once more the teenaged Fire Princess was free. But what was her first sight upon liberation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. An empty room -- Korra had left with Ikki and Jinora. Lost yet determined to escape, Azula will leave the room and try to flee. But instead of finding the exit, she first runs into an unaware Ikki and Jinora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Korra -- The new Avatar, intrigued by this chain of events, finds out who this tiny girl is and shows her off to the Airbender twins. Together, all three become Azula's new wardens, and the island becomes her new prison</span></div></div>",

She was in a massive room. A massive, empty room. Was this what that filthy waterbender was playing at? A new cell? But no, it was too nice compared to her previous prison -- maybe her pathetic brother had one of his guilt twinges and was 'merciful'... No matter. She was going to have her revenge and reclaim her throne -- but first, to escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too easy to find a way out of her cell. First, she leapt down from her high table, using jets of blue flame to cushion her fall. Her landing was slightly erratic -- it had been some time since she had last been allowed to use her powers, after all -- but she quickly recovered. The door was even easier than she had hoped. There was a gap, small enough to be practically unnoticeable for anyone else, but large enough for her to squeeze through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door, there was a wide, austere hall. Nothing for Azula to hide behind, but no matter. She just crept close to the wall. There were no guards yet... strange, but maybe little Zu-zu didn't want a repeat of last time. Then, as Azula neared the end of the hall, she heard an all-too familiar sound. The sound of a strong wind being harnessed and contained. The sound of airbending. At last, the Avatar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula kept quiet, back flat against the wall. If she could kill Aang, she would remove the greatest obstacle to her eventual return. Then she could head on a little journey to the Northern Water Tribe -- pretend to be a victim of some unfortunate accident with spirits. She could convince them to regrow her, and then she would be free and ready to rally the disloyal nobles of the Fire Nation to her cause. It would be glorious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then prepared to strike. She would fry him with lightning, then burn him to finish the job. The sound of air grew closer and closer now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula leapt to the center of the hall and lashed out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bolt struck the orange and yellow robes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" yelped Ikki, who was entering the room on a ball of air. The sharp sting of a static shock caused her concentration to lapse for a moment, and her air scooter dispersed. The young airbender's backside slammed down hard on the wooden floor. Azula was given no time to react before the enormous giantess's rear dropped on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides outrage and humiliation, her mind stewed on the fact that here was another airbender who was not the Avatar. How could this be? Even if Sozin's initial purge of the Temples had somehow missed a few airbenders, it was impossible that there could be an enclave so long after the systemic destruction began. How was there another airbender? How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was given little time to reflect, however, as Ikki quickly jumped up. Azula started to fall off her behind, but was then caught up in the reformed air scooter. As the Fire princess was trapped in a cataclysmic whirlwind, Ikki sped away, looking for her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ikki found Jinora as she was walking to the meditation room. \"What are we doing now?\" asked Ikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad wants us to go meditate or just not bother him. I'm meditating. Wanna join me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki thought for a moment. \"Nah.\" Then she turned to leave, but Jinora called out. \"Oh, and Dad wants us to not use air scooters. Says it's noisy enough as is. Be sure to put your boots on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Azula attempted to break free from the spinning orb of howling wind. The airbender girl -- who must be part of some hidden airbender family, judging from the other girl's actions -- was slowly easing the ball of wind, making it safe enough for Azula to use her jets once more. But even the comparatively safe winds were powerful, and Azula was buffeted off course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she land?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. In a pair of boots -- a barefoot Ikki is about to put on some shoes, and Azula will be somewhere she's never been before... at someone's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. On a meditation rug in the next room -- Jinora is going to plop down, pinning Azula, who won't take this insult sitting down.</span></div></div>",

She struggled to rise from her kneeling position, but the flexible mat simply bent wherever she applied pressure. As she tried and failed to get up, she heard the soft, booming footfalls of the second airbender girl entering the room. The former heir to Ozai turned her head as far as she could, and saw the orange-clad giantess walking in her direction. Even if she could could get up in time -- and she couldn't -- there would be no way for Azula to outpace the young airbender. All she could do was watch as the red pillars of the girl's boots stomped closer and closer -- swung over her position, pausing just in front of her. The giant novice made some arm motions that Azula couldn't make out... and then she began to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's eyes widened as the orange-robed posterior grew larger and larger in her field of vision, shadowing everything as it came down, faster and faster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFWUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinora's robe-covered rear plowed into Azula, forcing her deeper into the mat. The princess pushed as hard as she could against the massive butt, to no avail. Her poor footing prevented her from getting leverage, and Jinora's training regimen had ensured that her buttocks were, if not as solid as Korra's, very firm nonetheless. Having failed to get the weight of Jinora's rear off of her, Azula began to futily punch the giantess, throwing all her weight into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinora was trying to meditate, but she felt a persistent itch on her rear. So she shifted her position a little. Azula was dragged roughly across the mat, and redoubled her efforts. Jinora, still feeling the itch, started to grind and wriggle. Azula was buffeted from side to side, unable to breathe. Her unaware captor still felt the annoying little itch, so she raised her butt several inches up before slamming it back down. The Fire Princess spent the next several minutes being crushed, rubbed, and pounded by Jinora's posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the airbender, determined to be rid of the irritant, looked to make sure nobody was coming before lifting her left, then her right buttock and scratching furiously before settling down again. Azula was given the briefest of moments -- a gasp of fresh air -- before the young airbender's scything fingers slammed into her, driving the air out of her lungs and scratching her against her ass. Then, before Azula could catch her breath, Jinora dropped her backside back down on her, smothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the tiny princess, desperate for enough oxygen to sustain both her and a flame, flopped weakly, and still Ikki's sister was annoyed. Meditation was entirely forgotten now, and now Jinora wanted to just get rid of the horrible itch. It wasn't just her skin, so what else could it be? Once more she twisted, and when Azula didn't respond, she decided to just ignore it. Jinora retuned to her original position, bulldozing the weakened Azula once again. The airbender girl gave her buttocks one last, playful wriggle before returning to meditation. Meanwhile, Azula struggled to retain consciousness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes -- And Jinora, now rather annoyed by this point, decides to stand up and inspect what has been irritating her for so long. Mistaking Azula for a bug, she decides to test just how resilient the 'insect' is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo -- Jinora finishes meditating and leaves Azula on the mat. However, by the time she revives, Korra has entered to start practicing...</span></div></div>",

She wriggled once more and resumed meditation, unaware that the one-time Fire Princess that she had heard so many stories about was now bug-sized and unconscious under her rump. Azula's breathing was shallow, and her body was deeply pressed into the mat by the orange-clad backside. But she was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the young airbender sensed footsteps coming down the hall. She unfolded her legs and stood up, leaving twin indentations where her butt had been -- and had she looked closer, she would have seen a small, dark figure pressed in one of them. But she did not, and she walked over to the doorway. Jinora didn't need seismic sense to know who was coming. Only one person on the island wore heavy boots indoors (to the immense exasperation of Pema, whose eternal duty it was to try and keep the island clean).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the preteen turned to walk down the hallway, Korra rounded the corner and headed for the room that Jinora had just left. She raised her arm in a casual greeting as she stomped past. \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinora returned, barely glancing in the Avatar's direction. \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as they both were about to exit the hall, Jinora half-turned to face Korra. \"Hey, Korra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom would like it if you didn't train in your boots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avatar nodded. \"Alright.\" Then she entered the room, and Jinora went around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra stopped before she trod on the mats. She slipped her feet out of her boots and planted them on the ground. Her toes wriggled and clenched as she wondered what her training routine would be. The waterbender had long since discovered that the climate of Republic City, especially at this time, was not boot-wearing weather. At first, she wore her boots out of necessity -- it wasn't like she could pack a wardrobe in Naga's saddlebag, and Tenzin hadn't decided to buy shoes for his children seven years in advance. Then, as her position at Airbender Island became more stable, she kept the boots because they reminded her of home. But unlike her Water Tribe coat, her boots couldn't easily shed their layers when they weren't needed, and if she wore socks with her leather boots in Republic City, it felt like she was trapping her feet in a furnace. The solution she had come up with was to just not wear socks, to go barefoot in her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result of this was that both her feet and the inside of her boot reeked of filth and sweat. Despite being a waterbender, Korra had never shied away from getting dirty. Besides, she had been earthbending for nearly as long as she had been waterbending, so she was fine with a little grime. It wasn't like anyone was around her to look at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's eyes snapped opened as she heard the first foot step onto the mat. Even at a distance, she could sense the pungent odor of Korra's unwashed body. Shaking off the aches of being the giant girl's seat for so long, she rose unsteadily to her feet. The new girl was wearing a light blue... something. It was just a form-fitting piece of clothing with no sleeves. It appeared to be Water Tribe, but the waterbenders usually lived in climates that were far too cold for that sort of clothing. The giantess pulled some water out of a pouch by her side and started to manipulate it. Whoever she was, she was indeed a waterbender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beginnings of a plan formed in Azula's mind. Then Korra lumbered over to where Azula was, bringing her overpowering foot-stench with her. Azula rolled out of the way of the giantess's smelly foot, but a drop of sweat from Korra's exposed armpit hit Azula directly on the head and engulfed her, trap ping her on the mat. Korra shifted her foot to the side. Her toes raked across the surface of the droplet, smearing it across the mat and unintentionally freeing Azula. If the Avatar felt anything damper than usual, she made no sign of it. She pressed her foot flat against the floor, and the tiny Fire Princess was stuck in the vaunted arch of Korra's toes, which were too close together for her to squirm out of, and too low for her to crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Korra curled her toes. The roof of foul-smelling flesh became a tube for Azula. The dirt-caked pad of one of the giantess's toes slammed into Azula's side and lifted her up to the 'ceiling'. Little bits of the sweat-moisture from Korra's armpit mixed with the dirt to form a sticky, stinky mud that adhered the tiny child of Ozai to the bronzed flesh of her toe. Azula's struggles only appeared to cause discomfort, because the more she thrashed, the tighter Korra's toes curled. And as the titanic teenager exercised, some of her toe's own sweat started to appear, carving light paths in the layers of filth on top of her heating skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Azula did not dare use fire at this time, for fear of being crunched between those colossal toes. She was going through hell, but she would keep going. If she could recover her size, that would be worth this torture and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an eternity of workout torture, Korra finished, giving her enough time to feel that there was something between her toes. She kicked out her foot, uncurling her toes as she did so, sending Azula flying off into space. The tiny Fire Princess landed on something clean, white, and soft. For a while, her body collapsed, just wanting to lie down and sleep again after such a terrible activity. In that time, Korra stomped on over. There had been nothing on her feet besides the usual grime, so she might as well towel off before putting her boots back on. Absentmindedly, the behemoth Avatar grabbed the towel Azula was resting on and rubbed it forcefully in her sweaty armpits. Then she looked down at her breasts, which glistened with sweat. She resolved to clean those off too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she moved the now-rather-smelly towel to her ample chest, she noticed a small dark shape on the towel. Probably just a piece of grime, she thought. A very odd piece of grime. It almost looks... alive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPathetically, Azula raised an arm and attempted to punch the air. Even from her perspective, the blue fire was barely a spark. The once and future Fire Princess slumped on the pale towel, awaiting the judgement of the poorly-dressed waterbender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra squinted at the dark shape for another three seconds before deciding that it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. A person -- Korra is very apologetic and only wants to help the self-described \"poor citizen run afoul of spirits\" -- and Azula plans her return...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Grime -- Korra lightly towels off her sweaty breasts, leaving Azula stuck in her cleavage as she heads off to dinner with the rest of the members of Air Temple Island -- and Azula tries to escape...</span></div></div>",

The first sight she had in seventy years was of a giant woman, clad in light blue Water Tribe garments -- most likely some waterbender servant of her brother. This suspicion was confirmed when the woman casually moved the melted spirit water into a nearby cup. But the woman was looking at her with an expression that the princess wasn't used to -- one of confusion. The giantess rumbled, \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's nostrils flared. Of course she'd be slighted by the guard, even if this did seem to be a rather luxurious prison. \"Oh, I'm just a poor farmer who ran afoul of spirits and got shrunken for no reason at all,\" she replied with as much sarcasm as she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer guard's expression changed to one of shock. \"Really?\" she boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula snorted. Great. A guard with as much sense as a rock. Might as well play along. This girl could be a useful pawn. \"Yes. Just a humble servant of the Fire Lord, Ozai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should have gotten a laugh, or at least a correction to 'Zuko', but instead, the giantess's face showed only concern. \"Ozai? You mean Lord Zuko's father? Wasn't he deposed by Avatar Aang, like, seventy years ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ozai's been gone for decades now. Same as Aang. Fire Lord Zuko's still around, though. You must have been in that ice for a long time, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Fire Princess staggered back. Seventy years? Her father gone? Her brother reigning? The Avatar... dead? She looked around the room. This was no cell -- it was her \"guard's\" room! What could she do now? She was a relic! The enormous lady seemed to notice her distress and got up. \"I'll get Jinora and Ikki. They're Aang's grandkids, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who- Where's the new Avatar?\" Azula managed to splutter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking at her. Name's Korra.\" Then she closed the door, leaving Azula alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Korra returned with two girls in orange-and-yellow robes. She introduced them to Azula. \"This is Jinora and this is Ikki. Girls, this is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller one gasped. \"Azula!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Azula. She's Lord Zuko's sister. She was an evil sadist who went mad with power, went insane, and also planned to burn the entire continent of the Earth Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked like she was about to object when the smaller girl -- Ikki -- darted forward. The young airbender reached out for the tiny princess, saying, \"Aw, come on, guys, she doesn't look so -- EEEEE!\" She quickly dropped Azula and stuck her now-singed fingers into her mouth. Not everyone had seen the brilliant blue flash of fire, but everyone knew what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula landed at the feet of a now-vengeful Korra. She looked up just in time to the new Avatar, whose face was a cold mask of righteous fury, bend down and grab her in her massive hand. She struggled, but Korra simply tightened her grip, driving the air out of Azula's lungs. Meanwhile, Ikki started to cry from the pain. Then Korra placed her free hand reassuringly on Ikki's right shoulder and said, \"Don't worry, Ikki, I'll make it up to you. How about I take Azula and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Make you a popsicle\" -- Korra will freeze Azula and give her to Ikki to make up for the burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Have a little chat with her\" -- Azula will be taken to the garage and be taped to the seat of Asami Sato's motorcycle.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't see or hear anything, and all of her senses were overwhelmed by the squeezing of Korra's fingers and the movement of her hand. When Korra finally unfurled her hand, the tiny black haired girl fell with a plop onto a soft but firm black surface. Before she could even get to her feet, Korra's fingers sprung into action, pinning her to the surface with gigantic strips of black tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? Where have you put me?\" Azula yelled angrily, not at all pleased at being restrained. She fought as hard as she could against the tape pinning her tiny arms and legs, but her twig sized appendages lacked the strength to accomplish anything. The tape may as well have been steel chains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, guess they didn't have motorcycles back in your day.\" Korra said, having forgotten how old Azula really is. \"Basically, you're taped down to a saddle, and you're gonna make a great butt cushion for my girlfriend.\" Korra said with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not go anywhere near anyone's butt!\" Azula shouted, futilely trying to assert her dominance over the Avatar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where you're wrong princess.\" Korra said. \"On the bright side, Asami has a fantastic ass. I think you'll really learn to enjoy it after a while. Though I should probably make sure you're comfy enough for her.\" Korra turned her back to Azula, presenting her own round rear end. She removed her fur lined apron, wanting to minimize the material between her ass and the shrunken fire princess. Then without another word, she swung her leg up and over the fire nation princess, bareing her tremendous ass for the fire nation princess to appreciate in all its terrifying glory. It hung threateningly above Azula for a moment, before forcefully crashing down onto the tiny girl like a tremendous boulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Azula, you make a really good cushion!\" Korra said, mocking the shrunken firebender. \"How would you like to have a permanent position as my seat? I could glue you down to Naga's saddle and you can come with me for every ride!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was certainly not excited about that prospect. Korra's weight was tremendous, and her ass cheek was currently enveloping her entire body. Azula's' face was buried in the fabric of Korra's soft blue pants, but she could feel the overwhelming heat of the Avatar's ass cheek radiating from just on the other side of the fabric. Korra's muscular glute was firm and unyielding, making her grateful for the minimum comfort provided by the padded seat. She was fortunate she had the good sense to turn her head to the side before Korra's ass came down, since this allowed her the privilege of being able to breathe. Had Korra's ass come down on her face, she'd be suffocating in the Avatar's ass flesh right now, which was just about the most shameful death she could imagine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, riding Naga gets a little bouncy. I'd have to make sure you are up to the task. You have to be able to take some hits.\" Korra said, preparing to have some fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula felt the crushing weight of the Avatar lift off of her, hoping she was going to free her from this torment. Instead though, Korra's ass just slammed down again, harder than before. Azula screamed out in pain, her shouting a tiny vibration on the Avatar's ass cheek that did little more than tickle the water tribe girl. Unfortunately, this just convinced Korra that Azula could take more punishment. And Korra was more than willing to dish it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula had to contend with strike after strike from the Avatar's muscular buttocks. She had not felt this rage at being unable to fight back since Katara had first chained and captured her after her Agni Kai with Zuko. But even then, she had not had to contend with a gigantic ass trying to squash her out of existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra giggled and prepared to give Azula another bounce, only to be startled by a voice from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything ok Korra?\" Asami asked, entering the room to find Korra bouncing her ass up and down atop her motorcycle seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Asami!\" Korra said, clearly startled by the intrusion. She had been pretty lost in her domination of Azula, and had forgotten to mind her surroundings. \"Yeah... uhh... Everything is fine! I'm just... thinking about getting myself one of these Sato cycles. Naga just can't fit through some of the skinny streets in the downtown area, so I need something more maneuverable for certain situations. So I was trying yours out to see how it felt, but the seat was a little lumpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lumpy? I don't remember the seat being lumpy.\" Asami said, crouchibg down to get a better look at the seat. She didn't notice the tiny fire princess taped to it though. Azula's outfit blended very well with the color of the seat, and her jet black hair along with the black tape Korra put over her mouth meant there wasn't very much to notice for someone who didn't already know where she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't see anything\" Asami muttered, though it was deafening to Azula at close range. While Asami didn't notice anything, Azula could see every detail of the gigantic machinist's face. Her pale skin and ruby red lips combined did make her face very beautiful, but Azula had no interest in finding out if this gigantic beauty had an ass to match her other features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Azula, this was most definitely the case. This became very clear as Ms. Sato withdrew her face, satisfied with the state of her seat, and turned her attention back to Korra. She paid no attention to her bike or its seat as she swung her leg over the bike, presenting her black leather clad ass to the tiny ex-ruler. She stood over her bike, her taut butt on fill display, chatting with Korra about this and that. Before finally, the words the began Azula's hell left Asami's lips: \"I've got some errands to run Korra. I'll be back in a few hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Asami lowered her ass down towards the seat, bringing the rounded posterior mere centimeters from her seat's tiny inhabitant. With her feet on the footrests, she remained crouched over the seat as she revved the bike's engines. Azula could feel the seat vibrating beneath her as the engine roared to life, blurring her vision as her entire body shook with the seat. She was confused by the unfamiliar technology, but she couldn't dwell on it for long, as before she knew it the bike shot forward and Asami allowed her ass to drop down onto the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instantly, Azula wished she was back under Korra's butt. First of all, the black leather pants Asami was wearing proved far less soft than Korra's water tribe garb, and every tiny shift of the giant girl's bottom scratched the rough fabric across the tiny princess's face. Second of all, there was the vibrations of the engine below her. While almost imperceptible to Asami, the slight shaking of the seat Azula was attached to meant that she was constantly rising up and down, being lightly pushed over and over again into the gigantic rump of the Avatar's girlfriend, her face rhytmically smacking against the gigantic buttock. Finally, there was the shame. Azula hated the Avatar with all of her being, but it was understood that the Avatar is the most powerful bender in existence, so losing to her was aggravating, but not entirely unexpected. Being pinned underneath the ass of a non-bender who did not even know she was there was truly shameful. This girl was dominating her without effort, without even a thought, and with only her shapely ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.... Korra was right. This seat is lumpy.\" Asami muttered, annoyed that one of her own products would cause her discomfort. \"Guess I'll need to have a talk with my factory manager about better quality assurance...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Azula, a perfectionist like Asami was not going to tolerate a lumpy seat, especially on her favorite bike. Asami had no intention of allowing the lump to continue to exist, and that meant flattening it under her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula gasped as the engineer's butt lifted off of her, hoping she'd arrived at her destination. Instead, Asami's ass hung only a half inch above her, just enough to give her a decent view, before crashing down with a thud again. And again. And again. Every strike felt as though a flying bison was landing on top of her. Each time she was newly surprised not to be a bloody stain on the cycle seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she didn't quite flatten it out, Asami decided she'd have to deal with it later, as clearly her bouncing was not enough to obliterate the imperfection. Azula breathed a tiny sigh of relief as the bouncing stopped, but she would soon have other issues to contend with. Asami rolled to a stop as she got stuck in the typical Republic City traffic. Accepting that she'll have to wait, she sighs in annoyance and leans back in her seat, allowing her full weight to settle onto Azula for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula is caught off guard by this, and is unprepared for the sudden wave of butt flesh that settles down onto her. She does not prepare herself accordingly, and has a result, as her face buried directly in the rich girl's ass cheek. Unlike Korra's incredibly muscular buttock, Asami's butt was more soft and yielding, allowing her butt flesh to flow and mold around the tiny girl on her seat, ensuring every side of Azula was surrounded with the overwhelming butt flesh of the Avatar's girlfriend. Azula's breaths were replaced with panicked gasps as she struggled to breathe beneath the endless expanse of Asami's ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this traffic wasn't moving at all, and it was a rather warm day. This made things slightly uncomfortable for Asami, who was stuck sitting in the hot sun in her typical all black outfit. She could feel the sweat forming on the back of her neck and running down her body, headed right for Azula's position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Azula, Asami's mild discomfort meant she was in a hellish sauna. Far from the comforting steam rooms in the hot springs of Ember Island, this felt more like she was being cooked alive between two hot plates. The black fabric of her pants and the black seat cushion both absorbed a lot of heat that they were all too happy to transfer to Azula's position. This caused Azula to sweat a good deal, but it was not her sweat she was worried about. Some of the sweat that had formed on Asami's back slid down its length and plopped down onto the seat. And unfortunately for Azula, while there was very little space to move under the giant ass, it was certainly not watertight. Sweat sealed in the space under her butt, starting at Azula's hair, and working its way down her body. At the same time, Asami's lack of movement and the high temperature conspired to cause sweat to start seeping through Asami's pants themselves. The fire bender was sure she was going to drown, but it was more like being waterboarded. Sweat constantly dripped onto her face, burning her eyes and covering her ability to breath through her nose. And all the while, Asami's enormous booty was pressing down, ensuring no air could stay in her lungs for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! What's the holdup!\" Asami shouted, annoyed about the ridiculous traffic jam in front of her. She had no idea how things got so bad, but the street was full of cabbages and there was an angry old man screaming at the driver in the front of the line of cars. Her yelling went unanswered as things considered unchanged, leaving her grumbling angrily to herself. As she did, she suddenly noticed the disturbance under her ass once again. Now she had something to take out her frustration on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, rather than trying to squish it down with bouncing, she decided to try and flatten the lump by grinding her ass across it. This was a new and horrible sensation for Azula, who was already doing everything she could to avoid drowning in sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asami slid her ass from side to side, Azula felt like she was being flattened out by a giant fleshy rolling pin. The massive cheek that had been abusing Azula since the moment Asami sat down always started one side of her, crushing only her closest arm and leg. This wasn't as bad as having the full weight of the industrial titan bearing down on her, but she was truly shocked at every moment that her arm and leg didn't snap like a twig under the giantess weight bearing down on them. As it rolled further across and covered her face, things only got worse. Asami's black leather pants may have been stylish, but the rough fabric chafed and cut across Azula's exposed skin with every slide, further diminishing the princess's cruel beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the grinding stopped, as the cabbage crisis on the street was resolved and Asami was able to get moving again. Of course, Azula never knew about the crisis. All she knew now was Asami's ass, and that it had mercifully decided to spare her further exacerbated suffering for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Azula's steely resolve began to waver under the giantess's sweaty ass, Azula felt the crushing weight of Asami lift off of her. She sucked in clean dry air for the first time in ages, barely remembering what it's like to have fully inflated lungs. She screamed in rage at what she had just experienced, but Korra's tape ensured her screams would go unheard and muffled. When she gave up on her attempts to scream, she just laid back in exhaustion, accepting that she was trapped at the whim of the giant Avatar for the foreseeable future. She swore that if she survived this, she would find a way to get back to normal size and have Korra and Asami shrunken down and made into a pair of sandals, so that they could spend the rest of their miserable lives with their faces pressed into her royal soles. As for the airbending brats, she decided that she was going to take another stab at the elimination of the Avatars that Fire Lord Sozin had almost accomplished, but this time, by eating them alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's blissful thoughts of tiny airbenders squirming down her throat were interrupted suddenly as Asami came back into view. Azula had been sure the torment was over, but she only now realized the terrible truth: they were only halfway done. Asami had just finished her errands, and now she had to head back to Air Temple Island. She did her best to squirm for Asami's attention, hoping she would look down at the seat, but Asami didn't notice anything at all as she allowed her still slightly sweaty butt to plop back down onto the bike seat, sealing Azula back in the darkness for a very similar experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Asami finally arrived back at home, Korra was there waiting for her a friendly wave and smile. She was happy to see her girlfriend of course, but she was even more excited to see what sort of state the tiny Fire Nation Princess was in. Asami hopped off her bike and gave Korra hug, forgetting all about her plan to deal with her lumpy seat. Korra took this opportunity to look over Asami's shoulder to see if she could make out Azula. She couldn't help but smile when she spotted her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Practically flattened against Asami's bike seat. <br>\r\n2. Stuck to Asami's ass, black tape blending in with her black leather pants.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amon, criminal leader of the terrorist group calling themselves the Equalists had been missing for a little over two days. With no sign of his body in the wreckage of his escape boat that his brother Tarlock had destroyed, the man formerly known as Noatak was presumed dead, his body most likely somewhere at the bottom of the ocean. What nobody realized was the fact that Amon had managed to save himself just before the explosion struck by using his father's psychic Bloodbending technique to toss his own body to safety. However he did not survive the explosion unscathed, the impact still managed to leave him unconscious with a rather unusual side effect taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmon's body drifted, following the ocean's current back towards Republic City for an unlikely reunion with a certain young girl. The waves carried his body for some time, death almost appearing imminent for the fugitive Bloodbender. However, fortune seemed to smile upon him, or laugh in his face as his body was washed ashore on the beach at Air Temple Island just outside the city limits. How cruel fate was to bring him to such a place, but still the worst had yet to be discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed and Amon's lifeless body rested on the sand until the tide came in, splashing him with a rather large wave and washing his body further up the beach. He regained consciousness for the first time in days, stumbling to his feet on top of the wet sand. He was still dazed and a little out of his wits after 2 days without food or fresh water to help him rehydrate. Still, he could immediately tell that something was off as he observed his surroundings. No doubt this was Air Temple Island but everything surrounding him was gigantic, even the sand surrounding him was large enough to pick up and hold in his hand like a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things couldn't get any worse Amon found himself standing in a dark shadow, shaped like a person. He turned and took a fighting position, ready to use what little power he had at his current size to defend himself. His heart sank as the figured was revealed to be none other than Avatar Korra herself, standing over the inch tall criminal, hands on her hips, glaring down at him as if he were a bug that had royally managed to piss her off. It was unclear how long she was standing there for, but Amon was willing to wager that it had been some time before he regained consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, look who finally decided to wake up! Not so big and tough now are you?\" Korra asked, belittling the enemy standing in front of her giant boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avatar, I...\" Was all Amon could muster before Korra stomped her boot into the sand not far from him, cutting him off from speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we all thought you were dead, but honestly this is so much better! You're gonna pay for all the innocent lives you ruined, starting with me!\" Korra proclaimed threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh yes, you're bending. What if I said I could restore you to your former glory, would you release me then?\" Amon asked, thinking he might be able to make some kind of a deal. Little did he realize on major flaw and miscalculation in his plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, you might wanna stick around for a while. I was thinking about having a barbeque, tell me. Would you prefer I cook you medium rare, or well done?\" Korra asked, Firebending a ball of fire into her open palm. Amon was taken back at first, he could have sworn he'd removed her abilities to bend anything but air. But he could hardly be surprised when it came to the Avatar, in only 2 days she'd managed to regain her bending which could only mean he was in bigger trouble than he originally thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you regained your bending Avatar, I'm impressed,\" Amon said, trying to maintain his composure. He couldn't allow the towering Avatar to see him sweat or it would be all over for him. He could try Bloodbending her, but he's never moved a mass equal to Korra's size before with his powers and if he failed he would only make her angrier with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What wrong, you look pretty nervous down there. Am I too BIG of an opponent for you? Maybe I should get Jinora or Ikki out here too deal with you? I'm sure they wouldn't have too much trouble stomping you out!\" Korra teased, though she wasn't exactly wrong. Korra was gigantic compared to him and though he hated to admit it his chances of survival would be far greater if he was fighting either of the two young Airbenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra wasted no time in bending over to grab Amon, her hand swooping down at lightning fast speeds and lifting the shrunken Bloodbender off the sand and under the gaze of her cold blue eyes. The dark skinned woman smiles evilly as she thought about all the possible ways that she could now torture and humiliate her tiny foe. Already having something special in mind she wished to do first, assigning him to a jail cell where he belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately for you, I want to keep a closer eye on you till I can determine whether or not you're still a threat. So I'm placing you under arrest, you'll be happy to know that you're jail time until we can make a cell small enough for you will be spent close to my person. Very close. In fact, you're gonna be a close as possible because I'm keeping you ____________ where I can keep an eye on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"Inside of my boot\"- Korra tells Amon that because he is now bug-sized he should get used to being stepped on, taking off her boot and dropping him inside so she can walk all over him. Taunting him with the fact that she'd just finished training before she found him, saying he shouldn't expect any pleasant smells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"Between my boobs\"- Korra pushes Amon into the depths of her cleavage, finally finding a use for her oversized breasts after all this time, as a prison cell. Completely entombed in flesh Amon struggles to even breath fresh air between Korra's enormous tits. But will his struggles grant him freedom or lead to something even worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"Stuck to Naga's saddle\" - Korra calls her loyal Polar Bear Dog to help punish Amon's for his past crimes, using a Sato Industries adhesive to stick Amon to her seat. Telling him she'll use the solvent on him if he survives the ride.</span></div></div>",

At your size, you'd get stomped on hundreds of times, maybe even thousands anyways throughout your pathetic life. At least in my boots, you'll have the honor of being under the Avatar's feet. Comforting them as my insole wherever I go, soaking up my foot sweat while I'm training, in fact, I'm sure you have all kinds of uses now that you're so small.\" Korra threatened, terrifying Amon as these threats rolled off her tongue mere minutes after finding him in his shrunken state. Almost like she'd been planning this out for weeks, or even months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 17-year-old girl's cold stare sent shivers down his spine, inspiring the same fear into the Equalist leader that once filled Korra's very being, only multiplied by a thousand. She could end him anytime she chooses, obliterating him from the face of the Earth in any number of ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified by this fact, he forgot to even object to his new holding cell under the Avatar's foot. Possibly even doing so in the effort of self-preservation as Korra slipped one foot behind the other, sliding her barefoot out of her boot to make way for the disgraced Bloodbender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arguments?\" Korra asked genuinely surprised, never imagining that she'd have Amon so outclassed, maybe he's snap out of it once he was underneath her foot. At least, that's what she thought to herself as she lowered her unceremoniously towards the ground, the scent of her feet built up over months rising to greet him halfway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench, however, wasn't nearly as bad as the heat emanating from below. Like being dangled over a furnace, but then again, it was hardly surprising for a girl who shot balls of fire from her feet. Amon's body reacted to the combination of heat and the smell, acting on impulses to try and escape. A smile appearing on Korra's face as she felt the inch tall man come to life between her fingertips, then effortlessly condemned him to her footwear with a flick of her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmon shot through the opening of her boot, rolling on top of the insole for a few feet before falling into a ridge. Upon standing up and getting his barrings, Amon discovered that he was centered in the imprint left behind by the Avatar's foot. He was standing where the ball of her foot would most likely rest, closer to the exit was a larger indentation caused by her heel, and in front of him were five smaller imprints left behind by her toes, each one either equal or larger than his body in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boot began to rumble as Korra's toes drummed on the outside, wanting to give Amon a heads up that she was about to put it back on with him inside. The light coming from outside was eclipsed by her foot as it crept towards him, effortlessly bulldozing him and knocking him to the ground. The young Avatar twisted her foot in a downward motion, pinning Amon between her toes and the ball of her foot for 'safe'keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, these are a lot more comfortable with you inside them Amon. You might have a real future as an insole.\" Korra teased, when in fact that was a promise. Amon was at the mercy of her toes. There was no escaping such a harsh reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled and kicked the best he could as she flexed her toes, clutching his face between her brown digits. But Korra only laughed as the vibrations from his voice tickled her skin, she couldn't quite make out what he was saying, but she could only assume it was a plea for mercy. Unfortunately, she was fresh out and ready to begin the real fun. Having Amon underfoot would certainly make her _______ more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Fire, Water, &amp; Earthbending practice- having mastered these elements, Korra continues to hone her skills. Making sure that they are put to good use torturing Amon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Airbending training- Korra meets with Ikki and Jinora for a lesson while Tenzin and Melo are visiting Katara, hoping to get a better handle on her new Airbending abilities. However, after seeing the girls in action, Korra decides to slip Amon into one of their flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Hangout with Asami- They were not dating at this time, so they are only good friends. Korra and Asami now hang out regularly and get along well since they have similar interests. Will torturing Amon become something else they share? That's up for Korra to decide(She does).</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now comes the Pokemon Series that in my opinion brought some life back to the Anime. Ash is finally Seventeen, growing up 7 years overnight because that's how puberty works. He meets up with a girl named Serena who he'd met before as a child, he also becomes friends with yet another Gym Leader named Clemont who is an inventor and his younger sister Bonnie. Other girls in the show are Shauna who is a friend and rival of Serena's as well as Korrina and Viola who are Gym Leader, and Viola's older sister Alexa who is a journalist. I'm sure you know enough about this Anime to jump right into it and if you don't it probably wouldn't take you too long to find out. Anyways lets see the first set of choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. While testing Clemont's new Battle Measuring Device in a battle between Ash and himself, Clemont's machine overloads and explodes causing both him and Ash to shrink with Bonnie and Serena nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Ash and Friends, Bonnie excluded(because I don't wanna shrink her) are all shrunk when a mischievous Pokemon crosses their path. While enroute to a Pokemon Center to get help Bonnie runs into Shauna who offers her assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the drill, option 3 is 'More Choices' please feel free to add some there.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, with Ash around it was only a matter of time before things took a turn for the worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu, use Volt Tackle!\" Ash yelled, leading his Pokemon partner to charge towards the robot while surrounded by a powerful electric field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Ash, I haven't programmed in defenses for a move that strong yet.\" Clemont tried to explain, but it was already too late as Pikachu used its speed to maneuver under the Robot's shield and attack it directly, causing Clemont to panic as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh, this is bad,\" Clemont told himself, realizing that the experimental battery he put in the robot was being charged by the electric mouse's assault before long it would explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine Spasming in an attempt to rid itself of the excess electricity, while Clemont and Ash rushed the control panel to disable it, Ash quickly yelling out to Pikachu \"Find Serena and Bonnie and bring them back here.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu quickly left, and the two tried to shut down the machine but to no avail. The display screen cracked, and the two hit the grass for cover before the big,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Bang*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Robot exploded as bits and pieces were flung all around the training grounds, releasing a negative magnetic field that affected all living things in its proximity. Of course, this included both Clemont and Ash who were opening their eyes to an entirely new landscape from the training field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were separated by about thirty or so feet, which they would soon come to realize was only about six inches. \"Whoa, where are we?\" Ash asked, surprised to see grass even taller than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's strange, but any number of possibilities could explain this. Here, let's compare notes and see what we can find out.\" Clemont announced, walking towards Ash before being interrupted by a powerful earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">*Boom, Boom,</font> <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Boom, Boom!*</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThundering tremors shook the very Earth beneath them, each shock stronger than the one that came before, quickly associating these quakes with a large pokemon such as Onyx.  However, the appearance of a large shadow over them suggested an even larger Pokemon was to blame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">*Boom!*</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quake with the most destructive force yet came to them in the form of a gigantic pink sandal, one Ash and Clemont recognized immediately. The giant sandal-clad foot, landing in the open space between them, nearly crushing them both. It was the same kind that Bonnie, Clemont's younger sister wore every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did my brother and Ash go?\" Boomed a familiar voice, the two looking up to confirm their suspicions that it was none other than Bonnie herself towering over them. But how was this possible? Had Clemont's machine turned her into a giant? A quick observation of the tree dwarfing Bonnie confirmed otherwise. They'd been shrunk, making them even smaller than Joltik(The smallest Pokemon).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while Clement was already finding it hard to comprehend the fact that he now had a two-hundred-seventy-five-foot tall sister another giant was already on her way to make them feel even smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">*Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!*</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second series of aftershocks followed the initial Earthquakes cause by Bonnie's stomping feet, though they were calmer and didn't occur as quickly. These belonged to none other than Serena who stopped behind Bonnie to take a look around \"Don't worry, I'm sure they're just fine, It's not like Clemont hasn't blown us all up before right?\" Serena joked, secretly worried about Ash. Pikachu was also behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea they were secretly next to Bonnie's foot, giving them a perfectly unobscured view of Bonnie's legging-clad butt and her own panties hidden from everyone but Ash and Clemont underneath her skirt. Although, despite their best efforts not to look up Serena's Skirt, it was nearly impossible due to her size and their current position. After all, she was close to four hundred feet tall through their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonnie, Serena! We're down here! Down here!\" Ash and Clemont yelled, jumping up and down near Bonnie's foot in the hope of drawing attention to themselves. Though it was difficult when they were smaller than even the tiniest of Bug Type Pokemon, so small that the grass surrounding them reached up to their necks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Bonnie looks down and sees Ash and Clemont by her feet, becoming excited and asking how they became so little and cute. Then convinces them through her size too let her keep them as her dolls until Clemont thinks of a way to reverse this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Serena points out something by Bonnie's feet and has the younger girl move before addressing Ash and Clemont herself, promising to keep them safe from the outside world for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Serena convinces Bonnie that they are most likely fine, suggesting they have a picnic to pass the time hoping Ash and Clemont will come back in time. Laying out a picnic blanket over them and laying down on it with Bonnie while the two boys try not to get smushed to death under the blanket. </span></div></div>",

They couldn't have been Pokemon, even Joltik weren't so tiny in size. \"Huh, Serena! Look quick, I found them, I found them!\" she cheered joyously, jumping up and down on her tippy toes, creating nothing short of a small Earthquake for the shrunken duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? I don't see them anywhere.\" Serena asked, spinning around to see that they were still alone, or so she thought. Her attention however quickly turned to Bonnie's feet, watching as two diminutive figures ran back and forth in fear of being stepped on in the midst of Bonnie's jumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonnie, calm down please! I can't keep this up for long!\" Clemont yelled, not believing his voice would reach the eight year old's ears over the sound of her own laughter. Luckily for Ash and Clemont, Serena soon came to the rescue, walking up behind Bonnie and gently holding her down to protect her shrunken friends first before wondering how they became so tiny in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Bonnie, now I understand you're excited. But please try and calm down, I'm sure we look really big from way down there and it could be dangerous for them if we accidentally step on them.\" Serena pointed out, standing over the boys behind Bonnie, allowing her to take the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right! I'll just pick them up so I don't accidentally hurt them.\" Bonnie announced, turning her attention down to her feet, grinning ear to ear as she lowered herself down to their level. \"Okay boys, try to stand still for me. Okay?\" Bonnie giggled, reaching down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Ash and Clemont yelled in unison, stiffening up at the sight of Bonnie's giant fingers, going against their own survival instincts, telling them too flee from the gigantic blonde girl. Her hand swiping across the dirt, scooping them both into the center of her palm with ease before lifting them up to level with her chest so she could look down at them from a closer vantage point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, you two are so cute at this size. Like teeny tiny little dolls!\" Bonnie cheered happily, holding up her opposite hand, fingers separated by about an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks Bonnie. But I hope that we're not gonna be like this for long?\" Ash replied, not liking the thought of being compared to dolls after the whole Sabrina affair in Saffron City during his original adventures throughout the Kanto region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, you're not? But I was looking forward to playing with you guys. Can't you stay tiny for just a few days?\" Bonnie asked, wanting to make them her personal playthings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on boys, can't you do it for Bonnie?\" Serena asked, doting on her like she was her big sister. \"I mean, can you even reverse what happened to you?\" trying to help Bonnie get her way, thinking she could force them into playing with Bonnie as a last resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, no. Not yet anyways, I'll need some time to figure out the specifics.\" answered Clemont, all but sealing their fate as Bonnie's playthings. The young blonde's face lighting up as he said these words, instinctively closing her hand into a fist around them and bouncing with glee. Meanwhile, Ash and Clemont rolled between her fingers like they were inside of a washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful now Bonnie, I'll let you play with them for now but you have to promise not to overdo it. Alright?\" Serena asked, leaving Ash and Clemont unable to object vocally while pounding against Bonnie's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course. Thank you Serena!\" she giggled, opening her hand into a flat surface for them to stand on. Giving them a view of Serena as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right over here if you need me.\" Serena called out, leaving the boys at Bonnie's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up they could see that she was smiling from ear to ear, considering all sorts of games she could play with them. Which one will she choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Bonnie says they must have been scared of her at first, comparing herself to a giant monster before saying that it would actually be fun to play as a giant monster, placing them back at her feet and chasing them through the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Bonnie removes her Mary Jane shoes and drops one of the boys inside each of them, telling them to climb on before she puts them back on, laughing at them as they struggle to climb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. You choose what she does next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a few weeks since the closing of the Dark Tournament and Yusuke's powers had yet to return, Botan certainly hadn't been any help as of late, and even Genkai was stumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced back into his normal life, Yusuke found it hard to cope with attending full days of school, easing his boredom with quick street brawls and video games at the local arcade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after school hours and Yusuke had fallen asleep at his desk during the final class of the day. The other students leaving without trying to wake him in fear of what he might do. Even the teachers left him to sleep, thinking he would wake up sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the students from after school activities remained, one of which was very upset with Yusuke as she stomped her way down the hall. Keiko Yukimura, the class representative of Sarayashiki Junior High School and Yusuke's oldest friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumb boy, hasn't matured at all since he was five years old. I bet he skipped class again, explains why I didn't see him at all passing through the school gate!\" Keiko yelled throughout the halls, believing that she was alone in this part of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice echoing loud enough to wake the sleeping Yusuke, rubbing his eyes at the same point Keiko stopped in front of the door to the classroom. Looking around to see the dimly lit classroom surrounding him, although something about the room bothered him even more than the fact that it was dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slid open and Keiko waltzed inside, lowering her bag to the floor and sealing herself inside before turning on the overhead lights. The bright bulbs shining down on Yusuke from above like several suns, shielding his eyes from the blinding light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I was right.\" Keiko announced, scanning the room to confirm that she was alone, or so she believed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke on the other hand, realized the opposite to be true to an extreme degree as his eyes adjusted to the light, Stunned by the sight of a skyscraper sized Keiko as she walked towards him, holding a book under her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the book on Yusuke's desk and seemed to daze off for a moment, internally monologuing her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was lost in thoughts, Yusuke made an attempt to gain her attention, standing up and waving his arms. He called her name dozens of times \"Keiko, I'm down here! It's me, Yusuke! Hey, earth to Keiko!\" he yelled, failing miserably to get her to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yusuke.\" She said to herself, overheard by Yusuke below as he realized himself to be at about thigh level with the gigantic girl. After shrinking his body must have still been on top of the seat he fell asleep on, meaning that Keiko was about to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, crap!\" Yusuke realized, turning to see Keiko's large white panties dominating his vision. Giving him a much better look at her underwear than he'd ever had in the past. She'd chosen his desk as the seat for her rear, and Yusuke's roll in all this was merely to provide extra cushion for the teenage girl's posterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to run, but Keiko dropped faster than even Hiei could move, obviously losing a great deal of his supernatural speed along with his size. He was defenseless, falling onto his back in the final moments before, THUMP, Keiko's body landed on the seat with enough force to make the chair slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly question is where did she land?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. With Yusuke trapped under one of her butt-cheeks, giving him the benefit of being easily noticed. His upper body caught under her exposed butt flesh, screaming into her cheeks until she notices him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. With Yusuke trapped between her butt-cheeks, the fabric of her underwear stopping him from being noticed by the giant girl. Being drawn into her butt-crack along with her panties at the center of her wedgie. Allowing Keiko to take him home unknowingly when she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. With Yusuke laying down between her thighs, looking up at her panty clad crotch and unable to see Keiko's face passed the flap of her skirt, meaning Yusuke will have to find some way of getting her to notice him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Keiko\u2019s giant body came right down, Yusuke was scared to death. How could he not really, as he was about to get hit by a force even greater than Toguro\u2019s strongest punch. Keiko was so huge, and her ass was even bigger than his appartment. Yusuke could do literally nothing as it came down right onto him. He braced himself for the rough impact he was going to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact from the hit sending Yusuke off his fleeing feet, falling down onto his stomach as he braced himself, thinking it would continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it did not, as Yusuke felt no pressure on him what so ever. Well that was not entirely, true as he felt a blanket like fabric on his back. It was holding him down, but he could still move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh what the hell.\u201d Yusuke said as he tried to figure out what is happening. \u201cWell at least i\u2019m still alive. But, what the hell is this thing on top of me?\u201d He said spinning around onto his back, feeling the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy for Yusuke to figure out what it really was. It was Keiko\u2019s school skirt. He has lifted it so much that even at this size, he knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo pressure and under the skirt, he thinks he knows where he is. Right between her thighs in her open legs. He wore a smile as he could see the exit not so far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got moving, getting away and out of the skirt. He was crawling across the wood, but he has been through so much worse then a giant splinter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got out of the skirt, he rolled around once again and looked up, seeing the giant tower that was Keiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw her giant thighs on either side of him, as Yusuke couldn\u2019t help but stare at them. Up over the skirt was Keiko\u2019s giant body, still in a daze and thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke got up onto his feet and cupped his hands around. \u201cKeiko!!!! Down here Keiko!!! You can\u2019t be that dense are you!!!\u201d he shouted to her. It may be a bit rude, but he is understandably a bit angry. On the other side, it\u2019s kind of his fun with Keiko. Once he saw no reaction he frowned. Putting his hand to his chin and thinking. \u201cJust great, now what the hell am I going to do?\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke tried to figure it out. So many ideas running through his mind about what he is going to do. Climbing her body? Yusuke sure was stubborn enough but that seems like more of a last choice rather than the first. Another idea was firing a Spirit Gun at her, like a beacon. However he quickly got reminded that was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw come on! This can\u2019t be real!\u201d Yusuke said, spinning and complaining. Right in front of Keiko. \u201cAm I just going to be little forever! Keiko! Seriously pay attention!\u201d He shouted, seeing no reaction. He got angry, but calmed as he saw something right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least it will get her attention.\u201d She said with a massive smirk. Walking over and forward onto the skirt. Where was he going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiko\u2019s panties. At the front, it was in pure sight for Yusuke and he knew what he was going to have to do. Keiko sure will be pissed at him, but then again he\u2019s use to it. Plus he knows he can trust Keiko. She\u2019s admittedly the only person he was close to. Even more than Kuwabara. He trusts her, and he knows she will forgive him for doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe after a sort moment of angry Keiko. That\u2019s what he was really expecting. No doubt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved up close to the giant white wall, knowing what was on the other side. Yusuke has perved on Keiko\u2019s panties more times then she would admit, although he\u2019s never been this close that was for sure. He could see nothing inside of the skirt, nothing but Keiko\u2019s panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant cave around him shifting and moving with every little twitch that Keiko does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke took a step back and closed his fist. \u201cNotice me!!\u201d He shouted, driving his fist right into her privates. Punching not as hard as he can, but hard enough for Keiko to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Keiko up above, she was relaxing and thinking about what she is going to do with Yusuke. She knows he\u2019s a busy person, she watched the tournament and saw the fight and danger he was in. But still Keiko is sure he needs to focus on his life. Focus on improving himself and thinking about his future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what she should do, or what her friends tell her to do. She does care for Yusuke. More than anyone else really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem is, Keiko is pretty sure she would have to tie Yusuke down just to get him to study. She just cares about Yusuke, no doubt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt something that made her yelp. \u201cEhp!!\u201d She said, moving her ass more back into the seat and panicking for a bit. A massive blush on her face as she knew what she was really feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Something touched her right in the privates. This made her panic and freak out a bit as she didn\u2019t know what that really was. Was there something down there, or was it just her imagination. Good thing she was by herself so no one could see her embarrassed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Yusuke was looking out and listening. It would seem that she didn\u2019t reach down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made him turn around again. \u201cKeiko, if you just noticed the first time. I wouldn\u2019t have to do this!\u201d He shouted, moving his hand around and punching it around. He pushed hard with his fist as he made sure this punch was stronger. Not one he would throw at demons, but maybe one to show them who was boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028She yelped again as Yusuke turned. Seeing that ______________</span></div></div>",

Still Pan couldn\u2019t shake the worry that Goku wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to defeat the next foe they encountered, sure he had Super Saiyan 4 now. But even that was barely enough to foil Baby\u2019s plot against the few remaining Saiyans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had too do something to help her grandfather get stronger, knowing she couldn\u2019t ask shenron to return Goku to normal she developed a plan that would help him get stronger. First she gathered the Earth\u2019s seven Dragon Balls atop the Lookout Tower where Goku was training inside of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Of course she couldn\u2019t join him just yet because she was too weak to help him improve, for now anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided that if she couldn\u2019t make Goku stronger, then she\u2019d just have to make him weaker temporarily so she\u2019d be strong enough to help him with his training. The twelve year old quarter Saiyan placed each of the orange orbs within a few inches of each other on the ground and summoned the Namekian dragon Shenron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome Shenron, come so you may grant my wish!\u201d Pan exclaimed, following this the sky turned pitch black as clouds filled the sky. Immediately after the Dragon Balls began to glow, illuminating the surrounding area. Then with a flash of lightning the dragon appeared over Pan in the sky, his tail extending from the center of the Dragon Balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Shenron, I shall grant you any wish your heart desires. Now speak!\u201d The green dragon demanded, prompting Pan to make up her mind. Not that it took very long, she knew exactly how she planned to make Goku weaker than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to take the Saiyan Goku and shrink him down to the size of a bug! I need him to be smaller and weaker than he is now so I can train him.\u201d Pan demanded, picturing the ideal size for Goku\u2019s training to be somewhere between ant size and the size of her pinky toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, it shall be done.\u201d Shenron announced, his eyes glowing as he granted Pan\u2019s wish. In the moment of silence Goku was inside the Hyperbolic Time chamber being shrunk down to the size Pan desired. First he went from being an adult to a little kid, now he was going to get a whole lot smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour wish has been granted, farewell.\u201d Shenron said before returning to the seven Dragon Balls, each of which started floated a feet feet above the tiled floor of the lookout before flying off in different directions. And with that the sky cleared and returned to its usual shade of blue. However this was only the start of Goku\u2019s troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Shenron gone Pan was eager to get inside the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and see firsthand how tiny Goku had become. True her interest wasn\u2019t solefully on training him, she had the feeling that this was gonna be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber Goku was clueless as to what had just happened, the whole world was like an endless void. Only the entrance/exit had any detail to it, So focused on his own training Gku remained completely oblivious to the fact that his body had been reduced to a mere fraction of its original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he realize what a big surprise he was in for as Pan snuck her way into the pocket dimension, she was careful to watch her step as she walked forward, not wanting to step of Goku accidentally. \u201cNow where is he? I should have had Shenron teleport him into my hand.\u201d Pan said to herself, scanning the floor until her keen eyes noticed a little orange dot on the white tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha.\u201d Pan whispered to herself, holding back a fit of giggles as she realized how tiny goku actually looked. Maybe she should have had Shenron make him doll sized? She was probably taller than a skyscraper from his point of view. \u201cOh well, what\u2019s done is done.\u201d she told herself, walking over to where Goku was so she could introduce him to the new and bigger version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground quaked under Pan\u2019s feet as she stepped out into the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, her body weighed down by the intense gravity of the pocket dimension, approximately 10 times more powerful than earth\u2019s normal gravitational pull. This caused vibrations to be sent throughout the tiled floor where they were quickly detected by Goku, however as he turned to investigate the source all he could do was stutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPa-pa-pa-Pan!\u201d was all the shrunken saiyan could say as he found himself looking up at a three hundred fifty foot tall version of his granddaughter. She was absolutely enormous, large enough to hold any saiyan in their primitive ape form like a stuffed animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I hope you don\u2019t mind. But I took the liberty of asking Shenron to shrink you for some special training.\u201d Pan explained, placing her hands on her hips as she bent forward to look down on Goku from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecial training?\u201d Goku asked, wondering what type of training had in store. Was it only combat training or had she developed Ideas for other areas like strength training or speed training. With the immense size difference between the two, the possibilities for what Pan in store for Goku were endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019ve made it my job to help make you even stronger. That\u2019s why I had to shrink you, to help make me stronger by comparison for the duration of your training.\u201d Pan explained, looking down on Goku from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I think that as your trainer I should first establish your strengths and weaknesses in battle. That\u2019s why we\u2019re gonna have a sparring match.

The shrunken Goku followed his paradoxically-aged granddaughter's cue and got ready to fight. Both knew what the outcome was likely going to be, especially with Pan promising not to hold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" Pan shouted, enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the onset, Pan showed that she wasn't holding back. Moving with inhuman speed, she simply appeared in front of Goku and brought her fist down where she stood. Had Goku not been a skilled fighter with years of experience, he would have been planted in the ground beneath the black haired girl's knuckles. Instead he managed to leap back out of the way. Of course, Pan was also a skilled fighter and with her size advantage, she would be keeping Goku on the defensive for much of the battle. She swiftly lifted her hand of the ground and followed up with trying to stomp on Goku with her right foot. Goku managed to dodge to the left, avoiding being splattered like a bug, only thanks to his supernatural agility. Unfortunately, his movement put him in position for Pan's next attack, a stomp from her left foot. Goku leaped back as Pan's blue sneaker shook the earth and sent up a cloud of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving avoided Pan's relentless attacks on the ground, Goku took to the air, hoping she would have more difficulty striking him. Pan threw down another punch at the spot where Goku had taken off from, barely missing the bug-sized Saiyan. Goku finally found an opportunity to counter against Pan's brutal assault and fired several Ki blasts at Pan's arm as he flew up. Pan bit her lip angrily as she felt the sting of each burst, bringing with it pain on pair with maybe a bee sting. She wanted to get revenge for the three burn marks on her arm, even if they were tiny specks. Unfortunately, the last punch had put her off balance, so Pan went for an unorthodox attack. Throwing her weight backwards, she lifted her spread legs up to be level with the fleeing airborne Goku, then, she swiftly slammed them together. Goku was surprised when he suddenly saw two walls of lavender, comprising his granddaughter's pants covered thighs coming at him from either side. Goku flew as fast as he could and barely made it out without being scissored between the preteen's legs. He felt a gust of air from behind as the girl's legs smacked together, followed by a crash as Pan landed on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow,\" Pan groaned as she sat up, rubbing her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku finally saw a chance to go on the offensive. He held his hands back and began focusing Ki. If his regular blasts of energy only stung Pan, he'd need something stronger if he hoped to win this fight. Although at Pan's size, Goku realized not a lot of his attacks would seriously injure her, but maybe that was for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ka-me.....ha-me....\" Goku began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get to finish the attack as Pan suddenly flew up into him, having quickly recovered from her fall. The shrunken full-blooded Saiyan's concentration was quickly ruined as he was slammed against the preteen quarter-Saiyan's chest. The attack still wasn't done though as Goku saw the shadow of Pan's arms. They wrapped around her chest, as if giving herself a hug and Goku was forced face-first into the soft mounds beneath Pan's red crop top. Pan continued the attack by pulling her knees up, curling up in a ball with Goku squeezed at the very center between Pan's smooth arms and small breasts, which were barely noticeable at normal size. Goku gasped for air as Pan squeezed on him hard from all sides. Goku struggled to escape before he was knocked unconscious by the pressure, but in this state he was completely helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Goku was never one to give up. He realized that in the heat of the fight, he had forgotten one of his ultimate techniques. One that would hopefully even out the fight. He reached down deep, focusing himself even in Pan's crushing grasp, trying to bring forth his Super Saiyan form. Unfortunately, there was something that Goku hadn't realized, a side effect to the Dragonball. They had completely disabled his Saiyan ability to achieve the Super Saiyan form. Goku only realized his inability to transform after a few tries, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Gramps? Am I too much?\" Pan giggled as she pulled herself tighter together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku still needed more strength to break free and if he wasn't going to get out with his Super Saiyan form, he'd use something else. Thinking back, Goku suddenly recalled a technique which would work. It was one he hadn't used in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaio-ken!\" Goku shouted, causing his Ki to suddenly multiple in intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaio.....what?\" Pan questioned in response, confused due to having never seen her grandfather use that technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan was caught off guard as Goku suddenly managed to break free of her almost unbreakable grip. She hadn't known what to expect from the attack and in the split second that it lasted, Goku had managed to capitalize on that. The tiny Saiyan flew backwards once he was freed, putting some distance between himself at Pan, who had fallen to the ground after being knocked off balance. Panting, Goku felt his entire body flare up in pain. He realized now why he had long since retired the technique. He pushed through the pain though and raised his hands up in the air to prepare the Spirit Bomb as his next attack. He closed his eyes to focus the necessary energy for his attack....this turned out to be a big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hip Slam!\" Pan yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku opened his eyes just to see Pan's shapely, denim-clad butt filling up his vision. The young Saiyan girl had once again taken to the air and, upon announcing her attack, Goku was hit by the girl's behind. She flew backwards until she slammed into a stone wall with enough force to crack it. Goku let out a gasp of pain, he knew he must've broken at least one bone from that. He struggled to escape, but found himself pinned between the wall behind and Pan's two rounded cheeks. He was too weakened to use Kaio-ken and he wasn't strong enough on his own to push the two fleshy mountains apart. To add insult to injury, Pan seemed to enjoy watching Goku struggle from over her shoulder. Whenever he'd stop trying to break free, she'd clench her glutes, painfully squeezing her shrunken ancestor between the rounded mounds of fat and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Looks like I win!\" Pan excitedly announced, \"All thanks to my buns of steel,\" she added, giving her ass a firm smack to punctuate the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku hoped she would let him lose soon, but she seemed to have no intention of doing so. She continued to lean comfortably against the wall with Goku wedged in her crack, occasionally squeezing him. She smiled, enjoying the sensation she got from dominating the world's strongest fighter with her rear. Still, it would have to end soon enough, she realized as she tried to devise a suitable punishment for Goku's lose. She thought back through the fight, trying to judge how well, or more likely how badly, he did against her. In the end, she came to the conclusion that Goku had fought _____.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious, no matter what, that Goku had lost. The only question was, how badly did Pan think he fought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Surprisingly well (Pan thinks that Goku did well against her considering that this was his first fight at one inch tall. However, she goes on to say that he could improve his abilities through training and suggest a new workout routine as her insole.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Terrible (Pan decides that Goku's fighting was so bad that she\u2019ll need to punish him somehow so he applies himself more in the future, electing to drop him inside the back of her panties so he can spend some quality time with her giant ass.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Not bad, but not great either (Pan decides that Goku will have to prove himself against an opponent closer to his own size, tossing him inside her mouth to fight against her giant tongue.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That was utterly pathetic! I mean look at you, I can't believe someone so strong would allow himself to lose against a young girl's butt.\" Pan blushed, pushing her round posterior harder against the wall to emphasize her point. Her robust cheeks encompassed Goku's tiny body to such an extent that he'd become completely engulfed by her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, guess it couldn't be helped, my butt's just too big and powerful for you now.\" Pan continued teasing, enjoying her easy won victory over the Earth's mightiest fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna have my work cut out for me training you, I didn't even break a sweat in our fight. Though you did surprise me with that one move, it was still nothing I couldn't handle.\" Pan said proudly, confident in her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lmnnett oftt Pnnnn!\" Goku yelled in response, his words like his entire body were muted and suppressed by Pan's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? You want to start your training right now?\" Pan laughed, putting words in Goku's mouth. In her defense, it was hard to hear him through her self-proclaimed 'Buns of Steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I guess I could start training you now. But, you have to agree to do everything I say. Also, you're going to stay that tiny until you've completed your training!\" Pan yelled, pretending to take her position as Goku's new master seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pnnnnn nnnnn!\" Goku yelled, his screams indicating that he wanted no part of Pan's unique brand of training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a yes to me!\" Pan cheered happily, planting her rear cheeks even more firmly against the stone wall. Meanwhile, Goku tried his best to fight back against the onslaught of incoming butt flesh, enhanced by Pan's Denim jeans. If his body hadn't endured grueling training in the past, then he would have been torn to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how should I go about training you? A real mentor would access her student's weak points and help him overcome them. So, I'll do the same.\" Pan announced proudly, looking back over her shoulder. It was hard to believe Goku was actually behind her butt. She couldn't see or hear him at all. In fact, she could hardly feel him punching her giant butt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you struggled with my butt most during our match. And, I don't think you're breaking free on your own anytime soon. So, we'll start there.\" Pan decided, pulling her weight back to retrieve Goku for his first stage of training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started by grabbing Goku from the space between her butt and the wall, finally allowing him to have some breathing room. Next, she decided to explain how the first stage of Goku's training was going to work. \"Before we start I need you to remember, this isn't just training. It's a punishment for losing our fight, think of it as an incentive to do better in the future. You're going to be training with my giant butt while I get warmed up, which means you'll be spending some more quality time down there with my big butt-cheeks.\" Pan stated, ready to put her plans in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started by unbuttoning her jeans, just enough so that she could pull them down to her thighs if need be. But the real purpose this served was to create a pathway for Goku to enter through. Pan grabbed the back of her jeans, coupled with her purple panties and peeled them away from her skin. Exposing her bare ass-cheeks in all their naked glory, each cheek about as big as the spaceship Goku traveled to Planet Namek on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't get lost down there, I don't wanna have to fish you out later.\" Pan said, already scolding Goku before the training even began. With only one hand to work with Pan rearranged her fingers so that Goku was caught wedged between her thumb and pointer fingers. She then moved her hand into position and tossed Goku down the back of her panties. Unable to fly or correct his course Goku landed first on Pan's left butt-cheek, bouncing off the doughy surface and crashing face first into its right counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with Goku's position, Pan released her grip and allowed her pants and underwear to carry Goku between her butt-cheeks. Next, Pan focused on buttoning her jeans, securing them around her waist with Goku still trapped inside. Meanwhile, Goku's surroundings got tighter and tighter with each passing moment as Pan's cheeks were squeezed tightly together by the fabric of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, you kinda tickle wiggling around down there between my butt-cheeks. Better watch your step or I might just have to sit on you again to teach you a lesson.\" Pan teased, making light of Goku's situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Pan wasn't done just yet. In fact, she was just getting started. There was no end to the ideas she could come up with for training Goku, surviving between her enormous ass cheeks was merely the tip of the iceberg. But first, she had to get Goku acclimated to his new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first step in achieving this goal this was child's play, at least for Pan that is. All it entailed was her walking around, getting Goku used to the swaying motions of her hips. However, while this scene would look innocent enough to anyone watching, Goku was actually being assaulted by Pan's doughy rear. The massive mounds of flesh saw Goku as nothing more than an obstacle in their path, seeking to eliminate him with no feelings of remorse. With no way to predict how Pan's flesh would attack him, Goku was left defenseless. Forced to endure the hits until Pan's body came to a standstill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step Pan took to achieve her goal required more effort on her part, bending down to touch her toes while also keeping her cheeks clenched tightly around Goku. This allowed Pan to find out how much pressure was necessary to keep Goku in place, so she wouldn't accidentally hurt or crush him later in his training. During this exchange, Goku felt as if his body was being processed inside a taffy puller. Pan's cheeks would extend out from the rest of her body, providing Goku with a brief moment of freedom before Pan decided to clench her glutes around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this process would also often end with Goku switching directions. Changing which of Pan's rear cheeks he was stuck to. Sometimes he'd end up stuck face first to her right butt-cheek, or facing the other direction with his back facing Pan's cheek. This frequently led to him being slammed either from the front or the back by Pan's boulder-sized ass-cheeks as they seemed to fight over him. Pan continued doing this for a count of ten times before deciding Goku was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I've finished warming up we can start your training. Now I hope you're listening down there cause I'm only gonna explain this once. Your goal is to survive between my butt-cheeks. If you can get out of my panties and onto the ground, you win and advance to the next stage of your training. If you can't, then you'll fail your training and I'll have to punish you even more. But if you can't handle it and pass out. Well, let's just say you're better off not knowing what I'll do.\" Pan announced, giving Goku three scenarios where only one was favorable to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that we've got that out of the way I think I'll tell you the exercises I'll be doing so you'll have a better chance of escaping on your own. I'll be starting with a 5-minute jog, the increased gravity inside the hyperbolic time chamber should help me increase my heartbeat. Next, I'll be sitting down for 10 crunches, followed by 10 squats, and rounded out by 10 lunges. I need you to remember that this isn't a workout for me, its an exercise to improve your abilities. Whether or not you pass is entirely up to you. Now, let's get started.\" Pan giggled, her tone suggesting that she was excited about her upcoming mini workout. Probably because it allowed her the opportunity to feel Goku struggle against her giant butt in a variety of different ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Goku can't escape during Pan's jog but manages to break free of her ass before she sits down for crunches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Goku becomes further wedged in Pan's cheeks and is unable to escape after Pan clenches her cheeks around his legs, refusing to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Goku passes out during one of Pan's exercises, waking up to find himself either in Pan's bedroom or some other location waiting to receive a harsh punishment.</span></div></div>",

However, something was seriously wrong because nothing was the proper size. Instead, everything surrounding them was gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goku, we've been shrunk.\" Trunks realized, coming to the obvious conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure someone didn't just make the ship larger?\" Goku asked, childishly amused by how big everything was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good! We need to find a way to get back to normal. But first, we have too...\" Trunks trailed off as he realized one of them was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where's Pan?\" He asked, his answer appearing in the form of a loud bang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Boom*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook behind them, cause both the shrunken Saiyan and Saiyan Hybrid to turn their heads in shock. Their eyes meeting with the familiar sight of one of Pan's purple and black boots, except it had also become gigantic compared to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks hoped that this didn't mean what he thought it did, craning his neck upwards to the see a planet-sized version of Pan smiling down at them. She was massive, towering over them as if they were ant's compared to here which according to Trunk's estimation they practically were at only about a centimeter tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/39900000/Pan-dragon-ball-z-gt-39987426-3648-4800.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/3...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi boys, did you have a good nap?\" She asked, playing off her size as if nothing was wrong. Although, it was hard for her to keep a straight face when while she was talking to her two bug-sized companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Pan's huge!\" Goku yelled, surprised by her impressive size enhancement. Still believing that the ship might have grown, and her along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pan, what's going on here? What did you do to us\u203d\" Trunks yelled, not exactly thrilled to be looking up at the ten-year-old quarter Saiyan girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well I might have borrowed this from your mom's study before we left.\" Pan teased, pointing to her wrist at a device that Goku quickly recognized as Bulma's Micro Band. A wristwatch she created that allowed the user to shrink themselves down to a fraction of their height. However, over the years Bulma had perfected the process to shrink other people and even make them smaller than the original product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pan, how could you be so reckless? Unshrink now before somebody gets hurt!\" Trunks argued, his voice hardly audible to the eight hundred foot tall tomboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I? I'm tired of being the only girl on this ship and getting no respect!\" Pan's voice boomed, silencing Trunks' outcry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe being the size of ants for a few days or maybe even a week will give you some perspective on how to treat a lady,\" Pan announced, beginning to crack a smile again as she imagined how much fun she'd be having during that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding on a show of force to demonstrate her seriousness, Pan lifted her foot over Trunks and Goku, pausing for a few moments so they could get a good look at the underside of her sneaker. Then in a quick motion brought her foot down with a powerful stomp. Enjoying the view as she watched them scurry like cockroaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Boom*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do see how strong I am?\" Pan asked in a cheerful tone, giggling as she leaned forward to get a better look at them. \"Of course if you two tough guys think you can overpower me and take this back by force why then, by all means, why don't you give it a try?\" Pan smirked, pointing to her watch. Hoping they would accept her challenge, so she had an excuse to demonstrate her real power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pan, this is ridiculous! We're not going to fight you!\" Trunks yelled, knowing full well that he couldn't overpower Pan by himself, even with Goku the odds weren't in their favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, does that mean you give up? Huh, tiny?\" Pan teased, not backing down from her challenge even a little. \"Either fight me or become my new playthings for as long as I want, what will it be?\" Pan said, demanding a final answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Trunks' response be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>1. Trunks choose to accept Pan's challenge, both of them trying to attack Pan with low chances of success. With so many different ways to assert herself, how will Pan choose to defeat them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Trunks backed down, and Pan announces her first plans for Trunks and Goku. Stuffing them into her sneakers to serve as insoles while she goes for a walk on a planet to look for the next Black Stared Dragonball. Unfortunately for them, it's a hot desert planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Trunks turned down the challenge. Pan says that she thinks it's about time she learned how to fly the ship, suggesting that Goku and Trunks help her out by monitoring her piloting skills from on top of her seat.</i></span></div></div>",

I'm really excited for this to be started up in the series and will make the first addition to the chapters following this one shortly. Naruto follows the story of a blonde haired orphan who has a powerful demon sealed inside of his body, for this fact most of the Hidden Leaf Villages ninja and citizens dislike Naruto. Still he strives to become a great ninja by any means and become the leader of his village so all those people will respect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the story, who will shrink and how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Naruto shrinks himself by accident after stealing a scroll from the Hokage's Mansion and performing the 'Shrinking Jutsu' on himself. He is soon after found by Hinata who was watching him from a distance and saw everything, she decides it would be best to bring him either to Lady Tsunade or the Hyuga Family Estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sakura Haruno learns the 'Shrinking Jutsu' from Lady Tsunade shortly after starting to train with her, she then decides to practice this skill by shrinking her rival Ino Yamanaka down the the size of a bug at her feet. Now Ino's only hope of ever getting back to normal rest in Sakura's hands since the Jutsu can only be undone by the caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't like these two scenarios? You can always add more on the next chapter 'More Scenarios'.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Naruto, get back here this instant!\" yelled the Leaf Village Chunin as they chased after Naruto Uzumaki, who had stolen a scroll from Lady Tsunade's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto jumped from treetop to treetop, skillfully evading capture from his pursuers before taking a sharp left after disappearing from their line of sight. He then jumped from the top of a tree onto a clearing in the forest \"Haha finally lost them.\" Naruto said, taking the scroll out of his pocket. However Naruto didn't realize that he wasn't completely alone, watching him from a distance was Hinata Hyuga. Another young Genin who was one of his classmates back at the academy and one of the nine rookies that participated in the Chunin Exams. She had a crush on Naruto and would always watch him train at a distance when she wasn't out with her own team on a mission or training with Neji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get started. I'll master this jutsu in no time, believe it!\" Naruto said confidently, opening the scroll and reading the hand signs off the paper. However, the text was smeared enough that he couldn't read the name of the Jutsu itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I think I got this.\" Naruto said in a self assured manner, if he could master a Jonin level technique like the Shadow Clone Jutsu than he could master this as well. Naruto took the stance displayed on the scoll and made the following hand signs \"Ox, Boar, Monkey, Rat.\" infusing his chakra to activate the jutsu. Suddenly a large fog cloud appeared around Naruto, was this the jutsu he'd worked so hard to get? Some kind of Smokescreen Trap Jutsu, it might not be powerful but at the same time Naruto realized this could be a useful tool during battles. However Hinata still watching from a distance with her Byakugan saw this Jutsu for what it really was and moved in to help Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the smoke cleared and Naruto also realized that the Jutsu wasn't what he originally thought. In truth didn't summon a smokescreen at all, it was a byproduct of the actually effects of the Shrinking Jutsu. Naruto realized this too late as he looked at how drastically his surrounding had changed in a few short moments, placing himself at about only an inch tall. Everything around him was gigantic, which also only could have meant that everyone back in the village was gigantic as well. Horrified by the thought of Sakura or Lady Tsunade finding him like this and punishing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na, Naruto.\" A shy voice called, as Hinata entered the clearing. She was was absolutely ginormous from Naruto point of view, stretching up taller than any of the buildings in the Hidden Leaf Village. The distance between him on the ground in front of her sandal clad and her face rivaling that of the range between the great stone faces and the village below. \"What's Hinata doing here?\" Naruto asked himself, finding it strange that she would be so close by to where he'd shrunk himself. Still he was glad to be found so quickly before some wild animal or bug made a meal out of him, now Hinata could help him get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up Hinata, can you help me?\" Naturo asked, causing Hinata to blush as she got down on one knee to get a closer look at her inch tall crush. She deactivated her Byakugan, finding it difficult to see him clearly. She was surprised at first by how small the Shrinking Jutsu had made him, definitely smaller than most if not all of Shino's bugs. Hinata then realized that she'd have to be extra careful if she didn't want to accidentally crush Naruto like one of Shino's bugs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yes, hold on ju-just one moment.\" Hinata said nervously thinking she had to be carefully about this. She couldn't keep Naruto in her ninja tool bag, too many sharp objects. And she couldn't very well carry him around for all the villagers to see, she knew of his dream to become Hokage and doubted that any of the villagers would ever respect him if they learned he shrunk himself accidentally to be carried around. That left her with only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So-Sorry about this Naruto.\" Hinata said timidly reaching towards Naruto, however she wasn't reaching to pick him up. Instead she positioned her fingers behind the shrunken Genin and pushed him forward into her toes, right between her big and second toes deep enough that he couldn't be seen. Naruto tried to fight back of course not realizing the reason for Hinata's actions but at her current size she was simply too strong to overpower, even though she was still trying to be gentle with him. Naruto's surroundings became very dark, accompanied by the odor of Hinata's feet which was only overpowered by the aroma of perfume. Aside from the fact that she was currently sweating being between Hinata's toes wasn't all bad, but it still wasn't the first place Naruto thought he'd end up when he got out of bed this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Hinata go next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Hinata walks to the Hokage's Mansion to see if Lady Tsunade can reverse the effects of the Shrinking Jutsu. But first she feels as if Naruto needs to learn some kind of lesson first, deciding that he is the perfect size to receive her harshest punishmentsd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Hinata thinks of this as the perfect opportunity to tell Naruto about her feelings for him and brings him back to the Hyuga Family Estate with the plans to do so. But can she bring herself to do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. While she's walking Hinata's toes become sweaty, causing Naruto to slip out from between them. Leaving Naruto to be discovered by the next person passing through, his teammate Sakura.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't believe her crush was so tiny, or wedged between her toes, or asking her for help. She didn't know what to do or how to help him. Even at his miniscule size, Naruto could feel the effects of the shy Genin's nervousness. The heavy blush that seemed to radiate down the girl's entire body was making her toes notable warm, and to top it off she had also broken out in a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is she sweating so much?\" Naruto asked himself rhetorically as a drop the salty liquid splashed across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he wasn't so focused on gagging at the taste of Hinata's sweat, Naruto may have noticed that with each step he was slowly slipping out of her grasp. Unfortunately, he didn't notice the side effect of the slick sweat until it was too late. As Hinata took yet another step forward, he was catapulted through the air, no longer surrounded by the hot embrace of the Hyuuga girl's foot and instead met with the whistle of wind rushing past him. Naruto hit the dusty earth hard, eliciting a groan from his tired body. Looking up to the sky, he swiftly saw it replaced with the blue treads of Hinata's sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he even had a chance to call out for help, the young ninja was met with the unstoppable force of Hinata's next casual step. He was driven into the ground under her normally petite weight, now magnified a hundredfold by the shrinking Jutsu. Naruto thought for sure his body was going to pop like a grape, stomped to death by the very girl who had been kind enough to help him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hinata's weight lifted off of him. Naruto saw light return as Hinata's shapely rear, clad in tight blue pants, exited his field of vision. She continued walking, each step shaking the ground at Naruto's back. The orange garbed ninja was too tired to call out or give pursuit; too awed by his survival to think of getting her help. The quaking footsteps disappeared, growing fainter and fainter until Naruto was left in relative silence. Then the quakes started again as someone yet again approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NARUTO!?\" Came a girl's voice, it held a tone of shock and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up once again, the tiny ninja was surprised to see, not the blue-haired, pale-eyed girl from before, but instead the fierce pink hair and determined gaze of Sakura, his teammate. She wore an expression that somehow mixed a frown with utter confusion. Naruto, on the other hand, went for a simple sigh of relief as he finally sat up and dusted himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura! I need your help! I accidentally used a shrinking jutsu on myself!\" The blonde Genin explained as he began to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process of standing up, Naruto became more and more aware of a shadow forming over head. Looking up, he saw a familiar and terrifying sight; he treaded sole of a female Genin's sandals fast approaching. With all the speed he could muster, Naruto formed a group of Shadow Clones which swiftly threw him free of the impact zone. He slid through the dirt as Sakura stomped down on the group of doppelgangers, each one giving a pained expression before vanishing in a puff of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sakura! What the hell!?\" Naruto yelled up at his teammate who was turning to face him, hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already missed out on training earlier today. I'm not letting you sneak out again, just because you're small.\" Sakura explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was left with no time to argue as his teammate lifted her foot up once more in preparation of stomp on him. This time Naruto was spurred on to fight back. He made the usual hand signal and in a flash, summoned a large group of Shadow Clones. Rather than throw himself free, Naruto and his clones held their hands up and braced for impact. As Sakura stamped her foot down, she was surprised to find Naruto was able to hold it up, with a little help of course. She couldn't help but smirk as she leaned forward, applying just a little more pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Naruto saw his clones vanish one by one as the weight above increased. Soon it was only him and a handful of Shadow Clones, forced on their knees trying to hold up what felt like the weight of an entire world. Then with just an ounce more pressure, the remaining clones vanished in a puff of smoke. Naruto didn't even know what was happening as the sandal forced him down into the ground. The impact knocked the wind out of him and he found his body pinned down. The overwhelming mass above felt like it would turn his bones to dust in a matter of seconds. Then the weight somehow lightened, it was still heavy enough to pin him down without effort, but no longer enough to turn him into a red smear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash the weight was gone and Naruto was rolled on his back as the mass above swung to the side. Looking up, he know saw Sakura's barefoot, toes wiggling, sole dirty and marred from a long day of training. Apparently she had taken off her sandals while standing on him, then just now kicked it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for round 2, Naruto,\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sakura's barefoot lunged at the shrunken Ninja. Naruto barely had enough time to leap away with the help of yet another Shadow Clone, one that swiftly turned to smoke as it was crunched between Sakura's hungry toes. Sakura continued her assault, swinging her foot back as all five toes scrunched up to grab the fleeing ninja. With the help of two more clones, Naruto pushed himself away from their reach. The poor doppelgangers were quickly snatched up like the last one. Though this time, one of the pair was unlucky enough to not vanish on the initial impact. Wedged between Sakura's big and second toe, the unfortunate clone was flicked off into the distance by the uncaring pink-haired goddess as she resumed her assault on Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly backed up as Sakura's right heel drove into the dirt before him. Unfortunately for him, this was her plan. His body was suddenly hit from behind by Sakura's sweaty toes and driven into the back of her heel. The fleshy appendages wrapped around Naruto like snakes, though far more foul smelling. Once there grip had been maintained, Sakura lifted her foot up, resting her heel on the back of her ass while balancing on one foot. She glanced over her shoulder and giggled as Naruto dangled helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I've won two rounds so far. You're gonna have a long day ahead of you if this is how training is going to go.\" She said, struggling to keep a straight face as the tiny orange bug squirmed in her toes grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped as he realized for Sakura, this was only the beginning of what she had planned. What other painfully, disgusting, and/or humiliating \"training\" exercises were to come?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Sakura picks up Naruto and takes him to a nearby stump to prepare for their next training exercise. Naruto must now try to avoid getting smashed beneath his teammate's massive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Sakura takes a seat on the ground and positions her feet at Naruto's sides like two walls of flesh, while Naruto tries his best to use all the clones he can muster in order to keep her at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Sakura is interrupted by Hinata who realized Naruto wasn't between her toes anymore and is trying to find him. Sakura decides to use Hinata to unknowingly torment Naruto, by challenging her to a sparring match with Naruto at their feet. If Hinata wins, Sakura says she'll help her find Naruto.</span></div></div>",

Plus it's a better read in my opinion most of the time if everyone knows the character they are reading and writing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Trades are open for people who interest me with their writing skills, email me on site and maybe we can trade chapters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least, just because I'm writing a new anime story doesn't mean I'll be giving up on the other interactives I have. I might not add to some as often as others but the old anime story will be replaced by this one in due time. Myself and the other writers who added some of the chapters in the old story will be editing our works to fit the new format and give this story some content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really do hope that everyone will be able to enjoy this story as I continue to improve my writing skills in order to dish out better content for your enjoyment. Last but not least the <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Shrinking Scenarios</font> will be listed in the main story after you enter via the normal link below, however the <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Giantess Scenarios</font> will only be accessible through the Zero Story link that follows this short paragraph.
