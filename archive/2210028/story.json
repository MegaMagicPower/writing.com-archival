            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucas had made up his mind about what he wanted to do today. Today was the day he was going to get himself a pet. His mother had always told him no as she felt he wasn\u2019t ready for a pet, but he felt prepared. He hadn\u2019t told anybody else about his plan as he wanted to keep it a secret for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy entered the pet store and looked around. There were a lot of pets to choose from. Some of them were pretty big while others were fairly small. He searched carefully until he accidentally bumped into an employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said. The woman turned around and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there! What can I do for you today.\u201d She asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m looking to adopt something. I\u2019m just not sure what.\u201d He said. He scanned the different creatures, having no idea what to pick. The employee smiled and thought for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we have many to choose from. However, perhaps I can offer you a unique type of pet.\u201d She said. Lucas turned back to her, curious as to what she was referring to. The woman motioned him to follow her and took him to the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back room was really quiet and there weren\u2019t any animals. However, there were a lot of eggs on the shelves with different labels. Each one seemed to be a different color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of eggs are these?\u201d Lucas asked. He went up to a shelf and read the label. \u201cAnthro\u2026bunny. What does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are unique types of pets that cannot be found anywhere else. When your egg hatches, your unique pet will be born. They will always be female and start off small but incredibly intelligent, perhaps even smarter than you or me.\u201d She explained. Lucas nodded, listening carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do they eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh pretty much anything, and I mean anything. They may even decide to eat their own species if they want. However, we have a special type of food just for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman walked over to a cabinet and opened it up. She pulled out 3 jars and set them on the table. Lucas inspected them and noticed they looked like berries. Each jar was a different size and had different colored berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are the only things that will make your pet grow. The green berries with grow your pet by 3 inches. The yellow berries with grow them a foot taller. As for the red ones, you must be very cautious with them.\u201d Lucas gave her a look and tilted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, How much does it cause them to grow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c5 feet.\u201d The woman warned him. Lucas shuddered, he was 6 feet tall so one red berry would cause the creature to become almost as tall as him. After a minute of silence, the woman started smiling once more. \u201cSo, which one would you like?\u201d She asked. Lucas looked around and carefully considered his options. After a minute, he decided to go with\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucas looked over his options carefully until he noticed a label marked \u201chuman\u201d. He hesitated before picking the egg up. It felt nice and warm, making him smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there really a human in this egg?\u201d He asked. The employee nodded and rubbed the egg a little. Lucas held the egg close and started to pet it. The thought of a human female inside the egg made him chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how will I know when this egg is going to hatch?\u201d He asked. The woman leaned into his ear and started to whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready for her, just tell the egg <i>It\u2019s time to wake up</i> and it\u2019ll start hatching.\u201d She explained. Lucas nodded and smiled at the egg once more. The boy paid the employee and put the jars in his backpack (he had taken it just in case).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d He said, walking out. Lucas kept a close eye on the egg as he traveled back home. He didn\u2019t want anything to happen to it, and he certainly didn\u2019t want his family to take it away. When he got home, he could tell his mother was in the kitchen. The boy quietly moved upstairs to his bedroom and locked the door. He placed the egg on his bed and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, I can\u2019t wait! I wonder what she\u2019ll look like.\u201d He thought to himself. He leaned in, feeling excited. \u201cIt\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d The egg sat quietly, making Lucas feel confused. He wondered why it didn\u2019t react. \u201cIt\u2019s time to wake up.\u201d He said again. Still no response. The boy sighed, losing his excitement. He was starting to think this was just a scam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to reach for the egg when it suddenly cracked. He froze, holding his breath. The crack grew and spread across the egg. The damage continued to increase until the entire thing shattered. Lucas stared in awe. On the bottom egg shell was a small adult woman curled up. After a moment, she started to move, standing to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked to be about 3 inches tall, small enough to fit in his hand. She had long ginger hair, blue eyes, and a nice figure. Lucas quickly blushed as the woman was completely naked. The tiny female started to look around, observing her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello there.\u201d He said. The woman looked up at him and simply stared at him. \u201cMy name is Lucas.\u201d The woman continued to stare at him, not reacting at all. After a minute, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there Lucas.\u201d She replied. The boy was stunned that she could already speak. Her voice was soothing and nice. \u201cAre you my owner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I suppose I am. I want to be friends with you though and have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I look forward to it but first, what is my name?\u201d She asked. Lucas thought about it for a minute. He wanted her to have the perfect name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about Penny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny\u2026how lovely. Alright then, call me Penny.\u201d She said with a smile. Lucas lowered his hand and allowed her to step on. As he lifted her up, he continued to blush and her sexy body. \u201cSo Lucas, what would you like to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiled, already equipped with an idea.</span></div></div>",

Lucas mirrored her smile and sat down on the bed, listening carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was born with the knowledge of what I can do and how I am. It\u2019s to help owners understand us better. I think the first thing you should know is that my body is basically invincible.\u201d Lucas\u2019s eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. You can step on me, burn me, eat me, whatever you want and I won\u2019t die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut wont it hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, it would hurt a lot. However, something interesting is that after enough torture, my body will adapt. So if you continue to step on me, my body will become stronger to the point where stepping on me won\u2019t hurt.\u201d Penny explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool! What else can you do?\u201d Lucas asked, curious of the woman. He was glad his friend would be able to stay safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty strong for my size. In fact, I could probably pick up a basketball if I wanted to. My strength will also increase as my size increases. As for my speed, I\u2019m pretty fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Can I see?\u201d Lucas asked. When Penny nodded, the boy set her down on the ground. The tiny woman smiled and ran to the other side of the room. The boy stared in awe as it only took about 10 to 15 seconds. When she ran back, Lucas picked her up again. \u201cWow, you\u2019re like a super human. If you were to grow to my size, you could probably take me down easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas started to chuckle at the idea. It was kind of amusing to think about how strong she could become. He didn\u2019t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. Penny smiled as well. The thought of becoming overpowered interested her. However, there was one thing pretty clear in her mind at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t intentionally hurt you though. Even though we just met, you seem like a nice person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Lucas started to pet her, making Penny feel nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Lucas, is there anything you can do?\u201d The tiny woman asked. Lucas blushed and started to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can play an instrument pretty well.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I see?\u201d Lucas nodded and placed her on the bed before walking to his closet. Within a moment, he pulled out a silver ocarina. He sat down next to Penny and started to play it. The tiny woman smiled. The music sounded nice and peaceful. She laid against his leg and listened for a while. Lucas continue to play the ocarina for a couple of minutes. Playing the ocarina reminded him of good memories. When he finished, smiled at his friend once more. \u201cAlright Penny, what do you want to do now?\u201d He asked nicely. The girl thought about it for a moment.</span></div></div>",

Although she didn\u2019t mind being small, she wanted to be bigger, even if it was only a little bit. Lucas nodded and pulled the jars out, setting them on the table. Each one looked pretty good to Penny. \u201cOh, by the way, there is something you should know. I can\u2019t actually get the berries myself.\u201d Lucas gave her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can eat the berries myself, but I can\u2019t open the jars. If they\u2019re already open, I can reach in and grab them but being unable to actually open them is in my blood. It\u2019s so that I can\u2019t grow bigger without your knowledge.\u201d Penny explained. Lucas nodded, he hadn\u2019t considered that. He made a mental note to start double checking the jars for later. He trusted Penny, but wasn\u2019t sure if she could resist growing bigger by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned towards the berries and started thinking about which one to give to her. If he were to give her a green berry, she would grow to about 6 inches, the size of a doll. He would still be able to hide her and she could get around a little easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Lucas were to give Penny a yellow one, she would grow a foot taller, a bit taller than a ruler. He would have a bit more trouble hiding her, but it could make things interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy then considered the red berries. He had been warned to be careful with then and indeed were a dangerous option. One berry would make her almost as tall as him. He would be forced to tell his mother the truth sooner that he would have liked (he would also have to hope she didn\u2019t punish him for it). However, if Penny were his size, she could enjoy things like a normal human. There were definitely benefits to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas nodded with a decision in mind and reached for\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kori smiled as she was getting ready to leave. After today, things would be quite different. After all of these years, she finally decided to get a pet. Her 15 year old son and 17 year old daughter were currently in school which gave her time to get one as a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe locked up the house and started walking towards the pet store. As the sun shined down on her, she carefully thought about what to get. She could get a fish as to start with. However, Kori wasn\u2019t sure if the kids would be interested in it. The woman also considered getting a guinea pig, though she wasn\u2019t sure about that option either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take her long to get to the store. When she entered, she eagerly scanned the different creatures. There were many wonderful options, both big and small. She stopped in front of a cat and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026nah, cats can be cruel.\u201d She said to herself, remembering a time when her friend\u2019s cat scratched her. As she started to turn towards another pet, a female employee approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello, can I help you?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m looking for a nice pet to take home but I haven\u2019t decided which one to take.\u201d Kori responded. The woman smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then if you\u2019re interested, I have some special options in the back, if you want to check them out.\u201d The employee said, indicating towards a door. Kori thought for a moment before deciding to see what she had in mind. She followed the employee to the back room and flinched. There was tons of eggs with labels. The woman approached one and read the label.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Centaur</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Kori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese eggs are very special. They contain creatures that can\u2019t be found anywhere else. They start off small but highly intelligent. These creatures have the ability to grow very large though, potentially even bigger than you.\u201d Kori stared at her, unsure of how to respond. The employee pulled out some jars containing weird berries that she had never seen before. \u201cThese are what help the creatures grow. With a green one, they grow 3 inches, a foot for the yellow berries, and 5 feet with the red ones. For this reason, you need to be careful. Besides these berries, the creatures will eat literally anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori took a moment to process this. This whole idea didn\u2019t seem logical. After all, centaurs and fairies weren\u2019t real. Although, it made her curious. If this was true, her family could have a pet like no other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have two kids so I need to know something, are they dangerous?\u201d Kori asked. The employee stayed silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPotentially. They\u2019re strong enough to survive almost anything and once they become big enough, they\u2019ll be stronger than humans. You shouldn\u2019t worry though, your pet won\u2019t harm you. At least, not on purpose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori thought for a moment before sighing. It was better than nothing and she decided she might as well go for it, even if it was just a prank. She carefully looked over her options before deciding to take\u2026</span></div></div>",

Though she was a little bit worried it might be dangerous, the woman believed it was a safe option as long as the fox didn\u2019t grow too big. As she grabbed it, the egg felt warm and nice in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do I know when it\u2019s going to hatch?\u201d Kori asked. The employee smiled at her before leaning in towards her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, say <i>Rise and shine little creature</i>.\u201d The woman answered. Kori nodded and paid for the egg and the berries, putting the food into a large bag. The woman started to walk home, not questioning what just happened. Her thoughts soon changed as she was half way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, hold on. Let\u2019s see if she really was being serious.\u201d Kori said to herself. She set the bag down and held the egg in her hands. \u201cRise and shine little creature.\u201d She stated. Within a few moments, the egg started to crack a little. The damage quickly increased until the entire egg broke. Kori stared in awe at what was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the egg shells was a small humanoid fox that looked to be about 5 inches tall. Her fur was mostly orange with some white fur going up her belly and breasts. She wore no clothes but had a nice bushy tail. The fox girl stretched with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it feels good to be alive!\u201d She proclaimed. The furry creature quickly noticed Kori and smiled. \u201cHello, are you my owner?\u201d Kori wasn\u2019t sure how to respond for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026um\u2026yeah, I guess. My name is Kori and me and my family will be looking after you. What is your name?\u201d The fox girl giggled at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a silly question. I was just born so I don\u2019t have a name. You have to think of one for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ok. Well um, how about\u2026Amber?\u201d Kori suggested. She still couldn\u2019t believe she was currently holding a small furry lady in her hands, and one that was quite attractive too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmber\u2026I like it! So Kori, where are we going right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori thought for a moment. The logical thing to do would be to head home, but she wasn\u2019t sure she was ready to go home yet. The woman considered going somewhere quiet so they could chat for a bit. The woman was also a bit hungry and she guessed Amber was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKori smiled at her new friend and decided to go\u2026</span></div></div>",
