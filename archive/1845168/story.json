            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weather was cold and a strong wind blew threw the forest. It was already night and the rain hadn\u2019t stopped since it had began early in the morning.<br>\r\nSebastian or Bastian how his dear but sadly dead mother loved it to call him, was already on his way back into the little town he called home.<br>\r\nHis long light brown coat along with his brown pants, the black simple leather shoes and his tan long sleeved shirt where completely drenched from the rain and with every step he did, crept the coldness of the awful weather more and more into his already of a disease weakened body.<br>\r\n\u201cDad\u2026\u201d He said as his weak legs gave away and he landed face first into the sodden ground. His hand searched for the bag in which he had gathered the pollen of a very rare flower which was the only hope for a cure for the people of his town.<br>\r\nHe searched for it but he couldn\u2019t found it. He moved his head and noticed the leather bag near the edge of the road that the mage had told never to leave.<br>\r\nThe boy crawled over but the strong wind pushed it over the edge just before Sebastian could get it.<br>\r\n\u201cNoo.\u201d He cursed silent and with his last bit of energy, pushed himself further and also over the edge and good seventy feet down the hillside. <br>\r\nSebastian rolled down all the way and hit branches and tree trunks several times on his way down.<br>\r\nHis clothes were thorn from the sharp rocks and threes but he doesn\u2019t care about it.<br>\r\nThe boy looked up and saw his important freight not even and arm length before him.<br>\r\nHe stretched his arm and finally felt the wet bag in his hand before he pulled it back at himself.<br>\r\nIt was just then as the whole content began to fall out of it. The pollen he had collected for which he had cut his hands and fingers when he climbed up the long way at the mountain fell out of it. The only hope for his village\u2026for his father\u2026for him\u2026was gone blown, and washed away from the wind and the rain.<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Nooo!! No god no!!\u201c Yelled Sebastian out of his lungs while he tried to grab at least some of it. <br>\r\nHe opened his hand and looked into his palm and the little amount of the pollen he had managed to save before he closed it again.<br>\r\nTears rolled down his tired face and mixed with the rain and dirt in it as he spotted something not very far away from him. <br>\r\nHis vision began to blur as an effect of the disease which had already killed more then half of the village and he thought first that his mind played him a dirty last trick but no. It was a cave entrance and a very large one. <br>\r\nBastian forced his legs and arms to move on while he began to cough badly. He made a few feet and collapsed until he tried it again. He saw the cave entrance clearly for a few moments before his vision began to blur again it was real and it wasn\u2019t far away just a little more he thought but his arms and legs ran out of strength and his face landed again into the muddy ground.<br>\r\nIt was then as a shadow, larger and bigger as most of the trees in the forest covered his body and a gigantic hand gently picked him up\u2026<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, look what I found outside.\u201d Said Meena with a worried expression on her face as she entered the cave and hold the little creature up to her mother.<br>\r\nKarin, Meena\u2019s mother was a truly giantess. With good sixty five feet in height, towered the female giant over nearly every tree in the Jotun forest. No creature was stupid enough to attack her or her daughter and there was enough food and water to live a calm and peaceful life. <br>\r\nKarin turned around from the fireplace where she was about to put in the last ingredient for a soup into a big steel pot.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you found this time?\u201d She said and smiled knowing that her little girl would often bring some wounded animals back home so she could cure them.<br>\r\nBut as she looked at the tiny form of the human lying in the palm of her daughter\u2019s hand, her expression changed in a second.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you found him?\u201d She asked and Meena told her that he lay just before the cave entrance.<br>\r\nKarin grabbed at a cloth and formed it into a simple matters before she laid him on it.<br>\r\n\u201cMeena go and get me another one quick.\u201d She said while she began to undress him. <br>\r\nThe giantess just had taken the wet coat away from him as she saw a blood drenched bandage around the right leg of the tiny guy. Karin shook her head as she looked into his dirty face and noticed that it was a child. He was maybe not even older as her own daughter.<br>\r\nShe grabbed a bowl and filled it half with hot and cold water to get a nice warm bath for the tiny lad while she wondered why he was out here. Didn\u2019t he knew that the forest was a deadly place for humans?<br>\r\nShe had already taken his soaked vest and shirt of as the boy woke up in her palm. <br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d Karin said soft and warm but he didn\u2019t seem to recognize her as he tried to get up and as that didn\u2019t worked, began to crawl.<br>\r\nKarin grabbed with her fingers at his waist to hold him in place and felt his tiny muscles weaken only a few seconds later. <br>\r\n\u201cCalm down I don\u2019t hurt you boy.\u201d She said gentle but didn\u2019t get any response from him as she turned him around and noticed that he still clenched his right fist tight and wondered why.<br>\r\nKarin opened his hand as gently as she could and noticed the little remains of yellow pollen in it.<br>\r\nShe felt his forehead and immediately placed him into the bowl of warm water. <br>\r\nAs Meena came back to the kitchen, she saw her mother searching in one of the cupboards.<br>\r\nShe noticed the bowl and as she came near, she saw the tiny guy in it his body half covered in the warm water.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you searching for mom?\u201d She asked just as Karin found what she had searched for a brown clay pot.<br>\r\n\u201cThis here sweetie.\u201d She said and put the pot on the table. <br>\r\nKarin opened it and used a spoon to get a good potion of the same yellow pollen out of it.<br>\r\nShe held the spoon over the bowl with the kid inside and slowly gave the pollen in it.<br>\r\n\u201cIs he sick?\u201d Asked Meena at what her mother nodded her head without saying a word.<br>\r\nThey both heard him coughing again and again and Meena looked worried on the little fella in the bowl.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Meena the pollen will heal him. He just needs some time to rest.\u201d She said and placed his drenched and cut clothes over a slim rope to let them dry.<br>\r\nMeena sat at the table and looked on the little guy in the bowl. She noticed his constant slim breathing and hoped that he would be okay. <br>\r\nIt was the first time that she had seen a human in her life and she was very curious to get to know him better.<br>\r\nMaybe, they could even become friends with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I\u2019m afraid I need a special ingredient to make it. One I haven\u2019t seen in ages but I know where it can be found.\u201d He said and took an old piece of paper from under his long dark green robe.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe placed it on the wooden table before Joric and pointed with his index finger to one of the mountains which was a few days away from the town if someone would use a horse.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThe Alcalit mountains, old man this\u2026\u201d But the wizard raised his hand to cut his speech.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI know Joric it\u2019s a dangerous path but it\u2019s the only way. One of us has to go their and climb on the mountain to get me a some of the pollen of that flower.\u201d He said calm and looked on the map.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only the mountain but you seem to forget that it is behind the forbidden forest. No one goes through the forest you know the law.\u201d Joric said and rested his hands on the table and looked with his light blue eyes into the old grey eyes of the wizard.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe have to Joric or everyone is dead before the full moon raises again.\u201d The old man said at him but a second later began Joric to cough and collapsed where he stood before.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe mage went over to him and tried to get him up on his feet again. It was then as Sebastian ran into the room and called out for his dad.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDad!!\u201d He yelled in panic while he helped the old man to bring his father to his bed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe touched his forehead and shook his head as he felt the heat on it. \u201cHe too\u2026\u201d He said silent and looked to the boy at his side. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSebastian please bring be some water\u2026hurry.\u201d The mage told the boy and pushed him firmly out of the room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSebastian took one of the bowls and ran out to one of the fountains they had in their town.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe came back and saw the old map lying on the table. <br>\r\nJoric and the towns mage didn\u2019t knew it but he had heard their conversation about the cure. All they needed was something from a flower he thought as he carried the water filled bowl into the bedroom with his father inside.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOld mage.\u201d He began on which the old man turned is head to him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it boy?\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIs it true? Can this flower cure my dad and all the others?\u201d He said and fought his tears back.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYes it can boy.\u201d He answered on which Bastian turned around walked into his own room and grabbed his leather bag a green vest and his belt with a dagger on it, and a long light brown coat.<br>\r\nHe opened his door as the mage stood before it and looked down on him. \u201cAnd where do you think will you go young man?\u201d He said and knew form look of Sebastian\u2019s face what he had in mind.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI go and get this flower.\u201d He said stern and moved on but was stopped by the old mage.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish boy.\u201d He said and pushed him back to the door of his room. \u201cMany brave man tried their luck and where never seen.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBut we need the flower!\u201d Bastian yelled out loud and clenched his hands to fists. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe mage looked at him. He truly was Joric\u2019s son. He like him, had the same stubbornness and the old men knew that as young as the boy was, even if he wouldn\u2019t allow it would Bastian come and steal the map if he had to.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe mage knelt before Bastian and gave him a warm smile. \u201cSebastian I know you want to help but\u2026you can\u2019t do a thing. You are fourteen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFifteen in a few days.\u201d He said and looked at the old mage with a stern expression.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHmmm I see\u2026if you really want to go, you have to be fast.\u201d Said the old man and handed him the map..<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
