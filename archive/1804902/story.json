You\u2019ll screw everything up again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon scowled but turned around and headed to the other side of the playground, away from the more athletic eleven and twelve year old boys who were getting ready to play a game of kickball. He didn't particularly like the game, but he was desperate to make some friends, any friends. Unfortunately, his reputation as a klutz seemed to have preceded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see the last time he tried to play?\u201d Simon overheard Greg, a blonde-haired, tanned-looking boy, asking the rest of the guys on his team. \u201cWhen he was at the plate, he whiffed the ball three times in a row, the last time falling flat on his face in the process!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the blood rush to his face, Simon (mostly) held back his tears and picked up his pace, trying to get as far away from these jerks as possible. As he started to run however, he began to lose his balance, and his feet tangled together, sending him crashing to the dirt. As he lifted himself up, picking up the glasses that had fallen off of his face and putting them back on, he prayed that no one had seen what just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, by the sounds of laughter coming from behind him, his prayer had gone unanswered. \u201cThere he goes again!\u201d Greg yelled out, his surprisingly baritone voice grating in Simon's ears. \u201cKlutzy Simon can't even walk from one side of the school yard to the other without taking a dive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of the boys continued their hooting and hollering, Simon quickly rose to his feet and got out of there as quickly as possible, thinking to himself how satisfying it would be if he could only find some way to teach those asswipes a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Simon was laying on his bed, reading the latest issue of his favorite magazine, National Geographic, which has just come in the mail that day. The cover story focused on different reports of alien abductions, taking a generally dismissive attitude towards virtually all of them.  \"Regardless of the fervent testimony of a few zealotous alien apologists,\" Simon read the last paragraph of the article, \"the fact remains that there has yet to be any conclusive evidence presented for any alien's existence in the first place, much less their contact with humans. However, one thing we can all agree on is that, if they ever do contact us, we shouldn't expect to see little green men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't that the truth,\" a voice from the other end of the bed said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon yelled a little and jumped back in fright. What looked like a boy his own age was sitting across from him, smiling softly at him. He looked like any average ten-year-old, except that he was glowing white all over, like some sort of ghost, or angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" Simon asked, his lips quivering slightly. \"How'd you get into my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Simon,\" the boy said, \"I'm not here to hurt you. I'm a visitor from another dimension, what you might call an 'alien', though I don't really come from another planet, and this is for sure not what I really look like. But I'm here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelp me? Simon thought to himself. How could someone like him help me? Out loud, he simply said, \"What-- what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, the shimmering boy began to slowly walk around the room. \"There's something very unique about you, Simon, something that allows you to do and become things that no other human could even dream of. To put it as simply as I can, you're the descendent of someone who came to your world centuries ago from the same dimension I'm from, and we want to get you back home. To do that, though, we're going to need to work on developing some of the abilities that lay dormant within you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnique? Abilities? Home? Simon wasn't quite sure he was following along, or if he was just imagining or dreaming the whole thing. Still, if what this \u2026 being \u2026 if what he said was true\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of abilities are we talking about?\" he asked, his curiosity piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't say for sure exactly how they'll manifest themselves within you,\" the boy said as he sat back down on the bed, closer to Simon. \"A lot of that's to be seen, and you'll have a lot of choices to make. I just need to know that you're willing to believe in me. Otherwise, I can't help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon thought long and hard for a few moments, wondering whether he did truly believe in what he was hearing. Finally, he nodded, slowly at first but then more enthusiastically. \"Yes! Yes, I do want to believe you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then we're set to begin tonight!\" The boy stood up and walked over to the wall, then suddenly seemed to disappear through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Simon called out, reaching out his hand after the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Simon heard the voice, though the figure didn't return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, do I need to do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not tonight,\" the boy reassured him. \"At least, nothing that you'll actually be aware of. But tomorrow might be a little\u2026 interesting. For you and anyone you come across.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the voice went silent, and Simon could tell that he had left for good, or at least for the evening. Leaning back in his bed, he thought for a long time about what had just happened, imagining what changes could happen to him over the course of the next few days. He didn't really have any idea what could happen, but he knew that it sure sounded exciting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Simon woke up the next morning, he instantly felt different, though he couldn't quite put his finger on it. Just getting out of bed felt different, as if his body was heavier. Remembering the night before, he quickly ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, shocked at what he saw: he appeared to be a full two years older. He was about five inches taller than before, and his body was noticeably more developed, though he still was still very skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" he exclaimed aloud. \"That's pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for a moment, not quite sure if he should be expecting a response or not, but when nothing answered him back, he shrugged, smiled, and went back to his room to start getting ready for school. Looking through his closet, he noticed that his clothes, while still very much the same style he had worn before, now seemed to be a bit larger, as if they were made for a twelve year old. \"That's strange,\" he wondered, \"I guess they grew with me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was even stranger, though, when he went downstairs and sat down at the breakfast table. He braced himself, waiting to see his parents' reaction, but neither of them seemed to bat an eye. Finally, after he was half-finished with a silent breakfast, he coughed slightly, and asked, \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Simon?\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm,\" he thought for a moment, not quite sure of what to say. \"Do you notice anything... different about me this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him with a questioning look, but then shook her head. \"No, I don't think so. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon decided to keep his secret for now. \"No reason.\" He tried to think of a way to ask her how old she though he was, but he couldn't figure out how to do that without appearing to be crazy. He finished his breakfast and then headed off to school soon after, wondering if everyone else around him saw him as a twelve year old just like his mom apparently did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question was answered as soon as he saw where he was being dropped off for school. Instead of the elementary school that he was used to going to, he noticed that he was walking into the middle school a block over. It was a strange feeling, and he fought an instinct to turn around and run back to the elementary school, but he figured if that, with everyone else treating this day as normal, he just had to go with the flow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the thrill of being, or at least appearing to be, two years older than he had been just the day before immediately subsided when he realized that being twelve years old in a middle school meant he was in the youngest group of students. And the difference between other twelve-year-old sixth graders like himself and the fourteen-year-old eighth graders was substantial. Even tall as he was for his age, there were boys who towered over him, and almost all of them could out-muscle him any day of the week. He took a deep breath as he walked down the halls, hoping not to get noticed, at least for now, and also wondering if in this reality he had any friends here -- or enemies, for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell to start class rang, he soon realized that he had no idea where to go. Luckily, a teacher standing in the halls noticed his bewildered state and called out to him, \"Well, Simon, will you be joining us in homeroom today or not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon breathed a sigh of relief as he quickly ran into the room. \"Sorry,\" he said, quickly scanning the walls for signs of the teacher's name, \"Mr. Corwall.\" The teacher smiled in acknowledgement, and Simon quickly hurried to the only empty seat left in the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the roll began to be called, Simon looked around at the rest of the students in the class. No one seemed to notice him or object to his presence in the room, or even wonder who he was, but he didn't recognize a single face. He started to sweat a little. If reality had changed like this around him, even if it did mean that he had gotten a little older, it would be nice to have some sort of control, or at the very least a cheat sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he suddenly heard a voice whisper, \"Simon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whirled around his head, looking for the source of the voice, but saw nothing. He quickly realized, however, that it was the same voice from last night. He started to say something, but then stopped, realizing that if the other students didn't notice the voice, and he began to talk back to it, he might be seen as deranged, or at the very least get in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about answering,\" the voice snorted, slightly indignant. \"Yeah, yeah, I know you're in class. Fine, then I'll do all the talking. I hope you've enjoyed the first little surprise this morning. I sense, though, that you seem to be uncomfortable in this new situation, especially not knowing anyone around you. Tell you what. I'll fill you in with some of the information on this reality. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon didn't quite know how to answer or what to expect, but after a second, his head suddenly began to fill with memories of the past two years, finishing elementary school, going through the first scary days of middle school, meeting all his classmates and teachers -- it all flooded in. In a moment, he knew every one of the other students' names, and he knew what the rest of his schedule was and where the classrooms were. It was as if he had actually lived the past two years that he had skipped overnight, but deep down, he knew that it wasn't the reality he had experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" the voice said, \"I think something's missing. It looks like the way your backstory has unfolded, you don't have a single friend in your school. Well, I guess we can fix that. And this is where I can start to give you a choice. Look around the room here, and choose one of the other boys. I'll make it so that in his mind, and in yours, you two will have been best friends since you can remember-- a deep, lasting friendship. Just, whichever one you concentrate the hardest on, that'll be the one that I pick. 'Kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon wanted to protest, to ask for more information, or another chance, but the voice seemed unable or unwilling to read his thoughts. So he had to pick somebody, it seemed. Looking around the room, he tried to decide which one looked like the best choice for a best friend, drawing upon what he knew of them from his newfound memories. Finally, he made his choice.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After considering the matter for a few minutes, Simon finally settled on Austin. Sitting at the side of the wall near the windows, Austin looked like he kept mostly to himself, but after searching through the new memories in his head, Simon realized that Austin was very intelligent but humble, and had a sweet, caring side to him that rarely came out in class. Simon didn't want his new friend to be so popular that they never got to hang out or talk, so Austin seemed to be the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter deciding this, a flash of light came over him, and Simon found himself in the seat next to Austin. Looking over, he saw that Austin was doodling something on one of the pages of his notebook, though he couldn't quite make out what. Austin saw that Simon was looking his way, and a smile started to creep across his lips. He started to say something, but then was interrupted by the teacher, who was continuing with the lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's head began to fill with new thoughts of his life as best friends with Austin. The two boys had known each other since kindergarten, and they hung out every chance they got. They were both only children, but they treated each other like brothers, sharing nearly everything and always getting into scrapes and friendly fights with each other, though their more cerebral sides would also lead to them helping each other on homework and pursuing more creative things, like writing. Neither of them had many other friends, but the bond between them was about as close as could be. Simon could even tell that there was a hint of something more than friendship, but it had never developed much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the bell rang, and the students started to empty into the halls. As Simon got up, Austin quickly ran up to his side. \"Wanna see my latest sketches for 'The Deadly Duo'?\" He nearly hopped up and down with boyish excitement, clutching his notebook tight to his chest as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wha--?\" Simon stopped himself mid-sentence, as he came across the memory of a comic book the pair had been working on for the last year or so. As far as he could tell, the work was more of just talking about ideas for characters and plot events, along with a few doodles, but nothing concrete. \"Oh! Yeah, sure. Is that what you were drawing in class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm,\" Austin nodded in affirmation. He handed over the notebook, opened to the page with fresh pencil marks (along with a few leftover eraser shavings). \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon studied the page closely. The first thing that jumped out at him was how good of an artist Austin was. The sketches were rough, sure, but the body models and facial expressions were on their way to being the quality of a professionally published book. But the biggest thing that struck Simon had to be the two character's appearances. They were big and muscle-bound, like superheroes should be, but there was no denying that they held a striking resemblance to Austin and himself - one with the shaggy red hair and glasses matching Austin's, and one with the shorter, spiky black hair and Asian appearance like Simon's. It was an uncanny resemblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" was all that Simon could answer. \"It looks\u2026 really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAustin beamed with pride at this praise. \"Thanks, man! I'm glad you like it! I can't wait to get home and ink and color them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smiled, but as he did so, he felt a certain sense of power come over him, a strange yet familiar feeling. He could tell that this was an indication that he could make a choice to change reality again, but he wasn't quite sure how. He kept expecting the voice to return, but it never did. \"Maybe,\" he thought to himself, \"this is a sign that I need to act on these opportunities myself. But what should I change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the notebook in his hands, he knew he had the answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not just in muscle. His penis was a whopping 8in long currently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued down the hall, a high school student happened to be passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen \u201cHey watch it. You lower students should stay out of the way for us high school students.\u201d This student was a senior in high school, and stood at 7ft tall with muscles that put a body builder to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cHey.

He gave Ralph a look that said \u201cThis isn\u2019t over.\u201d The principal drags Linda away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph stared at Linda as he walked away with a sneer. Ralph would show him something next time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went as usual. As he was walking home, he thought he saw something in the bushes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he got there, there was a simple necklace with a small pendent attached to it. Ralph grabbed it and looked at it closer. The chain seemed like a regular chain, but it was made if some silvery metal. The pendant looked like a small blue egg, but it was veined with different hues of blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph looked around to see if someone was looking for it, but saw no one, so he pocketed the necklace. He walked home and went to his room. When he got there, he took the necklace out and looked at it more closely. As he looked at the chain, he saw a letter every other chain link. It said \u201cThe You That You Want To Be\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cInteresting. What do I want to be?\u201d While he was thinking, he remember his encounter with Linda, and how he was so big that he would dominate you. \u201cI want to be bigger and stronger.

What he saw shocked him. He was growing. He saw his t-shirt get smaller and smaller on his body. He saw more of his stomach get exposed to reveal a set of firm 6packs.

It became 12in long with tennis ball balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cNo way!\u201d Ralph took off his cloths and felt his new growth. He was big before, but not he was massive.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ralph sat down staring at the necklace for hours until he fell asleep. When he woke up, it was the next morning. Ralph couldn\u2019t wait for school today. When he got down stairs, he thought his parents would freak out from his growth, but when he got there, his mom set a large plate of pancakes in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cHow\u2019s my big boy doing? I gave you a few more pancakes because you need the energy to grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph thought this was weird \u201cHey mom. Do I look bigger? At least bigger than last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cReally? I can\u2019t tell the difference. You could be a little bigger, but I can\u2019t tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cOh\u2026 Ok. I guess I\u2019ll work harder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cDon\u2019t work to hard. It takes time for result to show. Now hurry up and finish. The bus is almost here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph thought about what happened as he ate. No one notices his change. When Ralph finished, he went outside and got on the bus. As he walked down the middle, no one acted out. It seemed like he has always been like that. He looked for an empty seat, but saw only one. It was next a girl named Zia. She is an easy to get along with kind of girl, who is smart and very active in community events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he sat down next to her, he felt his eyes drawn to her, making him examine her in everyway. His heart started to pump, and he felt hot. The snake in his pants threatened to burst out. In the end, Zia said \u201cHi. You Ralph right? I\u2019ve seem you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph snapped out of his trance \u201cOh\u2026 Umm\u2026 Yah. I\u2019m Ralph. Zia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cYah. You\u2019re pretty big aren\u2019t you? Well actually, you are big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph faked a cough \u201cUh\u2026 Yah. I guess its just genetics. You look athletic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cWell I hope I do. Either that, or crew practice is for nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cYou do crew? That\u2019s rowing right. What\u2019s it called\u2026 a canoe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia laughed \u201cIf you said that to the coach, she\u2019d flip on you. Its just a boat. Never say canoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cBoat\u2026 Got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cDo you do a sport?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cNo, but this crew thing sounds interesting. I might give it a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cAwesome! We can use anyone we get. We are very lacking in players.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continue to talk for the remainder of the ride. In the end, Ralph had asked if she wanted to go for a smoothie after school. Just to talk. Nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ralph got off the bus, he felt a strange lightness in his body. He felt happy, and calm. As he walked, he thought about what to say to her after school when he heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda \u201cHey you! I owe you for yesterday.\u201d He walks up to you and grabs your new shirt. He tried to lift you up, but couldn\u2019t for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cNot right now. I\u2019m having a good morning.\u201d He said in a nonchalant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda got angry at how he spoke \u201cNo one tells me what to do. You\u2019re nothing but a pipsqueak, but you weigh more than you look. Did you put rocks in your shirt? You\u2019re heavier than yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph had a curious thought. How am I heavier. He should be able to lift me with no problem. His thought was interrupted when Linda gave him an angry punch. He felt a light thud, but nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda grabbed his hand in pain \u201cWhat do you have under there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cNothing except my abs, and other muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda \u201cNo muscle is that hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cWhat ever. Believe it or not. Bye.\u201d He walks away leaving Linda standing there in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They did the basic eye examine and height check. When they did the weight check, something was weird. The numbers didn\u2019t stop going up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse \u201cThat\u2019s weird. It looks like the scale is broken. I\u2019ll have to you comeback another day when I get it fixed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph did his goodbyes and went to class. It was actually pool, so that\u2019s what he got ready for. He changed in the locker room, and put some swim trunks on. He kept his necklace on though. He didn\u2019t want to risk losing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got out to the pool, the other students were already doing their thing. Everyone stopped and stared at his body. The boys were envious, and the girls thought he was the cutest boy in school. When he stepped into the water, he sank straight down. Almost like a rock. When he tried to do a light swim, he kept sinking. He had to swim hard to stay afloat, but that wasn\u2019t hard for some reason. Ralph reasoned that he was getting denser. His body was still growing, but it was being compressed, and because of that, his weight increases and so does his strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen pool was over, he went through the rest of the day like usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If they found the genetic code for a large penis, and could produce a protiens that stimulates it, they would make millions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavior's day, Ned \"Hey son. Have a good day at school. Mom will pick you up. Tell her that i'll be late today. Good luck on your first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavior \"Ok dad\" You sigh as he left. It was the middle of the year, so everyone has already organized themselves into groups. \"I'm going to be the odd ball here...\" you sighed. As you walked into the school, everyone looked like normal teenagers. That is until you noticed that all the boys have basketball sized bulges in their pants, and they were only 13 or 14 yo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped threw the hall, everyone stopped and stared at him. Xavior hears various voices \"Hey its a new kid. Kind of lanky isnt he? Small to... His height is average. Oh... you meen his. Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXavior trudges to home room drowning in self pity. Why do i have a 1in penis? Why here of all places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school day goes by slowly because you were excluded everywhere. All because of... (Well... you know). You were ok in class, but in the halls, you were constantly picked on. You developed a deep hatred for all the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school ended, your mom picked you up and you went inside, and fell on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens here?</span></div></div>",

As you step inside, everyone stopped what they were doing and stared at you. And the day repeats itself. That is true until he gets bullied at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking to a table when a kid walked up to you and flipped your tray on you. You were covered in mash potatoes and gravy.

I didnt see you.\" He smirks as leaves you standing there fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away, you wanted to strip him of everything that made him so arrogant. You thought about sucking up half his penis, and balls making him smaller than everyone else. As you thought about it, you felt your penis stir. You felt a sharp pain in your pants. You look down, and see a bulge forming on you, and getting bigger. You stare in amazment. You run to the bathroom, and get in a stall. When you got there, you unzipped your pants, and a giant penis flopped out. It was at least 15 long, and there were two base balls attached to it. \"No way...\" You smirk as you realized that your life just got a whole lot more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

You expected someone to point out your change, but nothing happened. People continued on like normal. Why don't they notice you? At that point, you saw Seth walk by with his reduced organ. However, his personality seemed different. His possy wasnt a possy, but a group of close friends. Seth seemed more humble, and slightly intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mutter \"What's going on?\" As the day continued, people were more accepting of you, but they were still a little hostile. Since you were still small in comparison to everyone else. You decided to change that. As the day went by, you took one inch off of every boy that past you, and a bit of their balls as well. For some reason, your pants felt incredibly tight, but they didnt burst. By the end of the day, you had a beach ball hiding in your pants, and you were the most popular kid in school. It seems that your close grew to fit your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got home, you saw you mom in the kitchen cooking. You wanted to see if reality had changed so you were always like this. When you got to the kitchen, you mom looked at you and smile \"How was the second day of school? Are you fitting in ok? I know that you have the biggest penis, so i hope that helps you fit in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare \"Um... Yah. School was awsome today. What's for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \"Oh... Just some stake. You're a growing boy, so you need your protien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at you mom and sighed with embaressment, but it was the good kind. You even smiled. \"Ok... mom... I'll be up in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \"Kk. Dinners ready in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to your room and went to your full body mirror. Then you took off all your cloths with a slight shock. When you took off your pants, you giant penis flopped out and fell in a pile on the floor. It was like a garden hose with watermelon balls. \"Oh... my... god...\" You whisper. \"Its huge.\" You knew it was big, but not this big. You tried to measure it, but couldnt because you dont have a ruler big enough to do it. The thought of you huge size started to make you erect. \"Oh no!\" You penis started to fill with blood and get hard, but that stopped soon because you started to panic. You knew that your penis would either smash the wall down, or you'd have a squished erection. When you had calmed down, you realized that your gift was also a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started to grab you penis with both hands and shove it back into your underware, you saw how huge and ugly it looked un your small frame. You had a beanbag bulge, but a small lanky body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

While you were doing that, you stretched your hand under your pillow and brushed your hand against something. Out of curiosity, you pulled it out, and saw that it was a notebook. It was a shooting star across the cover that seemed to move, but stayed still. You opened it and saw a gold pen inside. Subconsciously, you took the pen and started writing everything that happened to day, and what you would have changed. You wrote that your penis was twice as big as the biggest penis there, and that you had overdeveloped muscle and bones to that you were the tallest and the strongest. After a while, you finished, and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, when you got up, you felt kind of weird. You felt heavier, but the good kind. You lift your hand to your face and saw that it was huge. Well bigger than yesterday. You gasp and jump out of bed. You look your mirror and was shocked to see a 6ft5in tall teen with a huge muscular build. However, your biggest surprise was your penis. You had gigantic briefs on that were bulging out hugely. \u201cIs that me?\u201d you say. As you say it, the person in the mirror copied you with a deep powerful voice. \u201cHow\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eyes, you saw the notebook. You run over and grab it. \u201cIt was this\u2026\u201d You stare at it disbelievingly, but smiled. This day just got a whole lot better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to your closet to put on some cloths and find that all the cloths had somehow grown to fit you. \u201cThat\u2019s odd. How did this happen?\u201d You didn\u2019t complain, and just put on some cloths. After that, you went down stairs and it to the kitchen for breakfast. When you got there, you saw a mountain of bacon and eggs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cHey honey. Your breakfast is right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201cYou mean the mountain right there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cYah. Sorry that its kind of small today. We can out of bacon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201cOh\u2026 umm. That\u2019s ok.\u201d With that, you started to attack your breakfast. When the bacon entered your mouth, you realized how hungry you really were. When you finished, your stomach was pacified, but could have eaten more. \u201cWow\u2026 I eat a lot. It must be what these muscles want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you went to your dad\u2019s car to get taken to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \"Hey son. Have a good day at school. Mom will pick you up. Tell her that i'll be late today. Good luck on your first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201cFirst day? Dad\u2026 this is the second day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cAre you sure? I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the first day of school. I haven\u2019t brought you here before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare, but stopped when you looked at your watch. It was yesterday again. \u201cOh right dad. Sorry. I had a dream I was at school, so I thought this was just the next day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled \u201cOk son. Have a nice day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a quick wave, and walk into the school. Everyone stopped and stared at you surprised. They stared to gossip about you. \u201cLook at the new kid. He\u2019s huge! He\u2019s so tall. His muscles are huge. How many grades was he kept back? Did you see the thing between his legs. I know! Its got to be the biggest in the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk as you walk confidently threw the halls. All of a sudden Seth, the biggest kid in school. Actually, he was the biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cHey new kid. This is my school. Got it? You follow my rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare shock, but replied \u201cNo. I say that its my school, and your just a follower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked at you with a frown. No one has ever defied him before. \u201cFine. I guess I\u2019ll have to show you who\u2019s boss.\u201d He comes up to you and give you the hardest punch he could give. However, you weren\u2019t even phased. You were a foot taller than him and three times more muscular. Not to mention your penis. It was twice as long as his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201cOh sorry. Did you hit me? I didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d You said with a smirk, and then you gave him a shove. He went flying 10ft back. \u201cOops. I tried to go as light as I could. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth landed on his back with a  thud. The fall knocked all the wind out of him, but when he recovered, you were walking down the hall past him. Seth had just lost his alpha male status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

People looked up at you in awe at your size and the aura of authority you gave off. Everyone knew that you were big. They knew you were tall and muscular, and that your penis was gigantic, but they wanted to know how big. It was obviously the biggest, so you were the top of the social ladder in this school. The social ladder for the boys is based on their manhood's size, and the girls was based on which boy the dated. The bigger the better. There fore, the students base it off of a yearly measure of their size. The school has to order custom made uniforms due to the students' large organ, so when the results get put in, the students see who had the largest pair of underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, all the students went into the gym to get measure for their cloths. It was well known that you had to strip down. (Odd school. Isn\u2019t it?). Everyone is doing it, so you had nothing to fear as long as you weren\u2019t to small. First off were the boys. After and hour and a half of watching teenage boys strip, you were called up. When you got down, you noticed that Seth was in the row right next to you. You took off your cloths and showed off you awesome physique. You had a set of deeply chiseled eight packs, with pectorals that pushed 5in off your body. When you took of your pants, everyone saw your gigantic thighs and calves. However, everyone was waiting for one thing. You tried to take your underwear off, but you had a lot of difficultly, so in the end\u2026 you just ripped them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment they ripped off, a huge mass of manhood fell down with a thump on the ground. There was a pile of pure manhood lying between your feet with watermelon balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to you, Seth stared in awe at you size. He then looked at his mass, and looked down defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they started to measure your size. You were 10ft long. Seth was 5ft long. Everyone else was 3ft long or shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girls started to get measure, the room was filled with moans as the boys struggles to keep their penis from exploding out of their pants. Occasionally, you hear a loud rip as a throbbing rod shot into the air like a flag pole. You had even more difficulty trying to control yourself, but you failed in the end. You penis pulsed once more, and shot out into the air. It was 20ft of steel. Everyone paused as you try to keep yourself from tipping over from the sheer weight of your member.. They all gasped at your size. At the same time, all the boys stopped focusing on stopping their penis from exploding out, so they did. Like a signal, you penis made all the other poles shoot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the room filled with pheromones that attracted all the girls. They all went crazy and ran across the room to the boy\u2019s side and clung to all the members. There had to be 40 girls tackling to member. Massaging, rubbing, biting. It was all to much. You oversized balls went into over time, and shot cum out like a volcano. There was a moment of silence when everyone heard you explode with come, then there was mass hysteria. All the boys started to orgasm at the same time, and the room filled with hot steaming cum. This continued for hours until the everyone calmed down, or fell asleep. You were the last to stop because of your giant over productive balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked around, you saw that everyone was covered in cum, and the floor was flooded in it. The cum four feet deep. Everyone was laying down a sleep or panting from exhaustion. You sighed and smiled. You giant penis had deflated back to 10ft. There were seven girls laying on it asleep. You decided to copy them. You quickly fell into amazing sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when you wake up?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see the logo and realize that your dad\u2019s company was taking the cum as samples for research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and notice that something is different. You look around and realize that you were taller. You look down and see that your penis had gotten longer by a few feet. You drag yourself over, and pick the girls off your penis, and then you carried your penis in your hands, and went to the bathroom. When you got out of the auditorium, you saw that you had to duck to go threw the doors. In the halls, you hair was brushing the ceiling. When you got to the bathroom, you saw an 8ft tall behemoth in the mirror. That person\u2019s muscles were gigantic. It seems like the person\u2019s pectorals blocked his view of his feet (which it did). Not only that, but his penis was 15ft long, and his balls were over stuffed beanbags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201cNo way\u2026\u201d You hear a very deep and sexy sound come out of your mouth. \u201cWow! Didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a minute to explore yourself, and then you went back to the auditorium. By now everyone had gotten up except for a few stragglers. You go over and look for your cloths, but they were all drenched in cum, so you decided not to wear it. Actually, no one put their cloths on because they were all covered in cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principle came in \u201cWow\u2026 This was the biggest one yet.\u201d He wasn\u2019t surprised. It happens every year. Earlier, he called the fire department to come by with a large hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fires trucks drove by and stopped. They took out their hoses, and fired water at everyone until they were mostly all clean. Then they drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principle had also ordered large numbers of sheets to cover people because he know the cloths would all be ruined. They gave everyone a medium white sheet while they had to get an XXXL for you. The only problem with it was that it didn\u2019t support your penis, so you asked them to sew another sheet inside to make a pouch or something that could hold his penis. They did that for a few others, but none were near as big as yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, everyone went home in their makeshift cloths. As you walked, you felt your penis bounce up and down. You could feel the power inside of it. You also felt a strange feeling in your balls. Since they were so big. They were even big proportionally, so they produced more cum and testosterone than thought possible. The testosterone was being pumped into your body making you grow more, but slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got home, you went to your closet and put on some new cloths. Again\u2026 your cloths had grown to fit your new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked around trying to get use to your new body when you remembered the notebook. You walked over to it, and looked inside. You flip threw the pages until you get to the back. You saw a few rules and side effects. One of then was \u201cThe effect of what ever is written will continued until specified to stop at a certain time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and smile. This means that you can keep growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So\u2026 You made it so that your growth would continue threw the day in small spurts.. You laugh as you wonder how you will look in an hour, or a week, or a month!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wrote that down, you walked to the wall and measured your height and body. Especially your penis. It was 15ft long, but not for long. After you took off your cloths to check yourself out, you felt a quick tingle as you shot up an inch, your penis lengthens, and your muscle become more pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201cI guess the wish is working.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put you cloths on and go outside to enjoy the rest of the day. As you walk past a field, you saw kids from your school playing with kids from another more athletic school. The kids at your school were being creams by the other school. You decided to join and help even it out. They were playing foot ball. As you ran and joined, the other team looked slightly worried, but their captain said to just let him handle you. The captain was a large high school student with giant muscles. You looked at him with a smile, but he just glared. The captain hated you school because of the boys, and their special gift. His was big, but it was dwarfed by your school. You made his look miniscule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were running, and tackling, and catching, etc. You felt your muscles pump and build momentum. At one point, some kid tackled you giant penis. It was huge, so it was hard to miss. When he landed in it, he bounced off, and you were uninjured because your penis acted like padding for your balls. As the game continued, you came face to face with the captain. You two were an even match except for one thing. He was more experience, so he started to push you back. As that was happening, you felt a tingle as you shoot up to 8ft6in, and you muscle bounce out. You penis grows from 15ft to 17ft. When your growth stopped, you had become to heavy for him to move, so you started to push on him and made him move back. Lets just say your team won in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything is turning out better than expected, so decided to see how far it can go. You pick up the gold pen and start to write \u201cMy growth will continue at a faster, but more gradual pace. No more spurts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you wrote that, you felt a tingle that told you the effects were taking place. As you walked around getting to know the town, you felt your cloths get tighter, and then they grow to match your body. The process continues even when you get home and get ready for bed. Ever since you were young you slept with only your underwear on. When you looked in the mirror, you saw that you were 9ft tall with abnormally large muscles, and a 20ft penis. Your penis was compacted into your brief. The briefs looked like someone crushed a car into a ball and put it inside. You manhood was so big and heavy, that it made your underwear band slouch and touch the ground. You smirk at your new size, and you were only 13yo. With that, you went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you felt your feet on the ground, and your arms hanging over the sides of your bed. You sit up and you head brushes the 10ft ceiling. \u201cNo ******* way. I\u2019ve got to check this out. You crawl out of bed and sit in front of your mirror. You had to move your 35ft penis out of the way, and saw that you were a giant tank of muscle. \u201cHA! Yes!\u201d You started to kiss you muscles and hug yourself. In your excitement, your penis started to get hard, and smash a hole in the wall. You started to feel an untamable desire to jerk off and orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you started to pull you penis in and out of your wall until \u2018boom\u2018!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were outside at the time, you\u2019d see a giant throbbing rod going in and out of a house. Then out of no where, a jet of white hot fluid gets shot out of the rod. It was sent houses down the street, and into a public pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been satisfied and laid down panting. You look around and saw that you had practically destroyed your room when suddenly, reality changed. Your ceiling shot up to 50ft tall, and your room was the size of a football field. \u201cWow\u2026 So this is my room. How did my parents afford this?\u201d Then you saw a plaque on the wall. \u201cThis stadium is given to Xavier by the town of Testostnia in thanks for bringing new visitors every year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as your realize that your size had put this town on the map, and that he was a major attraction. You put some cloths on from a gigantic closet, and smirked at the fact that they still had cloths that fit you. With that, you went outside, and went to school. When you got outside, there was a crowd of people being held back by police. They all stared in amazement at your 20 ft tall stature and near 40 ft penis. Nothing can describe your balls. You laugh and say hello to everyone. You talked with them for a while until you got bored and went to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got there, you saw that the school had changed into a U shaped stadium. At the opening was a chair marked with the name \u201cXavier\u201d You sit down in the chair and you look around. You see that every floor had at least 50 classrooms, and there were 10 floors. Ever since you can, you made the economy boom and they had extra money to renovate the school. You helped speed up the project by lifting the heavy stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked around, you saw that a large screen appeared from the ground, and that your math teacher was at a computer next to it. To your left was your class mates. You smile as you realize that they had to make changes to that you could still learn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was lunch time, you found out that the town paid for lunch. In front of you was a 10ft diameter plate stacked high with sandwiches, pasta, salads, etc. He dug into it right away. It vanished quickly, and you burped showing your content. When lunch was over, you notice something was off. You were bigger. You looked around and saw that you were 30ft tall now, and your penis had grown even more. It was 60ft long now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve got to fix this.\u201d You run home and about 10 steps. When you get there, you go to your gigantic room, and go to your giant desk. You open your giant drawer, and pull out a giant notebook. You had worried that it would have been small, and that you wouldn\u2019t be able to write in it. With the pen, you write \u201cI wish that I was compressed back into my old frame.\u201d With that, you felt all your body shrink and get denser and denser as the book\u2019s magic compressed your body. When it was done, you were as small as before you grew. \u201cDang! That didn\u2019t work out like I wanted.\u201d You start to write \u201cI would grow until I was the envy of every boy in school.\u201d With that, you started to grow until you were 6ft5in tall. With a large build, and a huge penis. You pectorals rose 3in off your body, and your abs were as hard as diamond. You biceps looked like it could lift 300lbs easily. You legs looked like they could support the empire state building. Then you penis was now 10ft long. Twice as big as Seth\u2019s again. \u201cNow. This is more like it. I think I need something more. Lets make it interesting.\u201d You write down \u201cMy body\u2019s density will increase by 10% every time someone does something that relates to my penis. If they say penis, touch my penis, talk about, or even implies my penis, my body\u2019s density will increase. Also every time I get an erection, my body\u2019s density will increase by 1% for every second my erection lasts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you wrote down your lengthy wish, you decided to test it out. When you looked around, you saw that your room had shrunken down to its previous size, and everything was back to normal except for the fast that your penis was in the world\u2019s record for largest penis. You smile at that, and went outside, and ran back to school. You snuck in before the end lunch bell range, and got to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eyes, you see some girls pointing to you and your penis while gossiping. \u201cDid you see that new kid? He\u2019s huge in more than one way. I know. His penis is huge. I wonder if he was a girl friend. I\u2019d be more than happy to his. You know why? Because the bigger the boy friend the bigger your popularity. Yes, and also because he\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked, you felt yourself get heavier and heavier. You could feel the strength in your body increase. Also you felt an unknown side effect. You balls were getting compressed more and more, but they maintained production as though they weren\u2019t that size. They were producing growth hormones at least 100 times faster than a regular person. You felt like there was a pump shooting water into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they gossiped about you, you felt your desk start to creak until \u2018bam\u2018! Your desk fell apart because it couldn\u2019t hold your weight. This caught everyone\u2019s attention, an they all started to talk about you. You felt the power in your body grow stronger and stronger. As you thought, you felt the floor give way. Your weight made you fall threw the floor, and the next floor, etc. until you hit the basement. At this point, you wrote down \u201cMy density increases but my weight won\u2019t. How ever, I can change my weight. I also wish that the floors and desk were repaired and that I was back in class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, you vanish and reappear at your desk. No body acted out and said you magically appeared. After that, you went to health class where they taught you about your body, and what it does. When they got to the female body, you paid close attention to pictures. While you were staring, your penis started to get hard. Along with every boy in the room. You penis filled out with blood, and touch the ceiling. As each second passed, you could feel your strength exponentially increasing. As your hard-on continued, it started to release strong pheromones that drew all the girls attention. They stared at you and then walked over to your penis and began to massage, and other things\u2026 At the same time, every time they touched you, you get even stronger. After 5min, you orgasm and fill the room with cum. It continued to spill out until the whole room was filled to the ceiling, and that\u2019s when someone open the door. All the cum poured out of the room, and everyone could breath again. However, you were still having an orgasm. When you were done, you had flooded this floor of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He realised that this hurt his ego greatly, and he wanted to get back at seth and his girlfirend. Right before today's game, he snuck into the boy's locker room and broke into Seth's locker. He quickly began to sprinkly a huge amount of iching powder into Seth's cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater (just before the game): Everyone was in the locker room changing when someone started to scream \"What is this?!?!\" Josh was siting on a bench with a small smirk on his face. Then to his surprise, it wasnt Seth started to strip in front of everyone, and ran into the showers. Everyone's face turned red, and they turned away. Seth had no more secrets. The coach come is and asks what's going on? Some one says that Seth started to scream, and ran into the showers. The game was postponed until further notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on in the next day: Josh was walking down the hall to the coach's office. He wasn't sure why he was called, he hoped it was not for what he thinks it was about. When he got there, the coach was sitting in a chair to the side of a small monitor. The screen was showing a certain Josh breaking open a locker, and shaking something inside. Josh knew there was no way out, so he started ask \"What's my penalty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresent time: Josh had just finished cleaning the lockers, and discoovered things that he never wanted to see. He understood why he was given such a seemingly easy punishment. However, it wasnt all bad. He found a wristband, a gold pen, and a some cloths; which was only a package that cometain fresh clean briefs.. He thought about throwing this stuff out, but decided to keeping them instead of wasting this stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater: At home, he decided to try one of the tings on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich did he pick?</span></div></div>",

I get another inch on my penis this year. Ha! I got two, and my balls got bigger too.\u201d Josh got tired of the conversion quickly.

The two junior bodybuilders behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ken. I took this new supplement. Its doing wonder for my muscles.\u201d Josh felt another tingle, but all over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so. Your muscles seem bigger.\u201d Then he felt it again.

I hope I get to school soon.\u201d He was hoping to get to a bathroom to examine himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, the bus arrived at school, and Josh walked quickly to the bathroom. When he got there, he went to the handicap stall because it was roomy, and clean.

His pectorals push out more, and his abs were more defined. He gained a few inches on his arms, and his legs felt stronger. \u201cThis is amazing, but how did this happen?\u201d Josh pondered for a bit, but realized that he might be late for first period, so he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The word muscle popped up at least 15 times, and each time, Josh felt a tingle. His baggy pants and large T-shirt started to feel less and less loose. Josh smirked at what he thought was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the teacher was done, Josh went over to the dumb bells and picked up a 50lb weight, and sat in front of a mirror. As he lifted, he saw that he was definitely bigger than before. He had put on about 25lbs of muscle since he woke up. He admired his growth. Then he had an idea. He whispered \u201cMuscle\u201d Then he felt a tingle as he grew more. Then he said \u201cPenis\u2026 balls.\u201d Then he felt his shorts get a little tighter. \u201cNo way\u2026 Hmm. I wonder.\u201d He thought about getting taller \u201cTall.\u201d Then his point of view rose an inch higher. Josh smirked at what he had just discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he examined himself in the mirror, he looked like he was 6ft6in now, weighing 200lbs, and sporting a significant bulge in his shorts. He was about half the size of Seth, the humongous quarterback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was 7ft tall, 300lbs of raw muscle, and he had a football bulge in his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought \u201cI wonder what would happen if I were the biggest.\u201d However, he thought about how people would react. He would probably be taken to a lab to be tested on, so he thought about doing a few tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked up to his best friend Zak. \u201cHey Zak. Do I look bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak \u201cWhy do you ask. You look the same as yesterday. I know you started a new training routine, but it takes time for the results to show. So don\u2019t be discouraged by me saying \u2018no\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh \u201cOh. Ok. Thanks for the advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak \u201cNo problem!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked away with a guess. First off. His best friend didn\u2019t see any change. Two, his cloths don\u2019t change size with him. Three, he can grow various body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then he said \u201cMuscle\u2026 Muscle\u2026\u201d until he was 400lbs of pure muscle. The muscle was stretched out over his body, but that still left his huge. He was big but not like a muscle bound freak. Then he turned his attention to his penis. After a few chants, he had a 20in penis with balls the size of base balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at his handy work and was impressed with himself. He had to be the biggest kid in the school if not the state. Josh put on the cloths that he stole and found that they fit him nicely. They hugged all his muscles showing off every muscle on his body. His pectorals pushed 4in off his body, and he had a deep 6pack, broad shoulders, a thickly muscled neck, and tree trunks for legs. When he moved, he could feel all the power he had in his body. With he flexed, he could see the shirt move to show off his amazing physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to go show off, and stepped back into the weight room. When he got there, everyone was till doing their thing, but now a lot of the girls were eyeing Josh with interest. Josh stepped over to the dumb bells again and started to lift 100lb weights in each hand with ease. A group gathered around him, and started to chant and woot and your display of strength. While they were doing that, Josh felt his cloths get a little tighter because kids were commenting on his muscles, height, and endowment. Josh cut it short and left to change into baggier cloths, and get ready for the next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You called you mom to come by, and she was a little worried. The nurse told here that the seasons are changing and the change in weather reduces the immune system. She said that I probably had a minor flu and should get some rest when I get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*One ride from mom later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh slowly walks up stairs and goes to his room while his mom is downstairs making chicken noodle soup. While she\u2019s doing that, Josh lays in bed wondering what makes him grow. He started to go through the events, and felt like it had to do with his wristband. Josh looked at the wristband, and took it off. When he took it off, he had an empty feeling. Then he said \u201cMuscle\u201d, but nothing happened. He tried again with the same results. Then he put the wristband back on, and said \u201cMuscle\u201d, and he felt himself grow. \u201cSo this is what made me grow. Awesome! Not only of it could grow my cloths.\u201d Then Josh felt a slight tingle on his wrist. He looked down and saw the letters on the wristband change from \u201cYour Inner Self Outside\u201d to \u201cThe Life You Want to Live\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished reading, he looked around and saw that everything had changed. His room\u2019s ceiling was higher, and he had a huge trophy case. He looked in his closet and saw that his cloths were his size. It seemed like reality changed to match his size. \u201cThis is amazing. My life is totally different.\u201d At that instance, Josh saw a new reality flash before him. He saw himself grow normally like before until he hit puberty. When that happened, he was the biggest kid every grade ever since. \u201cWow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door. \u201cJosh honey. I made some chicken soup.

It was the size of the pot she cooked it in. \u201cI eat this much!\u201d Josh started to dig in and realize how much he really could eat.

Just write it down.\u201d After that, the warm feeling faded, and you realized that you had written something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh \u201cWhat do I wish for?\u201d Josh thought about it and wrote \u201cI wish I was bigger.

How?\u201d Then you remembered \u201cThe pen!\u201d You get up and feel slightly disorientated because of your increased height. You walk carefully to your deck and look at the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye and saw a huge teenager. You were previously 6ft5in weighing a decent 180 lbs of muscle. Now you were 7ft tall with 220 lbs of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh \u201cNo ******* way!\u201d You then remember another part of your wish.

You put some on some cloths, and they hugged your muscles nicely. When you looked in the mirror, your polo shirt displayed your large bowling ball biceps, 6 packs that were deeply chiseled, and a pair of pectorals that pushed 3in off your body. Your pants clung tightly to your thighs and calves. When you walked, you could see your diamond cut calves bounce. The last thing was that you sported a large bulge between your thighs. You tried to rearrange it to be more comfortable, but it was just to big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you went downstairs for breakfast.

You smirk at their confusion, and play along so you aren\u2019t suspected for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at his penis and say that it was not 30in long, with bowling balls for balls. He gasped at its size, but smile afterwards. Then he looked at his body. It seems kind of large and disproportional to your body. He was big, but decided to be bigger to match his gift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe look around again and saw that every one else seemed a bit off as well, he decided to grab his pen and write \u201cEvery boy that attends my school will grow taller by 6in, their muscles would increase by 75%, and that they will continue to grow, with a 5% increase in height, muscle, and penis per year, until they are thirty. Does not include Seth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished that, you felt yourself grow bigger and taller. You fixed your wish so that you got taller so your muscles didn\u2019t look so freaky on you. When you looked around, you saw that everyone else was bigger a well, and they were confused. However, they didn\u2019t complain. Except Seth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared in awe, and was furious at why he didn\u2019t grow. His penis had gotten bigger, but he didn\u2019t grow like the other. He was still bigger than most of the kids in the school, but just barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh saw Seth\u2019s reaction, and went one step further. He wrote \u201cEvery boy smaller than Seth will grow slightly large than him.\u201d When you wrote that, you heard a few boys yelling as their cloths started to squeeze them. The sighed after you heard several ripping sounds. You smile to yourself as you see everyone get huge. Every boy was a hunk now, and no girl could complain about their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard boys commenting on other boys, and they talked. All the girls were in a corner freaking out, but they settled down and commented and chatted. It was kind of awkward because most of the boys were naked, and those who weren\u2019t became naked soon. Everyone except Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some of the scientists wanted to take a sample of blood but with no parents around that would take to long.  SO the school was dismissed early with every student given a slip which would permit these men to take a blood sample.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked home, deciding the buss would be way to crowded.  He walked by a Mc Grumbles and felt his stomach growl.  \"Might as well eat,\" he said before going in.  After using the Pen to make a hundred appear in his wallet to cover, he sat down with his large order and ate the, to him, tiny burgers.  He looked over to another booth and saw Fredrick Hamston, the safety of the team, with his girlfriend sitting on his lap and feeding him French fries.  Her hands rubbed over his body and it was clear she loved every inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh set down his extra large soda and thought.  He was the one with the power and the huge size but still alone.  He was the one to grow to incredible sizes but if Jen was any sign, he could be used until she had enough of him.  Or be interested in his status not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took out the notebook and Pen once more.  Logic was never his strong suit but his parents were able to make sure he understood conditionals.

She held some books in front of her and her backpack looked heavy from all the books she carried.  If Josh didn't trust in the power of the Pen, he would have not considered her any worth at all.  She took a deep breath and walked over.  Upon closer inspection, he saw she had small breasts, probably no larger than A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was supposed to be his perfect match?  Well, the Pen had done everything so far to make his world better, best trust it here.  If he didn't like it, he could always change things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Josh said curtly.  The girl smiled as she looked up at the giant student.  He looked at her face and knew it was familiar, but from where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Josh.  May I sit?\" she asked.  Josh waved his hand and she sat across from him with her legs pressed against his massive legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Josh asked after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um . . . Gabrielle.  Gabrielle Johnson,\" she said.  \"I'm in Economics with you.\"  Josh nodded and closed his eyes to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Jen's cousin,\" he finally said.  It wasn't just in class, but on photos in Jen's home when he met her parents.  There were photos of some family reunion he glanced over with who he considered the \"Hot and Not\" in a photo of Jen and who now sat before him.  He opened his eyes and looked at the scowl on Gabrielle's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like the same scowl Jen gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said.  \"That bitch is my cousin.\"  Josh smiled at the insult.  \"I think she was wrong to dump you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Josh asked.  Gabrielle nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have an ego so large it makes your body seem small, but you have a good side too,\" Gabrielle said.  \"You're also not an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that mean?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I am Mr. Banks' student help, remember?  I get a peak at everyone's grades.  Despite you fooling around, you do get high Bs and low As at Economics,\" Gabrielle replied.  Josh nodded but honestly didn't.  Part of her being so plain meant he really never cared about her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now that I know you stalk me, why are you here?\"  Josh asked.  He watched her blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I've always liked you,\" Gabrielle said.  She looked down.  \"Ever since freshman year when you stopped Todd Markham from bullying me.\"  Josh nodded as he recalled the fight.  He honestly wasn't doing it to protect her.  Todd had sucker punched him earlier and Josh was returning the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want Gabrielle?\" Josh asked.  Gabrielle met his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A business proposition.  You want to get back at my bitch-of-a-cousin, right?\"  Josh nodded.  \"Well, then what about dating me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh did his best to keep a neutral face.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you may have too many other options,\" Gabrielle continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  And why not?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of your freak genetics.  Look at yourself!\" Gabrielle said.  He looked at his powerful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a huge hunk,\" he said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some would call you a monster.  You are what? Eight feet six inches?  Eight feet ten?  You have a dick that could kill most women.  And God only knows if you aren't done growing,\" Gabrielle said.  Josh said nothing for a moment.  \"Most girls will hang out with the next star of the football team, the Adonis of the school.  But if I doubt many would be willing to take all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you would?\" Josh asked.  Gabrielle nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would.  I liked you before you got huge.  And now I only see more of what I like,\" Gabrielle said.  \"Besides, this would only be pretend to get back at Jen.  She dumped you, betting on the big man, only for the big man to be a runt now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I start going out with her, no offense, runt of a cousin,\" Josh said.  Gabrielle nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.  Compared to her body, I am,\" Gabrielle said.  Josh thought about Jen.  Thought how angry she would be if he was kissing her cousin.  He liked the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we have a deal,\" Gabrielle said, reaching her hand out.  Josh's hand smothered her hand and wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, shall we practice now?\" Josh asked.  His eyes looked to Fredrick  Gabrielle followed and saw the sight.  She nodded.  Slipping out, she walked over and sat on Josh's lap.  She didn't even come up past his pecs.  One hand gently rubbed his chest.  The other stroked his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt very nice.</span></div></div>",

He held her close to his massive chest and somehow, it felt really nice.  His thick arms keeping her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe practice proved wee put as soon after they started, Jen showed up.  Josh just glanced at Gabrielle who kissed him with more passion than a fake out make out should have had.  That really got him going and nearly broke the table from the passion this tiny girl was making him feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen screeched and stormed out in a fit.  Gabrielle was smiling when she broke away and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would meet him in front of his house the next day.  Josh simply nodded and watched her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one hell of a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Josh sat in his room, looking at himself in the mirror.  Or better to say looking at his chest because he was too tall for his room.  His parents were worried about his sudden changes but a quick change with the pen and they remembered the weird family genetics they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat on the floor of his room and licked his lips.  The kiss was still on his mind.  Taking out the pen and some paper, he wrote down, <i>Tonight, I will share a dream with Gabrielle.  She will not realize it is a dream but still be in full control.  I can wake up at anytime I wish.</i>  Yawning, the massive teen fell onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Note to self, make bed bigger in morning,\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness was around him before his eyes opened.   He was in a bath outside.    There were really tall trees all around him.  Part of him wondered where he was but really didn't care.  He looked over his body.  Everything was Huge with a capital H.  He didn't know how big he was but he liked it.  His muscular body glistened with signs of being exposed to the sun quite frequently.  He looked around and began to wonder where Gabrielle was, when she appeared wearing only a bottom half of a bikini.  Her breasts were larger now, more than what Jen ever had.  She walked with confidence and a swagger.  Her face had a erotic beauty about it.  The kind that made men and women want to get closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also smaller than before.  She walked to the pool, as that is what it had to be, and jumped in, swimming to Josh' penis slowly getting harder and larger.  She sat herself upon the growing organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My handsome giant,\" she said as she looking him up to down.  \"How is everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh never better,\" Josh said.  He shook with each stroke and kiss she gave his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy I found how to activate that growth gene at will in you,\" she said.  \"You are such a handsome hunk.\"  Josh smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are an exotic beauty, my little lady,\" Josh said with a smile.  Gabrielle laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make me feel so happy,\" Gabrielle whispered but Josh' ears picked it up perfectly.  \"You are so strong, muscular, and powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you just say the same thing three times?\"  Gabrielle shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong because you could have had any one you wanted, man or woman, but you still picked me,\" Gabrielle said.  She looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you liked me for me, not just my muscles and the semi you are on,\" Josh replied.  Josh lifted her head with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are muscular because of those beautiful genes, and because of my research into you, I got my doctorate,\" Gabrielle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to be of help,\" Josh said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And powerful because even though you could control so much of this town, you don't,\" Gabrielle said.  \"You make such a wonderful husband and father.\"  Josh froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he whispered but before Gabrielle could respond, he heard some thumping and from the treeline two young boys stood with huge muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" they called happily and ran to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already they are five and seven feet tall,\" Gabrielle said, \"Such big boys for a four and six year old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will mommy's new baby be big like us?\" one boy, the taller one, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh most definitely,\" Gabrielle said as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wake up now!</i>\" Josh thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes flashed open and he shook his head in disbelief.  \"Well, you wanted someone to like you for you,\" Josh muttered as he saw the sun up.  He yawned and rose up and up and up.  He was even more hunched over than he was last night.  \"Guess her dream about my size could some true.\"  Looking into his closet, Josh found his clothes grew once more and he dressed in them.  After thinking on it, he went to the pen, which seemed to get a bit bigger too.  Josh smiled as this made using it easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Every guy at my school will find their clothes large enough to fit them but not think it is important.  Does not include Seth.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Josh went down and ate a mountain of a breakfast before carrying his backpack in his one hand.  He looked up and down when a hot looking car came up and stopped in front of him.  It was a convertible with some adjustments.  Namely the passenger seat was removed.  Gabrielle sat in the front and looked up at him with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey handsome,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, how . .  where .  . .?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandpa gave it to me in his will.  Not the one I share with the bitch,\" Gabrielle said.  She took a second glance at Josh.  \"Merciful God, did you grow overnight too?\"  Josh laughed and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" he said.  Gabrielle smiled and pulled a tape measure out of her purse.  She stepped out and came to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lift me up, unless you aren't strong enough,\" she said.  Josh nodded and brought her to eye level with one hand.  \"Hold this with the other hand,\" she said as she held up the end of the measure.  Josh gripped it gently and set down Gabrielle with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the verdict?\" he asked as she looked at the final result.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't help but flex, in the middle of the gym, uncaring of those viewing you.  You examined your swollen bicep, your huge pecs, and thick legs, all bigger than just a few moments ago.  You smirked, lifting up your shirt, and viewing you larger, tighter abs.  You even looked a bit taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to flex as hard as you could, noticing something happening.  The massive bulge in your gym shorts throbbed, as you began to grow erect.  Your eyes widened, as you realized you were visibly growing.  You took a few steps closer to the mirror, and flexed more.  You watched your biceps slowly filling up, like a balloon inflating at a slow rate.  You look down at your hands, watching them thicken and lengthen.  You look back at yourself in the mirror, watching your head slowly, centimeter by centimeter, rise upward.  your stomach began to expose itself, as your shirt was no longer long enough for you.  Your knees were slowly becoming more exposed as the shorts moved upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge in your shorts moved outward, pushing your shorts out, as your penis grew erect, and forced it's way upward, and began to harden further, poking out of the waist band of your shorts, and moving upward.  People began to stare and gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, get that shit out of here.\"  One guy said to you, but you ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck...is that guy growing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed a bit, as the growing picked up.  Your shirt tightened around your growing body, your back muscles flaring outward, as your shoulders moved up and out.  Your cock was at full erection now, as you continued to grow.  \"Bigger...\"  You whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave...\"  someone said, as they walked up to you, and stopped, shocked by your growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were passing 6'9\" in height now, and kicked off your uncomfortable, shrinking shoes.  You pulled down on your shorts, and let them drop to the floor.  You grabbed the side of your shirt, and ripped it off in one movement.  \"Want me to leave?  That's fine.\"  You said, walked toward the exit.  Everyone stared in awe, your giant erection swinging left and right, your giant, growing balls bouncing.  You got the exit, and laughed, the doorway to short for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped outside, and people gasped and watched you.  You stood still, your arms at your hips, and just basked in the sunlight, which seemed to fuel your growth.  Your body swelled faster, bigger, harder, stronger.  You grunted a bit, as the growth began to cause sensations in your body.  Your skin felt tight, your muscles sore, pushing outward and upward.  You curled over a bit, bending your knees and pulling your hands in front of you, making a dragon-ball-z-power-up stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunted, your body growing.  \"How is this happening?\"  You heard someone say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people left, scared of what was happening.  Some stared in awe.  You passed 7'6\" in height now, with massive body builder muscles, and a 16 inch penis, and softball sized balls.</span></div></div>",

Your balls were bigger than your head. Grunting in ecstasy, you watched as your pecs grew into two monitor-sized plates of steel, and your abs quickly grew into a 12-pack, with diamond-hard obliques running across your sides. Your biceps were 90\" around unflexed. Your thighs were thicker than tree trunks, and your calves looked like overstuffed hams.<br>\r\nAs your muscles grew even thicker, you felt your balls start itching, and knew an orgasm was approaching. Furiously beating off, your muscles quickly doubled in size, your dick over 4 feet long and thicker than your legs were before all the growth had happened.

I think I feel it inside of me, but its kind of in an awkward place\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps looked even more worried \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where, but if it dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen point toward his groin and sighs \u201cUmm\u2026 Its somewhere around there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cUmm\u2026 Gramps. How do you plan on getting it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell first we have to scan for what it is. Then we have to do something unpleasant.\u201d Gramps whispers something into Gwen\u2019s ear causing her face to go red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI\u2019m out of here. Tell me how it goes later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked confused \u201cWait! What are we going to do after the scan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYou\u2019ll find out, and Gwen\u2026 you can wait outside if that\u2019s what you want. It might get a little unpleasant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen leaves and Gramps rummages around for his scanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk. I got it now. Ben you\u2019ll have to take off all your cloths for the scanner to get the proper readings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned red \u201cUm\u2026 do I have to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed \u201cYes\u2026 I don\u2019t like to get up in people\u2019s personal space, but its sometime necessary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed defeated, but he still grumbled when he was taking off his cloths. As he took off his cloths, he realized that something was off. He saw his stomach with a faint six pack, and his pecs were a little bigger. He looked at his arms and saw decent sized biceps. \u201cThat\u2019s odd. When did I get these?\u201d Ben looked like he gained a few pounds of muscle. Not to much. He also got an inch or two taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps looked astonished, but not the bad kind \u201cI think I know what hit you, but I don\u2019t know until I run a scan. Now lay down. You\u2019ll feel a slight tingle, but it wont hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laid down and waited as Gramps took out a strange boomerang shaped device out and turned it on. Lights started to flash and a laser scanner materialized. Gramps ran it over Ben a few times until it located any foreign objects. Which happened when the scanner focused in on Ben\u2019s reproductive organ. After a moment, the laser vanished and a hologram of a baseball sized orb appeared above the scanner. A list of descriptions and properties appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI thought so. The thing that hit you last night was a crystal of growthium. It is extremely rare, and found on only one planet. However, that planet had vanished millions of years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 what does it do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWhat ever samples that exist are highly sought after for their unique ability to enhance all physical attributes of any living organism. They size of each orb of growthium has always been the size of a pea, but yours is the size of a baseball. No human has ever gotten a sample of this stuff, so we don\u2019t know what it does it us. However, by looking at what its done to you in the past hour, I think its safe to assume that it makes your muscles grow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! I wonder how fast I grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps looked at Ben frowning \u201cWe still have to remove it from your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Gramps shocked \u201cDo we really? Its isn\u2019t hurting anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was about to say no, but Ben made a puppy dog face. Gramps sighed \u201cYou can keep it for a little while. We\u2019ll have to see it\u2019s effects on you though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen perked up instantly \u201cYay! Love ya gramps!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smile  \u201cEveryone love gramps when he says yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo how fast do you think I\u2019ll grow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cLets get some measurements first. What were you before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 I was 4 ft 10in and about 90lbs\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps takes out a scale and some measuring tape. Ben steps on the scale and it said he was 10lbs heavier. Then Gramps measured him and it showed that he was now 5ft tall exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAwesome! How long has it been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cAbout 1hrs since we found you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only if it could fix that brain of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at her and was about to comment when Gramps gave him a hard look. Ben realized that if he doesn\u2019t control his temper, people could get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was waiting for an insult, but it didn\u2019t come. \u201cBen\u2026 are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sigh dejectedly \u201cYah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Then out of no where \u201cHow bout those smores!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*A few days later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was sitting down reading her spell book again, and gramps was making phone calls. Ben, however, was bench pressing a tree. He had grown se that he was 5ft 6in tall with 300lbs of muscle. His muscles looked ridiculous on his body, but Ben had yet to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps got out of the Rustbucket and went over to Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSame as usual. Trying to see how strong he is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI think its time to get it out of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah. I don\u2019t wanna be mean, but those muscle are starting to get freaky. The first day, he was kind of cute, but not so much any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Ben was listening to their conversation. Hear them say this stuff about him made him angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if I look freaky. I\u2019m super strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Gramps turn around in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBe reasonable. How are you going to tell you mom and dad! \u2018Oh\u2026 I had a super growth spurt over the summer?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen fumed \u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cCome on Ben. Remember you said that you didn\u2019t want to be super huge just a few days ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat was then. This is now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was about to say something, but he didn\u2019t get to because Ben turned around and ran into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThere he goes\u2026 are we going to do anything about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed \u201cWe should, but it won\u2019t matter. Only he can decide\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back with Ben*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had enough of their criticism, and just turned away. He just wanted some place quiet so that he could fume. Eventually, he reached some inland lake. He found a fallen tree, and sat on it. He stared into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIts not fair! I found the dang thing, but they want to take it away. Its mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just sat there and talked himself out of his anger. Eventually, his thoughts drifted over the lake. He looked at his reflection and wasn\u2019t as happy as he thought he would be. There was a kid that looked like a 15 yo staring back. He was average height, but his tremendous bulk made him look shorter. He was about as wide as he was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cMaybe they were right.\u201d Silently, Ben wished that he was smaller. A size that was his age, but slightly above average. After a moment, Ben felt a strange sensation. Something that was totally new to him. It was a tremendous wave of pleasure surging over him from his now 20in long rock hard penis. Instinctively, Ben took off his pants and started to jack off. However, instead of cum coming out, a strange bulge formed at the base of his shaft and worked its way to the top. When it got there, a green sphere popped out. However, the strangeness didn\u2019t stop there. While Ben continued to wallow in his pleasure, his muscle seemed to shrink down. When Ben calmed down, he was confused at what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat has happened?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was now 5ft 2in tall with a slightly above average build. He didn\u2019t look freaky huge, but more on the really athletic side. He could pass for a 13yo instead of a 10, but that was ok. Ben was a above average in every aspect, and not just muscle. There was a certain organ that seemed slightly out of proportion from that rest of his body. It was about 7in long, but it didn\u2019t seem like much in the mind of a 10yo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared at himself admiring his smaller appearance. \u201cI think this is good.\u201d Then there was a flash of green at his feet and he saw the green orb. Ben picked it up and he looked at it. He tried gave it a closer look by putting it in the sunlight. As the sunlight passed threw the green crystal, the light turned green and landed on Ben. Ben felt a slight tingle in all his muscles as though they were growing, but got compressed instantly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took it out of the light and the feeling stopped, but when he put it back, the feeling returned. \u201cIt must be the sunlight passing though the orb\u201d Ben concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of examining his new body, he decided that it was time to return to the Rustbucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben got back, Gramps and Gwen were surprised to see that Ben had shrunk down. They asked a few questions, and Ben tried to answer as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cLet me see the crystal.\u201d Ben hands it over, and gramps looks at it curiously. \u201cWell\u2026 this is indeed a growthium crystal ball, but its is several time large than ordinary ones. All others that have been found are only the size of a pearl, but this on is the size of a baseball. I wonder what that does to its growing properties. Usually, these orbs work only on the first organism it finds. That\u2018s until it dies of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared at the orb trying to understand its abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBen\u2026 may I try something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cSure.

If others could, then everyone would try to steal it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026 Also Gramps. I have a question. What happened to my muscles. I\u2019m not complaining. I thought about what you two said, and I agree. I\u2019m cool with my size right now, but I can\u2019t get over this strange feeling. Everything feels lighter than a feather. Even that tree is light, though it takes a little effort to lift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps though for a moment \u201cStay here for a moment, I have to get something.\u201d Gramps vanished into the Rustbucket and returned with a regular looking weight scale. \u201cStep on the scale Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked up to the scale and got on it. As soon as he did, the numbers jumped to 800lbs. \u201cWow! How can I weigh so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cIf I what I think is correct, then your growth has been compressed into your current body. This has never happened with the other orbs. Let me try something.\u201d Gramps takes Ben\u2019s orb and lets the sunlight pass threw it and onto Ben. As soon as it hits, the number on the scale jumped up, and wouldn\u2019t stop until Gramps removed the orb. \u201cI thought that would happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIt feels weird. When I grow, everything is all tingly. It must be because I\u2019m growing so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell\u2026 isn\u2019t this peachy\u2026 Ben has the most dangerous weapon in the universe, and he also has the rarest and most unique crystal in the universe.

You seem a bit on edge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell. Its not fair. Ben always gets the cool stuff. All I can do is read spells and what not. I can only improve so much on my own, but it seems like the universe is throwing all the good stuff at Ben. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t want all the muscle stuff. Just a way to improve my abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Gwen and understood her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps looked at Gwen and smiled \u201cWell. If that\u2019s what you want, all you had to do was ask.

You\u2019re acting just like Ben. I have to go in and get it first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen quieted down because she was ashamed of acting like Ben, but the excitement inside her threatened to burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps came back with a small chest. \u201cOk. This will be test number 1. Open this box. If you can, then you ca have what ever is inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat?!?! I thought it\u2019d be a present.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cIt is, but this is a gift from the planet your grandma came from. It is a test to see if you can handle what\u2019s inside. If you pass, then you can take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at the box defiantly. She wouldn\u2019t be stopped by a simple test. Gwen walked up to the box. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled in total confidence. \u201cOk. I\u2019m going to put it on the ground. Give us a moment to get away because our bodies aren\u2019t designed to handle the energy given off by the test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk\u2026 thanks for the heads up.\u201d Gramps and Ben walked away. When they were far enough not to be seen, Gwen proceeded to open the box. The box had an ancient design. It was encrusted in purple pearls and spheres. The silver surrounding the box was molded into complex patterns. The whole box was an enchantment. As Gwen\u2019s fingers touched the box, there was a spark, and the box opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s it!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen turned around surprised to hear Ben\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Gramps aid it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHe was just being overly cautious. Nothing even happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen tried to counter, but had to admit that she had expected more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell? What\u2019s in the box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all the confusion, Gwen didn\u2019t even look inside the box. Gwen took out an object that was cloaked in a purple cloth. She slowly unwrapped the object and she saw a silver bracelet that had a trinket shaped like a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was about to say something, but Gramps came running into the clearing. \u201cBen!!! I told you it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell. Nothing happened. Gwen touched the box, and it opened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps turned to Gwen in surprise \u201cIt seems to me that you are stronger that you appear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cEver citizen of your race can open that box. Each time, they get something from it. However, it takes time for the box to open because it need to absorb a large amount of mana before it opens. There for, it takes time for weaker people to open it. About a year or even longer. If it opened that fast, then your level of magic muscle be very high.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cReally?\u201d Gwen said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at her slightly jealous at how fast his sudden changes were so easily put aside. However, he was still curious as to what Gwen got. \u201cWhat did you get anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell lets see. It different for every person that uses magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen took out the bracelet. \u201cWell. Its this silver bracelet. It has a purple book/trinket that looks like its made of a purple gem stone of something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell. There\u2019s only one way to find out. Put it on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen slipped the bracelet on but nothing happened. \u201cUmm\u2026 Gramps. Does it take time or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps thought for a moment, then he said \u201cSome times, these things have a trigger. It could be a phrase or emotion\u2026 Just something to get it going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was quiet until Ben spoke up \u201cI think there\u2019s a word on your little trinket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at the purple book attached to her bracelet \u201cVERITAS\u2026\u201d As soon as she said that word, the purple book glowed so bright that everyone had to close their eyes. When the purple light faded away, there was a purple, gem encrusted book in Gwen\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAwesome!\u201d What does the book say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI don\u2019t know. Let me open it.\u201d Gwen flipped to the first page and saw that everything was in English. Except of the runes and symbols. Those were written in the language of her species. There were spells on every page, but the weirdest part was that they were written so the Gwen understood it perfectly. \u201cThis is amazing. It seems like every spell in the universe is in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps gasped \u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026 looks like the book from the stories of your original planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk. Grab a chair or something. This will take a while to explain. It\u2019ll be dark before I finish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just grabs a folding chair and sit down with the green orb on his firmly chiseled chest and rock hard six pack. As the sun hit it, it increased his muscle density instantly. However, something was wrong.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d take a seat if I were you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA long time ago, on Gwen ancestor\u2019s planet, the mages or the planet were in a struggle of power along with the rest of the universe. Every species wanted one thing, while the others wanted another. So there were wars fought over small issues. The planet of Anodyne, Gwen\u2019s ancestor\u2019s, and its inhabitants were sought after for their assistance because of their unique abilities. Your people obliged to help what ever cause they believed in, and they generally agreed. Except for this one time only. A spunky Anondite, the inhabitants of Anodyne, named Xen was traveling the skies like most teenagers of your race. However, he was unlucky enough to meet Deceit. This monster of an alien had the slipperiest tongue in the universe. He could weave a lie so complex that it seems to take on a life of its own. He got to Xen and told him a lie about an upcoming rebellion within their society. One half wanted to dominate the universe while the other half wanted to retain peace. Deceit lied about wanting peace, and he told about a future so beautiful that Xen had no choice but to agree. Together they worked for the next decade gathering allies and collecting resources. After that, things began to move a lot faster. Xen and Deceit and their army of a million Anondites, and other aliens faced off against the supposed evil. This supposed evil was Xen\u2019s grandpa, Spectus, or Watcher. Spectus has seen the change in his grandson long ago and turned to his Donum, his gift from the box. It was a purple gem encrusted book. He opened it and said \u201cVeritas. I wish to learn the truth.\u201d With that, the book glowed and words began to appear.<br>\r\nThe book \u201cXen has been deceived by Deceit. Deceit wishes to take over Anodyne and enslave all of your people. I advise you use spell 598.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpectus \u201cOh yes. A most apt spell. It reveals the intent of all living things. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book \u201cNo problem. Glad to help. You better hurry. Deceit is nearing your walls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpectus sighed and stepped out into his balcony. He made a few signs in the air and wave of light washed over the land. As it passed over the army, everyone saw the lie that had covered the truth and chaos ruled the army. Everyone went everywhere. Deceit glared at Spectus as his army dissipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpectus \u201cDeceit. When will you learn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeceit glared and let out a roar that shook the soul of every person that heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpectus \u201cVeritas. What do you think is the best way to show this monster the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book \u201cMaybe threw a lie. Let him live his fantasies in his dreams for all eternity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpectus \u201cWhat a nice solution. What would I do without you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book \u201cA lot actually. Its nice to talk to someone though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpectus \u201cTrue\u2026 true. Now let see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpectus casts a spell on Deceit sending him into eternal sleep and restoring peace to their planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cGwen. I think you have to book of the Great Spectus. His book was his greatest advisor and resource. It holds the \u2018TRUTH\u2019 of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at her trinket with new interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was laying on his bed sleeping like usual. History lessons  had always bored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI wonder\u2026\u201d Gwen took out hew book and opened it \u201cVeritas. What I want to know the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book glowed a bit and word started to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book \u201cHello Gwen. I\u2019ve been waiting. It been a boring millennia with out Spectus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at the book surprisingly \u201cUmm. Sorry. This is kind of new to me so its kind of awkward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBook \u201cHah! Spectus said the same thing when he was a tyke. Fine\u2026 Just use spell 168 to give me an illusion of a body. It\u2019ll help break the ice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen did as he said and a boy about 13yo appeared. The kid had dirty blond hair and a Hawaiian tan. He was athletically muscle from what could have been surfing. The boy had on some casual looking cloths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy spoke \u201cHey. Looking nice. The last body I had was a woman that was in her 20\u2019s. Spectus had wanted a wife. It seems that this is what you look for in a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen\u2019s face turned bright realizing that this was something she had created in her mind, and that it was true. \u201cN-n-n-nooo. I-ii-I-its just.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBook \u201cGottcha! Its good to pull a leg every now and then. don\u2019t worry. I got your back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was still sitting in his chair astonished by what he\u2019s seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBook \u201cAhh\u2026 Gramps. I think your someone Gwen looks up to. Fun but serious. I respect that. Nice to meat you. I\u2019m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWho?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy \u201cGwen has to name me first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked up \u201cUmmm. I have to name you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy \u201cYes. What do you want it to be. You can call me Veritas like Spectus did, or you could change it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cUmm. How about Seth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBook \u201cOhh\u2026 a human name. That\u2019s new. Yah I like that. That is if you\u2019re asking me if I like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah. Ok Seth. Umm. Is there anything I should know about that is going to happen soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWell. You\u2019ll get to Mt Rushmore in about an hour. Also, Ben growthium crystal in Ben\u2019s pocket is changing Ben so that he knows where all the other crystals are. It seems like the crystal is trying to get Ben to bring them all together. Also, I\u2019ll tell you one more thing when Ben wakes up. For now, I\u2019ll just get used to this illusion of a body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was dumbstruck by how alive Seth was. Previously, he was just a spell book, but now he was something that is alive with actual emotions and opinions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*An hour later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBen! Get up. We have to get you in Mt. Rushmore before you weigh as much as the earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHuh? Wah? 5 more min.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI think spell 9 will get him up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cCare to share?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment later\u2026 \u201cAhh! I\u2019m up. I\u2019m up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk Seth. What were you going to tell us when Ben woke up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cOh right\u2026 You know that orb in Ben\u2019s hand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYah. It originated from the Green planet next to the green sun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cYah well\u2026 Every time the planet released a crystal, it got smaller. Each crystal is in fact a piece of the planet. Any how\u2026 the sun that the planet was next to released an energy that gave the crystal its ability to grow. However, it is about to super nova. All aliens in the universe are trying to harness its power to their own purposes. I suggest that you get Ben that thing of yours quickly and get over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think its from Ben.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \"If you must know, effects of your ray are wearing off due to his tremendous weight. I believe that when they fully wear off, that Ben will weigh a couple million pounds. You won't make it to Mt. Rushmore in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \"Gramps! What are we going to do? If they wear off, can we re apply it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \"No we can't. The gun only had one shot due to the amount of energy it takes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \"Seth! Do you have a solution?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \"I was hoping you'd ask. I think that spell 163 is the best choice. It makes the object its being cast on weigh as much as it looks. It was mainly used on Dense-onians due to their high density. It made them incredibly heavy, and nearly impossible to subdue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \"Thanks\" Gwen starts flipping threw 'Seth' until she found the spell. When she started to chant, purple lights began to materialize around Ben, and purple tattoos started to glow a around Gwen's body. Gwen finished the spell just in time because the bed that Ben was on was starting to collapse. *crack* *splinter*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen woke up with a start \"Huh!? What happened? What'd i miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen groans and Gramps sighed with relief. Seth on the other hand smiled with satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \"Idiot! You almost got sucked into the earth! Or worse! You earth could have been sucked into you. You skull is as dense as your muscles...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps calmed Gwen down and Ben said \"At least nothing bad happened. I\u2019m alive\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cTrue\u2026 How are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cFine\u2026 Never better actually. My arms felt heavier before compared to now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI can explain that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Seth in surprise \u201cWho are you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cOh\u2026 I\u2019m Gwen\u2019s book. She gave me this fake body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared dumbstruck but that soon changed \u201cThat\u2019s wicked awesome! You look my age. We could go to the same school and stuff. Though its awkward to know that you\u2019re a book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth frowned, but smile in the end \u201cAnyway. Your arms feel lighter because they weight as much as a normal arm at that size. You still have all the density and strength as before though. Just not the weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! What else changed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThat\u2019s all the current spell did to you. However, when Gwen received me from the box, your orb was greatly effected by the tremendous energy released. The orb is now making you denser without the need of light, and the orb made it so you can detect the energy signature of other orbs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIs that what it is? Cause I\u2019ve felt a pull from the sky ever since Gwen got you, but its getting even stronger. Like something is about to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWell. That is caused by the only green star in the universe. It is on a dead line to supernova in a couple of day. You should hear news about it from the plumbers in a couple of minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cSorry for barging in on the conversation, but are you psychic of something? How do you know all this stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThat a simple question. The answer is magic. I exist because of magic, and my capabilities are working with magic. Magic is everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sat quietly comprehending the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBack to my question. What about the green star. What\u2019s different about this supernova that makes it so special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWhat do you think made your orb so special? It is the last orb created from the green planet. Technically, it is the green planet. Anyway\u2026 as the planet orbit the green sun, it absorbed the energy the sun released. The energy absorbed altered the chemical atomic composition of the planter giving it incredibly unique properties. Which you already know about. However, this energy is special because it makes things \u2018stronger\u2019. When a regular star goes supernova, it had a sudden burst of power that allows it to make something beyond its original capabilities. Even I do not know because it isn\u2019t magic that does this. It is part of the physical universe. Also, the energy released from the supernova could prove beneficial to any race that can grab hold of it. In the wrong hands, the universe could be controlled by one ruler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sat with his jaw hanging wide open as though he heard the story of his life. \u201cHow can we stop them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI do not know. It does not correspond with magic, so my knowledge is limited on this matter. However, just as there are evil alien out there, there are good aliens that wish to maintain the order of the universe. These two sides are about to go to war.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWe have to get up their and help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen speaks up finally \u201cOk\u2026 I\u2019ve been quite long enough. How are we suppose to get up there? Isn\u2019t it like light years away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWe could always teleport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat? I can do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cAnd you can have passengers. Though it requires tremendous energy to do. It always requires the same energy to do the spell. It doesn\u2019t matter if you want to go to the other end of the universe, or two feet to the right. It uses the same amount of energy. You will need to practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWe better get started.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now we have to measure the amount of magic you use when you use that spell. Every person uses a different amount of magic. Some of your species use so little magic when they do that spell that then can go to the energy back and forth a hundred times in an hour. Some people can only use it once a year or decade, or not at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk\u2026 how are we going to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWell. There is a safe test in to see if your ready. If you pass it, then you can. This isn\u2019t like the time you opened the box and got me from it. The box was measuring your \u2018potential\u2019 power. Its looks into your future and see\u2019s how strong you can possibly become. This test will measure your current magic levels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk. I think I understand. However, what is this test?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cYou need to maintain a levitating spell, materialization/summoning spell, and transformation spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen\u2019s mouth fell open \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to master any of those yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I magnify your abilities. The stronger you are, the stronger I make you. That\u2019s why you have were able to put that spell on Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cUm\u2026 ok.

What\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cIt\u2019s a test to measure Gwen magical capacity. You should stay to cheer her on. This will be difficult. It takes decades of training to master this, but think Gwen can handle just a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Seth with shock, and then turned to Gwen and stared in awe. \u201cYou can do it Gwen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Ben and smile, but her face turned serious as she looked away. As she started to focus, the runes on the ground started to glow. Gwen began to float off the ground. When she started to chant in some the language of her homeland, reality seems to distort itself. The ground outside of the circle began to float up and orbit Gwen. As the chanting got faster and more sporadic, the air in front of her was being morphed and pushed around by something. Out of nowhere, a large glowing sun appeared in front of her. As the sun floated there, the ground beneath it started to get scorched, but reality seems to change again. The scorched land started to change. It went from rocks and earth to liquid water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou can do it Gwen! We know you can!\u201d Ben was yelling and jumping excitedly. That was until the ground below him got caught in the spell. Ben jumped up higher that time and landed on a tree up of the range of the spell. \u201cWatch it!\u201d Ben yelled accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was standing and observing Gwen as she continued the spell. The test required her to keep the spell going for about an hour. When Gwen started, the spell was fairly easy to maintain, but as she hit the half way mark, she was feeling the tremendous drain on her body. She felt like their was a cramp all over her body and that she just worked out for the last five hours non stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen thought \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can keep this up. Its just to difficult!\u201d Gwen was about to let go of the spells, but she saw Ben to the side shaking his but at her and making faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d, and then there was more taunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this did was make Gwen even more defiant and want to work hard. With renewed resolve, Gwen continued the spell. As the seconds ticked till the end, Gwen was suffering. Not even Ben could renew her resolve. 3...2...1...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth counted down the last seconds, and then all the spells collapsed and Gwen started to fall from the air. Just as she was falling, Ben ran up and caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen felt a weight less kind of feeling as she fell. All of a sudden, everything stopped. She felt a strong heart beat and gentle arms get a hold of her, and carry her. She felt the warmth from Ben body, and the strength in his arms. As her mind receded into deep sleep, he last though was remembering how her dad used to carry her when she was little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hours later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was dark as Gwen looked out the window. Wasn\u2019t it noon just second ago? As she sat up, she felt how sore she was. All of a sudden, Gwen remembered the test and how Ben caught her\u2026 and how sense of security. She realized that Ben had changed a bit. As she slowly got up, she looked out the window and saw that everyone was sitting in a little camp fire laughing and joking around. Gwen looked at Ben trying to see what has changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked like a 13 year old kid with a larger swimmer\u2019s build. He looked strong, but not like that freakish kind of builds, and was about 5ft 2in tall. His chest pushed about an inch and a half, and it hugged his shirt nicely. Threw the shirt, you could see a set of nicely chiseled abs. His legs looked quick and agile, but also very strong, so did his arms. If he wasn\u2019t Gwen\u2019s cousin, she would have dated him, but since he is her cousin, the idea is appalling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen noticed Gwen in the window and waved her to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled, and went to join them by the warming campfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The next day*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cHow are you feeling Gwen? You did something amazing yesterday. I\u2019m very proud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled knowing that he helped a little, but kept quiet as he wallowed in self pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen on the other hand gave Ben a glare, but was happy Ben was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cOk\u2026 You\u2019re ready to use the spell. If my skills as judging these exams have not deteriorated, then I believe that you have a 10 out of 10. You are the second person to pass that test, but I don\u2019t think there is time to be cheerful yet. The green star is on a deadline. We must more on.\u201d Seth proceeded to walk out of the Rustbucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled and followed Seth. Ben and Gramps followed quickly behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThe spell will get easier with time. The first time will be as hardest, but as you get understand it better. It will still use the same amount of energy, but understanding the spell helps you maintain a positive attitude about using it.\u201d \u201cThis spell does not require an incantation which makes it difficult to perform, but that\u2019s also why it get easier to do as you understand it. You will need to know visualize the general of where you want to go, and imagine that reality is folding onto itself to bring you closer to your desired location. Give it a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen did as Seth said, and imagined standing next to the tree 10 ft away. After a moment, Gwen felt a sudden drain on her body as though she ran a marathon, and just finished. Gwen was about to fall, but someone caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGod! You\u2019re falling a lot lately. Good job though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen opened her eyes and saw that she was next to the tree, but Ben was there holding her. The safe feeling returned, but Gwen caught herself before she started to get to deep in thought. Gwen gave Ben an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Gwen nervously \u201cWhat\u2019s that face for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen got his answer almost immediately. Gwen thought of Golden Gate Bridge in California, and imagined Ben there.

Ben remembered where the camp was and start to sprint to it. A person next to Ben freaked out when Ben appeared out of no where, but freaked out even more when Ben just vanished. Ben was running so fast that it looked like he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back at the camp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cGwen! Where did you send Ben?\u201d said surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cCalifornia, and Gramps\u2026 Ben\u2019s going to be fine.

Every one quieted down. Gramps answered the transmission. \u201cHello! Max Tennyson. What can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cAre you near yet. The enemy has already attacked, and the green star is going to supernova in about a day. We need you here soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWe\u2019re already there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Gramps like he was crazy, but Gramps took out a photo of the green star and showed it to Gwen. They all knew that Gramps wanted Gwen to send them there. There was a flash and then everything turned green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It appears that the green sun was shrinking as it burned up the rest of its fuel, then BOOM! The green star supernovas. It sends waves of energy outwards, but the energy was being stopped. The force field surrounding the star was maintaining control, but it was being contorted.

His tremendous weight was put the force field in his area under a lot of stress until -pop- Ben made a hole in the force field where the energy from the Star could escape, but that\u2019s not all that happened. As soon as the energy got out, it started to orbit around Ben at unreal speeds. At the same time, the orb in Ben\u2019s hand starts to float up a bit and absorb the energy from the Green Star.

I guess that\u2019s true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen suddenly remember something \u201cWhy don\u2019t I weigh like a billion pounds right now? I thought you took the spell off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI did, but I put another one on you, so we had to improvise. We are in an anti gravity room. No matter what you are, or how much you weigh, you will have next to zero weight in here. It also nullifies any gravitational pull.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around trying to comprehend what they were saying \u201cSo what is the solution now? Why can you reapply it now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI can not. Seth told my that it can only be used once per person due to its unique effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI think I know of something that can help, but we\u2019ll have to ask Xam a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think he owes us a favor for stopping the army.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cActually, we didn\u2019t stop them. We escaped them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat ever. We foiled their plan in the end. Now what are we asking him for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cIts just a rare mineral called Gravitum. It has properties similar to Gwen\u2019s spell. However, you need it with you at all time. That\u2019s the only down side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cCool. Is that all it can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cIt has one more property. When it is molded into a shape of a container. Kind of like a locket. It gains the ability to store anything no matter that the size, and keep it sealed until the owner opens it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo I could put the orb into it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYes. Exactly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat are we weighting for? Lets go get it.\u201d Ben starts making his way to the door, but he was dragged back by a tentacle of magic. \u201cGwen! What was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIdiot! If you walk out of here, you\u2019d kill us all! You gravitational pull would make the ship collapse on itself\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Gwen ready to comment, but looked at his feet I the end chastised. \u201cFine then. When is Xam going to bring this thing. I\u2019m dying to go somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cDid someone say my name?\u201d Xam said as he entered the room. \u201cBen\u2026 you are such a pain like your Grandfather.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cExcuse me! I was the one mature enough to keep you out of trouble most of the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cThat\u2019s why you were a pain, butt this is besides the point. I\u2019m only giving this to Ben because he is drawing about 90% of the ships energy to keep him from killing us all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrn \u201cWhat are you giving me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam takes out a box and opens it to reveal a necklace made of some linked metals. Kind of like a chain, but it had a more complex design. At the bottom was a small locket. It was the shape of 3D compass. There was a needle suspended in the needle spinning and pointing everywhere as it looked for some kind of location. \u201cI have dozens of these Gravitum necklaces, but everyone on this ship told me to give you this one. It has the usual properties, but it also has one more unique ability. The compass right here points to the location of what ever you are looking for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the necklace with curiosity. When Xam gave Ben the necklace, Ben had held it for a moment, and then put it on. There was a humming sound that appeared, and slowly faded away. \u201cI feel kind of weird. Everything is weightless again. My body feels like it weighs nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cGood. That\u2019s how we know its working.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s one problem solved, but I think a new one came up. When I got near the Green Star, my\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cYou orb absorbed the energy it released.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked in surprise \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cAnyone with a pair of eyes could see it from a light year away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh\u2026 Anyhow, I\u2019ve felt strange ever since. There was this liquid after all the energy was gone, but my orb absorbed that to! Now it feels like the orb\u2019s alive. It even has a pulse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Ben, and when he took the orb out, they all saw that he was right. The orb was gave off pulses of light that faded away. \u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I have a hunch. I believe that your orb had taken the energy and the remaining core of the Green Star and compressed it into that pearl at the center of your orb. I think that pearl IS the green star, or what ever is left of it. It astounds me that so much energy can me compressed into such a small size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his orb with new wonder \u201cBut what doe it do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI don\u2019t know. Lets try to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does it do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This isn\u2019t magic, but actually reality remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThen lets just look at it for a bit.\u201d After a few minutes, Ben noticed something \u201cHey look at that.\u201d Ben points to a scar on Xam\u2019s forearm. Everyone looks and was surprised to see that it was disappearing. \u201cYour scar. Its gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam stared in awe at what just happened. Then he smile. \u201cI think we found one property.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded \u201cWhat else can it do?\u201d At that moment, a servant came in to give refreshments. The alien looked tired and worn out from the events of the day, but when it got into the green light of the orb, it started to feel less tired and had a stronger hop in its step. \u201cWe have another property I guess. It can heal and re-energize. It seems to deal with any physical/body related ailments. Like injury and weariness. Can it cure a cold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cWe can find out. Lets go to the infirmary.\u201d Xam leads the group to another section of the ship and there that found countless ailing aliens. \u201cTry healing them. Some of them have known diseases.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stepped forward to the alien in front of him, and took the orb out of his pocket. As soon as the light hit the alien, it began to heal. Even the horrid gash on his leg had vanished. As Ben raised the orb higher, all the ailing alien began to heal at a tremendous rate. One alien lost an arm, but that grew back with a little time. After half an hour, all the aliens were as good as new. Even the older aliens looked younger (at least in the eyes of their species).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam was lost for words. Most of the aliens in the room were in critical condition and would have dies, but Ben\u2019s orb healed all of them with out any effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI guess it, but think we know enough about the orb to say that it won\u2019t have negative side effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWell\u2026 you are growing at an exponential rate now. Billions of times faster than before. I only know this because you are a living organism, and you release mana. All living thing release mana, but yours is huge. The mana around an organism is the magnetic field of that organism. It has a shape. The larger the mana, the larger the magnetic/mana field. Gwen\u2019s is larger than most because she if unique, but yours is the largest in the universe. If you could control it, the universe would be in the palm of your grasp. Though, it\u2019s a good thing you can\u2019t. You mana field is about the diameter of a large star, and getting bigger. Gwen\u2019s is the size of the Earth because I magnify her magic abilities. You have a near infinite supply of mana, and that could be useful. Gwen could tap into that power if you allowed her, but currently, it\u2019s a blocked off source of power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared dumbly and confused \u201cI don\u2019t really get it, but I\u2019m like a power outlet, and if Gwen taps into that outlet, she will have a lot of power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cIn a nut shell\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so! It\u2019d save a whole lot of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI know, but some people want to hear the facts.\u201d Giving a grin to everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhatever\u2026 can we go home? I want to enjoy the rest of my summer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cGood point\u2026 I believe that we\u2019ll have to wait for Gwen\u2019s mana field to recharge. Over using it reduces the size, but it will recover with a bit of sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAnyway. We can\u2019t leave yet. The alien army won\u2019t stop so easily. They\u2019re look you this hip right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGood point. Just tap into my mana, and do something about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThat\u2019s a nice idea. If you want to go along with this idea, I suggest spell 359. It makes people forget what they were doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHow are we going to do this? What do we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cFirst off, you\u2019ll have to hold hands. That\u2019s a physical contact, but then you\u2019ll need to establish a mental link. The mana will flow threw your minds and your bodies. Just think about holding hands in your heads and the mana will do the rest. Once the link is established, Gwen can tap into Ben\u2019s mana when ever she wants until you sever the connection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Gwen walked up to each other and held hands and imagined them selves holding hands. To both of them, it felt like someone opened a door, and they could peer into the other person\u2019s head. They could feel each other\u2019s presence, but they couldn\u2019t see or communicate with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIs that it? Nothing\u2019s different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cTrue. Though I don\u2019t feel as tired as before. I think your mana is help me a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cYah. You can use the mana that is surrounding Ben, but since it is so huge, it is surrounding all of us plus anything within a couple hundred thousand mile radius. Gwen could be anywhere in this mana field and tap into its power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cReally? That\u2019s awesome. Give it a shot Gwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cKay\u201d Gwen snapped her fingers to make a \u2018small\u2019 flame appear, but when it materialized, it was sever meters in diameter. She was shocked by it size, and quickly extinguished it. \u201cWow\u2026 I was trying to make a small flame. That was huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAM I suppose to feel a drain of energy or something? I didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cUsually, a flame that large would make a regular mana user tired, but since your mana field is so large, the drain is miniscule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s good t know. Now how about that spell? I think it would be a good time to use it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cRight\u2026 spell 359.\u201d Gwen looked threw her book and found the spell. It was fairly simple to use on one being, but when you get to huge numbers, it would be impossible without help. Gwen began to locate the enemy with mana, and used the spell when she located them. As soon as she said that, the enemy went into a frenzy. They were wondering why they were floating around in space with aliens that they have never seen. Some attacked each other, and others fled. How ever, there was one alien that did nothing. It was ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gwen\u2026 care to do the honors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen then warped them back to Earth, just outside the Rustbucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as their eyes cleared from the purple lights, Ben ran inside and went to bed. Gwen and Gramps followed behind quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Review of the rest of summer*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last month of summer timed down, things were on the dull side. After all that had happened at the green star, nothing seems as exciting. The newest thing Ben had learnt was how to put his orb inside the compass. Then when it was inside, the compass made the orb invisible. As though it never existed. The orb couldn\u2019t heal or glow or anything. Well\u2026 it still made Ben grow like crazy. That\u2019s it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week after the Green Star events, there was the occasional alien sighting. Ben finished it off quickly by giving the alien a quick beating, and then throwing it into space. Though, Gwen and Ben traded positions every now and then. Gwen would sometimes send the alien to another planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of summer, Ben and Gwen had to get ready to go home. Gramps was sitting on a log while he whittled a stick. Ben stepped up to him and gave Gramps the Omnitrix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIts not fair that just Gwen and I get all the cool stuff. Also\u2026 there\u2019s to much power for me to do anything with it. Its to tempting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps stared at Ben and gave him a hard look. After a moment, Gramps smile and ruffles Ben\u2019s hair. With that, Ben left, and enjoyed the last fleeting moment of his summer. Gramps on the other hand watched Ben walk away. The Ben that came at the start of the summer was arrogant, playful, wild, and crazy. The Ben that is about to leave was more calm, self controlled, and still playful. Gramps smiled and went back to his whittling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How was your summer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cUmm. Ben? Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his dad with a confused look. \u201cOf course its me. Who else?\u201d Then Ben understood \u201cOh!!! Yah. I forgot that I got a lot bigger. I started to work out ever the summer with Gramp\u2019s old college weights. It was funny though. I got a growth spurt at the same time, so they gave me awesome results.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad looked at his son disbelievingly, but the proof was right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUm dad\u2026 may I come it? Its getting chilly now. Its not summer anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad snapped back into reality \u201cOh. Right! Yah come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cHey honey. Is Ben home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cYah he is. He\u2019s a little different though. it\u2019s a good different I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom walked out of the kitchen and saw Ben\u2019s new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey mom. How was your summer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cIts been good. Not to exciting without my boy to make things interesting though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh\u2026 sorry. I had a blast though. Camping was awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and dad looked at each other wondering if this was Ben, but what Ben did next was even more surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cMay I be excused to my room? Its been a long day because of all the packing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad stare at Ben in disbelief. Ben just \u2018asked\u2019 \u2018politely\u2019 to go to \u2018his\u2019 room. The old Ben would have just ran there, and skipped all the greetings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cUh.. Sure sport. Go get some sleep. Mom and I\u2019ll help you unpack later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thanked them \u2018nicely\u2019 and walked upstairs to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cYou father is a miracle worker. What\u2019s his secret?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d He said in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The first day of school*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cHave a nice day at school Ben. Mom will pick you up later if you want. Just give her a call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThanks dad. See yah later.\u201d Ben stepped out of the car and walked toward his school. It was a larger school to. Their town doesn\u2019t have a separate middle school. The Elementary and Middle school were combined into a jumbo school. The elementary half was the first three floors, and the middle school half was the fourth through fifth floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked into the school and went to homeroom on the third floor where the sixth graders were. When he got there, he recognized a bunch of kids, and said \u2018hi\u2019, but they all gave him a look, and turned back to their conversations. \u201cHey look at the new kid\u201d. They all said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen homeroom started, Ben had found an out of the way seat. No one would notice him if he sat quietly. Everyone else soon followed and sat down somewhere. Strangely, they were all kids from last year\u2019s homeroom. When the teacher came out to take attendance, everyone became quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeacher \u201cWe have a new student joining this homeroom today. You may have met him. Lets see if you\u2019ll notice the name.\u201d The teacher worked her way down the list of names. Its was strange because Ben\u2019s name was last, and the new kid\u2019s name was right before his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKen Ten\u201d The teacher said. She waited for Ben to raise his hand and say \u2018here\u2019 because she thought he was the new kid, but Ben never did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me. I said Ken Ten.\u201d Ben just sat waiting for his name. \u201cFine then. I\u2019ll mark you absent. Next is Ben Tennyson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at the door waiting for a short kid with brown hair to open the door, but it never came. \u201cHere.\u201d Ben said while raising his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned around and say that a large six grader was raising his hand. All the students started to gossip and comment. Ben sat down with his face turning red from the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeacher looked amazed at Ben\u2019s change \u201cBen\u2026 is that really you? You got to big. And it was only one summer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah I know\u2026 I started working out over the summer, but I also had a growth spurt at the same time. Not just a regular one either. My family has been known to have growth spurt earlier than most people, and its several times more effective. So the work outs and the growth spurt made me kind of big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeacher stared in awe at Ben\u2019s new size unable to believe her eyes and ears. In the end, she just accepted it as fact and move on. \u201cIt appears that our \u2018real\u2019 new student has yet to show up. That\u2019s a bad start for a new year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that, a kid with dirty blond hair and a heavier than normal kind of build casually strolled into the room like it was nobody\u2019s business. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late, but my alarm didn\u2019t go off. Its takes sleep to get these muscle to grow. The kid failed to notice the much larger kid in the back with a noticeably larger build than his own. Don\u2019t get me wrong. James is still \u2019just slightly\u2019 above average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was waiting for people to stop and comment about his physique. He heard murmurs about muscle and other things, but they weren\u2019t about him. They were about that kid in the back! Ken frowned when he heard the name Ben and not Ten. \u201cExcuse me. You guys may have miss heard. My name is Ken. Not Ben. They sound similar, so I\u2019ll let it go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeacher sounded annoyed \u201cOk Ken sit down. I believe that everyone is talking about Ben. The student in the back. They shouldn\u2019t be talking at all actually\u201d The teacher gives a hard glare at the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked around for this \u2018Ben\u2019 that he heard so much about. The kid can\u2019t be that much of a news story. Ken looked in the back, and saw this 13 year old kid with a really developed athletic build. Its was the body of speed, agility, strength, and a little more. Ken stared at Ben jealously of his body, and even angrier about being outclassed. At his old school, he was the top dog! The reigning champ of the school in all athletics! He won\u2019t go down so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ken walked to the back of the calls in order to get a closer look at his competition. It was clear that Ben worked out \u2018a lot\u2019, and that he looks strong. But that\u2019s all for show. There\u2019s no strength behind it. \u2018Ken assumes\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stepped up to Ben \u201cHey. I\u2019m Ken. Nice to meet a fellow exercise addict.\u201d Ken holds out his hand to shake with Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey. I\u2019m Ben. Nice to meet you to.\u201d Ben reaches out and they shake hands. Ben give him a gentle grasp in order to not break his hand. Other the last month of summer, Ben had worked on self control in order not to destroy things by accident. He\u2019s improved significantly, and has 99.99% mastery of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen on the other hand likes to make sure his peers know who\u2019s the strongest, so when Ben and Ken held hands, Ken squeezed Ben\u2019s hand as hard as he could to make Ben scream in pain. However, instead of crushing his fingers, it was like shaking hands with a rock. Ben didn\u2019t feel the pressure from the squeeze due to his dense muscles, and strong bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled a fake smile to hide his shock, and sat down. He thought \u201cWhat just happened? No can not show some kind of reaction to that kind of hand shake.\u201d Ken was about the size of a middle school 8th grader. He was 5ft 3in, and about 160. Which was a lot for someone his height and age. There was actual strength in this 6th grader\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen on a similar hand was 5ft 4in, and about 165 lbs in appearance. To bad Ken doesn\u2019t know that he\u2019s setting himself up for an impossible task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter homeroom, was first period. Which was gym. YAH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day of gym at this school is always a fitness test. They compared your strength from the first day with your strength from the last day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all stepped inside, mats and lines were drawn all over the floor for the fitness exam. There was push-up, pull-up, sit-up, mile runs, sprints, flexibility, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen couldn\u2019t wait to show everyone who is really the strongest. He believed that Ben\u2019s muscles were all air, and no definition. People were assigned partners to compete with, and Ken was happy to find that he was paired with Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Push Ups: Goal is to do as many push up as you physically can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen and Ben lined up next to each other doing a plank as they waited for the \u2018go\u2019 that would tell them to start. \u201cGO!\u201d Ben and Ken started immediately. Ben was taking his sweet time and doing his push up with a rhythmic pattern. Ken on the other hand was going all out. After 35 push up, Ken was dying. Ben on the other hand was barely even sweating. At 45 push up, Ken was dismayed to see that he couldn\u2019t go on, and fell. Ben on the other hand kept going and going and going. At about 100, the coach said enough, and told Ben and Seth to move onto Pull-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Pull-ups: Do as many as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame result as push up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sit ups: as many as you can<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame results as pulls ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Both Sprinting and running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Flexibility: Reach as far past your toes as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a close one, but Ben won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day ended, Ken couldn\u2019t stop think about how he lost \u2018all\u2019 of those tests. He didn\u2019t beat Ben once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ken do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From that day forth, Ken works out at the gym when ever he had time. He worked for hours and hours. Even to the point that his grades were dropping. He became obsessed with growing and becoming bigger than Ben. He had to slow down a bit though because his parents had gone far enough to almost ban him from the gym if his grades didn\u2019t go up. After that, Ken was more careful with his grades, but worked out every spare second to make up for the time. After a week or to, Ken started to freak out. He was actually losing weight. His coach told him that he has to eat more because he\u2019s burning to many calories, and his body doesn\u2019t have the fuel to grow. (I got the idea from taylor lautner). Any how, after 5 months, or serious work out, Ken had managed to put on 50 lbs of muscle. This gave him a freakish body. He was only 11 years old like every other sixth grader, but his body was has bulky as a junior bodybuilder. (Oh right. Ben is now eleven years old. He had his birthday during the summer, and he had grown a smidge taller and bigger.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of January, Ken was super huge and intimidating. He had worked up the will to finally challenge Ben again. Ken was about twice as bulky as Ben.<br>\r\nKen was 5ft 6in now, and weighing 210lbs<br>\r\nBen was 5ft 6in as well, and 180lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lunch time, and Ben was sitting at the center table talking with the only girl that was nice to him last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen walked up to the table and slammed his elbow down. \u201cArm Wrestle. NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared at Ken in shock at the intensity in his voice \u201cUmm. You could say please. That\u2019d be more polite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen glared at Ben impatiently, but finally worked up the politeness \u201cFine\u2026 PPLLLEEEAAASSSEEE\u201d As though we was choking on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s more like it. Are you sure you want to wrestle? I won\u2019t go easy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cHa! You\u2019ll have to go as hard as you can if you want to beat my tank of a body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed, and set his arm on the table. They grasped each other\u2019s hands, and waited for someone to referee. A kid that was already between Ben and Ken counted down \u201c3...2...1... Go!\u201d Ken went all out at the start. Ben on the other hand decided to go easy on Ken. He let his arm go back a bit, but after a while, it was clear the Ben looked like he wasn\u2019t trying, so Ben finished it. Ken\u2019s arm was hit by a truck and hit the table. Everyone had expected Ken to win since he had a slight advantage at the start, but also because he was even bulkier then Ben. When Ben won, everyone was silent for a second, but they all cheered in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at his arm in total shock and disappointment. He was so ready to win. To reclaim the glory that he was used to, but he had lost. \u201cHOW! How can you beat me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gave Ken a poker face and said \u201cBecause you are weak.\u201d Ben had known that Ken wanted to humiliate Ben for a while. Ben had gotten annoyed over the past few months, and he couldn\u2019t hide his frustration from his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked up at Ben and hated how Ben looked down at him. He swore under his breath and cursed Ben. He swore to make Ben bow down to him one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA teacher came and dispersed the crowd, and everyone left after that. The last person to leave was Ken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was above steroids so he threw that idea into the bucket. He went online and looked up various ways to grow. There were hundreds of supplements, and they all had good results, but Ken had already tried them all. Finally when he was about to give up hope, he saw an ad pop up on the side bar. \u201cNew Product Being Tested. Testers Try for Free!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen clicked on it and got the address. He found the directions to it, and began his long walk. As he walked, he noticed the that the suburban setting changed to an industrial feeling. When he got to the address, he was at a large facility surrounded with fencing and barbed wire. Looked like an army base, and not so much a lab, or commercial body supplement facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stepped up to a small gate designed for cars only, and talked into a box. \u201cHello? I\u2019m here from that Ad looking for a tester.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box crackled for a moment then a voice started to speak \u201cOk. come right in.\u201d The gates swing open and Ken stepped threw. He followed a path until he got to the white building. When he arrived at the door, a lady greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady \u201cDr. Wess is working in his lab. He\u2019s the owner and mastermind of this whole organization. He recently discovered a way to cure muscular defects, wants to see if the cure can also grow normal muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was listening, and her words filled him with hope. This might be what he was looking for. She started to guide him threw a catacomb of hall ways and elevators. They got to the bottom floor and what Ken saw surprised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was very well lit, and it showed a massive floor filled with all sorts of machines and equipment. However, there was one vacant area, and that was the middle of the room. In it was an old man tinkering with a laser type of machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady \u201cExcuse us Dr. Wess, but we have a person who would like to help you test your new discover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Wess looked up from the ray, and saw Ken looking at him intently. \u201cHello there. You want to test this out? My\u2026 aren\u2019t you already big enough? How old are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at the old man, and frowned a bit, but smile again to be polite. \u201cYah. I work out a little. I\u2019m thirteen, but I\u2019m looking to try something new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cVery good. That\u2019s what I look for. Enthusiasm! Ok\u2026 Come here boy. We\u2019ll start the test now.\u201d When the Wess said that, the lady excused herself, and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cJust step in front of the ray and sit patiently. You\u2019ll feel a light tingle, but it\u2019ll be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stepped in front of the ray and was about to ask a question, but the doctor had already fired the ray. A green light shot out and enveloped Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen felt a tingle all over his body, but that soon died down. The next feeling was amazing. He felt like he was having the great pump in the world. He could feel his muscles stretching and ripping, but then healing back almost instantly. His bones began to stretch and grow to accommodate his new size. As he continued to grow, his cloths were beginning to fail. His shirt was already split down the middle and the sleeves were rendered useless a while ago. His jeans had torn off and all that was left were some briefs that looked more like speedos. It didn\u2019t matter because the python they hid was pulsing with power beneath the thin cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growth slowed to a stopped, he had gained about 70lbs of muscle. He now had basket ball arms, with shoulders so broad that from shoulder to shoulder, they measured 2ft 6in. His pecs pushed 8in off his body, and his abs were so deep that you could fit your whole hand in it. His thighs were over stuffed turkey dinners, and his calves were bowling balls. Not to mention his engorged organ that seemed to be effected the most. At about 16in long and 3in wide with tennis balls for balls, it seemed that it had a life of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was speechless\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cIt seems to work very well on you. Previous test subjects had half the growth that you had. It might be because of your size. The bigger you are. The bigger you grow I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at his body in amazement. \u201cTell me!!!! What\u2019s your secret. How does it work? How can it be possible! I just got years of progress in minutes or less!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cShould I tell you? I think I might if you promise me one thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at Wess greedily. \u201cAnything! I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cI want you to do a little spying on Ben Tennyson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen felt a rage rush up, but he suppressed it somehow. \u201cWhy do you need me to do that? Is the punk that special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cHe has something that a person wants. That person hired me to get it. Now I\u2019m hiring you. Will you accept?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smile evilly. \u201cAs long as I get that secret. I\u2019m in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess smile \u201cVery good. The secret is\u2026\u201d Wess walked toward the ray gun and opened a small compartment to reveal a small green pearl sized orb. It gave off a small glow as though someone just shoved energy into it. \u201c\u2026this little pearl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at Wess like he was crazy. How can something like that make his growth possible. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cNo I\u2019m not. This little orb here can convert regular energy into something that strengthens any living organism. It also grows what ever holds it. Though its strange. I was told that these orbs are selective to one owner at a time, but once you shove a chunk of energy into them, they couldn\u2019t care less. Anyway\u2026 as long as you have this on hand, you\u2019ll grow. However, not as fast as this time. I just fired a few trillion kilojoules of energy into the orb and fired it at you. That\u2019s a lot of energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at the orb with desire and imagined how soon he\u2019d be able to bring Ben down. He reached out to grab it, but Wess pulled it back. Ken glared at Wess angrily and was about to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cStop. don\u2019t forget out deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smile at that \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll see of he was what you want. I might even help you get it depending on my mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cVery good. Here you go.\u201d Wess hands over the pearl. \u201cI\u2019m expecting another one to come in soon. If you want, you can have it. That is\u2026 if you get me what I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at Wess with a crazed look \u201cOh\u2026 you\u2019ll get it alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen leaves after that with the pear held tightly in his newly strengthened grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also, he could feel the orb in his necklace pulse stronger every time Seth passed him. (Ben had stopped feeling the presence of other pearls ever since he absorbed the green star). Also, every time Ken passes him, he felt that Ken was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ken traveled the hall, he made sure to keep an eye on Ben when ever he saw him. However, it was weird. Every time he passed Ben, he\u2019d have this sudden intense tingle, but that vanished as soon as Ben walked away. Be lunch time, his new cloths felt tight, so he went to investigate. Ken went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. What he saw amazed him. He had checked that morning, and saw that he\u2019d grown a tiny bit, but now there was a significant growth showing. \u201cWhat can it be the Ben has.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the day ended, Ken went to the gym and did his usual work out routine. He was more than happy to find that his old weight settings were practically weightless. He felt a tiny pressure, but that was it.

They had become friends about a month ago, and they learnt that they had a lot in common. Amy was a bookish girl, but she wasn\u2019t afraid to get her hands dirty. She new how to laugh and talk and have fun, but she was totally dependable and an overall great person to know and be with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast year, Ben was bullied and pushed around. He had always been the smallest of the stalk. Short and not to strong, but he was always defiant and pranking people. This put him at the bottom easily. People made fun of him and didn\u2019t include him, but one girl was never cruel. That girl was Amy. She talked to Ben once in a while, and Ben was grateful for that, so he never pranked her. Ever since the 5th grade, Ben had a bit of a crush on Amy. Anyhow\u2026 back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen walked up to Ben \u201cHey\u2026 like the new me? I\u2019m bigger and better than ever. There\u2019s no way you can take me down this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned and said with an annoyed tone \u201cLook. I don\u2019t care if your better or stonger, so why should you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cBecause being lower means you have to look up at someone. I hate it even more because I\u2019m taller than you, but I still have to look up to see you. I was the top dog at my old school. I\u2019m just second best here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cEverything. Know one remembers second. Its always the top they know of. Second is just the lacky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cWhat ever. I\u2019m done dealing with you.\u201d Ben stood up and got ready to leave. He helped Amy with her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen roared angrily \u201cYou done when I say so. Now sit down. We\u2019re arm wrestling again, and this time, you have no hope of beating me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and sat down.  He asked Amy to step to the sides because this might get a little ugly. Ben and Ken sat down on either sides of the table and grasped each others hand. By now a group of kids had gathered. The all heard Ken\u2019s rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they both sat down, Ben saw his necklace glow green for a sec, and then he saw a similar green from Ken\u2019s pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s a pearl\u201d Ben thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Seth, I\u2019ll do this on one condition. If I win, I can take one thing from you. If you win, you can have something from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen thought about it for a sec, and agreed because of his overconfidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same kid from before began to countdown and referee. \u201c3...2...1... Wrestle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen did the same thing as before, and sat there holding Ken\u2019s arm with ease. Ken on the other hand was totally dismayed to find that Ben\u2019s arm hadn\u2019t moved an inch. \u201cHow?!? I\u2019m twice your size! How can you keep up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBecause I\u2019m stronger than you. Its that simple.\u201d At this, Ben slammed Ken\u2019s huge arm down threw the table and onto the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen groaned clutching his arm. All his anger that he though had gone away with his growth had risen back up back up with greater force then ever before. As though reacting to Ken\u2019s emotion and Ben\u2019s orb, the pearl in Ken\u2019s pocket glowed brighter than ever. Before Ken knew what was happening, he began to grow at a colossal rate. He felt pain everywhere as though he had done a marathon over and over again. His eyes were closed tight from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Ben knew was that Ken was growing even bigger than he was before and it was slowing down. He got taller and stronger, and just kept on growing. His shirt ripped off soon to reveal a tank where his torso used to be, and his giant legs were soon revealed. When he pants had ripped off, the pearl had fallen out under Ken, so he was still lying on it as he grew. The agony he suffered was to much, so he all he did was sit there on top of the pearl. By now all the kids had run screaming from the growing Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen soon passes 6ft then 7 ft and 8ft, and just kept going. When he got to 30ft tall, he had rolled on his side smashing threw half the school\u2019s playing field, and off the pearl. As soon he was off of it, his growth stopped and so did the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprise of Ken growing kept Ben from moving to do anything, so Ben just stood there, but when the pearl revealed itself, Ben ran and grabbed it, and put it in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his growth stopped, Ken\u2019s eyes opened and looked around. Everything looked different. Everything was smaller, or he was BIGGER! Ken looked down and saw two meaty pecs blocking his view. \u201cNo way!\u201d Ken started to bounce his pecs up and down and enjoyed his new growths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Ben\u2019s face had turned red because Ken\u2019s underwear had ripped up along with the rest of his growth, and a 10ft long anaconda was swinging in the air with bean bag balls. However, that didn\u2019t stop Ben from taking this chance to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ben took out his orb, and saw that it had a small pearl in the middle (from before), but now, it had a single glowing dot orbiting it. Ben put the orb back into the locket and turned his attention to Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Ken had remembered what was happening, and he turned his attention Ben as well. Then a thought hit him. The pearl\u2026 where is it! Ken bent down looking all over the ground, but I seems impossible. The pearl was just to small for his huge eyes to locate. Then another though entered his mind.

Ben noticed that his head didn\u2019t have to look up so high to see Ken\u2019s face anymore. After a few minutes, Ken had shrunk down to an average size. Even the muscle he had before the orb was gone. He was \u2018average\u2019 sized now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stopped running around now and waited for Ken to realize what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cWhat\u2019s going on! What happened to my muscles! I just got them!\u201d Ken fell to the ground crying all over his naked self. Ben looked down at Ken, but felt a little pity. Ben ran home and got some cloths for Ken to put on. That would take a normal person about 10min, but it looked like Ben hadn\u2019t even left. He\u2019s that fast. It appears as though he just materialized the cloths out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cPut these on. Make yourself look decent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was still moaning over his loss. (I just realized that a lot of kids are jealous of each other and want to out do the other. It makes sense right?) Somehow, in has loss, Ken was still able to think. He had given up right there and then. He couldn\u2019t stop Ben. He simply put on Ben\u2019s cloths and walked away defeated. He started walking towards the gym to start all over again. Ben just watch sadly as Ken walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ken was gone, Ben decided to help Ken out a bit, but first he had to fix the field. Ben ran and fixed anything that could be fixed, and put the dirt back in their proper place. After that, he walked towards to the gym to look for Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was sitting at a bench press lifting weights. He hadn\u2019t even looked at the weight setting. Just lifting what ever he thought he could. If he had looked, he would have seen that he was lifting several hundred pounds with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cKen. That\u2019s kind of amazing what you\u2019re doing there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked up slowly \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou\u2019re lifting about 600 lbs there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen turn his head to the weight and was surprise to see it was true. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d He said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think I know. Lets go check out a scale to make sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen led Ken to the nurse\u2019s office to use the electronic scale. Be told Ken to step on it. For some reason, the school had an industrial scale used for weighing objects in the thousands of pounds. When Ken stepped on, the numbers began to rise. It stopped at about 30tons. \u201cI thought so\u2026 Your previous size has been compressed into this frame. I think that there is one more thing you can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at the scale amazed and wanted to hear more from Ben \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLets go back to the gym. There\u2019s more room there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both went back to the gym and Ben said \u201cImagine yourself bigger. I want to see what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen did just that. He imagined himself bigger than Ben. About 300 lbs of muscle and about 7 ft tall. As soon as he thought that, he began to grow bigger. Ben\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 cloths were tearing at this new size. \u201cWow\u2026\u201d Then Ken started to get an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had looked away while he was think about how to tell this to his Grampa, but while his guard was down, Ken had taken the chance to grow to his biggest size (which was the thirty ft tall behemoth), and attacked Ben. He threw Ben at the wall with such force that that half of the room caved in on itself. At this, Ken quickly ran out and went looking for someone that could stop Ben. Ken looked around, and saw Amy on the field looking for Ben. He ran out and grabbed Amy before she could run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had been stunned by Ken\u2019s attack. Ben was hit on the temple, so it had knocked him out. When Ben came to (about 2 min after because he recovers quickly), he followed Ken\u2019s destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was in the middle of the field with a wide grin and something in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned his attention to Ken\u2019s hand and was angered that he had involved innocent people. Especially the girl the Ben like!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cPut her down. This has nothing to do with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cSo? I don\u2019t really care. I think I have the upper hand now. You wouldn\u2019t want to hear this would you?\u201d Ken gave Amy a slight squeeze, and Amy screamed and passed out. \u201cWoops. A little to tight I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had enough \u201cThis is you last warning. Put her down or else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cOr else wh-\u201d Ken didn\u2019t get to finish because Ben gave into his rage. In a fraction of a second, Ben had given Ken a few hundred punches. All with enough force to kill a hundred men each, but at Ken\u2019s size, they were only enough to give him a lot of bad bruises and to knock him out. Ken had let go of Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fell, she was aware that she was falling. Then it stopped suddenly. Ben had ran up to her and caught her. Amy fell into Ben\u2019s arm. You\u2019d expect it to hurt because of his hard muscles, but it didn\u2019t. Ben soften her fall and carried her. To Amy, the world was a small bubble that contained only Ben and Amy right there and then. She felt safe. She felt the warmth in his body calming her, and the strong steady beat of Ben\u2019s powerful heart. Before, They were just friends, but she didn\u2019t know anymore. She didn\u2019t get to think much more because as Ben carried her, she drifted into blissful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen vaguely remembered where Amy lived, so he carried her slowly home. Savoring the moment. When he got to her house, he knocked on the door and waited for one of Amy\u2019s parents to open the door. A lady wearing an apron came to the door, and was shocked to see Amy passed out in the arms of Ben. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cExcuse me. Are you Amy\u2019s mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady \u201cWhat did you do to my baby? What\u2019s wrong with her. Give her to me!\u201d Amy\u2019s mom grabbed her from Ben violently in panic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know you. I thank you for bringing her home. I want to trust you, but I can\u2019t\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded in agreement \u201cI know. I understand. Anyway, some kid pulled a prank and put knockout gas in her locker. She was out cold when she opened her locker. I was in the hall when it happened, and took her to the nurse. The nurse said she\u2019d be fine, but should go home. I just carries her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s mom smiled, but she still hesitated to do more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAnyway. I have to go back home. I have a few things to get for my mom.\u201d Ben turned and left and Amy\u2019s mom just stared. Soon after, Amy\u2019s dad had joined Amy\u2019s mom and was shocked. He carries Amy up to her room, and let her rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Amy woke up to find her mom on her bed, and her dad laying in a chair next to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cMom\u2026 dad\u2026 why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woke up her parents and they were so happy to see their daughter was ok. They asked her what happened with the knockout gas, and the large young man that carries her home. When they described Ben, her faced turned a little red, and she hoped they didn\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cUmm\u2026 yah. I vaguely remember Ben, you remember him, carrying me to the nurse. I don\u2019t remember much after that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cWait. That was Ben? Wow. He grew a lot over the summer. Quite the gentleman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cWell. I think I\u2019d like to meet him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s face turned red as she thought of how she felt when Ben had carried her home. \u201cYah\u2026 I think we all like him.\u201d She muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cWhat was that honey? I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cNo. Nothing. I think I should get to school. My friends are going to worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cActually, the school is close down for repairs. It seems like that knock out gas had done damage to a gas line that caused part of the school to explode. Luckily, no one was hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was shocked \u201cSo no school? Can I at least go outside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth her parents seemed nervous about doing that, but they reluctantly said yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After he hung up, he jumped onto bed and tried to sort his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought \u201cWhat happened back there. I carried her home. That was it.\u201d However, Ben couldn\u2019t get a grasp over what he was feeling. When he carried her, he wanted to do everything he could to keep her safe. He looked at the calm face and the steadiness of her breathing. He wanted to never ever wanted to hear that scream again. The one that came out when Ken squeezed her half to death. After laying for a while, Ben fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Ben had woken up and was still thinking about what he felt. When his dad came in to tell him that school was canceled till further notice, Ben asked something. \u201cHey dad. Can I ask a question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cSure sport. What\u2019s on your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell. I don\u2019t know how to say it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad closed the door and locked it \u201cWhat? I\u2019m listening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell there\u2019s a girl, and I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave a small chuckle as though he just learnt a cute little secret. \u201cOk. I think I know what going on, but just keep talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen told a small lie about how Amy was about to get hit by a car, and he get her out of it. He said she fainted, and he carried her home, and how he felt. How his emotions were all missed up. Anger towards the car (Ken), and a sense of protecting. About hot he cared about only one thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cOk. I think its time we had a talk\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne talk later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his dad with a new view of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cOk sport. I\u2019m going to be late for work now. Take care while I\u2019m gone. Oh and you can have this.\u201d His dad slipped him a twenty. \u201cMaybe take you lady friend for a movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDad!\u201d Ben\u2019s face turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cJust saying. Mom\u2019s on a business trip to Hawaii, and I\u2019m not home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDAD!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cOk... Ok\u2026 I\u2019ll stop. The money\u2019s on the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben heard his dad leave the house and the car backing out, Ben stood up and put the twenty in his pocket. \u201cWhat movie is good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hours later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had been walking around and somehow wandered into the local park. Ben had done the same as well. As they were walking, they were lost in thought, and without looking, they walked right into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy \u201cOh! Sorry. Didn\u2019t see you. I was j-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy again \u201cOh. Hi. Sorry. I didn\u2019t-\u201d Both their faces turned red as they accidentally talked in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cHey\u2026 thanks for carrying me home. Sorry for what my mom did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said quickly \u201cNo! It was alright. I wouldn\u2019t have given you to her if she didn\u2019t care so much.\u201d then Ben thought what he said over and said \u201cWell I mean that I would have given you to her but I wouldn\u2019t trust her. No wait! I mean-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy started giggle and then that turned into a laugh. Thus turning Ben\u2019s already red face into something redder \u201cIts ok. I know what you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen slowly asked \u201cWell\u2026 if your free\u2026 umm\u2026 do you want to see\u2026 that\u2019s if you don\u2019t mind\u2026 to umm\u2026 go..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smile \u201cWhat! Just say it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen cleared his throat and said quietly and very quickly \u201cWill you go on a a get to know me date at a movie or some thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cNah\u2026 I\u2019m busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen made the \u201cO\u201d shape with his mouth, and he started to feel uncomfortable, but then Amy said \u201cWell\u2026 I guess I could make an exception since you asked so nicely. But it have to be back by 9, and it better be a good move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised Ben even more \u201cUmm\u2026\u201d and made with scrunched up kind of face afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy suddenly started to laugh, and then grabbed Ben\u2019s arm and pulled him I the direction of the movie theater. Ben slowly caught on to what she said and started to laugh to! While they were running, Ben had started to carry Amy, and then he bolted to the movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Amy decided that a movie was to quiet for a Get to Know You Date, so she suggested a smoothy. To help start with a \u2018smooth\u2019 clean slate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the best day of Ben\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sorry. I\u2019ve been a little preoccupied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps chuckled on the other end of the line \u201cWith you lady friend I bet. So what do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face was red from the comment \u201cWell\u2026 yes\u2026 Do you have anything like my necklace? I want to get Amy a gift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cHmm\u2026 That\u2019s a tough one. I think I have a solution of you can stop by. I\u2019m near Mt. Rushmore right now. Just making sure everything is where its supposed to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a sec.\u201d Ben hung up the phone and ran to Gramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was outside the door still on the phone \u201cBen? Hello? Are you still on the phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey gramps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cAhh good. Your still on the phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo gramps. I\u2019m right here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps turned and was surprised to see Ben. \u201cOh. Hey. Yah. My solution was that we could try to make copy from nothing. Thought it takes tremendous energy to do it though. We\u2019ll need Gwen and Seth\u2019s help to get you linked up to the machine to run it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Lets just say that they managed to make a copy of Ben\u2018s locket, but not the necklace because if he took off the necklace, everyone on the planet would be killed by his galaxy sized gravitational pull)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThanks guys. I appreciate the help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell sure! I\u2019d help sooner, but I had to get over the fact that my you were in an actual relationship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIts not that unbelievable!\u201d Ben said whining a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cAnyway\u2026 Your strong mana field made it possible to synthesize the gravitum. Though it seems to have different properties from regular gravitum. Well, actually, it has the same properties, plus more. It seems to repel harm, or things that want to induce harm. Even poisonous gases are being filtered from the air. If I look further, I think that it keeps you from drowning, and other stuff as well. Its like a bubble of defense. I believe your will to protect carried over to the gravitum and made it something new. Anyway, it can still reduce weight and store a near unlimited amount of objects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the clump of gravitum or what ever it was, and wondered what shape to give it. He didn\u2019t have enough of it to make a necklace whole necklace. Maybe a small locket like his, or a bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGwen\u2026 your girl right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked up surprised \u201cWhat\u2019s that suppose to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI mean, you know what girls like right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell duh\u2026 I have palate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDoes that mean you can help me out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOnly if you say please\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWill you please help me out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSure! Anything for a love bird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen groaned \u201cNot you too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed at Ben\u2019s suffering, but not in the evil way. Just the playful kind of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat does she like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 she to take care or animals. She said that\u2019s why she helped me last year because I was wild and unpredictable. Which now that I think about it was kind of true. Anyhow\u2026 she helped a couple of doves the other day, and they sang her a song in thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell then. Why not a couple of doves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk then. Lets make it a dove.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps took the small clump of gravitum but stopped when he remembered something. \u201cI forgot that we need a type of crystal inside to act as a stabilizer. The crystalline structure helps create order when space is being bent to hold and object. It needs to be about the same density of the gravitum in order to prevent the gravitum from ejecting it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWell\u2026 this isn\u2019t good. When the gravitum formed, it copied Ben\u2019s density. Its even getting denser as we speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSo we can just make a mineral that gets as dense as Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cGood point. I suggest that we use a pure carbon mineral like diamond. Due to its strong crystal structure, it can maintain order very easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Moments later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey now have a diamond crystal the size of a pea, but it was the densest mineral in the universe. Though, because of that, it has a gravitational pull that was almost equal to Ben. To prevent it from killing them, the gravitum encased itself around the diamond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat was pretty cool. The gravitum jumped onto the diamond the moment it formed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cMost likely because we could die if it hadn\u2019t. The gravitational pull would make us all get sucked into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just had a thought \u201cI just remembered something about black holes. Since I\u2019m so dense, why am I not making a whole in the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cBecause of the gravitum. For every force, there is a counter force. If you want to go forward, you have to push something back. If normal atoms pull on other atoms, gravitum pushes. These two forces are countering each other at this very moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah, but not we have to do something with the clump of gravitum. It took the shape of a pearl when it surrounded the diamond. Now we have to change it up a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh right! Can you hand it over.\u201d Seth hands the orb over to Ben, and Ben takes it. Ben looked at the orb for a little bit, and then he started to mold it with his bare hands. When he was done, he had made two doves flying with each other, but he also revealed the diamond. He had taken the diamond out for a bit and chipped it and shaped it into a small heart that he inserted into the dove\u2019s chest. Ben spent hours shaping and angling the strange metal until all his hard work paid off. \u201cI think its finished.\u201d The little doves was about an inch in diameter, and you could see every detail that you\u2019d expect to see, plus more. They seemed alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stared at the doves as they took the shape had wanted it, and had been amazed at how easy he molded it, and even more surprised by how careful Ben was to put in even the most minuscule details. Even Gwen was jealous of Amy right now, but not the bad kind. \u201cIts beautiful. I didn\u2019t know you were that artistic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019m not. The idea just came to me. It felt like the clump of gravitum wanted to look like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell what ever it was, Amy\u2019s still a lucky girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned a shade of pink as he thought about it. \u201cI think I should get ready for our date. it\u2019s the end of the school year, and I want to prepare it ahead of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His dad came to check in on him every now and then and left quietly as he saw his son entirely focused on his project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last day of school, Ben asked Amy if she wanted to go camping the whole summer like he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSure, but I need permission from my parents first. Lets go ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile and picked Amy up and ran to her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s mom and dad were outside put things in the garden, and cleaning the place up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s mom and dad \u201cHey Amy. Nice to see you Ben. What brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI wanted to know if it was ok with you if I took your daughter on a camping trip this summer. Like the whole entire summer. She seems to like animals and nature. So what\u2019s better than the outdoors. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have my grandpa be the adult. He\u2019s can handle any form of camping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019 mom and dad looked at each other for a moment, and smiled. They kind of like Ben. Like another person in the family. Ben would occasionally come over and have dinner, and they always had a blast. \u201cSure. Amy is this ok with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOf course! I want to see the wild for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cOk then. Lets start packing. Summer starts tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The next day*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, Amy, Gwen, Seth, and Gramps are making their way into the forest for their little excursion. Amy\u2019s face never left the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was outside running lightly beside the Rustbucket. He waved to Amy from outside, and she waved back. When they stopped, Ben was digging his heels into the ground because he just remembered that he was supposed to give the necklace to her the day before, but he forgot in his excitement that her parents said yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy got out the Rustbucket, her face was full of joy from the fact that she was with nature, but she turned her attention to Ben when she say him waving her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked nervously at Amy \u201cUhh. I forgot to give you something yesterday that I wanted to give, so I\u2019m going to give it now. Is that ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cDepends on what you want to give\u201d Amy said smiling mischievously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reached into his pocket and pulled out the necklace. The chain was made of billions of micro diamond links that he chained together painstakingly. He had heard Gramps say that this makes the chain exceptionally strong. At the bottom was a small keepsake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gasped when she saw what Ben took out. She somehow knew that Ben hadn\u2019t bought it. It was to detailed to be made be normal. \u201cIts beautiful. How did you get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 I made it with some help from Gramps, Gwen and Seth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI love it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThen here. Let me put it on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was on the side looking at Ben as he put the necklace on Amy, and Gwen felt a little jealous. She turned to Seth, and saw that Seth was looking at her. Seth had said a long time ago that his emotions were connected to hers. If she wanted something, he wanted it to. Gwen wanted a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had put the necklace around Amy\u2019s neck, and she was surprised to find that it was warm. Probably from being in Ben\u2019s pocket. When the metal hit her skin, we felt the air around her stir and become more calm. She took a deep breath, and it felt like Ben was in the air, and everything around her. When she touched the doves, she felt a heart beat as strong as Ben\u2019s. The steady beat made her feel safe. Everything felt safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy started to drift into a day dream, and slowly fell asleep. Luckily Ben was there to catch her. \u201cDang. I didn\u2019t even get to tell her what it does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy woke up suddenly re-energized \u201cWow! What just happened. I put it on, and it felt like someone put giant warm blanket over me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUmm\u2026 I need to tell you what the necklace does. Actually, I think I need to start off clean. You\u2019ve been polite, and haven\u2019t asked me how I got so strong. I should tell you how.\u201d Ben looked up at Gramps for reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps saw Ben look up, so he nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*One flash back later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThat makes more sense. So you have a green orb that\u2019s growing and condensing your muscle. And its in that compass of yours. And that you got that necklace from a Plumber. Who are people that keep order in the universe. And that compass counters your intense gravitational pull that can now grab anything with in a 10 light year radius. Also, you synthesized the materials that give your necklace the ability to hold objects. But usually, it holds only one thing at a time, but for some reason, mine can hold a near infinite amount. Also, mine has the ability to guard against any form of harm, and helps prevent an unnatural form of death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYes. I think that\u2019s it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSo how strong are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never faced a challenge that I couldn\u2019t muscle out of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI see. Now how about those other green pearls? Are you going to try to seek them out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shook his head \u201cNot really. I\u2019m probably the strongest living thing in the universe, so I don\u2019t see the need to do it. Though I\u2019ve had this bad feeling that someone has more than just one pearl. I wonder what happens if you have a couple hundred, or thousands, or a planet sized horde of them. That could be bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth decided to chime in \u201cYes. That would be. That person would have the equivalent power of your orb. Just not as compressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLuckily, aliens in the universe guard the ones they have with everything they\u2019ve got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell its night time. That flashback took most of the day, and its almost time for bed. I think its safe to say that we\u2019d better get some sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was about to complain, but he saw Amy yawn, and decided that he had more stamina than most. He helped Amy up and walked her into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen on the other hand gave Seth a look and they thought of a solution to their predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amy and Gwen had changed into their swimwear, and Ben was in his swim trunks. Then they went into their designated gender pools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ben go into his little tub and the water immediately tried to sink his high density body, but Ben used his powerful legs to keep himself a float. Amy and Gwen were in the other tub relaxing and putting cucumbers on their eyes. Ben decided to relax as well. He could feel several knots in his muscle loosed, and he slowly fell asleep. So did everyone else. Gramps was on a folding chair napping with a copy of the Galaxy Times on his face. Seth also went to sleep, but only because he was forced to sleep when Gwen slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mile away, Ken saw a strange cloud of steam rise out of the forest. Ken went to check it out, and was glad to see that it was Ben and his gang. Plus they were all asleep! Ken quickly ran up and tried to grab Amy, but he felt like he slammed into a wall. Amy was about 5 ft away, but he could even reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen muttered \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ken was wondering why he couldn\u2019t get near Amy. Any angle, it seemed like their was a wall. Ken then tried another approach. He walked away, and started to dig a tunnel until he got under Gwen and Amy\u2019s pool. Then he dug up until he felt the wall from before, and pushed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the surface, Amy started to rise up from the water and float in the air. This was what Ken had hoped. He pushed her up and out into the air and then he followed. Ken slowly made a game of toss and catch with Amy. Ken slow picked up the speed until he go to the laboratory of Dr. Wess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back at the pools*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen felt a chill pass over her as the water from the pool escaped through the hole Ken had made in the ground.

I was having a nice dream. What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps looked at Gwen pool and saw that the water had gone through a hole in the ground. \u201cIt seems like someone dug from below. Though, this is only a minor problem. The big one is what happened to Amy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard Amy\u2019s name, and that there was a problem. This got his full attention and he was out of his pool in an instant. \u201cI heard Amy. What happened? Is it bad? Is she hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI don\u2019t know about hurt or anything. I know that she isn\u2019t here anymore though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhere\u2019d she go? We have to find her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Ben as he franticly talked to himself and anyone who would listen. \u201cHow are we going to find her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a flash of green from Ben\u2019s compass, and the arrow inside started to spin in on direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the compass, and realized it was showing him the way to Amy. \u201cSorry guys. Be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He vanished from sight and reappeared in front of an industrial building. Ben broke through the fencing and ignored the security and traps. He simply smashed threw the floor and the ground strait to Dr. Wess\u2019s lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab was cleared out except for a few large machines that connected to an even larger machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Get out. It\u2019s a trap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned around and saw that Amy was inside a red bubble. Ben ran towards it and broke the bubble. It let go of Amy, but it soon encases Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you run! I would have been fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat\u2019s going on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cAh\u2026 so this is the Ben Tennyson that my employer has been seeking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat do you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cNo \u2018I\u2019. He, my employer, wants your growtium orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen suddenly turned up from behind a machine \u201cWait. If he gets it. Then I don\u2019t. What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cRight\u2026 sorry. But you\u2019ve been removed from this contract.\u201d Wess hit a button and another red bubble encases Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cYou tricked me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cNot really. I simply had a pre-existing deal that force me to use you. I did what I needed to. Now that I think a bout it, I guess I did trick you. Oh well.\u201d Wess said in an undermining tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cNow just to have the extra precautions. Vilgax\u2026 master, can you please keep hold of this girl just because I don\u2019t want to get over confident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s eyes snapped open. \u201cVilgax! You made a deal with Vilgax! He\u2019s nothing but a low lying, dirty little, space urchin that wants to rule the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess sighed \u201cThat\u2019s what he said you\u2019d say. No\u2026 he\u2019s a benevolent alien that seeks to create peace. Not everyone can be trusted to do the right thing. I believe Vilgax can. don\u2019t think to badly of me. I\u2019m just doing what I think is right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a red beam appeared from the ceiling and landed on Amy. It slow dragged her off the ground and up into a ship flying over head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Ben! Help!\u201d She said while trying to break loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAmy!!!!!!\u201d screamed as he pounded against his prison made of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cI would stop hitting that wall now. It is capable of recovering instantly from any form or damage. You can only hit it in one or two locations at one time. That\u2019s not enough to break it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen leaned against is orb shaped prison. Almost hopeless until Wess said that he had only hit it in one or two places at once. Ben thought \u201cMaybe\u2026 just maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess \u201cNow about that orb. I believe that if you want that girl of yours to live, you\u2019d best give me that orb.\u201d Then he saw Ben doing something. \u201cWait. What are you doing? No!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had lifted his necklace off his neck and this released a deadly gravitational pull that attacked all the angles of the sphere. Ben started to float toward the middle of his prison as his gravitational pull tried to made the prison collapse in on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crackle. Snap. Zap.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb had begun to fail. It couldn\u2019t recover fast enough. As cracks formed, they had healed a bit, but another had already formed. To the side, the machine sustaining the orb had started to short circuit. It flashed random colors. Then BOOM! Then Ben\u2019s red prison fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWess had already retreated to the side, and Ken was still in his orb. When the prison fell, Ben quickly put his necklace back on to prevent him from destroying anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ben turned and gave Ken a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at Ben with defiance, but ended up doing something unexpected. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was confused and power hungry. I shouldn\u2019t have done that to you or Amy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Ken disbelieving his ears. Was he lying? \u201cProve it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed \u201cThere\u2019s a pile of pearls over to the side of the lab. That old man said I could have it if I got you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised an eyebrow as if to challenge him. Ben walked over to the spot Ken said, and lifted up a cloth. The was a metal container filled with hundreds of green pearls. Ben looked at in surprise at the horde. No one has this many can they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on impulse, Ben raised his compass and opened it up. As soon as he did, the pearls in the container started to float up and enter the compass. Ben\u2019s muscles pulsed every time a pearl entered the orb. Like someone stuffed an air compressor into his body, and pumped him up. Ben felt his muscle grow and condense even fast than ever before. \u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was on the side watching as the orbs entered that compass. As they entered, he could feel the power that Ben had. He finally realized that he never had a chance in the first place. \u201cBen\u2026 maybe second place isn\u2019t so bad, but I\u2019ll never know unless I get out of here. Can you give me a second chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Ken thoughtfully.

This was even a surprise to Ben. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cWow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded in agreement, but then he remembered that Amy was taken hostage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen saw Ben\u2019s expression \u201cWe better hurry.

If Ben made it again, who knows what properties it will have. Ken will be more adapted for him. Plus, I can see that his mana field is rather large. Most likely due to him being exposed to the pearls for a long period of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and everyone went outside and they told Ken what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cWait what? Gravitum? It does what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo time. Just trust us like I\u2019ve trusted you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed \u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Moments later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cThat felt kind of weird. I feel kind of tired now. What did that do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThe process takes energy to convert the nuclei of atoms into something else. Gravitum costs a rather large amount of energy. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll recover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk Ken. This think right here\u201d Ben gestured toward the clump of gravitum with a diamond in it. \u201cCan hold anything! And only you can open it. This is crucial to the plan. No everyone listen up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Under Vilgax\u2019s Ship*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was on Earth looking up  at the ship that held his girl friend. Then he jumped and smashed through the hull of she ship. Alarms started to flare. When the smoke cleared, Ben started to run around the ship at a speed close to the speed of light. He found the command center quickly. In it was an alien with tentacles covering its mouth wearing the Vilgax family crest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax \u201cHello. I\u2019ve been expecting you. Your mate is in the chair over there.\u201d He said pointing to the side \u201cBut don\u2019t try to get her. She\u2019s surround with explosives. Oh! And that\u2019s trinket that she has on won\u2019t work. The killing force of the bombs are far to great and far to close for those barriers to deflect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Get away. don\u2019t deal with this monster! He\u2019s going to take over the universe. He want\u2019s your orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI know, but I can\u2019t let you pay the price.\u201d Ben turned his attention back to Vilgax \u201cLet her go. This is just between you and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax \u201cI know\u2026 the girl can go once I get what I want. She\u2019s just here to make sure you stay. I\u2019m not so unreasonable am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at Vilgax \u201cYou know I can finish this before you even blink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax \u201cThat would be true if I didn\u2019t have my family\u2019s planet sized horde of growth crystals. We\u2019ve been collecting them for years. Destroying who ever own one and gathering them. Every last one of them. I\u2019m up to par with your orb. It just comes down to wit and cunning. That is if you want to see her live\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! NO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned to Vilgax and took off his compass. Then he did the unexpected. \u201cKen!. Now\u201d Ben yelled as he chucked the compass at Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that faction of a second, Ken opened the locket from the inside and jumped out. Also, when he got out, he got Amy off the chair, and finally tossed the chair into the compass. He didn\u2019t have time to close the compass, so when the explosives went off, a flaming inferno rose out of the opening in the compass and melted a hole in the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax was shocked for a second, but realized what just happened \u201cYou will pay for this Ben Tennyson!\u201d Vilgax said. However, at the same time, his already bulk frame got even bulkier. The pearls that he owned started to make Vilgax grow even faster as though reacting to his anger. A fraction of a second later, Vilgax vanished from sight and attacked Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen responded by dodging and trying to get a punch in every now and then. Ben had the advantage of a small more condensed frame. He was smaller, so he was more agile. Ben and Vilgax were in a horrid dance of battle. No one knew who would win. It was like a Dragonball Z fight where they would appear and disappear in different locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Ben was thinking. Where are the pearls? He has to have them close by so that can make him grow. Ben then thought \u201cMaybe he has a gravitum locket like me!\u201d That\u2019s so vilgax doesn\u2019t destroy the universe.\u201d But where is it\u2026<br>\r\nBen looked all over Vilgax trying to find something that could be it. Then he saw it. It was the Vilgax family crest. It has the same astral grey that gravitum had. In a flurry of motions, Ben grabbed the crest off of Vilgax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ben did that, he noticed a significant drop in Vilgax\u2019s strength with every passing second. Ben was out growing Vilgax in strength because Vilgax had stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax realized this to and looked for the crest on his body, but didn\u2019t see it. \u201cGive it back to me. It belongs to my family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said mockingly \u201cNot any more. I believe its mine now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax, in one last attempt, threw himself at Ben, but Ben simply side stepped. When Vilgax was with in reach, he grabbed Vilgax by and arm and tossed him through the ceiling of the ship, and out into space. All he heard was \u201cCurse you Ben Tennyson!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Vilgax was gone, Ben looked to the side and saw Ken standing next to Amy smiling grimly. \u201cIs he really gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cFor now. Though, I doubt he\u2019ll be as trouble some next time.\u201d then Ben looked at Amy \u201cAre you ok? Did he do anything to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI\u2019m fine. He couldn\u2019t even touch me because of your gift. Though, he did push me onto that chair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cRight\u2026 we better get that fixed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cWe should get out of here. We made three large holes in this ship while we were on it, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good think. Especially if I can feel the ship tilting. Can we get off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile \u201cLets go\u2026\u201d And all three kids vanished from sight (If you were watching)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back at the Rustbucket*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThey should be back about now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Gramps said that, Ben, Amy, and Ken reappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWe\u2019re back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed in relief \u201cWhat took so long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cVilgax\u2019s family had been hording every pearl created in the universe. It was about the size of a planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was listening on and gasped \u201cThat\u2019s huge! How did he hide that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWith a gravitum locket I assume?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah.\u201d Ben said as he took out the Vilgax family crest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell\u2026 hurry up and put them in your orb before someone come and nabs it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and then took out his compass from his pocket (His actually compass. The one he threw was Ken\u2018s), and took the orb out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was on the side and he stared at the size and power the of the orb. No wonder Ben was so strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ben took out his orb, he tried to open the Vilgax family crest. \u201cWhy won\u2019t it open!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOh right! Only the owner can open it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThen how do we open it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do they open it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That would cause the inter dimensional powers of the gravitum to collapse and release the pearls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Seth as though he was the smartest thing in the universe. Which he was in some ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then started the bend the crest with his hands until he came across a green crystal on the inside. \u201cThis must be the stabilizer. What kind of crystal is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cIt appears to be something similar to growthium, but it\u2019s a little different. It has a unique property. I believe that it stabilized the gravitum, but it also helped to amplify the effects of the growthium. That\u2019s why Vilgax was able to keep up with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI see. So what happens when I remove it from the gravitum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThe pearls will start to shoot out of the gravitum through the largest opening. I suggest that everyone stands back about 50 ft, lest they want to get hit by high velocity objects. Ben you can stay because you are bonded to the orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone did as Seth said, and Ben stood up and removed the crystal that was the shape of the pearl and a size of a pea. As soon as he did, he felt the air vibrates as the green pearls began to shoot out of the crest and orbit around Ben. They kept coming and coming, and didn\u2019t seem to stop. Slowly, the pearls started to get absorbed into the orb, but the speed picked up. After 5min, the pearls had stopped coming out of the crest, and were almost done falling into the orb. Along the way, Ben had felt sudden change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one had seen what happened because the whole area was blinded by green light. However, because Ben was connected to the orb, every time a pearl entered the orb, Ben felt intense pleasure. But since their were trillions, and more, Ben was drowning in euphoric pleasure. As soon as the first pearl entered the orb, Ben felt his pants tent up, and with each pearl, he felt it get harder and harder. At some point, Ben had instinctively started to jack off. He was almost in pain trying to relieve himself. Then it came. As though some one-dimensional gate had opened a door, and all the stuff locked away had rushed forward. Gallons upon gallons of cum shot out of his mighty shaft. His super dense balls were on overtime as they made millions of gallons of cum that was being released. The cum shot out so fast, it blasted straight out into the outer reaches of space. When the last trickles of pearls entered the orb, Ben had about emptied his reserves, and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Moments later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOw\u2026 I just had the Best dream ever!\u201d Ben looked around that he was in bed inside the Rustbucket. As he looked around, he saw his compass on a night stand, and the or next to it. Then Ben remembered what happened (sort of). He remembered the pearls entering the orb, and that he felt \u2018good\u2019, but passed out when the last pearl went into the orb. Ben turned his attention to the orb and saw that it was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of just a solitary dot being orbited by one other dot, there were countless dots this time orbiting the center so fast, you could barely see it. The orb was now growing a bright green and it seem to thrum with energy. As Ben looked closer, the orb looked more like an enlarged atom trapped in clear shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was changed? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

IT was dark outside now. Ben had been asleep for a couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey guys. What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps looked up \u201cWe\u2019ve just been studying that crystal inside of Vilgax\u2019s crest. Its really odd. Its not growthium. That\u2019s for sure. It seems to be a substance that reacts with the growthium crystal and make it more potent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ben started to walk closer, and he saw that it was between Gwen\u2019s hands. It was surround by a purple light as Gwen tried to understand that crystal through mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite side was Ken who was looking at Gwen intently. But when Ben got close, Ken turned his attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cHey. How was your nap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled secretly \u201cIt was good, so what else did we find on the little pearl there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get more info. Gwen is doing a fantastic job at analyzing the crystal and its properties. I only had a hunch earlier.\u201d At about this time, Gwen had finished her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIt seems that this pearl here is not growthium. It is capable of amplifying the effects of your orb, but also, if you get them to combine, it creates an area of growth. I can\u2019t quite explain it. Anything with in a certain radius of you will develop stronger. Like\u2026 not grow specifically, but will help grow. Does that make sense?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was listening like his life depended on it. Even though he gave up on trying to beat Ben, he still wanted to get stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNot really. I don\u2019t make them grow, but I help them. Do you mean like a supplement?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNot really. More of\u2026hmm\u2026 lets say Ken was working out at the gym. He gains 10lbs the first month, but with you near him, he\u2019ll develop faster, and gain 30lbs lbs. That\u2019s just and example. I don\u2019t know how much faster that grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. I think I know what you mean. The only question is\u2026 should I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was sitting down with his heart pounding. \u201cYes!\u201d He blurted out. This startled everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Ken with a slight glare. Ben trust Ken more since he helped rescue Amy, but not entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen started explaining \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get to Ben\u2019s level, so I\u2019ll settle for second best. Though, I just realized I didn\u2019t care about that either. I just want to get stronger in general.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Ken surprised at his explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was quiet the whole time, but decided to speak \u201cBen. I think you should put the pearl in your orb. It\u2019s not like its going to hurt anyone, and anyway, who else can use it? I doubt there are many pearls left in space. It\u2019d be more useful if you had it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy and smile. He couldn\u2019t say no to her. Plus her logic was reasonable. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll put it inside. Gwen\u2026 do you mind handing it over.\u201d Ben held out a hand for Gwen to drop the crystal in. When Gwen handed it over, Ben took out his orb as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the orb got close to the pearl, it flared green. Ben could feel the growing powers of the orb increasing again. Ben felt a lot of pressure build in his body as his muscle grew and compressed. Kind of like inhaling to much air. As soon as they pearl and orb touched, the whole area was flooded in green light. Then slowly, it faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben\u2019s eyes cleared, he saw that his orb was still glowing brighter than before. Also, he still felt that pressure from his increased growth. The pressure wasn\u2019t going down. It actually seemed to speed up ever so slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does this mean?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My emotions and feelings are connected to you, so I can\u2019t say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Seth and said sincerely \u201cI honestly don\u2019t mind. You\u2019re missing out on a lot. And sure, magic has a lot of benefits. But knowing that you can have something with out much effort is kind of boring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWait. Why do you sound like you\u2019re about to lose you magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen turned to Ben \u201cBecause in order for Seth to get a real body, I\u2019ll have to sever my ties with magic there by freeing Seth of his connection to me. Though, just before I lose my magic, I can perform one last spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked shocked, but they didn\u2019t say anymore. This was up to Gwen and Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want a real body. To know that you can die, but living forever has been lonely. Waiting for you to get me was one of the harder things of existing forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cMaybe being human will be more simple. It\u2019s kind of fun being tied to the problems of reality. It keeps you busy and not as bored.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was quiet. \u201cI think I\u2019ll try taking on the life of mortal. It does sound more fun then living forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smile \u201cOk. Lets get started. What do I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth asked \u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen frowned \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked if I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve put a lot of thought into this, and I\u2019m ready. Everyone deserves a chance at enjoying life to the fullest. Living forever takes the fun out of living.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cOk them. All you have to do is imagine the magic in your body leaving you, and as it leaves, you can transform it into one final spell. This ritual is called the \u2018final breath\u2019 because it will feel like you are exhaling your magical half. This will be you last breath of magic. And every time someone has performed this ritual, the spell has always been the truly spectacular and the most powerful magic that can be done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk. So just imagine it leaving me, and do I need a spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cNo. The \u2018final breath\u2019 takes the shape of your desires. Only if you are sure about this, only then will it work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk.\u201d Gwen sunk into deep thought. She was floating in her mind, and she thought of her magic. Suddenly, she saw this purple girl flying around threw the air of her mind.  The moment Gwen saw her, she kner that this was the embodiment of her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen called out \u201cHello!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl saw Gwen and flew over. When they were close enough together, Gwen grasped the girls hand, and then gave her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cGoodbye\u201d then Gwen let go and waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl looked up at Gwen and then flew away without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside Gwen body, Gwen had started to release a purple aura. It began to rush out displaying amazing power. As it shot into the sky, it began to disperse and take the form of millions of butterflies. They started to fly down ward toward Seth and circle around him. Faster and faster they spun into all you could see was a mass of purple light. It soon became the only color you could see. Then poof. It was gone. All that was left was a wisp of purple have that was gently blow away by the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had opened her eyes and saw that Seth was on the ground, and looked like he was unconscious. Gwen ran over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSeth! Are you ok?\u201d Gwen said when she arrived near him. She put a hand on his chest and was surprised to feel a heartbeat. \u201cSeth! What up! It worked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth opened his eyes and gave a cough. A small wisp of purple escapes his mouth and faded away. \u201cDid I just cough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen started at Seth and then realized her hand was still on his athletically muscled chest. Gwen\u2019s face turned red \u201cUm. It worked\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth stood and took of his shirt. The night air was cool, but was not freezing. It was the summer\u2019s night chill. \u201cIs this what cold feels like?\u201d Gwen hadn\u2019t heard that question. All she saw was Seth\u2019s tones and muscle upper body. She had felt this feeling of longing before, but now it felt more intense. Gwen stood up and hugged Seth in warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth started to cry \u201cIs this warmth\u2026?\u201d he said quietly. Then he said in a smaller voice \u201cso many wasted years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It appears that the distance is so large that it covers the whole earth, but they learnt that the orb only helps males grow bigger, and even then\u2026 its only the males that Ben knows and wants to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Seth discovered emotions, especially one that drove him towards Gwen. After the first couple weeks, they were in a full blown relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that happened was that Ken has been doing a lot of exercise. Like a lot. His minimum size was 5ft4in, and the build of a person who did track. Now, since he\u2019s been influenced by the orb, his minimum size is 5ft6in and a swimmer\u2019s build. It seems that by exercising, he increases his \u2018base\u2019 strength. Then when he grows to larger sizes, he\u2019s exponentially stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Seth\u2019s new body was feeling the effects. His new body was feeling the effects of testosterone combined with the energy from the orb. With out even exercising, his body was growing. He went from surfer\u2019s tone build to a more bulky swimmer\u2019s build. All this did was drive Gwen even more crazy for Seth\u2019s new hot bod. ()Though Gwen isn\u2019t as focused on that. The body was a bonus, but when they got Seth enrolled in school, Gwen would have someone who was as smart as her to talk to.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was still the same, except he entered his \u2018would be real\u2019 growth spurt. Like the actual one his body would have received. This brought him to a nice 5ft 8in, and still growing. Ben was 12 about now, and he looked like a 16 year old junior body builder. His pecs pushed 2in off his body. His shoulders were round and strong. His biceps were bowling balls, and his 6 pack was nice cut, and tone. One more thing for Amy to like about Ben (though she likes him mostly for his personality)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was peaceful. When word got out that any alien that wanted to do harm to earth vanished, the usual numbers had dropped down next to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill this continue?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When it exploded, Gwen saw a little girl appear from the inside. She was unconscious. Slowly, she started to fall to earth, and was slowly speeding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked shock, but still tried to save the girl \u201cWakeup! Do something.

Before she could say more, they had hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen jolted up from her bed gasping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was nearby looking a little nervous \u201cYou ok Gwen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIt was this strange dream.

Some of the energy was solidified into the body you gave me. However, I think that there was so much energy, that had nothing to do, so it went out into space. There, it solidified into another body.

You were dreaming of the materialization of her body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, but it could mean that you can get your powers back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked shocked.

I said it might be possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI know\u2026 its just that the world seems to have lost some color since I gave up my magic. Don\u2019t get me wrong. There past few weeks have been amazing, and still are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth put a finger on her mouth \u201cI know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smile and gave Seth a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWe may want to go outside. That girl is about to crash near us.\u201d Seth said this while slowly guiding Gwen outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Also, Gramps isn\u2019t here right now. He\u2018s on a Plumber assignment, and trust the Ben would handle things. Ken had also left the group and had gone home to clear thing up with his parents.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the purple light was getting closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAmy\u2026 can you step back. Things might get a little dangerous for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI doubt that I\u2019ll be in danger next to you, but ok. I\u2019ll humor you.\u201d Amy started to back up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout now, the purple light was closing in. When it was close enough to tell where it\u2019d land, Ben ran up and caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was stroking the little girl\u2019s hair. Ben was next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night continued, everyone started to fall asleep on the ground.

That\u2019s what the other place could do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAn exit?\u201d As soon as Ben thought of it, a door appeared out of nowhere. \u201cWow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl \u201cYou did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked, then he remembered to ask \u201cWhat\u2019s you name? Its strange just calling you by \u2018you\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl \u201cNo one gave me any. Though, my cousin\u2019s name is Seth, and the place I used to live in was called Gwen. I never had a name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked to here this. Then he thought, maybe this door could go to Gwen. Ben willed the door to open into Gwen\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Gwen\u2019s head, she was dreaming of a time in the future when Seth and herself would be in school together. Doing a bunch of stuff together like an item. Then suddenly, she everything changed. The scenes in her mind morphed into the scene when she first saw the girl. Everything was purple. But this time, there was a door in front of her. Slowly, it opened, and green light flooded her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIt worked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl \u201cYou found it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was shocked \u201cWhat\u2019s going on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI don\u2019t quite know, but this girl got into my dreams and wanted to come here.

This is where I said goodbye to my magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was happily flying around the landscape of Gwen\u2019s mind. \u201cOh yah\u2026 you said bye, so I left. I missed this place though. Is it ok if I stay? It took forever to find.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at the girl in shock. \u201cUm\u2026 sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl then smile and walked up to Gwen and gave her a hug. \u201cThanks Gwen.\u201d Slowly, the girl began to glow purple and she started wiz away around the strange magical landscape.

Where\u2019s that little girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThe girl was the embodiment of my magic. Though, she had real  feelings and thoughts. When I said goodbye, she left.

No funny business.\u201d He gives a sharp look at Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile innocently. Gwen was looking around, and admiring the building. The halls were full of display cases full of rare crystals and rocks that were being used for medical uses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour guide \u201cThank you all for waiting. Now if you would follow me this way, we\u2019ll get to see that world\u2019s largest synthetically formed diamond. And its still growing bigger!\u201d This got people\u2019s attention, and they followed along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen on the other hand had other things to do. He walked with the crowd, and slowly began to back up. When they were out of sight, he walked away into another hallway. He walked down and say behind one of the windows was a room filled with an endless array of technology. \u201cI wonder what all those things do\u2026\u201d Ben continued walking until he found a door, and he slipped in. All of a sudden, he heard a door slam. Ben quickly hid behind something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cDoctor. This must be the greatest thing ever discovered. This mineral can solve the obesity problem. It will strengthen any human! Can you believe it! When the ray hit the crystal, and fired at beam at that mouse, it practically doubled in muscle mass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice \u201cOk. I know its exciting, but remember that this must be confidential until we fully test it, and get it patented.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cSorry doctor, but do you know what this means?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other voice \u201cYes. I do. All kids with growing disorders will be cured, and improved beyond our imaginations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the voices faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI wonder what this thing is?\u201d Ben was slowly think of what it\u2019d be like to be bigger and stronger. No one could boss him around. He could do stuff that he was to small and weak to do. \u201cIf only\u2026\u201d Then Ben got an idea. He looked around until he saw a security camera. He hid behind another machine, and turned to the Omnitrix. You could see the aliens change until you saw a blobby kind. \u201cAlright\u2026 Upgrade\u2026\u201d Ben pressed down, an there was a flash of green. When it cleared, you saw a strange green blob. It moved, and jumped into the security camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he did that, security alarms flared. A speaker turned on \u201cAll personnel! There has been a security breech. I repeat a security breech. All tours are postponed till further notice. Make way to the field up front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps looked around for Gwen, and saw her standing near the front of the group, but where was Ben. Gramps waved for Gwen to come closer. \u201cHave you seen Ben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHe\u2019s gone isn\u2019t he\u2026 idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed \u201cWhere could he have gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was a bout to say she didn\u2019t know, but a security camera caught her eye. Instead of the usual clear lens, there was a large green circle that was blinking. Gwen pointed to it \u201cHe\u2019s there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps turned and saw that camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Ben, he was looking around, and he saw Gramps and Gwen stare at him. \u201cOh no. They saw me!\u201d Ben quickly retreated from the camera and went around looking for this mineral they were talking about. Suddenly, he felt a sucking motion. All the energy inside the wires that he was in was being dragged to one location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Three floors down*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were dozens of people in lab coats preparing for the next test of the newest mineral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman stepped up to an old looking man \u201cDoctor. All preparations have been completed. We are ready to proceed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor \u201cAlright then.\u201d The doctor stepped up to a large machine in the center of the room. The machine was a laser kind of thing, but it had a clear container in the middle. A stream of energy was being passed through it. Inside was a green softball sized orb. The doctor walked up to a control panel near by and pressed a large red button. The laser started to charge up and drag a huge amount of energy. In front of the laser was a young kid. Average in every way. He signed up for this because he wanted to be bigger. As the tension built\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was being forcefully sucked threw the wires. He couldn\u2019t fight it. The current was to strong. It twisted and turned, and doubled back several time. Then suddenly it slowed down. Ben looked forward, and saw that he was heading toward an opening. He was shot out and he saw a giant green orb in front of him. The current he was riding sent him orbiting the orb, and POW! He slammed into it, and got sucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Outside the ray gun*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeep Beep Beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoman \u201cDoctor. It seems that something has gone past security and obtained access to this room. The person could be manipulating the laser!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor looked slightly panicked \u201cShut it down! Shut it all down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the scientist in the room went to a near by electrical panel and started to turn this off, but it was to late. The laser was already charges up, so it fired!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid looked as the laser hit him for a brief second. The feeling was warm and tingle, but that was about it. Then it stopped. The laser started to recede back into the machine, and it no longer fired at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam from the laser moved back until it was back in the orb. Then suddenly, it fired out a bright Green light, but it didn\u2019t continue to the boy. It stopped short and began to bugle out at the end as though it was being trapped in a bubble. The laser kept on firing until it ran out of power. Slowly, the ball of green light \u2018popped\u2019, and out came a green alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around and was confused. What happened? I just slammed into a green orb, and now I\u2019m in a room surrounded by scientist. Wait! They can see me. Ben started running towards an exit. The scientists in his way ran scream at the unusual green monster made its way to them. Then the worst happened. There was a green flash, and Upgrade turned back into Ben. The flash blinded everyone for a moment giving Ben enough time to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid sitting in the test area was looking over his body, and smile slightly. He was the average skinny kid before, but now he was more on the heavy side. That brief contact with the laser had made him really athletic. The kid was about 10 yo, and his muscles were big, but not to huge that it looked weird on his body. The kid stared as the green thing ran away, but blinked when it changed into a boy. That boy looks familiar\u2026 The kid couldn\u2019t remember at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist was still in panic over what happened. Only one person was quiet, and it was the doctor. The doctor stood in front of the machine, and he was looking at the clear container. There used to be a green orb in it, but not any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Ben, he had ran up several flights of stairs. In his panic, he didn\u2019t see that he was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat size was he?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Be nice, I know Ben\u2019s a little careless, but he\u2019s a good kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat ever\u2026 we better stop him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had ran to the nearest stair case and were about to open the door, until it burst forward. Gramps was surprised to the brown haired nephew of his fly threw the air into him. Gramps caught Ben but had to take a few steps back. Gramps didn\u2019t remember Ben being this heavy before. Not much heavier, but still heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen got his face out of Gramp\u2019s gut. \u201cOh. Hey guys. We have to get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat did you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had already started jogging to the exit. \u201cTalk later. Run now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the stairwell, there were a bunch of panicked voices rushing up the stairs. Gwen and Gramps joined Ben as they made their way to the exit. They left the building, and got into the Rustbucket, and drove away. After an hour of driving, they pulled over to the side the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBen\u2026 you have some explaining.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Gramps defiantly \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault. The dang thing sucked me in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps raised an eyebrow \u201cSucked you in? Just start from the moment you left us. It\u2019ll make more sense that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk\u2026 So I left the group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWe know that. Duh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gave Gwen a glare \u201cWell\u2026 I left the group and looked around. Then I heard these scientist talking about a mineral that can make people bigger and stronger. Stuff like that. I wanted to have a look at it, so I turned into Upgrade and went around looking by using the security cameras. Then suddenly, I felt all the energy inside the wires suck me in on directions. The took me to this orb, and slammed me into it. After that, I don\u2019t really know. However, I do know that I was surrounded by people, and had to get out before the watch timed out, but it did when I was so close to getting out. Anyway, I don\u2019t think anyone saw me. I think the green flash blinded them for a few seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was waiting for Gramps to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that. These labs are expensive. Luckily, it doesn\u2019t sound like you broke anything. Anyway, you are still getting a punishment. It doesn\u2019t seem like you intended to do harm, but you should stop meddling. No going outside the Rustbucket for a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked by how short the punishment was. His parents would have grounded him for a month if he did something like this. However, Ben made a sad face just to satisfy Gramps. Then he started to mumble about how its not fair\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk. Stop whining. Now tell me about this orb. I\u2019m curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen starts to talk about the orb and what it looked like. Gwen on the other hand had stopped listening when Ben had received his punishment. She turned on her laptop and was looking up the latest news. On the front page of a newspaper website was the name of the place they were just at. \u201cLatest mineral discovery had gone missing. Unknown alien is blamed for theft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cGuys. Take a look. It seems like Ben\u2019s famous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Gramps walked over and read the article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI didn\u2019t take it. I swear! Even search me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNo\u2026 I don\u2019t think you took it purposely. Though its odd that it disappears then you came out. Something must have happened along the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell, all I know is everything I told\u2026\u201d Ben stopped talking as he felt something happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on with Ben?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt like there was some time of energy coursing threw his veins that originated at his balls. Slowly, Ben began to grow. His muscles stretched, ripped and repaired them selves. His bones grew longer making him taller. Though, the whole time, Ben simply felt a warm tingle, though it was more intense in his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBen\u2026 what just happened. You grew!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feeling faded away, Ben looked down at his body and say that he was bigger. Not much, but the growth was definitely there. His shirt felt more snug. He looked at his arm and saw small bumps of muscle that weren\u2019t there before. Ben picked up his shirt and saw small dimples where his abs would be. Even his chest pushed out half an inch. Underneath the fabrics of his pants, he could feel that his leg muscle were larger to. \u201cWow\u2026\u201d Ben just admired his growth. He flexed and arm and felt the bicep that formed. It was small, but hard as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBen\u2026 I think you have the orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen snapped back into focus \u201cI told you. I didn\u2019t take it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI know\u2026 you think you didn\u2019t take it, but while you were growing, I saw a green glow behind your zipper. I think the orb is in your middle region. Technically, its your groin. I cold get into more depth, but I\u2019ll have to look more closely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat ever. I\u2019m good. I don\u2019t mind. I kind of like the growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell\u2026 I can\u2019t do anything about it unless I know more about what\u2019s going on.

I think I know who to call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cso what do we do if we find out what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d As he talked, he took out his plumber badge and called to people.

Now all the Tennyson\u2019s had to do was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk. They\u2019re coming. They\u2019ll be hear in about 12hours. They are both on different continents right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen groaned \u201cThat\u2019s to long of a wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cStop whine. At least you got something out of this event. Everyone in school was getting taller than you. That\u2019s why that Nick kid picked on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stuck out his tongue \u201cHe was bigger than everyone since first grade. Everyone else is about his size now. He just grew early. He can\u2019t pick on anyone now. I heard that he\u2019s an \u2018average\u2019 sized 11 year old now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell\u2026 anyway. You should just be quiet. You grew to a normal height, though your muscles had more development. You look kind of athletic now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019ve always been athletic\u2026 just not coordinated or strong or big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell at least your humble about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah. Well. I don\u2019t need to be humble for long. If this keeps up, I\u2019ll be bigger than everyone soon.\u201d As soon as he said that, he felt the warm tingle again, and he smiled. He slowly grew again, but it lasted longer. As it happened, the tingle in his balls felt even more intense than before, but he ignored it. When it stopped, Ben was 5ft 5in tall, and had a light swimmer\u2019s build. His pecs pushed an inch and a half off his body. His 6pack was defined and hard as a rock. His biceps were softballs. Even his penis had caught on a little with the growth, and was 8in long, and his balls were golf balls. It looked like he was a well balanced athlete who could do almost any sport. He could pass for a 15 year old. Though, he still had the face of a 10 year old. \u201cAwesome! It happened again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps and Gwen looked at Ben worried that something bad was going to happen to Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI hope they hurry up. We don\u2019t know if this will have negative effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m just worried that his muscles are going to feed his ego and make him even dumber than he already is. One small dweeb was bad, but a bulky one is even worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen  smile snidely \u201cI don\u2019t care about your insults. Nothing\u2019s going to ruin my mood.\u201d As he was talking, he felt the tingle for a brief second, and he hag grown a little more. \u201cActually, I think my mood might even get better.\u201d he said as he flexed his newly enlarge bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waited, Gwen started to read her spell book, and Gramps had gone to his Plumber\u2019s guide to the universe. He wanted to find out more on Ben\u2019s issue. Ben on the other hand didn\u2019t think it was an issue at all. It was more of a gift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ben, the time spent waiting was a period of understanding his new body. He started to do exercises and lift things he could never do before. Though, he did get tired sometimes because everyone had a limit. Ben did about 300 pushups before he got tired. When he did get tired though, he felt the warm tingle and grew again. Then he would start doing another set of push ups, but even more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 11hrs had past, Ben had grown significantly. He could pass for a high school senior that was into pro bodybuilding. He was 6ft 9in tall. His pecs pushed out 6in off his body. His 8pack abs were cut so deeply that you could stick your whole index finger in before you hit the end. His biceps were 8in in diameter, which is really big! His legs had grown so big that that were rubbing against each other. Even his calves looked over stuffed. During his growing, he had already lost his cloths. The 10yo sized clothing could never hope to cover the godly muscles of Ben Tennyson. The only thin that survived was his underwear, but even that was about to fail. If it were to hang freely, it would be 18in long with coconut balls. Though, Ben didn\u2019t think much of it at his age. He\u2019s only TEN! He just thought it made going to the bathroom easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI\u2019ve had enough! Stop moving around and put some cloths on!\u201d Gwen\u2019s face was red because she had been looking at Ben naked for the past 7hrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like all this muscle? Besides. I don\u2019t have anything that fits. I doubt I could fit in gramp\u2019s stuff either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps over heard this \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d He said sarcastically. \u201cAnd I do have thing that will fit you!\u201d he stated. \u201cI should probably give it to you now because our guests will be here soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised an eye brow unwilling to believe that anything could cover his gargantuan muscle. Earlier, he like the fill of his cloths tightening around his muscle, and the feeling they gave when they tore off his body \u201cReally? You have something?\u201d Even though Ben did like feeling the cloths gave off when they ripped, he was starting to feel self conscious of the fact that he was almost naked. \u201cUmm.. You don\u2019t happen to have under wear do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps laughed \u201cYah. I do, tough you aren\u2019t getting my underwear. I\u2019m giving you Plumber brand clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWait! You mean those grey space suits you wear? Those are so boring. Don\u2019t you have anything like what I usually wear? You know\u2026 a the T-shirt and cargo pants that I usually wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps laughed at Ben\u2019s whining over style \u201cDon\u2019t worry. These aren\u2019t space suits. When plumbers are forced to go to other planets that don\u2019t have the same conditions on earth, we wear special clothing that mimics the feeling of earth. Though we will still need to have an oxygen tank or something. The clothing just keeps us from being crushed by gravity, and maintains the proper body pressure. It is also near indestructible. The material is super stretchy, heat resistant, and can\u2019t be torn. Trust me. We tried to set it on fire. We put it on the surface of a star, and it still came out perfectly normal. We were able to stretch it to the size of a mountain before we lost the man power to stretch it even further. Then we tried to cut it, but we couldn\u2019t. not even with lasers. These types of cloths are given to the higher ranks of plumbers once they have earned the clothing. But I think you should have it. You\u2019ll need it more than me.\u201d As gramps talked, he pressed a button on the wall and a set of cloths came sliding on a tray out of the wall. The clothing was gray and looked totally  not extraordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThey look bland, but put them on anyway. You\u2019ll be in for a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked over shaking the Rustbucket with his heavy foot falls. Ben took the clothing and put them on. They were actually to large for Ben. They hung to loose. Then suddenly, they started to shrink and wrap around Ben\u2019s body perfectly. They hugged his every muscle on his body showing off their size and power. Then something else happened. They started to change colors and pocket began to form. After a few moment, Ben was wearing a larger version of what he usually wore. \u201cThese are so cool! Thanks Gramps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYah. Yah. I don\u2019t need to get you a birthday present now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face froze \u201cSeriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps broke into a smile \u201cOk. That was funny. I think about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk good. Think long and good. Or until you think you want to get me something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen saw something outside walk toward the door. \u201cHey guys. I think someone\u2019s here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These are my grandkids, Ben and Gwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly\u2019s mouth was wide open when she saw Ben. \u201cHe\u2019s huge.

But this is totally different. Wait, Did you say ten?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded \u201cYah. Ten\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Melly was talking to Gramps, Ben felt a kind of strange. Due to the effects of the orb on his body, Ben had progressed further into puberty, thus causing his hormones to be highly explosive at time. He felt his penis fill with blood, and his face turn red. As he stared at Melly, he began to feel the tingly feeling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen excused himself to the bathroom. As he left, he heard her talking about how he was growing right before his eyes. When he got to the bathroom, he tried to calm his emotions. He was confused. Then he turned his attention his penis. Why is it hard? Ben poked it, and he felt a wave of pleasure pass through him. Then as if by instinct, he threw his pants off and began to jack off. With every pump, he felt himself grow even bigger and bigger. His lengthening shaft only made the feeling more intense. Then a pressure began to build up inside. Like a hose, his penis shot hot steaming cum straight into the air and onto the ceiling. Then suddenly, something appeared at the base of his newly extended shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon the pressure grew to much Ben to bear, but luckily for him, the thing holding it all back was forced forward. The thing at the base of his 24in long shaft bugled out at the base of his penis and slot made its way up the pole until it was thrown into the air by a jet of cum. As it flew into the air, it flashed green and all the cum that Ben had just made flew threw the air and into the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Ben had calmed down and his raging hard on had subsided. He was bigger than before. We had about 9ft tall now. His orgasm had gave his a huge spurt of growth. His pecs blocked his vision of the lower half of his body. His arms were so bulky, he couldn\u2019t touch his face. His legs were so huge that they pushed each other apart. All Ben could manage was standing up strait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat am I going to do!

I would date him if he were older. Though, his face is kind of to young and his body is way to old for him. I think he should seriously think of a way to shrink down to a size that fits his age. At least then I could squeeze his cheeks and say how cute he looks. And maybe a few girls will think he\u2019s kind of hot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cSHHH! He\u2019s going to hear you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was in the corner laughing her head off. This lady was hilarious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenald was quietly listening on. He\u2019s lived way to long to be dealing with this stuff. That\u2019s why he\u2019s doing research hundreds of miles away from hear beneath the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the talked, Ben couldn\u2019t help but think about what he\u2019s become. When Melly talked about the girls his age, what would his friends think of him now? A muscle bound freak! How were his parents going to react? Ben suddenly felt separated from everything that he\u2019d once known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked in the mirror and compared himself to his old self. First off, his old self could fit in the mirror, but now, he\u2019s so big now that only part of his lower half is visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen imagined himself at a smaller size. At about 5ft5in. That\u2019d make him about 4in above the tallest person in his grade. Then he thought about his muscles, and imagined a large but manageable size. His pecs were pushing and inch off his body. He abs were nice and defined. His shoulders were broader than most. His arms were thick with muscle, but not abnormally huge, and he his legs larger than most, but still built for speed and power. He hadn\u2019t know to think about this, but he subconsciously thought of having a 7 in penis with gold balls for balls. Overall, he could pass for a large and very athletic 13 yo. Soon, he felt a tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a green orb. Ben bent over and picked it. \u201cThis is what\u2019s been making me grow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then held it up to the light to get a better look at it. When the light passed threw the orb and onto Ben, he felt a slight tingle. Oh no! I\u2019m growing again. Ben looked down at his body and saw nothing happening. He felt the tingle, but he wasn\u2019t growing. Ben pulled the orb out of the light and the tingle stopped. Ben noticed this and put it back into the light, and the tingle came again. Then he kept the orb in the light, and he stepped out of the light. He felt the tingle stop. The he put his other hand in the light, and the tingle came back again. \u201cWow\u2026 I wonder what\u2019s happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen put the orb in his pocket and got ready to show everyone that he had shrunk down. As he was about to exit the bathroom, he accidentally hit the cabinet next to the sink, and pushed it out of place. \u201cThat\u2019s odd. This thing was like 500lbs\u201d The cabinet was made of wood infused with various metals. It only grew in space. \u201cHow can I move it so easily?\u201d Ben new from when he had been exercising that he had limits. He knew that the limit for a body his size was about at most 120lbs of repetitive lifting. Ben turned toward the cabinet and lifted it up. It felt like it was almost nothing. He began to lift it up and down. he did about a hundred before he felt slightly fatigued. Then a thought occurred to Ben. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t lose my muscles. They just got compressed into this body!\u201d Ben was so excited about his new strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen open the door \u201cGuys! Something awesome just happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen hadn\u2019t looked at Ben yet \u201cWhat took you so long. You\u2019ve been in there for like 40minutes.\u201d Then she turned to face Ben \u201cBen! You get smaller! What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was curious \u201cI\u2019d like to know how as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 I kind of thought of a smaller body. I kind of grew while I was in there. A lot actually. I think I was 9ft tall or something, but I anyway. I couldn\u2019t move at all. I was stuck, so I thought that being big wasn\u2019t so great. That\u2019s why I thought of a smaller body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly was shocked by Ben\u2019s change, so she walked up to him. When she was right in front of him, Ben felt his penis get hard again (he hoped no one noticed), but the tingle feeling didn\u2019t come. Melly looked at Ben\u2019s body and then started to pinch his cheek \u201cThat face is so adorable!\u201d Melly said in that voice that you use when you\u2019re being playful with a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Melly did this, Gwen busted out laughing. Ben just gave her a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled and couldn\u2019t help but let out a small chuckle. Then he saw a bulge in Ben\u2019s pocket \u201cHey Ben. What\u2019s in your pocket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then snapped back into reality \u201cOh right!\u201d Ben reached into his pocket and pulled out the orb. \u201cThis kind of came out of my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was when Renald decided to chime in \u201cImpossible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone grew serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said \u201cWhat? What\u2019s impossible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenold \u201cThis whole time, you\u2019ve been growing. I could only think of one possible solution. But even the answer is outrageous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but can you be more clear? I want to know what going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenold \u201cThere is only one mineral/crystal capable of making things grow, and that is called Growthium. I\u2019ve only seen 3 growthium crystals in my lifetime, and that was on plumber missions with powerful and/or wealthy aliens. Each time, the crystal was only the size of a small pearl. Later on, I learnt that all the crystals are the size of small pearls, and they all had equal ability to grow things. Though it was at a slow rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his orb and was comparing it to what Renald was saying \u201cSo mine is different\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenold \u201cYes! That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t jump to conclusions so quickly. You orb has to be growthium because it has all the same characteristics, as the usual, but just large in all categories. Where did you get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cActually, I took it with out knowing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenold \u201cFrom an alien no doubt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cActually, a human facility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenold was awestruck \u201cNot possible. The crystal is found on only one planet in the universe, and the conditions it forms under are very unique. The planet is green, and it is next to a green star. The planet itself I like a plant crystal. It reacts with light to make a certain type of energy. It is impossible to mine from the planet for some reason, but once a year (one orbit around it\u2018s star) it releases a single pearl into space. And that pear is collected by someone. Thought this was a long time ago. The planet has vanished from existence. Every time it ejected a pearl, it lost some mass. I don\u2019t know why your\u2019s has such a large size.\u201d Then an idea struck him \u201cUnless\u2026 it could be the last pearl formed. I think it could be possible for you to be holding the planet itself. Instead of ejecting a pearl, it hurled itself across space until it landed on earth where some scientist thought he discovered a new mineral\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo\u2026 this think here is one of a kind? Does it work with other living things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenold \u201cYes\u2026 it is capable of making other things stronger, but to a minimal extent. It will however, bond with a living organism via their DNA. It seems that when you slammed into the orb, it copied your DNA and only recognizes you. It will grow you infinitely. It can grow other things just a smidge, and only with your permission.\u201d Then as though to make them not hold his to his word \u201cThis is just what I learnt from reading the studies of other aliens. I\u2019ve read hundreds of essays, and dozens of test results. They are all to close to be false.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo if I tossed this to one of you, and want you to be a little more tone, taller, or more muscled, it would grow you a smidge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenaldo \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Gwen and tossed it at her. Instinctively, she caught it. At the same time, she was sitting near a window inside the sunlight. As the orb passed threw the light, it began to make Gwen a smidge more toned. She didn\u2019t get any taller, or that much muscle. She just looked like she did gymnastics, aerobics, or yoga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen yells and threw the ball down \u201cAhh! I don\u2019t want to get all freaky muscled like Ben!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen burst out laughing, and Gwen continued into a speech of insults that lasted for 10minutes about how of an idiot, dweeb, insensitive, evil, little person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cRelax. You look better now. You look more tone and less of a book worm. You look more athletic, and not as hard to look at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen quieted down and looked in the mirror. She did look more tone, and her stomach was more tight, and showed a faint 6pack. Unlike before she no abs. She then glared at Ben and stomped out of the Rustbucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps glared at Ben for a moment, but couldn\u2019t help a chuckle. \u201cBen\u2026 you should have asked first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly \u201cOk Gramps. What did you want me here for? I can understand why Renald was called over, but why me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI knew that you excelled in anatomy, biology, and all thing medical. I wanted you to examine Ben because I worried that there were some unknown negative side effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made Ben panic. He worried that Melly might see his hardened penis if she examined him thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly gave Ben a knowing smile and said \u201cNo. I can tell he\u2019s fine. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had seen the smile and knew the Melly had already known. Ben bent his head down sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI\u2019ll trust your judgment over my own, though I though he was doing pretty good to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly \u201cWell\u2026 now\u2019s a time I should leave, but seeing that its such a nice day, think a picnic in the woods would be a wonderful thing. Don\u2019t we all agree? Renald, would you be a dear, and go ask Gwen for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAlready heard, and I\u2019d love to. I was just outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen knowing that Melly was leaving wanted to leave a good impression on her. He knew it wasn\u2019t going to happen, but he was still going to try to be friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly \u201cIts settled! Max, start driving! Do you know any good picnic spots in the woods?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smile \u201cPlenty. Do you want a view of a waterfall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly burst out \u201cOf course! Now get going. The rest of us are going to get out cook on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wish it was like this everyday\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile hearing that Melly was so happy. He decided to just relax under the sky. As he laid down, he set the orb on his chest. It was held in place by his pecs and his up abdominal. As soon as the put it out into the light, he felt the warm, soothing tingle pass over his body. He slowly drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBen! You\u2019re sinking! What\u2019s going on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got everyone up and they all looked at Ben. Ben on the other hand had sat up causing the orb to fall of him. He looked around and saw that he had created an imprint of his body on the ground about 3in deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why did I get so heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenald \u201cIt appears that you still grow, but it gets compressed into your current frame. So your are steadily getting denser, though it happens relatively slow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh\u2026 then how much do I weigh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cLets find out.\u201d Gramps went to the Rustbucket and returned with an electronic scale. \u201cThis scale can weigh anything up to infinity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stepped onto the scale and it ready 10000lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat the! I\u2019m Ten thousand pounds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s mouth was open except Renold who had calculated an astimate for Ben\u2019s weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWe better make a plan for when you become to dense. We\u2019ll need a way to counteract your weight.\u201d Gramps went back into the Rustbucket and returned with a ray gun thingy. \u201cThis thing can make anything it fires at weight under 10lbs. Plumbers use it to transport impossibly heavy objects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWow\u2026 that\u2019s awesome. So if I was say a million lbs, and you used that, it would still work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps chuckled \u201cWe used this on a planet, and it still worked. Thought it only lasts for 24hrs. We\u2018ll have to get a more permanent solution at Mt Rushmore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo lets get going! I don\u2019t want to fall to the center of the earth!\u201d Ben stepped of the scale and sank a foot into the ground. \u201cUmm.

Slowly, the tingly feeling started to cross over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, near the 24hr mark, they go to Mt. Rushmore and had gotten in it. The place always amazed Ben when he came, and Gwen as well. Ben was near the back of the group as he walked and stared. While he was going that, he failed to notice that the floor beneath was starting to crack and sink under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps had gotten to a podium type of thing and presses a button.

He had left the ray back in the Rustbucket. He turned back to the podium and scrolled even faster. Then he heard another crash and Ben had sunk knee deep into the ground. This made Gramps look faster. Then he found it. He pressed for it to come to them. A container slid ut of the wall near the ceiling and began its decent.

Gramps tossed it to Ben \u201cCatch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the only then left of Ben body was his arms and head. Ben saw the necklace coming and caught it. He put it on, and he felt a tingle pass over his body. Then it vanished. Ben dragged himself out of the floor and stood up. \u201cThis thing felt weird when I put it on. What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThat is Gravitum. The only known place to mine it is Gravitron. The planet is 100% gravitum. The reason its had to mine is because the planet has no gravity. Instead, it pushes anything near it away. Though, through a lot of effort, the metal can be mined. Its just expensive. When you put it on, the effect of the metal in the necklace effected you be countering the effect of gravity on you, and your gravity on anything else. Something strange about this metal is that it makes you look as much as you weigh. Unlike the gun which just reduces your weight to below 10lbs. The necklaces recognizes the space you take up and makes you weigh a certain weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the necklace \u201cThat pretty awesome, but what the thing at attached for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cGravitum has another property. It can contain another dimension. To do that, You have to loop the gravitum into a closed circle. Then you have to apply a barrier so that it doesn\u2019t break free. You can store nearly anything inside that little thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the logo of the omnitrix on it, and was kind of disbelieving. The thing was so small. \u201cSeriously\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cGive it a shot. Just hold something in front of it, and it\u2019ll get sucked in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gave it a shot. He put his orb in front, and then a green light touched the orb and sucked it in. \u201cWow! Did you see that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smile at Ben\u2019s reaction \u201cOk. That\u2019s solved lets go back outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWait! Can I have one? Why does Ben get all the cool stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps stopped for a second and stared at Gwen. He just realized that Ben\u2019s been getting everything. The cloths, the orb, the Omnitrix, and now the necklace. He had an idea. Gramps walked over to the container again and rummages around for something. \u201cFound it!\u201d Gramps pulled out bracelet that was glowing slightly purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at it \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cit\u2019s a bracelet. don\u2019t let it fool you. This is also gravitum, but it had been melted down and forged on Anodyne, Gwen\u2019s alien ancestral home. There, they learnt that just by simple melting it down, and molding it with magic will give it special properties. Each one is unique. This one can magnify your magical ability. It still has the same abilities as Ben\u2019s though. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen gave Gramps a hug and said thanks for the bracelet. She had learnt long ago that she had a connection to aliens, and had wanted something to prove it. Now she had some jewelry made on her ancestral planet. She looked at it closely and saw that the links that made up the necklace were carved in intricate designs and the metal was purple, but when she looked closer. Then suddenly, she felt her energy spike. She jumped from the sudden shock. \u201cWow. What just happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThe bracelet just linked up with your flow of mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOh.\u201d Gwen looked at the bracelet again, but this time, she saw little waves of purple energy flow over the metal, but she only saw that when she looked real close. From someone else\u2019s perspective, it just looks like a purple necklace. \u201cThanks again Grandpa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNo problem.\u201d Gramps said as he walked over to Ben and Gwen and ruffled their hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cGramps! My hair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps laughed at this. \u201cLets go out and join Melly and Renald. They said they\u2019d stay outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got outside, Melly and Renold were talking about what Ben had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly \u201cI worry that Ben might get careless. With his strength, he could kill someone by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenold \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s capable of avoiding that scenario. He just need to work on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both saw Ben, Gwen and Max approaching. Ben\u2019s face was looking down ashamed.

I think the bracelet I gave you is going to be very useful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWe are going to need you to learn a new spell. Its simple to perform, but it takes a lot of effort to acquire the ability to do the spell.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked up at Gramps ready for a challenge \u201cI think I can handle it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smile grimly \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be fun, but necessary. We\u2019re on a dead line.\u201d Gramps went into the Rustbucket and brought back a scroll. \u201cThis is one of the higher level spells. Its teleporting. The spell will take you anywhere in the universe. It cost the same amount of energy to teleport to the other end of the universe, and 10 feet away. That\u2019s why Anodites spend so much time practicing the spell. It is very useful when you\u2019re are trying to escape or transport something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked determined to master the spell. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps opened the scroll and read \u201cWell, the spell can be done easily, but the energy required is tremendous. If we want to do the spell, we\u2019ll need to see how much mana you have to use. To do that, we\u2019ll have to do a test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat\u2019s the test?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYou have perform 5 spells simultaneously for 10minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen almost gagged \u201cWhat! I can only manage 2, and for about 6 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThat\u2019s where the bracelet comes into play. Its steadily growing the level of magic you have in your body, and magnifies it at the same time. It took me a lot in order to get that bracelet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at the bracelet in awe at its abilities. Now that Gramps pointed that out, she did feel more energetic. \u201cOk. I think I\u2019m up for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cAlright. Lets get started. You\u2019ll need to levitate a large object, summon a ball of light, convert matter into something else, and make an illusion. You have to do with without the aid of arcane symbols\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen\u2019s anxiety began to build, but she suppressed it. \u201cI can do this\u201d She said to herself. \u201cCan everyone step about 20ft away. Just incase things get out of control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone did that. Then Gwen stood in the middle of a clearing and began to chant a series of complex spells. Time seemed to freeze for Gwen. She could see and sense everything around her that was alive. Everything with mana, she could sense. There was on particularly large mana. She looked and saw that is was Ben. Then she turned hr focus back on the spell. Time resumed. The air began to vibrate with energy. The soil shook. Suddenly, the boulders nearby began to float up and orbit around Gwen. Then next, a ball of light appeared above her head. After, the ground began to changed it slowly went of brown to transparent. Gwen turned it into water temporarily. Next, the water began to mist. The mist came together to create the imaged of a person, the person was Albert Einstein, and he was talking about science and what not. As the minutes ticked by, Gwen realized she had down far better than she\u2019s ever done. At about 5 minutes, Gwen felt the fatigue of maintaining all the spells. At 8minted, Gwen wanted to give up. The whole time, everyone had been cheering her on, but she stopped hearing them a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw this, and walked into the front of Gwen vision. He started to taunt her and make faces. \u201cI knew you couldn\u2019t do it! Hah! Every Anodite can do this but you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen heard all this and redoubled her efforts just to prove Ben wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen continued the taunt, but eased up a bit so he didn\u2019t actually discourage her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk good. Its been 10minutes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Gramps said that, Gwen felt like she weighed a million pounds. One by one, all he spells disintegrated. The boulders fell. The light vanished. The water turned back into dirt, and Einstein said good bye and vanished. Then Gwen began to fall. Gwen felt herself falling, but couldn\u2019t do much about it. She was just to depleted. Her arms were like lead weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw her falling and ran up and caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen felt the feeling stop. She had landed on something warm and soft. (Ben had un-flexed his muscle to soften the landing). Suddenly, she remembered a time from long ago. Some kids were trying to scare her on Halloween, but none of them worked. He dad was carrying her around. She felt nice and safe in his arms. Now, she was in Ben\u2019s arm and could feel the warms of his body, and the strong steady beat of his heart. It was all to comfortable, so she drifted off into a nice peaceful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world came back into view as Gwen woke up. Her body felt a little sore as though she\u2019d some form of exercise. Why am I so sore? Then suddenly she recalled everything that happened, especially when Ben caught her. When did he become so gentle? I thought his muscles were like brick walls, or harder! Gwen got out of bed and saw that it was night time. She looked out the window, and saw everyone around a campfire waiting for her to join them eventually. Gwen grabbed a light blanket and draped it over her self, and went out to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw her come out and waved her over to sit next to him. When did he get so nice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen walked over and sat next to him. She waited for the fire to warm her, but she found that the heat that came off Ben\u2019s body was warming her faster, so she leaned on him and rested her head on his shoulder slowly letting his warm envelope her. Ben didn\u2019t object either. He swore to be a little gentler after he heard what Melly said. He\u2019s going to give Gwen a break today, but he\u2019ll be a little more himself tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly at the time saw what was happening, and smile softly. She was proud that Ben was acting less rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Gramps was a little shocked, but he didn\u2019t object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group remained silent for the rest of the night, and slowly gone to bed. Melly and Renald said they\u2019d go tomorrow morning since Gwen was asleep. It\u2019d be rude to leave Gwen before saying good bye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Ben\u2019s muscle have become denser, he found that he could sleep standing up, or sitting. His muscles locked into position when he did this. So through out the night, Ben slept by the burnt out fire, and Gwen had fallen from his shoulder to his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the sound of birds chirping woke Gwen up. She was resting on something warm and comfy. She looked up and saw that She was still resting on Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen on the other hand was still sleep. Before the fire burned out, he realized that he was getting denser. The light from the fire reacted with the orb inside. He thought that since the orb was put away, that it wouldn\u2019t grow him anymore. But he was wrong. Even now, when the sun is up, if it hits the little pendant that Ben is wearing, Ben will still grow. The sun had been on the rise for hours, and now that Gwen had woken up, she made Ben wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHey sleepy head. Wake up! Its morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s eyes slowly opened. He didn\u2019t need to sit up because he was already sitting up. \u201cHuh? Why am I outside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBecause we fell asleep out here you dunce!\u201d Gwen like the way Ben made her feel safe, but she still couldn\u2019t help but give a sarcastic insult every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen realized this and smile \u201cWell excuse me little lady. It\u2019s not like its my fault we both fell asleep out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled lightly knowing that if Ben hadn\u2019t been so warm, she\u2019d have gone back inside. \u201cRight\u2026 sure it wasn\u2019t\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued back and forth. Their noise had gotten the other adluts to wake up and join them outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly had brought a mirror and comb \u201cHey Ben head. You wanna fix your hair?\u201d Melly pointed to Gwen\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked and felt her hair. It was all scrunched up and ruffled. \u201cThanks Melly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gwen went off fixing her hair, Ben realized that he was still getting denser. The orb wasn\u2019t even in the light anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGramps. I think I\u2019m getting even denser. The light isn\u2019t even on the orb anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps thought for a moment and then remembered \u201cOh right! That necklace was made on Anodyne as well. The thing about this one is that the whole universe inside is full of light! You know how our universe is covered in darkness, but there are stars? Well the universe that your pendant contains was changed by the Anodynes, and it is covered in light, but there isn\u2019t a spot of darkness inside of it. I believe that the light inside was green or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then recalled when he put the orb inside that there was a green light that touched the orb, and sucked it in. \u201cSo is this a good then that I\u2019m getting denser with every passing second?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cAs long as you learn to control yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly smile at Ben \u201cI know you can do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Ben beamed, and then thought about how he\u2019d work on controlling his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenald on the other hand wanted to get back to his lab underground \u201cWell ok then. I think I\u2019ve put off work for long enough. I\u2019m going to leave now. I thank you for the stay, and its been a blast, but I must get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelly heard and said goodbye as well. Ben was slightly sad at this, but didn\u2019t object. They were just friends he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What are we going to do?\u201d Then a thought came to her \u201cWhy do they need you over at the Green Star?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBecause I have a lot of connections with powerful alien species either threw old mission or legal contracts. They want me to call in a bunch of favors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cCan\u2019t you do that from here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNo. I don\u2019t have the equipment to call in all my favors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 what are we going to do. We know Gwen is strong enough to do the spell. Should we just go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was about to say go, but she realized that they\u2019d be entering a war between two large alien armies. \u201cMaybe tomorrow guys. I think we should do something together first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps knew what Gwen was doing and agreed. This would be an event to get them to know each other again. Especially Ben since he seemed to be changing the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was kind of confused about the idea, but went a long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWhat do you guys wanna do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had an idea \u201cHow about pasta! That first day of summer we had summer and it was awesome. I still don\u2019t know what you put into it to make it taste so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps looked at Ben and she smile. She said \u201cThat good. Lets do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cIf you help make it, I\u2019ll tell you what I put inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was all for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*several hours of chopping, cooking, and stirring*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk. we\u2019re done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWait! I didn\u2019t see you add anything to the sauce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThe secret wasn\u2019t a physical ingredient. It was time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Gramps disbelieving. He though it was some super rare alien herb so something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed at Ben\u2019s face \u201cIt makes sense\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cLets dig in.\u201d Gramps set out 3 plates of pasta. There was a loud roar that appeared in the room. Gwen and Gramps ducked down because they thought hey were being attacked. When they looked up, they saw that Ben\u2019s face was red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUm\u2026 that was my stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stared at Ben. It wasn\u2019t possible for a stomach to growl that loud. But its Ben! Then Gwen burst out laughing. Gramps joined her soon. Even Ben smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps took one of the plates and pushed the pasta on it into another larger plate. It was about 3 time the size of the old one. Then Gramps dumped the rest of the pasta onto it. Then he set the plate onto the table for Ben to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s mouth was salivating the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cDig in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grabbed two forks and began to chow down like he used to do. His mouth was covered in sauce. Gwen on the other hand was using a pair of chopsticks and was eating her pasta while staring at how Ben could eat so fast and not throw-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw Gwen staring at him, but he didn\u2019t care. Then he noticed her using chop sticks and wanted to try. Grabbed a pair from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps raised an eyebrow wondering what Ben was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tried copying Gwen, but couldn\u2019t. He got frustrated \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d He said to Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBecause I practiced. Just keep trying. You\u2019re getting there.\u201d Though she was being amused by Ben\u2019s sad attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10minuted of failing, Ben get frustrated again and accidentally snapped his chopsticks in half with his hand. This caught Ben\u2019s attention. He had lost control to easily. He put them down and picked up another pair, but instead of using them the traditional way, he just stabled the pasta until he collected a few noodles. Then he munch them all down. Ben smiled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had stared at Ben as he was doing that. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you use them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. It got the noodles into my mouth, so I\u2019m good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen face palmed and looked at Ben. \u201cWhat ever. If you\u2019re doing it that way, just use the forks again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was sitting and eating quietly listening to the two kids talked. They\u2019re arguing again. Maybe I should stop them. He didn\u2019t because he saw the slight smile the Ben and Gwen gave each other. Because arguing was fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, they finished their pasta, and Ben was surprised that he finished his plate. He thought he\u2019d never feel full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHey dweeb. Wash your face. There\u2019s sauce everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen did that face when he was saying \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked in the mirror hanging over the sink and saw that his face was spotted with sauce. Ben took a finger and smeered some sauce on it. \u201cWant some?\u201d he said while pointing it to Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen recoiled \u201cUgh! You\u2019re so gross.\u201d then slowly, Ben\u2019s snicker turned into a laugh. Gramps joined and then Gwen joined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one wanted to say this one phrase because that means they\u2019d have to acknowledge that things were different. They didn\u2019t want to say \u201cLike old times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Green Star supernova\u2019s in 36hrs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded, so they grabbed hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cGramps, so how do I do the spell? Shouldn\u2019t I practice once?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNo need. All you have to do is imagine the place you want to go to. Luckily you don\u2019t have to. I have a picture of the Green Star.\u201d Gramps gave Gwen a picture, and she memorized it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk. Lets go.\u201d They hold hands again, and vanished from the earth in a flash of purple lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away, there was a similar flash of purple, and three humans appeared in mid space. They were in the atmosphere of the Green Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cGramps! We\u2019re in space with out space suits. Why aren\u2019t we dead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBecause the atmosphere of the Green Star is 1 light year in radius, and is composed of 90% oxygen. And 10 % of other harmless gases.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was silent. He felt the tingle from the orb again, but this time, it was a thousand times more intense. The feeling was almost numbing. Though he could feel his body\u2019s density sky rocket. He must be millions of lbs now if not billions. \u201cGuys. I\u2019m growing even faster that before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cProbably because the orb is reacting to the energy released by the Green Star. It should weaken I think. Maybe when you become dense enough, the feeling will fade because the growth will become relatively minimal compared to your density at that time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it, and could slowly feel the tingle fade slowly away. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. The feelings going away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk then. What are we going to do? We\u2019re in the middle of space with no was of getting to this person that called you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cActually, he should almost be here. The Plumber badges has a tracking systems that let the other know where we are at anytime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gramps was saying that, the sound of a roaring engine appeared. They looked in that general direction and saw a spaceship getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow do we know that isn\u2019t a bad guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cLook at the insignia on the side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked and saw the logo of the omnitrix. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the ship got close enough, it releases a tractor beam pulling everyone in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little alien with a large head and large eyes said \u201cWelcome back. Its nice of you to join us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cAzmuth. Nice to see you. What\u2019s the situation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Gwen had already encountered Azmuth, and were surprised to see that he was leading the defense to keep the universe in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cNot so good. The enemy army out numbers us 100 to one. We\u2019ll need you to star calling some favors with some aliens that can help. We\u2019ll need as much of it as we can get. The enemy has already declared war and will attack in 10 hrs. We\u2019ll need you to go make the transmissions now.\u201d Azmuth pointed to a large machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI can\u2019t punch these all in on time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth chuckled \u201cNo need. Just let the machine scan the pages. It\u2019ll take an hour to process, but after that, it\u2019ll be sending messages faster than the speed of light.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Breaking the fourth wall*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cImpossible!

It\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps did just that, and the machine turned on and began scanning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cNo that that\u2019s done, we can talk about the omnitrix. Ben\u2026 I\u2019d like you to give it to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked \u201cWhat do you mean? Why can\u2019t I use it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cBecause\u2026 When you transmute into another alien, the alien gets enhanced strength using the original host\u2019s strength as a base.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen explained \u201cI think he mean that if a child used it and turned into diamond head, he\u2019d be stronger, but if a pro wrestler used it and turned into diamond head, the new diamond head would be even stronger because it\u2019s base is a pro wrestler and not a child. Am right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cCorrect. Now hand it over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBut what if I were stronger than all the other aliens you wanted to give it to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth sighed \u201c\u201dBen. Be real. A human child can\u2019t match an alien that was born into a planet that requires it to use strength for everything. I\u2019ve met aliens that could lift mountains. I\u2019m sorry Ben, but you\u2019re to weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled. He took out the green orb from his pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth gasped \u201cThat is what I think it is? Is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIt\u2019s the universe\u2019s largest growthium crystal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth commanded several aliens to lock the doors and stop anyone from entering. \u201cHow! Wait. Tell me later. This changes every thing. How long have you been holding it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAbout 5 days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth frowned \u201cThat isn\u2019t good enough. Your body appears stronger than most humans your age, but that still isn\u2019t strong enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBecause its all condensed. I think I\u2019m a few billions lbs of condensed muscle, bone, and other stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth gasped. He realized that that was enough muscle to match a small mountain. Then he saw the Gravitum necklace \u201cAh\u2026 That\u2019s why the ship hasn\u2019t imploded. You\u2019er wearing a Gravitum neckalce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo what happens now? Can I hold onto it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth sighed \u201cI was going to ask my second inn command to take it, but I guess you\u2019ll make more use of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk\u2026 so that\u2019s solved. How are the enemies going to collect the energy of the Green Star?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cWith a giant battery. It can store enough energy to light the universe for days. They\u2019re going to use it to store the energy released when the Star implodes. Then after that, they\u2019ll collect the materials that that star will have created in its last moment of life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat does this mean for the rest of the universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cDepending on who\u2019s controlling the army, they could take over the whole universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThen how do we stop it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cWe\u2019ll need Ben to make a bee line to the machine that they\u2019re going to use to trap the energy. If we can destroy that, then the star will release its energy into the universe and then we\u2019ll need Ben to rush in and collect what ever it made during the supernova.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSo a lot is depending on Ben\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThen why did you need me to call in my favors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cTheir army is huge. We\u2019ll need to get them disperse in order for Ben to get to the machine in the center of their army.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBut how can they contain a super nova?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth the same way your pendant can store anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps gasped \u201cYou don\u2019t mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cYes. They obtained large amount of Gravitum ore and have started to loop it around the green star. They are almost completely done making the circle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Azmuth \u201cBen. We\u2019ll need to you rest up. You\u2019ll have about 24hrs to do what you\u2019ll need. During that time, I\u2019ll send out forces out to disperse the army. You\u2019ll have to be quick on getting to the machine as fast as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth dismissed everyone. He sent them to their on rooms for them to wait to be called on. Ben went to his room, but then got bored, so he decided to roam the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was walking he met hundreds of alien Plumbers and a couple dozen human Plumbers. They all wondered why there was a kid on board. A few aliens saw the Omnitrix and glared at him. How can a human dare wield the greatest instrument in the universe! Word got out about a human boy wielding the Omntrix. Eventually, word got to Azmuth\u2019s second in command. His name is hard to pronounce, so we\u2019ll call him Gerf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerf was sitting in his office waiting for Azmuth to come and give him the Omnitrix. He\u2019s worked hard, and was under the impression that Azmuth thought he should get it as well. When he heard a human boy had it he almost went mad. \u201cWhat! Show me this thing that wields the Omnitrix.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant guided Gerf to Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerf \u201cYou! Why do you have the Omnitrix. Give it to me. Azmuth is planning on giving it to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWas was, but not anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerf laughed \u201cAre you trying to say he gave it to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYup. So why don\u2019t you go do something else. I\u2019m busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerf\u2019s anger rose up again \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss me. I dismiss you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. If you say so.\u201d Ben turned to leave because Gerf said \u2018I dismiss you!\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerf stomped a heavy foot on the floor \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me human. I\u2019ve had years of experience in this field you call sarcasm. I\u2019ve hated every moment. Continue, and I will remove the Omnitrix by force.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile \u201cGo ahead and try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerf was confused. Usually, his size, power, and aura of command made his enemies cower in fear. What is wrong with this human. Is he stupid or something! (Gwen would be laughing right now) \u201cI have warned you human.\u201d Gerf charged at Ben and tried to grab the Omnitrix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with his super fast reflexes (that he got from his dense muscle), he side stepped Gerf and punch him in the gut. Ben started to walk away while Gerf was still standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerf\u2019s body was in turmoil. How can a human be so strong. How does he move so fast. Why can\u2019t I move. Then he fell into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the aliens had gathered to watch Gerf teach the human a lesson. He should not wield the Omnitrix so lightly. When Gerf lost, they were all lost for word. Some aliens wouldn\u2019t accept his loss, and thought it was a trick and threw them selves at Ben. Ben silences them with a quick punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that, Ben wanted some peace, so he went back to his room and looked out the window. He say the Green Star and how it shown with lively green. He could feel his density spike again and slowly fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared out the window until he heard over a speaker \u201cPrepare for battle! The enemy is quickly approaching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the ship came alive. Aliens from every corner of the universe got ready for battle. After a few minutes, ships were already deploying. Even Gramps\u2019 contacts had arrived, and were still coming. The armies from both sides seemed equal in numbers now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the battle cries as aliens jumped out of their shuttle and blasted forward using rocket boots and stuff of the like. Ben turned away. It was to bloody for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at his door. Ben \u201cCome in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Gwen and Gramps come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNervous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cA smidge. I didn\u2019t think was as bad as people said, but I was wrong.\u201d Ben\u2019s face was grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSmile a little. There\u2019s been a change in strategy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another voice chimed in from outside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cYes. Indeed. You\u2019ll head straight towards the machine with out even having to fight. We\u2019ll need you to go in as the alien you call \u2018Ghost Freak.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen began to chuckle. \u201cHe. Its so simple it funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cYes\u2026 it seems that way. Well. Hop to it. Every second the enemy fights us is another thousand lives. They\u2019ll start to think we\u2019re tricking them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took out the watch turned into Ghost Freak. Something was off. Ben thought. Where\u2019s the ship. Where is everyone? Ben looked around with his one eye and then say that his body was so huge that he enveloped the ship and a huge area around it. \u201cWow! I\u2019m huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the ship, Azmuth was awestruck. He knew Ben was highly condensed, and that he\u2019ll expand once he turned into Ghost Freak, but this was beyond what he had thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI\u2019d like to know that as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cHis compressed body decompressed once he turned into Ghost Freak. His body is covering the whole ship right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Ben began to more toward the other army. When he got to it, he covered the army and sent a chill through their bodies. They all froze and couldn\u2019t move. Ben knocked every alien he passed through unconscious. When he go to the center, he saw a huge machine. Ben got to work on ripping it apart. He squeezed his whole body inside, and then expanded making it explode. The aliens near the machine freaked out and were shocked by what happened. Ben took this moment to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben had escaped the army and began working his way back to the ship when his watch timed out. \u201cDang it! So close.\u201d Ben yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a rumble. He looked down and saw the Green star morphing and convulsing on itself. It was getting ready to super nova. Then Ben remembered the Gravitum ring around the Green Star! Ben looked down and saw a thin line across the surface that must have been the Gravitum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen if that was bad, something worse happened. Ben heard a roaring of millions of engines. Ben looked around and saw millions of machine fly past him and attach them selves to the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was to far away to make it in time. Then when he looked closer, he saw a glow surrounding the star. It was force field! Everything was getting worse and worse, then a thought struck Ben. Ben began to take of his necklace. Once it was off his neck, it appeared as though he vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tremendous weight and gravity pulled him toward the Green Star at a speed near the speed of light. BAM! He slammed into the force field. This stopped Ben in his tracks. Then slowly, the force field began to sag around Ben. POP! It vanished and Ben began his descent toward the star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moment Ben was stopped by the field, The Green Star imploded. Then it released a wave of energy that seemed to be stopped by something. The ring of Gravitum seemed to be doing its job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben fell, he felt the orb in his necklace vibrate in anticipation. It sent a tingle threw Ben\u2019s body. The star was quickly approaching. It seemed like a solid wall, Ben simple fell through it and into a sea of green light and energy. The orb in Ben\u2019s pendent went out and flashed green. All the energy from the star began to get sucked into the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Ben felt his penis grow hard, and a unknown level of pleasure passed through his body. Pulled his pants down and began to jack off in the middle of a supernova. Lost in euphoric pleasure, Ben failed to notice that the energy around his was slowly fading away. As the minutes ticked by, the pressure in his hyper condensed balls grow to much for him. He exploded with cum. Millions of kiloliters of cum blasted out of his hose of a penis. At the same time, the orb flashed green once more and all the cum Ben had released was sucked into the orb. This caused it to bond with Ben even further!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Ben calmed down and realized that his pants were down, so he pulled it up. Then off in the distance, he notice a tiny green crystal. It was shaped like a thin four pointed star, and it drifted towards the orb and entered it. Ben felt his body burn as the intense tingling feeling rushed through him. He wanted to scream, but couldn\u2019t. The pain was that strong. Like before, the tingle began to fade away until it was a barely noticeable. Ben realized the he was curled into a ball, and had been crying. He wiped his eyes and looked for his orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right in front of him, but it looked different. It was clear like before, but it had a tine 4pointed star in the middle, and surrounding it was were lines of green energy. The lines moved in a slow un ordered path that was ever changing. Ben stared at it mesmerized by how the lines moved and how the crystal thrummed with power. Ben held it in his and was surprised to see that it had a heart beat. For some reason, Ben could tell it was copying his heart beat. Ben put it back into his pendant where it would be safe. And then put his necklace back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a roar from behind him. Ben turned around and was surprised to see the enemy army was surrounding in a giant sphere. Ben looked at its size and saw that there were aliens farther than he could see. The  aliens surrounded Ben making a prison out of their own bodies that was about 500 miles thick. Ben sighed\u2026 this is going to take a while. Suddenly, there was a flash of purple and a pair of arms grabbed his neck. Ben would have already thrown the arms off, but he knew who they belonged to. Then there was another flash of purple and Ben disappeared from the prison for aliens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the ship, there was a flash of purple light and to kids appeared in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThanks Gwen. I thought I\u2019d be there for months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNo problem. I wanted to hurry and get home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was sitting in a chair reading a magazine. \u201cWelcome back Ben. We thought you had disappeared, but when the aliens formed a ball, we knew you were in there somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to that room opened, and Azmuth entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cWhat on earth happened out there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 I stopped the machine at the center of the army, but it was only one of a few million of machines. The others had arrived once the star started to act all funny.  I couldn\u2019t get there on time if I just floated toward then, so I took of my necklace and gravity pulled me in. It was kind of weird. First I broke through a force field, and then I get submerges in the star. After that, the orb began to suck in the energy from the exploding star. When it was done with that, there was a crystal left behind. It was a 4 pointed star, and it merged with the orb. Its in the center of it right now.\u201d Ben took out his orb and saw that it was glowing by itself and had no need to a light source. Ben could feel his density increasing rapidly, but her didn\u2019t feel the pain from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at the orb and saw that it was different. They saw the lines of energy and the star at the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cThis is totally unheard of. But I\u2019ll accept it for now. Ben Tennyson, the universe is in your debt.\u201d (I\u2018m sorry! I know its cheesy!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen didn\u2019t know what to say \u201cumm\u2026 your welcome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cIs there anything we can get you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When I used the Omnitrix, I saw how strong and powerful I really was. I knocked out the enemy army just by drifting over them. I don\u2019t know what would happen if I wanted to do real harm. I\u2019m not think about hurting things, but I fear what will happen if I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth nodded approving his reasoning \u201cOk. I will grant your request. However, since it is so trivial, I will grant you one more request.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it for a moment \u201cCan you give me something that will help me control my strength. I fear that I might hurt someone by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth nodded again and agreed that that was a good request \u201cVery well. We will produce a seal for your strength. Is there something you keep on you at all time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and showed him the pendant on his necklace. \u201cYah. I have the pendant with me at all time. I sometimes remove it, but keep it in my pocket or my hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth nodded. \u201cPerfect. Can I see it?\u201d Ben hands it over to Azmuth. Azmuth looked at the 2 in diamter circle. \u201cYes\u2026 Gravitum. A strange element if I must say. Gwen can you come over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked surprised \u201cMe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cYes. We need to you use magic to link Ben\u2019s strength to this medallion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk. How do I do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cBen\u2019s going to hold the medallion and imagine its abilities. Then you will use your magic to infuse his will with the medallion. Just imagine a ghost of Ben flowing into the Medallion. The magic will do the rest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth handed the medallion to Ben, and Ben imagined it doing what he wanted it to do. He wanted to hold back his strength so he was as strong as he looked. Though it only worked when it was connected to the necklace. When he took it off, the seal on his body is removed, but it would go back on when he attached it to the necklace again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ben was think, Gwen imagined the ghost of Ben\u2019s will flowing into the medallion. There was a green glow around Ben that started to flow into the medallion. The medallion gave a green flash, and the spell was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cOk. The spell is done. You can relax now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Ben, when the spell finished, his limbs felt heavier, and the air felt thicker. \u201cWow\u2026 my arm feels heavier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cThat means its working.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked over to a chair and picked it up. Ben felt the weight of the chair now. Unlike before, he hadn\u2019t felt a thing. He began to feel the fatigue from hold the chair for a while, so he set it down. Ben felt a sudden long for the strength he had, but knew that this was for the best \u201cOk. Yah\u2026 it worked.\u201d There was some satisfaction in his voice though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened, and a messenger came in \u201cAzmuth. The enemy army has located our position and is in a frenzy over their fail attempt. We will soon be overwhelmed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth nodded and waved him away. \u201cBen\u2026 it appears that I will need you to remove the seal and use the Omnitrix just this once more. We have to stop this before anymore people get hurt\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and removed the medallion. As soon as he did, he felt the world seem small and weak. Ben remembered the feel of power, and was scared of it. He knew that he\u2019d return the seal back to the necklace once he finished. He wasn\u2019t a person that like the power. After removing the seal, he turned into Ghost Freak and put the enemies to sleep. While they were asleep, he erased their memory of what had come to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen returned to the ship and turned back into Ben. He put the medallion with the Omnitrix logo back on to the necklace. \u201cCan you remove the Omnitrix now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cYes. Seeing you take down the arm had made me see why you wanted to rid yourself of the temptation. I believe that you are wiser than you look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen snorted and then covered her face \u201cBen? Wise? HA!\u201d And she continued laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cNo\u2026 not wise. Just scared of what could happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cCall it what you want. Now\u2026 I believe that this satisfies your 2 request.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cSo can we go home now? Its been a long day and a half.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cJust one question. Will you help serve the Plumbers when you are called upon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it \u201cYes and no. I\u2019ll help on impossible things, but I can\u2019t help all the time. Or else the plumbers will get lazy. They have to prove to me that they have run out of resources. I\u2019ll feel guilty if the Plumbers fail to protect the universe because they have a quick and easy solution.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth agree with Ben\u2019s reasoning \u201cVery well. You may go home and rest. We\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Ben, Gramps and Gwen vanished in a flash of purple light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the summer was uneventful. Ever since that Green Star event, nothing seemed exciting. Ben spent his time having fun like before. He got used to the slowness of his body, and then thing returned to normal. Gwen was still practicing spells. And Gramps was\u2026 he was just being Gramps. Everything was peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of summer timed down, there was little to no alien appearances. No evil plots. Nothing! When the occasional alien arrived, Gwen would teleport it to the other end of the universe. Ben had removed his medallion once near the beginning because he was still training his resolve, and had thrown the alien back into space. That was it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen summer was over and Ben had gone home. His parents were shocked to see their son a half a foot taller and a lot more muscled. Ben just said that he had a major growth spurt, and at the same time, he had been lifting some of Gramp\u2019s old weights. They accepted it because their son was a preteen, and thing were changing. Plus he had been a away for the whole summer. Their biggest surprise were his manners! He even asked to be excused from the table to go to bed early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just said \u201cI kind of got a little to strong over the summer. I hurt someone by accident, so I kind of learnt how to control my self in order to prevent that. I couldn\u2019t let my anger spike any more so I was forced to mellow out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents were lost for words, but went a long with it because they approved of his reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it\u2019s the first day of sixth grade (everyone had turned 11 by now. Including Ben). Ben walked to school that day and got inside early. He had found his new homeroom and sat down in a corner. All he had to do now was wait. As the bell rang for homeroom, students began to funnel into the room and get into their seats. The students rearranged the desks so they form their own little groups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, the bully from previous years, entered last. Everyone exclaimed when he entered the room. He had grown significantly. Near the end of last year, his growth had slowed down, so people began to catch up to his height and size. Now however, it seemed he had hit another growth spurt. He was 5ft4in, and had a strong bulky build (well as bulky as an eleven year old can get). He was proud of his body though he had to cheat in order to get it, but after that, he worked hard to maintain it. With hard work, he got to a decent size. His pecs pushed half an inch off his body, and you could make out decent sized muscle. He even had a six pack! Nick wasn\u2019t average anymore, so he was ready to exert dominance over his peers once again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strolled in trying to show off his good features. His jet black hair, dark brown eyes, summer tan, trade mark smile. He didn\u2019t have these last year, but ever since the experiment that summer, he was looking even better! The girls in the class felt a minor attraction to Nick and his improved body. All of these thing, he thought, would help him control his peers. He smile at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he took his seat, their homeroom teacher, Ms. Tse, came out and called for attendance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTse \u201cAmy!\u201d A girl said present. \u201cNick!\u201d Nick stood up and flashed a smile at all the girls and sat down. Tse continued through the names until she got to the last one. \u201cBen Tennyson.\u201d Tse sighed waiting for some noisy, brown haired kid to storm into the room. Actually, everyone expected that. Nick was sitting in his chair waiting for a chance to make fun of Ben. Some said something from the back of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked back surprised. Tse was surprised \u201cBen\u2026 is that you? You grew so much!\u201d She was moaning inside. A bigger Ben means bigger problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was outraged. Who ever this kid was, it wasn\u2019t that shrimp Ben. \u201cImpossible! Ben was a shrimp last year. How can it be possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and looked at Nick \u201cI won\u2019t tell you. May be if you asked nicely\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick glared at Ben in anger. No one makes him do anything. No one has ever talked to him like that but his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl to the side stood up and walked to Ben. It was Amy. She poked Ben\u2019s chest to make sure it was real, and recoiled when she felt the hard muscle beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy said nicely \u201cCan you tell me? I\u2019m kind of curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. Amy was one of the few people who was nice to him last year. He would tell her anything. \u201cFor you, I can tell. I had started lift my Grandpa\u2019s old college weight over the summer, but that can\u2019t make some grow that fast. However, it was funny. I had a growth spurt at the same time I started to lift, so the two coupled together made me grow significantly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy made the \u2018o\u2019 shape with her mouth and sat at a desk next to him and they chatted about their summer and what happened. Everyone was back in their own little groups gossiping about how Ben had changed. Nick on the other hand found that he had a new rival. It was going to be harder to maintain his alpha male status with Ben around. He\u2019ll have to show that he can beat Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first class that everyone had was Gym and the first day was always a fitness test. Nick thought that this would be a great chance to show off his strength, and push Ben out of the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe test checks for speed, flexibility, and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeed: Run a mile as fast as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was at a disadvantage in this category. He had trained his body mostly for strength. He couldn\u2019t do endurance exercises like running, but he could still beat a bunch of people with a bit of effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was at an advantage. All the hiking over the summer had helped Ben develop leg strength and endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gym teacher was Mr. Ted. He had everyone line up in 5 different lines and had the front five race each other. Ben and Nick were in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed \u201cOk. Ready. Run!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nick bolted forward trying to get as much of a lead as possible. By the time he got to half a mile, he was dying. His body couldn\u2019t handle the constant motion. Weights were do ten then rest. Do ten then rest. This was continuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen on the other hand had experience. He took a quick, but steady pace that he could maintain. Due to his larger size, he could be faster than most. Ben passed Nick sometime during the mile run and finished first. He felt slightly fatigued, but recovered quickly thanks to the stamina he built over the summer. Nick came third because some track kid had caught up and passed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick didn\u2019t count this as a victory for Ben. Running didn\u2019t count Nick reasoned. He was rally waiting to the strength portion of the exam. He was confident that he could out muscle anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexibility: How far past your toes you could reach, bend back, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick lost this to Amy who could bend so far back, she could take her glasses off with her feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWow Amy. That\u2019s incredible. How can you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smile from the compliment \u201cThanks Ben. You did pretty good on the run too! For me, I excel in flexibly. I have a lot of double joints, and I take aerobics, gymnastics, and yoga. They all help improve flexibility and keep me in shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said seriously \u201cMaybe I should give that a shot. I heard yoga helps loosen stiff muscles. I could use that a bit right now.\u201d Ben said as he stretched his arms, and back, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wasn\u2019t listening. We was getting impatient for the next exam to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrength: As many push-up, pull-up, and sit-up that you possibly can. Then lift as much weight as you can for 10 reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed told everyone to grab a mat and a partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen paired up with Amy, and Nick didn\u2019t get a partner. No one wanted him, so the coached ended up being his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed \u201cOk. As many push ups as possible. Ready! GO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began to do push-ups. Most kids began to die at 5. Some made it to 11. Ben and Nick however got to 20 then 30. By forty, Ben and Nick were starting to feel the strain on their bodies. Ben has been working out a lot over the summer as well in order to understand his body. He also learnt that he could always push his body a little harder than the last time. And this was a time to work harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s face was drenched in his sweat as he tried to maintain a lead on Ben. When Ben got to forty, Nick did 41. As Ben continued, Nick began to panic. He wanted his previous place of power. Everyone feared him, and he like that, but if he lost to Ben now, his dominance would be shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his dismay, Ben continued. Inside Ben\u2019s head, he saw Amy staring at him. Last year, Ben was relatively weak compared to everyone else, so they mocked him. Amy was nice, so he like her for that. Right now, he wanted to leave a good impression on Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wanted power (he\u2018s evil), and Ben wanted to impress a girl (less evil).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen made it to 50, and Nick was at 49. Inside Nick\u2019s head, Nick was screaming at his muscles. What was all that training for if he couldn\u2019t beat Ben! He bent his arms and got low to the ground, but he strained to push himself up. He made it half way up before his arms failed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed \u201cOk. Ben has 50 push up. Nick has 49 push-ups. Very good to the both of you. You should be proud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said good job to Nick, but Nick just gave Ben a sneer and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed \u201cOk! Time for sit-ups\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen won at 125 situps, and Nick at 124.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed \u201cPull ups!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen won at 25, and Nick at 24<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed \u201cWeight lifting time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen could lift 160lbs for ten reps. Seth was able to match his at 160 lbs for ten reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the exam was done, Nick stormed into the boy\u2019s locker room and took his shower and changed. while he was doing that, the boys and girls out in the gym were gossiping about Ben\u2019s body. This made his face turn red as he blushed. A lot of the girls snickered at Ben\u2019s discomfort, but when he saw Amy he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the locker room, Nick was alone inside and he had started to punch the wall with had hand. How?!? How did he beat me in all of them! I can\u2019t believe it! I even got an experiment done on me to make me stronger than everyone. Then he remembered something that happened during the experiment. The green and black blob monster had turned into a kid. It looked like Ben, but he was smaller back then. Maybe the effects of the ray were delayed for him, and cause his growth over a period of time! It doesn\u2019t matter. Ben was effected by the ray like me! Then he took the orb too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nick began searching to Ben\u2019s backpack trying to see if he had it there. He had emptied out the backpack, but it was all textbooks, and other school supplies. Then he heard some noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed told everyone to hurry into the locker rooms to shower and change. He would give them a pass to next period if they were a little late. The boys and girls funneled into their respective locker rooms. As the first boys headed into the bathroom, Nick made a bolt out of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen came in last because the coach held him back for a quick question. Why he did get in though, he say his school supplies scattered all over the floor. Ben sighed and began putting things away. Nothing was missing he thought. Probably just a prank. After everything was all squared away, Ben too his shower and changed. He was late so Ted gave him a pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was already in his next class, and the teacher was talking, but he was to busy think about where Ben had hid the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Ben talked to Amy shortly. They had become close friend through out the day. They had all the same classes. When Ben said good bye to Amy, Seth went out of the building and followed Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cHey Tennyson. How\u2019d you really get so big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised and eyebrow and made a questioning face \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cDon\u2019t play dumb. This summer at that medical mineral institute, you and that blob teamed up to steal the orb didn\u2019t you.\u201d he said smiling confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked, but he learnt to hide his expressions. They sometime got him in trouble, so he worked on it a bit. He maintain his previous look and broke into a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s funny Nick. Me and a blob! Good one.\u201d Ben said letting out a laugh. So he was the kid that the ray fired at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had been confident Ben had the orb. Why is he laughing? I\u2019m being totally serious. Nick walked up to Ben and tried to tower over Ben, but Ben was an inch or two taller than Nick, so Nick had to settle for looking straight in the eye. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke. Tell me where it is, or else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face got serious \u201cOr else what? You going to give me a punch? Shove me in my locker? Give me a wedgie? I don\u2019t think so. Maybe you think I\u2019m still weak like before. That I\u2019m helpless? Not any more. I\u2019m done with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was outraged. No one talks to me like that! I\u2019ve always been the strongest, and I still am. Who does he think he is! Nick walked up to Ben and gave him a hard punch to the gut. Then a just wave of pain rushed threw his fist and into his arm. What does he have under there! A metal board? (Even though Ben had limited his strength, his Boy was still has dense as before. Denser actually). Ben yelled in pain \u201cWhat\u2019s under there?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile \u201cNothing much. Just a 6 pack.\u201d Ben lift his shirt up to prove it. Under his shirt was a set of nicely chiseled abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cNo abs are that hard!\u201d he was panicking. I can\u2019t stand losing. Not to Ben! The kid I humiliated last year. \u201cYou can\u2019t fool me. I know you have that orb. That\u2019s the only way you could get so strong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cSo what are you going to do about it? Try to steal it from me? I\u2019ll tell you something. I always have it on me. I never leave it anywhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick though about it\u2026 It wasn\u2019t in his backpack. His pants don\u2019t have any bulges. So it can\u2019t be there. Did he eat it!?! De he put it un his body? This freak! \u201cYou put it in your body didn\u2019t you! That\u2019s the only way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let out a short burst of air and chuckled \u201cYou would think so, but no. I\u2019m not that crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was losing his patience. He saw Ben\u2019s medallion dangling out of his shirt. He always has that with him. It must be important. Nick planned on taking it and trading for the orb. Nick ran forward surprising Ben and grabbed the medallion and yanked it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned blank. He felt his strength sky rocket. The world was small and weak in his eyes, but he didn\u2019t want to hurt it. He wanted to protect it. Ben looked at Nick. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you just did to yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smile \u201cSo this is important! Tell you what. Give me the orb, and I give you back you medallion. It seems important enough. Doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Nick looked at Ben confidently think that he won. Then Ben vanished. Where did he go. He was standing right there!  Nick felt his hand become empty, and looked down. The medallion! Where did it go! Behind Nick, Ben was putting the medallion back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou Don\u2019t know what you just did\u2026\u201d Ben sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick turned around \u201cWhat is this! Some trick? Nobody moves that fast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYour right. Nobody moves that fast, but this somebody does. Now get over yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wouldn\u2019t give up. He charged at Ben and punched his chest as hard as possible. There was a cracking sound as he broke a few fingers upon impact. He screamed and fell to the ground clutching his hand. Its not possible! He\u2019s literally harder than stone! What is this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had a little pity. Ben knew that Nick was used to the feel of power, and was trying his best in a futile situation. Ben took out his phone and called Gramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cMax Tennyson. What\u2019s the situation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNick, last year\u2019s school bully got hurt pretty badly. Can you come over and patch him up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed on the other line \u201cIt must be pretty important for you to call me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah, I also what some advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNow this is making more sense. I\u2019ll be over in 10 minutes. Luckily I\u2019m only a town away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, and Gramps arrives in the Rustbucket. Ben Picks up Nick (who is knocked out), and carries him into the Rustbucket to get patched up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWhat\u2019d he do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHe took my medallion off, but I didn\u2019t hurt him. He gave me the hardest punch he had, and hit my chest. He broke a few fingers though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded and took out a small ray gun and shot it at Nick\u2019s broken hand. After a few moments, it began to patch itself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s new. When did you get that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cIt was a gift from Azmuth for helping back in you know when.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cThat was interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Nick\u2019s hand was all patched up and fully functional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Ben took Nick out of the Rustbucket and set him back outside on the ground. Ben said good bye to Gramps and started walking home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Nick was making his way home to. How did I lose. I gave him the mother of all punches. Its just not possible. Nick continued to himself how impossible it was that Ben wasn\u2019t effected in the least by his punches. Nick concluded I need to get stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He got to the right building and went in. He asked the lady at the counter about the testing on the growing product. The lady smile and pointed him down the hall. \u201cYou\u2019ll see an elevator. Just press the bottom floor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick left without saying thank you. He got into the elevator and pressed down. He thought about the place as he went gown 15 floors. The place is all grey and white. There\u2019s no color! The elevator made a thud when it hit the bottom floor. It opened to reveal a large cube shaped room. There were parts scattered everywhere. The room was barely lit and the only source of light came from behind a pile of disassembled parts. Nick walked around the piles to find an man in his 40\u2019s. Not old but has years of experience. The man was working on a ray type machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cHello! I\u2019m here for the testing on the growth thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked up, and saw Nick. \u201cHello there young man. How old are you? About 14 or 15?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smile \u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m 11.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man \u201cGod! You\u2019re huge. About 5 inches above the average height I can see. Well my names Kelvin Ester Nelson, but most people just call me Ken. Its good to see the young people stay in shape. Though it sad really. Some kids want to, but can\u2019t because of a growing disorder. I want to fix that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick chuckled \u201cJust like those scientist over at the medical mineral place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stopped smiling \u201cYah\u2026 I was one of them. The dang orb was stolen, and the doctor flipped out. Poor guy. Anyway, my new boss supplied me with another smaller  one. Do you want to get started?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick heard this and time seemed to freeze. He has another orb? This could be my chance to catch up with Ben. Lets get on his good side. \u201cSure. Lets go. I\u2019m dying to give it a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen remembered \u201cOh, and how\u2019d you know about that institution?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI was being tested on when that monster stole the orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed disappointed \u201cOk\u2026 lets get going.\u201d He turned on the machine and told Nick to stand 10 feet in front of it. Then he fired. A beam of green light shot out and hit Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt a slight tingle. The feeling was warm and soothing. Nick looked at his body and was excited to see that he was really growing. He felt his penis get hard from the feeling. Then energy stopped, and the feeling faded. \u201cThat\u2019s it!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cSorry buddy. I need to let the little fella recharge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cKnow what? I\u2019m gonna let you borrow the pearl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked up surprised \u201cReally? What\u2019s the catch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen continued smile \u201cJust bring it back in a couple of days. I need to fix this machine up a bit. Then you can come back for another test. While you\u2019re holding the orb, it will grow you slowly, but not as fast as it just did. May be half to a quarter of the growth just now per day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shook with excitement \u201cThanks! I really appreciate it, and I\u2019ll be back in a few days for sure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled and said good bye. Nick thanks him again and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nick was gone, Ken turned to a monitor. \u201cI did what you said boss. The boy has the orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatic filled voice \u201cVery good human. Keep this up and I\u2019ll get you that new lab in no time at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cThank you boss. I\u2019m glad you gave me that chance to collaborate with you.\u201d The transmission ended after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over night, Nick had grown to 5ft 8in tall. His pecs pushed out 2and a half inches, his 6 pack was cut deeply into his body. His shoulders were large softballs. His biceps were a good 4 inches in diameter. His legs had grown so that they almost rubbed each other when he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick got out of bed and felt the extra weight on his body and smile. \u2018Today might be my day\u2019 he thought. He did his usual morning routine, and went to school. He decided to wear a sleeveless T, and some cargo shorts to school. He wanted to show off his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered the build, he heard murmurs about how he seemed bigger, and he smile knowingly. The day continued on, and when Nick went to the bathroom, he could tell that he was just a smidge bigger than that morning. Slowly, his ego and confidence built up, and by lunch, he though he was ready to take Ben down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was outside sitting at a picnic bench enjoying his brown bag. Amy was sitting next to him and they were just talking and having a good time. Their relationship hasn\u2019t moved. They were still just friends, and Ben was ok with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick walked out of the school and saw Ben sitting, so he walked up and said commandingly. \u201cBen! I challenge you to an arm wrestling match. Winner gets to take one thing from the other person.\u201d Nick was confident he would win with his larger build. He was at least 30lbs heavier than Ben now, muscle wise. He still wanted the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed, and was about to say no, but he saw a flash from his medallion, and another green flash from Nick\u2019s pocket. \u2018He has an orb?\u2019 Ben thought. \u201cFine\u2026 I accept.\u201d He asked Amy to stand back a bit. Ben wanted to end this quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sat down across Ben and they got their arms into position. A crowd began to gather and they counted down for the two competitors. \u201cGO!\u201d Ben and Nick started to strain their arms trying to pin the other down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were dead locked for a good 5 minutes. But slowly, Nick began to get the upper hand. Ben hadn\u2019t removed his medallion, so he was just average strength right now. As Nick started to get Ben down, Ben started to panic. Just at the last second, he thought of Amy and how she was watching him. This gave him a burst of strength, and his arm surged with one last burst of energy. He pinned Nick down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at his arm in shock. \u201cHow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk\u2026 A deals a deal. I get something from you that I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was silent and didn\u2019t say anything. HOW! In his rage and confusion, he didn\u2019t notice that a tingly feel was covering his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, lunch was over, and kids began to make their way back to class. Ben was still standing over Nick waiting for the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was about to ask for the orb, when he noticed something happening to Nick. His cloths seemed tighter. Then he saw the glow from Nick\u2019s pocket. Then Ben saw the glow from his medallion. It seemed the Nick\u2019s orb was reacting to Nick\u2019s anger, and was borrowing energy from Ben\u2019s orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick clenched his fist and began to pound the picnic table. Bam! Bam! Crack! \u201cHuh?\u201d Nick looked down and saw that he punch a hole through the table. Wait! Are my arms bigger? Nick stood up and saw that he was growing again, but even faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood where he was watching as Nick grew to 6ft then 7ft, and it didn\u2019t stop. You could hear bone cracking as the stretched and grew. His muscle were bulging out. At 10ft tall, his pecs pushed 1ft6in off his body. His 8 pack was so deep, you could fit your index finger between the gap. His shoulders were over inflated medicine balls. His biceps were 16 in in diameter. He grew to about 20ft tall. Ben only reached up to his knee. His muscle were huge and totally out of proportion from his body. They seemed over inflated and impossible to move, but Nick could somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his growth, his cloths had fallen off revealing 5ft of pure boyhood along with bean bag family jewels. Ben stay to see what was happening. He ran and grabbed Seth\u2019s pants and pulled out the green pearl inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was speechless. This like a dream come true. He towered over absolutely everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ben do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben took advantage of Nick\u2019s shock to lock the pearl away. He turned around and quickly insert the pearl into his medallion. Unknown to him, once he did that, the pearl quickly fused with the orb, increasing it\u2019s strength exponentially. After a moment, the merge was complete, and Ben began to feel a tingle. It was like the times his density increase dramatically, though this time, it was only minimal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next surprised Ben, and angered Nick even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at the school trying to get a guess on his height when suddenly, he noticed the school getting taller. \u201cWhat! No! I just got these muscles! I can\u2019t shrink now! What happened?!?\u201d He looked frantically at his body as it shrank. When he got to 10ft tall, he saw Ben. \u201cYou! You did this. What did you do!\u201d In his rage, he ran at Ben to strangle him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw this coming, and knew he couldn\u2019t get away in time. So he removed the medallion from the necklace. To Ben, time seemed to slow down. His reflexes, strength and speed were so fast that everything seemed like it was moving through molasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick flew though the air as he tried to jump on Ben and slam him to the ground. His feet made contact. It was like running full speed, and trying to kick a wall. You heard a thump, and Nick fell to the ground clutching his foot. \u201cIt not fair! You already have an orb. Why can\u2019t I have that pearl? Your so selfish.\u201d Nick was crying like a child would cry if you took away his favorite toy, or long loved stuff animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen responded sadly \u201cBecause you want it for the wrong reasons.\u201d Ben couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for Nick. He was obsessed with power, and it drove him to the point of near madness. Ben slowly turned around, and went back into the school and went to class. Nick stayed out in the field naked and defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the final bell rang, Nick mustered the will to run to the boy\u2019s locker room and retrieve his spare change of cloths. He put them on, and felt how baggy they were now. He felt his anger swell again, and he didn\u2019t know what to do with it. He ran into the gym and started lifting what ever weights he could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, Ben came into the room looking for the Nick. He saw Nick over by the bench press lifting with out noticing how much he was lifting. It was about 300lbs, and he\u2019d done about 100 reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick saw Ben come in and stopped what he was doing. \u201cWhat do you want? You already took everything away from me. Why couldn\u2019t you let me keep the pearl? You already have the giant orb. Why?!?\u201d Nick\u2019s voice was filled with longing, and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt pity for Nick. He had set on completing an impossible goal, and failed. \u201cNick\u2026 did you see how much you were lifting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was surprised by the random question, but answered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking. It must have been pretty light for this wimpy body to lift. No thanks to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIt was 300lbs\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s ears perked up \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou were lifting 300 lbs. I don\u2019t thing your muscle were lost, but more compressed. If you step on the scale over their, you\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d Ben pointed to a scale in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick walked over to it hopefully. When he stepped on, the scale\u2019s numbers kept spinning and spinning. It stopped at about 50000lbs. \u201cOh\u2026 my god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI thought so\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nick stood in front of the mirror and started flexing. He was disappointed that he lost all his muscle mass. As he examined his body, he imagined it being bigger. Then he felt a tingle pass over his body as he grew to a larger size. I am I growing? He started to imagine himself even bigger until his cloths got to tight. Then when that happened, he flexed as hard as he could to rip the cloths off his body. After that, he grew even more until his body wouldn\u2019t allow it anymore. Which was at the 20ft tall behemoth from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ben had not noticed for some reason. Nick turned from the mirror to Ben and smiled evilly. He walked up to Ben, and gave him the hardest kick he could. Ben flew straight into a fall causing it to collapse. Nick took this chance to run and get someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*In an after school math club program*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was sitting down with a group of 30 kids working on math problems. They had recently learnt about imaginary numbers and what not. Suddenly, the fire alarm went off. The door opened, and Nick came in wearing a football uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cEveryone! There\u2019s a fire on the other end of the building.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher in the room got everyone in line to leave. Amy was the last in line. When everyone got out, Nick grabbed her arm and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d She turned around and he faced slammed into Nick growing body. \u201cOh my god! You huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled and grabbed Amy when he got to his 20ft height, and smashed through the walls of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the gym, Ben was working his way out of the rubble that had fallen on him. It was difficult since his strength was being suppressed by the seal. When Ben got out of the rubble, he sighed. He planned on dealing with Nick and trying to teach him control over his emotions. Ben is the only one who can survive his assaults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a high pitch scream. Ben turned in the direction, and began to run to it. When Ben got out, he saw Nick on the other end of the field. Ben ran up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat on earth are you doing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cNothing much. I just want to bargain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI can\u2019t ever give you the orb. I\u2019m preventing people like you from getting it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cNot even if its to save your friend, Amy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen froze \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick opened his giant palm to reveal a semi-conscious Amy. She could see, but couldn\u2019t talk or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s voice was call, but it seethed with anger \u201cLet her go\u2026 she has nothing to do with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. She\u2019s friends with you, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLet her go, or you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cDid your skull crack from my strong kick? I\u2019m not surprised if it drove you crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was tired of Nick\u2019s ranting. \u201cI warned you.\u201d Ben raised his hand to his medallion, and unhooked it. There was a small Click when the medallion came off. At the same time, Ben vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick only saw Ben disappear before his vision blacked out. In that fraction of millisecond, Ben delivered one inhumanely strong punch to Nick\u2019s stomach. The second after that, he had appeared in Nick\u2019s hand and grabbed Amy from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen landed on the ground softly, un-flexing his powerful muscles so they could absorb the shock of the land for Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Amy, her body became light from the fall. When she landed, it felt like she fell onto a firm, but soft bed. She looked at Ben as he carried her somewhere. Her ears and body heard the strong beat of his heart. She felt the warmth from his body enter her giving her a feeling she never felt before. It was a longing, but also a memory. A memory of true safety. When you felt like nothing would hurt you. She felt safe. She looked at Ben and saw his from a new perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw how he vanished, and the next thing she knew, she was falling in the arms of her hero. She saw the strength in Ben\u2019s muscles, but she wasn\u2019t scared. The emitted a strong feeling of defense, like they were a shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben carries Amy, he felt a strong feeling of protecting. He wanted to keep Amy safe from everything that wanted to hurt her. He held her close to his body, and stood as strong as his body could look. His body had an aura of defensive hostility. Anyone who had any evil intentions would be dealt with swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was carrying Amy home to let her rest. Along the walk, Amy had started to get could from the chilling air. It wasn\u2019t summer anymore. As she began to fall asleep, she did something that surprised Ben. To warm herself, she started to curl up against Ben\u2019s chest. She rubbed her face into his left pec to warm her nose, but she didn\u2019t know she was doing it. She was asleep, and dreaming a sweet dream. Ben smiled and hugged her closer to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to where Amy lived, he knocked on the door. A short Asian lady came to answer the door. She saw Ben through a window and smiled. Ben occasionally came by for dinner and a homework session with Amy, and her mom was always ok with it. Her name was Zia Chen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia opened the door smiling \u201cHello Ben. Amy isn\u2019t home yet, but you\u2026\u201d Zia saw her daughter in Ben\u2019s arm and froze. \u201cOh my god. What happened!\u201d Ben brought Amy inside and set her on the couch in their living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cShe tried to stop a fight, but one of the kids got angry and choked Amy till she fainted. I got there right after that, and put an end to it. After that, I brought her back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia had her hand over her mouth and was stroking the hair of her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get there sooner, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cStop Ben. Its ok. At least you came\u2026 Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019ll leave. I\u2019ll let you tell her dad. This seems like a family moment.\u201d Ben started to make his way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia asked him to stay for a drink or something, but Ben could tell that she wanted to be alone with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo really. I should go. My mom needs me to get something for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia nodded and turned her attention back to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had left and gone home. Along the way, Ben remembered the medallion, and put it back on. He walked back to school to see how Nick was doing. When he got there, he saw that Nick was gone, but the ground was all torn up as though someone had been writhing in pain. Ben sighed, and went home. He\u2019ll let the plumbers take care of this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nick didn\u2019t really care at the moment. He just wanted to get back at Ben, and he knew that the only way is through Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick walked into the building naked and ignored the lady at the front desk.

My boss has a special plan for Ben, but he\u2019ll need your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stopped pitying himself and raised an eyebrow \u201cSpecial plan? And he needs my help? Count me in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cThat\u2019s it. He told me to give you something if you accepted. He made a special delivery the other day. I installed it into my ray. Can you please go to the center of the circle on the ground?\u201d Ken pointed to a spot 10ft away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smile and did as he said. When he got to the spot, he wondered where the ray was. He didn\u2019t see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen presses a button, and a strange buzzing sound began to resonate from around the room. Suddenly, a flash of green light appeared at the top of the room, and a laser fired out and hit Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was attacked by billions of volts of energy. His body was being assaulted by micro knives. Nick bent over in pain as the energy from the beam coursed through his body. He fell to his knees and began to writhe on the floor. Then suddenly\u2026 it stopped. Nick was breathing heavily on the ground. When he opened his eyes, he was looking up, and saw a giant 10ft diameter sphere up attached to the ceiling. Inside were thousands of green pearls. \u201cOh\u2026 my\u2026 god\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smile knowing that Nick was fully ready to obey their commands. \u201cHey\u2026 you can have those if you bring Ben here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick recovered, and smiled. He could feel all the strength that was compressed into his preteen body. There is no way Ben can be as strong as me. The orb can probably grow him a little at a time like it did to me. He wasn\u2019t zapped like I was. Nick quickly built up his confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his confidence began to rise, his body grew to match it. His slim average 11 yo body began to ripple. He grew taller and taller. His pecs seemed like someone was stuffing cold cuts into it, but forgot to stop. His abs started to multiply. First there were 2, then 4, then 6, then 8, but he somehow got to a deeply cut 10pack. He was reaching 35ft in height, his biceps were 3ft in diameter, his pecs pushed 5ft off his body. His shoulders and neck were so thick with muscle, there was no neck visible. His legs were like school buses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this growing roused Nick\u2019s dormant preteen hormones sending him into a raging hard on. As if by natural instinct, Nick kneeled down and began to jack off on ground, and he was still growing! The feeling of his growing member in his hand gave him even more pleasure. They pressure in his balls built until it was almost to painful to say, then it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was laying faced up shooting his first load ever. His rob thrummed with heat and power as the hot seedy liquid rocketed out and hit the ball of pearls. For some reason, the cum was going up, but didn\u2019t going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was hiding behind a wall waiting for the boy\u2019s episode to subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eruption slowed down to a trickle, and then ended. Nick was panting unable to comprehend the feeling that thrummed every fiber of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, he felt a tingle cross over his body. He felt as though he were growing again, but with out the pain. He looked at his body and saw that everything around his was getting smaller again. He looked up at the sphere of pearls, and saw it getting closer. They were all glowing and sending invisible energy into Nick\u2019s body. They have become tied to his DNA. \u201cYes! Yes!  MORE!\u201d Nick encouraged the growth until his head began to press against the ceiling. As he continued to grow, he had to crouch and he eventually had to lay down. If he were standing up, he\u2019d be near 250 ft tall. The room was around 100ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick began to feel more and more cramped in the ever shrinking room. It soon felt like he was being squished together against his will. The pain was almost unbearable. Slowly, Nick had enough of the pain and thought of shrinking down. Slowly, shrank down unwillingly. Nick got to a height of 6ft, and with muscles the size of a pro body builder in super steroids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was demolished. The only thing left was the dome of orbs, and a few machined locked away in another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick saw Ken hiding behind a door that led to the other room, and then he saw the mess he made. He didn\u2019t really care, but thought he should be polite since Ken got him all his new growth. \u201cSorry Ken. I got a little carried away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled knowing that if everything went as planned, his new lab would be waiting for him. \u201cIts ok. Now get to it! Ben isn\u2019t coming here by himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded, and jumped as hard as he could. When he pushed off the ground, he left a crater that was 10 ft in diameter. Nick vanished from sight as he blasted threw the air, threw the ceiling, and several other floors, and finally ending up about 100ft in the air. Nick was beaming with joy at the sight of his new strength. They have literally brought him to new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a strange dream the Ben was saving her from various scenarios of life and death situations. She blushed from the thought. Amy looked down at the side of her bed and saw a bible, holy water, and prayer beads. Holding the prayer beads was her mom who was now slumped on the bed sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cMom? Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia bolted up looking at her daughter. She was speechless, but that didn\u2019t stop her from hugging her daughter, and not wanting to let go. Amy let her mom hug her for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cMom\u2026 you should let go. It\u2019s kind of hard to breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia panicked. She couldn\u2019t have her daughter faint twice in a row. \u201cBen told me what happened. You are so brave to break up the fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was confused for a second and realized that no one knows what happened. They all evacuated to the front of the school. Nick and Ben were in the back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t think it would get so violent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia scolded \u201cWell next time, let someone else handle it. I can\u2019t handle another one of those events.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cReally? It was so fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia frowned \u201cIf you do that, I\u2019ll kill you before they can.\u201d Then Zia smiled\u2026 \u201cSeriously though. Let someone like Ben do it. He\u2019s more than qualified.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smile hearing a compliment about Ben. \u201cYah\u2026 I might do that next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cAnd about Ben. He seemed different when he came over yesterday. He was always kind of\u2026 fun and easy going, but yesterday, he seemed calm, but at the same time it seemed like a shell. Its like he was hiding a storm that was about to break loose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wasn\u2019t surprised \u201cI guess so. He doesn\u2019t like fighting. He\u2019s kind of like a pacifist, though he will do anything to protect someone. He doesn\u2019t like any physical fighting at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia thought about it \u201cI makes sense. If a giant muscle kid like him walks around with a temper, someone is bound to get hurt. I like that he\u2019s composed, but easy going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wanted to keep talking about Ben, but decided to stop. Suddenly the lights in her room began to flicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia swore \u201cI guess we should get Ben over here to fix that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Flash back*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s dad died a long time ago because of lung cancer. Things have never been the same. The house began to fall into shambles. There were leaks and broken furniture, and it looked pretty darn bad. Zia had kept the place tidy, but she doesn\u2019t have the physical strength or money to get it all fixed or replaced. Amy wasn\u2019t happy about all this, but knew her mom was doing everything she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen on the second week of school, Ben had asked if he could come over to get help on homework, and Amy had agreed. She forget her home was in shambles. When they got to the house, Ben saw the house had its paint peeling off, and the lawn was dug up by passing dogs and surrounded by weeds. Amy saw Ben looking and felt ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think this place could use a little help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen realized that this was a touchy spot for Amy, so he walked away. Amy stood in front of her disrepair home silent and ashamed for about an hour. Then there was a tap on her shoulder. She turned around and saw Ben carrying a couple buckets of paints, a belt full of tools, and a backpack filled with odd things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think I\u2019ll help this place out a bit.\u201d Before Amy could say \u2018no\u2019, but started walking towards the house and began scraping paint off the wall. Amy stared for a moment, and then smile. She walked up to Ben and asked for a scraper and began helping him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, an old disrepair car came up the drive way, and Zia came out of it. The sun was still up because summer hadn\u2019t totally abandoned them yet. Zia saw that Ben and Amy had scraped the paint off of one wall and were working on the next one already. Ben was doing the top half with the help of a ladder, and Amy was on the bottom half. Zia walked up and grabbed a scrapper she found next to Ben\u2019s supplies and began scraping next to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of days later, Ben had plastered up cracks, and had painted it a nice creamy yellow. Those days had been the best for Amy and Zia. Everyday after school, Amy helped where she could, and Zia did the same after work. Once the walls were done, Ben had taken responsibly for resigning the room. He had learnt all these neat skills from his dad a few summers back. He mom was opposed to it, his dad insisted it was a very useful skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, the roof is hole free and water resistant. The lawn was totally weeded, and flattened. Zia had even found extra money to by grass seeds to scatter for the following year. Ben had gotten his supplies from the plumbers. He called in a few favors, and Ben now had a small budget for materials that he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough out the next week, Ben, Amy, and Zia had torn down wall paper, and sanded the hardwood floor. Ben was surprised to find that the floor was 250 year old cherry wood. The floor had acquired a beautiful orange red color from its age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the month began to end, they had painted the walls and polished the floors. Ben was now currently working on the electrical plan with some help from his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Now*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cI can\u2019t believe what this place used to look like. I worked and cleaned, and cleaned some more, but no mater how clean it was, it still fell apart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded. She wasn\u2019t ashamed of her home any more. In fact, it was one of the best, if not the best home in the neighborhood. \u201cWe should thank him somehow. The place is really amazing now.\u201d Amy looked at her room and saw the radiance and brightness of it all. It used to be all stained walls that were peeling, and floors that were degraded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia nodded \u201cYou know what? I think we have some money left over in our budget for this month. Lets throw a party!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was surprised by her mom\u2019s enthusiasm \u201cLets do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Zia talked party plans while Ben was at home thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Ben place, Ben was laying in bed trying to organize his thoughts. He still didn\u2019t know where those feelings came from. For the past few months, he\u2019s been friends with Amy, but it was just friends. He helped fix the house because he knew it was something he could help with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at Ben\u2019s door, and his dad, Matt came it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt \u201cHey sport. Just saying hi before I go to work. Crazy stuff yesterday at school wasn\u2019t there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYah\u2026 to bad I missed all of the cool stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled, and began to turn to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDad\u2026can we talk? Like just the two of us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt froze and came back in. He locked the door. \u201cSure. What\u2019s up sport?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 its about his girl who I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded egging Ben on. He knew what this was about. Ben was a young preteen with crazed hormones. What do you expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 I kind of saved her, and I felt like\u2026 I can\u2019t explain. I wanted to keep her safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded and finally said \u201cI think its time to have a talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*One talk later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s eyes had opened into a new world unknown. \u201cSo the reason\u2026 Then its because\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt just kept nodding as he let Ben answer his own questions. \u201cWell. This girl seems nice. Tell Amy she\u2019s very luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned red \u201cWhat makes you think its Amy?\u201d Ben said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt\u2019s face broke into a smile, and he chuckled. \u201cNo reason. Just a hunch. Anyhow\u2026 there\u2019s no school today because its under renovations. There\u2019s a 20 on the table. Use it on what ever.\u201d He gives Ben a wink and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben got out of bed and retrieved the 20 dollars on the table. His mom had gone away to Italy to see a friend\u2019s wedding, and his dad had gone to work. Ben thought about what he\u2019d do with the twenty. He\u2019s to young to have a job though his body can handle it, so he had relatively no income. He occasionally got some money from his parents when they felt like sharing. This was one of those time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen put the twenty in his pocket and was surprised to find that his plumber badge was in his pocket. Ben pulled it out and realized that he should get something special for Amy. Not from earth at least. Ben called Gramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cMax Tennyson. What\u2019s the problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cHey gramps. Can I come over? I need to ask you for something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cSure! Do you want me to pick you up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNah. Just tell me where you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI\u2019m kind of far away. I\u2019m near Mt. Rushmore right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d While talking, Ben had come to the conclusion that a gift for Amy was of utmost priority. He took of his medallion and ran to Mt. Rushmore. He ran around looking for the Rustbucket. He stopped when he found it. \u201cHey gramps. I\u2019m here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps opened the door and was shocked to find Ben standing outside reattaching the medallion. He frowned think that this must be important for Ben to need to take off his seal. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Ben?\u201d Ironically, Gramps got another phone call at that moment. He picked it up and heard Ben\u2019s dad talking about how Ben might stop by for a gift for his lady friend. Gramps smiled hearing this. It was kind of adorable. Young love\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey gramps. Who was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNo one important. What did you need to come here for?\u201d Though he secretly knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had come up with a logical, and unrevealing story. \u201cThis kid Nick got an orb, but he grew only a little. Then when he met me he started to grow dramatically. Then he tried to get my orb, but I stopped him. I tried to befriend him, but he attacked again, but this time he involved this girl. I saved the girl, but I fear he will attack her again without me knowing. Can you give me something casual and easily over looked that can help me communicate with her.\u201d Ben\u2019s whole speech was said kind of robotically. There was no depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was expecting a more straight forward request, but this was a little more complicated. \u201cWait. He had an orb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cAnd he\u2019s like 20ft tall, but he can shrink down to a minimum size, but grow up to a max of 20 ft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was slowly catching on. He was only wondering how the kid got the pearl. \u201cDid you get it away from him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah. I got the orb away before it made him even more of a threat. I put it in the medallion, but when I did, the pearl got sucked into my orb, and I felt like was growing even faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Considering the green star event, I assume that you get even denser every time your orb absorbs something with energy similar to its own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded in agreement \u201cBut this is besides the point. That girl is in danger because she is associated with me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed \u201cWell\u2026 I do have a simple solution. We can give her a heart stone. It\u2019s a rare mineral that grows only on Gravitron. As you\u2019ve noticed by now, everything unusual and rare is found on gravitron, but that\u2019s because everything on it contains gravitum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was curious. \u201cWhat\u2019s heart stone?\u201d He wanted to make his gift perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell, they vary in color and are composed of 100% gravitum. When gravitum atoms are bonded to each other with no specific order, it creates the silver color that you now wear. However, when the gravitum atoms bond together in a specific crystalline structure, it results in the strongest material in the universe (It can cut anything and is near impossible to break) It has the same properties as regular gravitum, and a little more. The stone gives its wielder the ability to tap into ONE source of mana. Remember Ben, mana is the magical energy that every living things have. The stronger that living this is, the more mana it has. Except Gwen\u2019s race. They have large mana\u2019s for some unknown reason. Anyway, the stone connects to the mana of one thing that allows it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone is also capable of connecting it\u2019s wielder\u2019s thoughts to the source of mana there by allowing the user to think their thoughts threw the heart stone. You basically share thoughts, though that\u2019s only if you want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was amazed by what gravitum could do \u201cWhy is it called heart stone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBecause it emits an aura that is based on what the source of mana, and the wielder feel. It has \u2018unstable\u2019 properties that will change depending on how the souce and wielder feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow rare is it? Do we have any?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed \u201cWell. There are only 300 known in existence, and most are on Anodyne. Sadly, I don\u2019t have one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face looked down in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps felt bad for giving Ben a little to much hope. \u201cHow bout we try to find one for ourselves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked up shocked. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cI mean we go up to Gravitron and find one for ourselves. If we can\u2019t find one, then we can try making one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was totally psyched \u201cSeriously? You\u2018d do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell\u2026 you are probably giving it to someone special. I don\u2019t think just any girl would associate with you. Well\u2026 except Gwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face was cherry red. \u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019s special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps just laughed \u201cNo what, I\u2019ll be nice and stop. Can you call Gwen and get her over here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen called Gwen, and asked her to come over. Before she replied, there was a flash of purple and Gwen appeared out of no where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHey Ben. Its been a while. You should call a little more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scratched the back of his neck. \u201cYah\u2026 umm. Sorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled at the shy side of Ben. \u201cIts been 3 months into the school year!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen got defensive \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYup! I heard Amy\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d Gwen said this with a little playfulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned bright red again \u201cIts not even official yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell\u2026 I go to the same school. We\u2019re just in different buildings. Its not hard to catch on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen threw his hands up \u201cI give up! The world wins!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cOk. So why\u2019d you call me over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen didn\u2019t want to say the reason because Gwen would start ranting again. \u201cWe\u2019re going on a field trip to Gravitron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen raised an eyebrow \u201cWhy are we going there?\u201d Gwen looked at Gramps<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cLets just say we\u2019re going treasure hunting. Do you want to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen knew she couldn\u2019t get anymore out of them \u201cFine\u2026 show me the place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBefore we go, we\u2019ll need to get in some space suites. There\u2019s no oxygen on Gravitron. We\u2019ll also need you to apply a spell to keep us from being repelled by the planet.\u201d Gramps had gone into the  Rustbucket and brought back three plumber badges. \u201cTake there and press then against your chest. These suits can decompose down CO2 into carbon and O2 gas for you to breath. The carbon will be filtered into a container.\u201d Gramps gives Ben and Gwen a suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pressed the badge against his chest, and it exploded, and quickly covered him. Ben looked at the suit and saw that it was see through. He felt like everything was normal on the inside. He couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the changes in the conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThe suits should feel like nothing. They appear not to be there. You\u2019ll know its on you be looking at the badge on your chest. There\u2019s a red light that says on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked down and saw the badge. It had the red light. \u201cI think we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk. Give me a moment to get the spell ready.\u201d Gwen began to mumble a series of short phrases, and then they disappeared in a flash of purple light. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some where millions of light years away, on Gravitron, there was a flash of purple light. As the light was about to his the ground, it was repelled and shot out into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang looked around. Everything was silvery grey. The ground was rough, and the sky didn\u2019t exist. It was just space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThis place is kind of dull\u2026 Its as empty as the moon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNothing lives here. Its just a massive star sized clump of gravitum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSo what\u2019s this treasure hunting you were talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGwen\u2026 do you remember Nick, the school bully?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell. He somehow got a pearl and grew massive. I stopped him before anyone was seriously hurt, but I feel like he\u2019s targeting Amy. Gramps suggest that we get a Heart Stone from Gravitron. They have the ability to let me talk to her with me thoughts and vice versa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled. She like how Ben was going out of his way to protect his lady friend \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan? How are we going to find it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWe need to did down. It forms under intense pressure. About 10^10000000000000000000000000000 metric tons of pressure, it but they are generally the size of a ping pong ball. They can change shape, color, texture, etc. based on what the wielder wants it to be, but it will always be a stone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell lets start digging. Gramps, can I remove the medallion to make the dig faster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded, and Ben unhooked the medallion. Ben felt hi strength spike as the seal was removed. Ben looked at the ground and gave it on strong punch that would have shattered the planet is not for the planet\u2019s odd properties. The ground beneath Ben however has been pulverized into a fine powder. Ben released another punch sending all the crushed gravitum out of the hole. Ben looked down and saw nothing but pitch blackness. \u201cEveryone ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Gramps were getting back on their feet and recovering from the planetary quake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWarn us next time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled playfully \u201cOops. Can we jump in the whole? Or me at least. I\u2019ll be doing a few of those punches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded, and Ben jumped down the hole. He fell for a few hundred miles. No one has ever dug this far, so who knows what down here. By now, Ben\u2019s gone past the 10^10000000000000000000000000000 metric tons of pressure, so the chances of finding a heart stone should increase, but Ben has seen nothing so far. Ben finally hit the bottom, and delivered a few strong punches, and fell some more. Finally, Ben saw something in the darkness the surrounded him. Ben has now reached the very center of the planet where the pressure is greatest. This results in a stronger and more structurally correct crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked forward in the tunnel he made until he came upon something glowing. At the end, he came upon an open chamber, and inside were billions of pearl sized gems. Ben gasped at the amazing jewels and couldn\u2019t decided which one to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben looked around and realized that the chamber was lit up by the gems. Its was kind of a warm glow. Not a blinding light, but enough to read a book with the light. Ben walked around for a bit and looked for a stone that stood out to him. He gave up trying because they all seemed perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he had an idea. Ben picked up two stones beneath his feet and squished them together, and compressed them into a stone that was the same size as before. Seeing that his works, Ben began to grab hand falls of pearls and compress them. Ben was slow at first, but he quickly picked up momentum. After a few minutes, every heart stone was compressed into a super dense stone. The stone was about a few trillion stones compressed together, and it has developed some new unknown properties, but what? We\u2019ll find out eventually, but for now, Ben has to go back to the surface before Gwen or Gramps start to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen lifted the heart stone up above his head to light his path. He saw that is was giving off a white glow. The stone itself was foggy looking, and the light it emitted gave off a warm energy. Ben walked forward being guided by the light of the stone. Eventually, his tunnel turned and became vertical. Ben looked up and saw that it was a straight shot up. Ben bent his legs and pushed off the ground lightly. Whoosh. Ben rushed out of the tunnel he made and shot out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Gramps were waiting up at the opening of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI hope he\u2019s ok. Its been a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen let out a quick ha \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine. His head is to dense to get hurt. I\u2019m surprised he even found out that a girl like him. He\u2019s usually ignorant of that stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYah\u2026 well, he\u2019s different now. I can tell just from the way he looks at something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a white flash at the bottom of the long tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI think that\u2019s him. What was the white light? Isn\u2019t the orb green?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cIt seems like he found a heart stone. They generally give off a light glow when they are smothered in darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard a strange echo coming out of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAre you hearing what I\u2019m hearing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoosh. Ben popped out of the hole and shot into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed\u2026 There was a flash of purple, and Ben disappeared and reappeared next to Gramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOomph!\u201d Ben landed face first. \u201cGwen! What was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cWell next time you shouldn\u2019t flew out of tunnels that fast. You almost took my head off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was listening and then he saw the stone in Ben\u2019s hand. \u201cYou found one! I\u2019m surprised. I thought we were going to have to attempt to make one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the stone in his hands. It was a perfect sphere, but it wasn\u2019t glowing anymore. It looked like a regular pearl, but more clear. You could see through it, but it wasn\u2019t clear. \u201cYah\u2026 I actually found a few trillion. I couldn\u2019t decide which one to take, so I compressed them all into this one stone. Though, the stone is super dense, it isn\u2019t any heavier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cMost likely because its made of 100% gravitum. I wonder what compressing it does to the stone. No one has been able to do that partly because the owners of the existing ones don\u2019t want to give up their stone, and because it just isn\u2019t possible. At lest until you did it. Now you say there were trillions? That\u2019s a lot of stones. Do you have any idea how deep you were?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think I actually made it to the center of the planet. It was rather odd. I could tell because felt the pull of gravity as I fell, but when I got to the center, the world seemed to press down from all directions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben and Gramps were talking, Gwen was looking at the stone. Gwen could sense mana since her blood line originates in Anodyne. When Gwen looked at the stone, she could feel that it had mana in it, or it was getting mana from somewhere. \u201cHey gramps. You said that the heart stone can make light in total darkness. Where does it get its energy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was surprised by the question \u201cIt absorbs excess mana in its surroundings. For it to have shined so brightly before, the surroundings must have been saturated in mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t need permission to absorb mana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNo! It does need permission for the orb to take more mana that the excess. With out it, it will just absorb the mana that is lingering in the air and is not needed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk\u2026 I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded. She thought for a moment, and looked at Ben. She tried to sense his mana, but she couldn\u2019t detect it. Usually, when she looked at a living thing, she can see the foggy blue mana circling around their body like an aura, but Ben didn\u2019t have one. Gwen thought of a reason. Since the mana of any living thing is dependant on two factors. One being their genetics, if they are an Anodite. And it depends on their strength. Ben\u2019s strength was immense. \u201cBen\u2026 sorry for this, but I want to check something out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was about to say what, but he vanished in a flash of purple light. Gwen looked up into space waiting for something. Then she saw it. A giant foggy blue cloud appeared up in the sky. Ben was several thousand light years away, so his mana must be so huge that it encompasses several hundred, and maybe thousands of galaxies. Gwen gasped at the size of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps saw Gwen\u2019s reaction \u201cGwen! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOh\u2026 my\u2026 god\u2026 Gramps, I know you can\u2019t see it. Every living thing has mana, and I can see it generally. Usually, the mana of a living thing appears as a faint blue clouds around their body, but it was usually only a millimeter in thickness. Bodybuilders have slightly thicker mana. My people have large manas because its part of our genes. Ben however has a mana that is several thousand light years in diameter. The size of it is astronomical.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was shocked by the news \u201cReally? That\u2019s\u2026 why didn\u2019t you see it before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBecause I was in his mana cloud. It was so huge, I could never see its outline.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed\u2026 who ever gets hold of that heart stone would be immensely powerful. Plus\u2026 who knows what the orb is capable of since it has become super condensed. \u201cYou should bring him back now. He\u2019s probably doesn\u2019t like that you sent him so far away with out asking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smile and flashed Ben back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was fuming \u201cWhat on earth was that for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen retorted \u201cWell I said Sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou don\u2019t just send people out to the far reaches of space!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell I said sorry, and arguing won\u2019t get us anywhere. I was just trying to see your mana cloud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen made the face he usually made when he doesn\u2019t know where the conversation has gone \u201cMy what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYour mana cloud. You mana circles around your body in a cloud, and I can see it on living things. Though yours was huge, so I had to sent you into space to see the outlines of it. I only did it because Gramps was talking about how the orb will feed of your mana and allow the owner to direct the mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was trying to absorb what he was hearing. \u201cSo\u2026 what happens when the orb connects to my mana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cIt will begin to absorb mana until the thing connected to it is depleted of mana, or until the orb become saturated. It will only absorb the mana of the organism until it is worn out. The thing won\u2019t die. Once the orb is completely saturated, it will begin to generate its own mana and become independent of its host.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI see\u2026 so it will suck up my mana until its full\u2026 then when that\u2019s done, it becomes a generator for mana. How much mana does it make?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell\u2026 as the mana in the stone goes down from usage, it will begin to build up on its own again. Though the rate is very slow since the orbs get saturated very fast. That\u2019s the basic gist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo how about this one? It\u2019ll probably be able to taking a huge amount of mana right? Since it can do that, it will generate mana even faster right? Maybe even into infinite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed \u201cI sincerely don\u2019t know. Everything you do its new to the universe. I can\u2019t tell you the answer truthfully.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk then\u2026 How do I get it to connect to my mana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps made a weird look on his face *cough cough* \u201cYou have to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he need to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can you flash me over to the place the green star was before. I\u2019m going to have to take off my space suit in the oxygen that had surrounded the green star.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen said ok and Ben disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the green star, Ben was taking off the suit. He pressed the badge on his chest, and he felt the suit peel of his body and retract back into the badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s heard rumors of boys doing what he thought he had to do. Ben took his pants of in the middle of space and began to stroke his penis. Ben had never done this on purpose before, so the feeling was a shock. Ben\u2019s penis was filled with and endless amount of compact nerves that were genetically altered by his orb to release one feeling. That feeling would only come when purposely activated. This was good because if Ben simply went to the bathrrom\u2026 well lets not talk about what would happen if he was sensitive then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019ll just say that he\u2019s super, hyper sensitive. The moment Ben began to purposely stroke his member, it instantly went hard and pulsed with power. It throbbed with every one of his heat beat. A wave of pleasure burst forward from his one mighty organ. Ben lost all memory of what happened next. His senses were washed away in pleasure. He pumped faster and faster. The pressure in his hyper productive balls began to build up faster and faster. Soon it was at the breaking point, and his load surged past the gate. Like water behind a dam that had just collapsed, his young male juices surged out. Hundreds of thousands of gallons passed through his mighty shaft every second. The surge began to die down to a trickle, Ben was still stroking himself. The pressure built again and was relieved, and built and went dozens of more times. When Ben had finally stopped, it was because his body couldn\u2019t keep up with his demand for more pleasure. Slowly, Ben regained consciousness and looked around. He was shocked to see that there was a giant hot white string that was trillions upon trillions of miles long. It was all tangled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked beneath him and found his pants. He put them on and took out the Heart Stone. He held it out until it touched the string. There was a high pitched slurping sound as the stone began to suck in the young boy\u2019s juices. The white string quickly shrank down until it was gone. The stone was still a foggy white, but it was also changing. Ben looked closer and saw that some parts of the cloud grew denser and some spots thinned out. It seemed like there was a fluid beneath the surface. Ben put the stone away in his pocket. As he was putting it in his pocket, he saw that it was beginning to blow. The light was trying to escape the murky could. Its was like looking at the sun from under water. There were patches of light getting threw, but it faded away and appeared somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat\u2019s going on inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on Gravitron, Gramps was sitting down and thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was staring out into space and was watching a giant blue mana cloud. The past few moment, the \u2019maximum\u2019 size of the mana cloud had grown dramatically (it grew once every time Ben had an orgasm), but now it was shrinking down, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Ben, Ben was still staring at the orb. The brightness of the light increased dramatically. More light was getting past the cloud, and it was almost blinding. Suddenly, Ben felt fatigued. It felt like he had his strength sealed away. Then he felt like he had ran a marathon. The wave of exhaustion grew until Ben began to almost fall asleep. Suddenly it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny pearl one inch diameter pearl in Ben\u2019s hand flashed a strange light. The light traveled faster than the speed of light, and it filled every corner of the universe for a fraction of a second. Even person on earth thought a strange thing had happened to them. For a brief second, darkness was obliterated, and light dominated the universe. As fast as it happened, it had ended just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s body ached from the pearl\u2019s drain on his mana. Then Ben felt a shock from the medallion in his pocket. He felt energy surge through his body rejuvenating his aching and sore muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Gwen, she was shocked to see the cloud has vanished from space. Then for a brief second, she thought she had gone blind from light. Then even that disappeared. Gwen continued looking into space. Suddenly, she saw the blue cloud return. It started out small and grew out to its fullest size again. There was something odd. It seemed like there was more than one cloud. There was a second cloud inside the first cloud. It was smaller, but still huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cGramps\u2026 I\u2019m going to bring him back now. It seems like he\u2019s done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded, and there was a flash of purple. Ben appeared in front of them holding a medallion in one hand and a gem in the other. (He had luckily remembered to put on the space suite before hand).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was silent, but then he exploded \u201cI\u2019m not to sure what I had done, but it felt awesome (It seems like the pleasure gave him minor amnesia). Then what happened next was cool too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cGreat! Tell me when we\u2019re back on earth.\u201d He looked at Gwen, and Gwen nodded. The was a flash, and they were back in the Rustbucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI should start charging you guys for this. Teleporting is a major drain of mana.\u201d Gwen was breathing hard from the exertions of performing to teleports in one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cKnow what? Lets talk over some ice-cream. That\u2019ll cheer you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and sat down at the table. Gramps got the ice cream, and Ben got the bowls, scooped the ice cream and inserted the spoons. \u201cEnjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNow Ben\u2026 care to explain what happened. Minus a certain detail.\u201d Gramps began to eat his ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen began retelling what happened. Though he paused for a moment as he remembered part of the strange pleasurable sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI see. So it seems that the stone has reach saturation the moment you connected yourself to it. The drain you felt was the gem sucking up your mana. It reached saturation the moment you began to feel tired. It also appears that the green orb helped you recover from the drain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. So what does it do now?\u201d Ben took the gem out and set it on the table. It looked like an exotic pearl. Lustrous and ethereal were the two words to describe it. It emitted a warm energy that seemed to have a personality. You felt safe when you felt the energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIt feels different, and looks different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps agreed. \u201cI wonder what it does?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She decided to help out \u201cIf you want to make it look nice, then no one knows how to make nice jewelry like a girl who understands it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised an eyebrow \u201cYou\u2019re going to help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cOf course! I like messing with you, but we\u2019re always here for each other. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile \u201cYah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cGramps. Do you have any rich metal that you don\u2019t need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was surprised by the request. He went into his drawer and pulled out a jewelry box. \u201cThis belong to an old friend that wanted my to have it. I don\u2019t use the stuff inside, and it seems like a waste if I don\u2019t, so pick something you like.\u201d Gramps opened the box to reveal intricate metal carvings encrusted in gems and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen\u2019s eyes were mesmerized. She wasn\u2019t usually interested in jewelry, but this stuff had character. They had a hint of old lifestyles and made with exceptional skill. Even better than skills that exist today. She took a silver chain necklace from the box and put it on. The silver was made of billions of tiny links. Who ever made it must have spent years making it. The chain has an almost fluid look and feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cThat looks nice on you. Why don\u2019t you keep it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen gasped \u201cReally!\u201d Gwen jumped and gave Gramps a hug. \u201cThank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled seeing Gwen burst out like that for the first time. He patted her on the back \u201cNo problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was still looking in the box until he came a cross a clump of iridescent white metal. It wasn\u2019t carved or shaped to make anything. Ben pulled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was shocked to see Ben pull that it. \u201cIts funny that you would pull out the most unique item in that box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThat is another form of Gravitum. An old friend of mine had found that on gravitron with the help of an Anodite. It\u2019s the only sample of gravitum ever found that looked like that in its metal form. Its caused by the strange semi random bonds that the atoms have with each other. They make bonds and break bounds almost instantaneously with each other. This should make it hard to bend, but it does the opposite for some unknown reason. It is even harder than heart stone. However, we suspect that it has other unknown abilities. You can have it if you want. I can\u2019t do much with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the clumps of gravitum in his hands and around his neck. \u201cGramps\u2026 its amazing what gravitum can do. And thanks Gramps. I think that the metal will look perfect with the heart stone. Why hasn\u2019t the metal been shaped or carved before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cBecause there was nothing that could shape it. It was to strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. If it was that strong, it makes it even better for protecting the gem from harm. \u201cUmm. Guys\u2026 I\u2019m going outside to carve this under some light.\u201d Ben looked at the clump of metal and observed it as he went outside. Ben noticed that as he turned it, he noticed that the angle the light bounced of the metal changed the depth of the whiteness of the metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps and Gwen watched as Ben walked away to carve the metal. Gwen went back to looking through the jewelry box. Gramps was there to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was outside. He took the medallion off and began to mold the tennis ball sized clump of gravitum. He spun it and stretched it, flattened it, split it, and wove it. Ben was so entranced by his project that he didn\u2019t see the that the sun was beginning to set. Though he was finished by now. Ben had stretched the metal into a spider web thin length of string. He had weaved it into a complex design that he had seen in the jewelry box. This created a necklace that caught the eye, and if you looked closer, it intrigued the eye. Then using the remaining piece of gravitum, Ben molded it around the gem. Luckily, the gem wasn\u2019t scratched because it was so dense. This was one of its new properties. Ben added details and designs that were so in depth, it seemed real. Ben made tiny white leaves branching out from on point on the gem. When you looked at it, it seems that the leaves were alive, and they covered the gem as though it was guarding it. After that, Ben created a tiny hooking area that looked like a vines woven together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his work one last time making sure it was perfect. Ben saw that the gem and the metal were both white, but there was a clear and distinct difference between where one ended, and the other started. Then the sun set, and Ben was bathed in darkness. Suddenly, the gem in Ben\u2019s hand began to release a foggy light. It looked beautiful. Even more so now that the thing was covered in white gravitum. Ben slipped the metal string necklace through the hook of the pendant, and latched the chain together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked back into the Rustbucket. Gwen was covered in jewelry, and looked ridiculous. Gramps was reading a magazine. Gwen was napping on a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cGwen\u2026 you look ridiculous with all that on. The necklace was perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen woke up \u201cYah. I know. I just wanted bragging rights. To say that I was covered in jewelry seems a little to cocky, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll tell anyone this happened. Anyway. What did you make?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pulled the necklace out from behind his back slowly. He was nervous that they were going to say its not good or something. When Gwen and Gramps saw it, they gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it not good enough. I\u2019ll start over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and gramps screamed \u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIts beautiful. I\u2019ve never seen anything so detailed. It looks like the leaves are alive. How did you make that! I don\u2019t think a master crafter could match that detail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cDitto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen beamed \u201cReally? You think so? I put a lot of work into this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHow did you get it to look like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI kind of looked the leaves in the tree nearby and copied it down as close as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cShe\u2019s going to love this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps looked at Ben. He was only 11 years old and he likes a girl this much to make something like that. He\u2019s very serious about her. Gramps wanted to know if the girl was the same way. Though, he knew his place. Grandparents shouldn\u2019t get involved with this kind of stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAmy\u2019s a lucky girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s faced turned red from the compliment. \u201cUm.. Well\u2026 I should go\u2026 um\u2026 give this to her.\u201d Ben had a plan to commence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cWhat are you waiting for! GO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked by her sudden loudness, but smiled. Ben vanished as he ran back home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ben\u2019s family was invited, and various kids from school were as well. Ben had planned to go out for dinner or something, but when he heard about the party, he was shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Amy\u2019s backyard:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKids were playing tag and other games. Ben was with other boys playing football and basket ball. The girls were talking about how awesome the house was and using the make up they brought with them. Amy however was just simply enjoying everyone else\u2019s fun. Some of the girls had joined the boys in football and tag. Amy was friends with a lot of tomboys because they were more fun and interesting in her opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shouted to Amy \u201cHey Amy! Thanks for the party. Its awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw Ben walking towards her with a glass of water. He was sweating lightly from  the game. Ben handed Amy the glass. \u201cHey. How was the game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cI don\u2019t know what those girls do in their free time, but they beat us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cSeriously? And I thought men were the dominant sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile \u201cWell\u2026 I let them win!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cDon\u2019t hide your shame\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said sarcastically \u201cOk\u2026 Ok\u2026 you win. I give up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed for a moment and then things became quiet. They just sat next to each other awkwardly. Ben\u2019s heart began to race, and he started to sweat again. Ben\u2019s hand somehow magically began to drift towards Amy\u2019s hand, and hers did the same. Their hands were about to touch when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriend from class \u201cHey Ben! They\u2019re creaming us again. We need your help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen snapped out of his trance and saw the girls beating the boys. Ben looked Back at Amy and smile awkwardly. \u201cUm\u2026 talk to you in a moment. It looks like they need help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat there wondering what just happened. The felt all jittery on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben walked away, Ben had a new hop in his step. He felt that jittery feeling too. He kind of like it, but couldn\u2019t explain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the game finished, Zia, Ben\u2019s mom and dad, and a few other adults called the kids over for cake. They all dropped whatever they were doing and ran over to the table and sat down. Ben sat next to Amy. Quickly, before any chaos happens, the adults passed out the cakes. There were a lot of happy comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Zia stood up from the table. Everyone trained their eyes on her. \u201cI\u2019d like to make a toast to Ben. The house next to us used to be a disaster, but thanks to Ben, it is one of the best in the neighborhood. And without him, there would be no party right now. Cheers!\u201d Zia raised her cup of soda, and so did everyone else. They all clapped for Ben causing his face to turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young 4 year old yelled out \u201cMommy! Why is Ben\u2019s face is all red?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone paused, and started to laugh. Even Ben smiled a little. They were all laughing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hours ticked by, the adults thought it was time to go. Ben asked to stay to a little while, and his parents said yes. The only people left at the home now was Amy, Ben, and Zia who was inside in bed. She was exhausted by today\u2019s event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy were out in the back yard on the swing set under the moon lit sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUmm\u2026 thanks for the party again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cStop it! It was my mom\u2018s idea. She did most of the work. Thank her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. I\u2019ll stop complimenting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy froze and made a look \u201chuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen burst our laughing \u201cGotcha! You should have seen your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gave Ben a hard look \u201cHm!\u201d Then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled to. \u201cUmm\u2026 I wanted to give you something earlier. I didn\u2019t have time to during the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy raised an eyebrow again. \u201cAww\u2026 You didn\u2019t have to get me anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell I wanted to, and you can\u2019t stop me. So can you close your eyes. It\u2019s suppose to be a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy closed her eyes and felt something warm wrap around her neck. She felt Ben\u2019s arm brush her neck and pull her hair back. Then she heard a very faint click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Open them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy opened her eyes and saw Ben smiling hopefully. Then she looked down and saw what Ben gave her. \u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d Amy was speechless. \u201cHow\u2026 how\u2026 did you get the money to buy this!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said shyly \u201cWell\u2026 I didn\u2019t buy it. I got the gem and metal and made it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at the carvings and the detail inside of it. For some reason, she believed that Ben had made this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was watching her smiling at the fact that she liked it. Then she flung her self on Ben and latched her arm around his neck. \u201cI love it. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen blushed and scratched his neck \u201cIt was nothing really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at him seriously \u201cI don\u2019t like it when people do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was caught off guard \u201cDo what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSay its no big deal when it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said seriously \u201cWell fine then. I had to travel to somewhere far to get that, and it was not easy. You should have seen all the digging I went through to get it!\u201d Then Ben smiled \u201cBut it was worth it I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushed and brushed her hair back. Then she looked at the gem again \u201cBen\u2026 what is this made of. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned now because now he had to explain that she was in danger and that\u2018s the reason he got it for her. \u201cThere\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been putting off. I thought it didn\u2019t concern you that much until Nick attacked. I learnt that because you are with me, you are in danger by those who want to hurt me through you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned \u201cSo\u2026 what does this have to do with the necklace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019m getting to that, bit I have a question. How do you think I took Nick down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought about it \u201cI don\u2019t know the reason, but you\u2019re stronger than you look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYes\u2026 I am. It started last summer with this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen began to retell his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy listened politely until the end. \u201cSo the reason is because you found this green orb that made you a lot stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I believe you, and all that alien stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wasn\u2019t surprised. He knew she would believe him. \u201cWant to see the orb?\u201d Amy nodded, and Ben took out his Green Orb. The orb released a green glow as it came out of his medallion. \u201cThis is it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at it intriguingly. She felt her fatigue fade away as she was bathed in its light. \u201cI can feel why it made you so strong. I don\u2019t feel tired anymore.\u201d Amy looked at get the heart stone and compared it to Ben\u2019s orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gem was 1in in diameter, and was a liquid like foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s orb was a clear green with a now 6 pointed star. The pointed in angles 90 degreed from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYou said that this thing will let me manipulate mana to a point. What is mana? You also said we could talk with our thoughts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought to Amy \u201cYah. Its true. Can you hear me? This is my first time doing this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gasped when she heard Ben\u2019s voice in her head. She thought \u201cIt works!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. He thought \u201cNow, about the mana, mana is a type of energy that allows you to manipulate matter. The simplest spell that Gwen ever showed me was making a tiny ball of light appear in front of you. The orb is connected to my mana, but it doesn\u2019t drain me anymore. I charged it up to the max with my large mana cloud. I told you that already. Then after that, it began to generate its own mana. Its independent of me now, but it is still linked to me because I connected a part of me to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOk\u2026 so just think of a ball of light?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah. Make it appear in front of you. It will glow the same color as your mana field. The orb will convert its mana to match yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought of a ball of light in front of her. Suddenly, she felt a tingle run through her body, and the necklace began to grow warm. The Heart Stone hummed faintly and developed a small inner glow. A ball blazing ball of light appeared in front of Amy. The strength of the light shocked her, but she maintained control and dimmed it down. She somehow managed to restrict the flow of mana, and the blazing white light became as large as a candle flame. \u201cWow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was amazed \u201cDitto.\u201d Then Ben remembered that the Heart Stone only lets it user use a specialized type of spell. Such as Healing spells, or materializing spells. Each one has a different ability. Amy\u2019s might have more because it several ones compressed together. Though they will only reveal themselves when the need is great. Some of the weaker spells are a given. Anyone can do them. Such as make light and a few other minor things. Ben thought these thoughts to Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI wonder what this Heart Stone specializes in? Maybe it can do a lot since there are so many crammed together, or maybe because they are crammed together, they can make one specific group of spells even stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOnly time can tell. If the need I great, the Heart Stone will react to your emotion and give you a new spell. The ball of light is an ability that they all have. Heart Stone users don't need incantations or anything. The stone reacts to your heart and emotions. Then it provides a spell that will help out. That's why it is called a Heart Stone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amy, however was fine since the Heart Stone was keeping her nice and warm. Ben didn\u2019t care. He insisted that she goes inside. Amy obliged since Ben was so serious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen went home after that and dreamed sweet dreams. Amy did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning. Amy woke up to a panicked thrum from the Heart Stone. As though it was warning her\u2026 telling her to keep her eyes open. Zia was at work right now, so Amy was at home alone. There was a ring at the door, and Amy went down to open it. The thrumming from the stone was getting faster. Amy started to worry. Got to the door and looked through the eye hole. On the other side, she saw some girl scouts, and she sighed. Amy opened the door and said hi. The girls were about 6 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne girl \u201cHello! Do you want to help us raise money by buying cookies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl \u201cWe have a lot of choices!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smile and said \u201cI\u2019ll get one raising oatmeal please. They\u2019re my favorite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl squealed \u201cMe too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cKnow what? Give me two please.\u201d Amy handed them the money from her purse. \u201cAnd now I open one and give you a cookie.\u201d Amy opened the box and handed each girl a cookie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled and took the cookie. For some odd reason, the girls were waiting for Amy to bite first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cFine\u2026 I\u2019ll eat mine first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls smiled and nodded. Amy took a bite, and the world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was still sleeping at this time. \u201cHe is a growing boy\u201d quoted mom. Well\u2026 it was true in a sense. Ben\u2019s artificial growth ended, but his normal growth hasn\u2019t even started. When Ben slept, he was dreaming of Amy and how perfect she was\u2026etc. Then the dream got dark and mysterious. Out in the distance Ben heard \u201cHelp me Ben! Help!\u201d Out of no where, a giant muscle bound arm appeared out of the sky, and slammed a mighty fist down on Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen jolted up from his bed. He felt that something was wrong with Amy. The link created by the heart stone told Ben that something was wrong. Ben sent a thought to Amy, but didn\u2019t a response. Ben started to panic. He went downstairs, but his parents had gone off to work. His mom had started working at a financial firm downtown. They though Ben was mature enough to handle being home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen ran to Amy\u2019s home and saw the door open. Ben went inside and went up to Amy\u2019s room. He knocked, but didn\u2019t get a response. Ben opened the door, and aw the room empty. On Amy\u2019s bed was a metal disk. Ben went up to it and pressed the button in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a buzz, and a hologram appeared. It began to take the form of a human. As it became more defined, Ben realized it was Nick. The hologram repeated the same thing over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201c164 ASDF St.\u201d Then in the back ground was Amy unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it played over and over. That was until Ben crushed the disc with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen anger unlike ever before. No one messes with the people he cares about. Especially his \u2018undeclared\u2019 girlfriend. Ben removed his medallion and ran to the address. Ben\u2019s body was composed, and he had a poker face. Everything about him looked fine except he was seething with anger. Ben blasted through the doors ripping them off their hinges. The desk clerk freaked out and hid under the desk. Ben walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhere is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desk clerk pointed to an elevator. \u201cB-b-b-b-bot-bot-bottom floor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned away, and instead of using the elevator, he punched the floor sending his straight down. Ben knew he had landed at the bottom floor when the ground remained more firm under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was all black except for a single light in the middle of the room. Under it was Amy. She was sitting in a chair gagged and unconscious. Ben began to walk up to Amy, but something caught his eye. Standing in the darkness was a boy Ben\u2019s age, but more heavily muscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at Nick. Ben somehow maintained enough self control over his body so he wouldn\u2019t end Nick right there and them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cBen\u2026 thanks for joining us. You came faster than anticipated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUs\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stepped out \u201cYes\u2026 us\u2026 my employer has been extra keen on meeting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell. Tell him I\u2019m just picking someone up. Nick, I\u2019m giving you a chance to redeem yourself. Stop this before I lose myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that do much. I\u2019ve had an upgrade since the last time we met. I\u2019m stronger and better than before. I doubt you can beat me now.\u201d Nick\u2019s logic is\u2026 my many pearls Vs. his one orb. Who\u2019ll win? Nick of course\u2026 That\u2019s what he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen never stopped glaring at them. He turned at continued walking towards Amy. Suddenly Ben was trapped. A force field appeared around Ben trapping him in. Ben gave the prison a punch shattering that part of it, but it quickly regenerated. Ben punched it again and again, but it repaired itself to fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cPlease stop\u2026 you can\u2019t get out of that prison. I made it myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cWell Ben\u2026 who on top now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen continued pounding the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen got a page from his boss \u201cNick, Can you dispose of the girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smile \u201cSure. Where do you want me to drop her off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen frowned \u201cNo\u2026 not drop off. I said dispose of her. Make her cease to exist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stopped smiling. He was mean, yes, but not a killer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cWhat? After all we did for you\u2026 fine\u2026 our agreement is terminated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cOk\u201d He could still feel the pearls growing him. Also, he knew that Ben was going to be gone soon, so life was good. Also, he had acquired some gravitum as a gift to prevent him from sinking to the bottom of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen laughed \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re just going. We\u2019ll have to dispose of you to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cHow? I bet I\u2019m stronger than Ben. I could probably break your prison with a punch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cWell lets test that out.\u201d Ken pressed a button and a red prison encased Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s ego told him to smash the force field to pieces, so he did. He delivered his hardest blow to the shield, but nothing happened. Nick was confused. How can Ben smash a hole through it but I can\u2019t. \u201cHa! You increased the energy on this shield didn\u2019t you Ken. Messing with my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed \u201cNo\u2026 I actually decreased the energy on yours. Take a look.\u201d Ken turned a computer screen to Nick showing a picture of a dial on the lowest setting. Ben\u2019s settings were on the highest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was in denial \u201cThat can\u2019t be true. I have to be stronger than Ben by now. I have more pearls than he has.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard this and paused\u2026 Nick has more pearls, so he\u2019s been doing more growing. That\u2019s why he was so arrogant. Also, he has MORE pearls. Ben thought of a way to get out. While Nick and Ken were talking, Ben took his necklace off. Ben felt his weight increase. The sphere like prison began to sag in the middle, and cracks started to form and repair themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen heard the noises it made \u201cWait. What did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the field broke and Ben slipped the necklace back on. Ben ran and grabbed Amy and vanished. Ben put Amy back in bed at home, and ran back to the lab before they knew he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was laying down in his prison whining about how unfair it was. He\u2019d grown to a colossal size. He could get to the size of the earth he bet, but he chose to compress it into a small frame to make his strength amplify. Nick looked at Ben while laying down and tried to see the strength that Ben had. How can it be? No matter how many tries I make\u2026 he is always above me. Nick continued to think in his prison. Maybe he would change for the better some day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Nick decide?</span></div></div>",

Then Ben returned and went looking for the pearls that Nick was talking about. Ben felt a pull towards the ceiling. Ben looked up and saw a dome covered in metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed \u201cThe pearls are up there\u2026 You can have them. I give up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen made a questioning look. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI can\u2019t win against you. No matter how hard I try, you will always be above me. I may as well be second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned. He hadn\u2019t expected this. \u201cMaybe second isn\u2019t bad. You win if you\u2019re happy and have fun with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wasn\u2019t quite sure how the conversation was going \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019m saying that we can try to be friends. I\u2019m willing to give you a second chance because Amy would expect me to. She\u2019s to nice of a person.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was shocked, but could still speak \u201cWell\u2026 the pearls are still up top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen remembered what he came back for and jumped up to the top. He tore into the metal dome and broke through the glass inside it. The room was still relatively dark, so when Ben made a hole in the done, a beam of green light escaped. Ben knew the pearls were in there. He opened up his medallion and let the pearls inside. As each one entered the pearl, Ben felt his muscle density shoot up. Also with each one, Ben felt a more pleasurable feeling in his organ. It grew more and more intense with every pearl. Soon, Ben was lost in pleasure and had began to jack off. His penis was inside the hole he made in the dome. Like before, the pressure in his balls built until it was almost to painful. And like before, he unleashed his deadly load. It came out and filled the dome. Luckily, the pearls inside began to suck in the new DNA. They seemed to respond more kindly to Ben\u2019s DNA than Nick\u2019s DNA. Eventually, all the pearls had gone into Ben\u2019s orb, and he felt the feeling fade away. Nick was at the bottom with his eyes closed and face red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen jumped down \u201cTest of friendship. This never leaves the room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick opened his eyes and shook his head vigorously. Ben nodded, and smashed the machine trapping Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cThanks Ben\u2026 this is going to take some getting used to. I think I should let you know something very important\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it</span></div></div>",

They were all confused and didn\u2019t know what was going on. On the perimeter of the building, two largely built preteens had appeared out of no where. At the same time, there was a large humming that shook the building. Suddenly, a black void appeared consuming the building and all its contents. It stopped just an inc away from the foot of one scientist. A yellow blotch appeared on his white lab coat and overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLets get out of here. You have some more explaining to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded \u201cUm\u2026 do you think they can forgive me? I was kind of obsessed with beating you. Though admitting defeat lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. I don\u2019t know why, but I think being second best isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile. Now that Nick wasn\u2019t a maniac, he was actually a pretty fun kid to be with. \u201cOk. I\u2019ll help break the ice with Amy and the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smile hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they both vanished and appeared at Amy\u2019s place. Amy was just waking up from what she though was a bad dream that involved evil girl scouts and a strange lab. \u201cThat was a weird dream\u2026\u201d Then after that, she heard the doorbell ring. Amy went down stairs and opened the door. She was happy to see Ben, but surprised to see Nick. \u201cUm\u2026 hey\u2026 what are you guys doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNick here wants to tell you something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stepped forward and swallowed his pride \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was power hungry and arrogant, and a little crazy. I\u2019m sorry I got you involved and almost hurt you. I don\u2019t know if you believe me, but if you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSure\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSure\u2026 I forgive you. I heard there\u2019s a party at Jenny\u2019s place next week. We can all go. I think I\u2019ll be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was flabbergasted \u201cSo we\u2019re cool? We can be friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy let out a cheerful laugh \u201cOf coarse! If you could swallow your planet sized pride, they least I can do if forgive you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick turned to Nick with a questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI told\u2026 she\u2019s to nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat did the others say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWe were going over to them next. Want to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, and the three kids vanished. Ben was carrying Amy on his back as they ran, and Amy was smiling the whole time. It was like the greatest roller coaster in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene turned into a forest with a trailer in a small clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside were Gramps and Gwen who was over there talking to each other about what has happen to Ben recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey Gwen and Gramps. Look who I brought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps and Gwen turned their head toward the new arrivals. They say Ben and Amy getting off his back. Then next to them was Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here!\u201d Shocked and surprised partly from the fact that Ben was with Nick, and partly from the fact that this was the first time Gwen had seen Nick in a long time, and that he was somewhat cute. Though he was to bulky for Gwen\u2019s taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was silent as he waited for an explanation. Years of youthful impulsiveness led him to discover that you should never jump to conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNick wants to tell you guys something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick steps forward again \u201cI want to tell you that I won\u2019t go all power hungry anymore. I realize that Ben is beyond me, so I\u2019ll just settle for being second. It\u2018s made me see that I\u2018ve been cruel and selfish. So all I can say is I\u2018m sorry and hope that there will be a chance for my to prove it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen on the other hand walked up to Nick and stared him straight in the eye. She raised her hand and gave him a hard slap. \u201cOk\u2026 I forgive you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was shocked. Then he turned to Ben \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t understand girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cDitto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen stood next to each other talking about what had just transpired. Gramps was on the sidelines keeping to himself. This was none of his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded and show them his arm. He was wearing a watch. \u201cYah\u2026 my watch is made of gravitum. Ken gave it to me. It clicks open, and I can put stuff inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk\u2026 So I need you to imagine what you want your seal to do. Tell me what you truthfully want it to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI want it to do what Ben\u2019s does. To make me as strong as I look, so I don\u2019t raise suspicion. And I want my watch to have a dial so that if I turn it 360 degrees clockwise, the seal will be removed. Then it gets re applied if I turn the dial back to its original position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps though that that was a nice way to start and stop the seal, and it helped prevent unwanted outcomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded \u201cOk. No think those thoughts until I say stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen did just that, and Gwen began to process once again. She imagined a ghost of Ken\u2019s will flowing into the watch. Gwen could tell that Nick hadn\u2019t lied because the image of the ghost gave off an aura that stated Nick\u2019s intentions. Soon the ghost vanished into the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was on the side shocked by what she was seeing. No one but Amy and Gwen saw what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick suddenly felt a drain in his strength. He opened his eyes and the world seemed bigger than before. No dangerous. \u201cWow\u2026 I think it worked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cUmm\u2026 did any of you see that ghost thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Amy weird except Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYou saw it? I thought only I could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps spoke up \u201cI think its because of the heart stone. It leaves he more open to things done by mana because she is now connected to mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy nodded \u201cMakes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just stood there waiting and listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was looking at his body. It had shrunk down to its minimum size. Which was small than Ben to his slight regret. He\u2019ll have to work on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had grown to 5ft 7in since the summer and was slightly more muscled to match his change in height. This was about an 1in in height and about 5lbs of muscle. This happened \u2018naturally\u2019. As in without any real exercise<br>\r\nMinimum Height: 5ft 7in<br>\r\nMinimum Weight: 180lbs<br>\r\nMaximum Height: N/A<br>\r\nMaximum Weight: N/A<br>\r\nDescription: More heavily built than the majority of kids his age, but it was made of hard lean muscle, so he was slimmer than he should be. His pecs pushed an 1.5 in off his body, and his 6pack was firmly defined. His shoulders were nice and broad. His back had a nice wingspan for his age, and his arms were bulky, but their size did not cost his and mobility. Same with his legs. They were tone, strong, agile, and fast. Ben had joined Amy when she went to yoga, aerobics, and gymnastics. These events helped Ben make his muscles more taunt, strip his body of excess fat thus making him very tone. Also a result is that it made his \u2018minimum\u2019 size different. Like average humans, his muscles changed is design depending on what exercise you do. He does heavy lifting thereby giving him stronger, more condensed muscles. Along with the yoga, it further slimmed him down. Though he is still largely muscles due to the effects of the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick on the other hand was only slightly smaller than Ben because he\u2019s spent to much time growing artificially.<br>\r\nMinimum Height: 5ft 6in<br>\r\nMinimum Weight: 150lbs<br>\r\nMaximum Height: Planet sized<br>\r\nMaximum weight: Planet weight<br>\r\nDescription: Nick lost the growth and size that was caused by any orb. Ever since Ben absorbed the pearls, Nick no longer felt the tingle from their presence. Ever since growing, Nick has failed to work on his minimum thereby letting it shrink down to a shadow of what it could have been if he had worked out. He was strong for his age, but not so much that it would make him stand out. Nick plans of changing that over the next few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After that day, Nick spent less time being his evil self and more out going. He even made some friends when he re joined society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were rumors that said that the school would be postponed for the year because of all the damages done to it. Then the next day after Nick fessed up, the school was good as new. Even better actually. Officials went inside to see if everything was alright for students to come back. The night before, there were dozens of tons of material set in front of the school to prepare for construction. The next day they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudent heard the news and groaned. As they filed into the new and improved school the following day, they were shocked to see that they can\u2019t even recognize their school. It has been turned into a towering dome (shaped like a donut) filled with the latest in eco friendly material. The outside was all windows.  All the windows were designed to let more light in, and could convert excess light into energy for the school. Around the school was solar panel walk ways with reinforce glass so they don\u2019t break. Surround the school were dozens of windmills that were turning in the autumn breeze. The school was surrounded by a an array of flowers that were organized into a beautiful garden. Even new trees were planted. In the middle of the \u2019donut\u2019 was a field of grass where students could eat their lunches or play around. All the students forgot their disappointment and ran in to explore their new school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne student walked in casually as though he knew where everything was. Ben strolled down the hall listening to kids awe and gasp. The class rooms were designed to feel like a normal class room, but had subtle changes to improve learning. It made it easy for student to see the board and thing placed on the walls. The light from outside brighten the room to give a more cheerful atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeachers had already started playing first come first serve. The majority of them fought over the top floor because of the view it provided. They quickly discovered that they could dim the windows or brighten them up. When they dimmed the window, more light got converted into electricity, and vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked into school and saw Ben strolling by. Amy ran up to him. \u201cYou did an amazing job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked confused \u201cI don\u2019t know what your talking about. This is knew to me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gave Ben a disbelieving look \u201cIs that how you\u2019re going to play it? Fine!\u201d She said in a challenging tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile. He thought \u201cYah\u2026 I did it. Don\u2019t let anyone else find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled knowing that Ben trusted only her to know this. Though she did think that Gwen and Nick would come to the same conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the devils. Nick and Gwen walk towards Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBen! This place is amazing. How\u2019d you do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSeriously man. I think I could enjoy going to school now that it isn\u2019t a dark and boring place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen said commandingly \u201cOh no you don\u2019t. We are not playing this game. Its like summer all over again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Amy raised an eyebrow wondering what happened over the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw this \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cFine\u2026 even if you say you didn\u2019t. We\u2019ll all know who really did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. I didn\u2019t do it, and you can believe it or not. Its up to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group hung around and talked. Administrative personnel were running back and forth trying to get students and teachers reorganized. They were trying to get everyone with the right homerooms and right teachers. They were distribution maps that were left in the main office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was practically no school that day. The student spent the whole day getting acquainted with the halls and such. They even stayed after school until 8pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, things were more settled. There was an anxious feeling in the air again. Its felt like the first day of school. Students looked at lists and charts trying to find their homerooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver night, a series of bridges were built by someone to make going from one end to the other more easy to do. The thrum of excitement and anxiety filled everyone\u2019s shoes. The teacher had organized the rooms to their liking that night and the following morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs student trickled into their homerooms, they were shocked to see new desks. They looked like regular desks, but they had a built in laptop for personal use and a series of ornate pencil sharpeners and flash cards. They were all shocked by this. This day kind of felt like school, but people had a hard time sitting still when there was so much to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one class maintained the same atmosphere. GYM! Mr. Ted declared that class to day was a free day. Do what ever you want. The gym was a huge room divided into two sections. You have the Gym Court and the Gym Weights. The gym court is the regular flat floored open area used for basket ball or other gym exercises. The other section had weights and aerobics in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess which one Ben and Nick went to? You got it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was starting out in the light weights because he\u2019s lost some muscle on his minimum size since he hadn\u2019t work out in a while. He was lifting light weights for more reps to build a bulkier build. He did this for every part of his body for multiple reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was lifting heavy weights for fewer reps to get a relatively smaller, but stronger build than that of Nick\u2019s. After he did his set of weights, he went to the treadmill and worked on endurance. After that, he did aerobics for flexibility and agility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of people gathered around the two boys as they did their routine. Nick had made it known that he was still stronger than the majority of boys in the 6th grade. Boys around him even tried to out lift him, but Nick always won. Ben was letting Nick enjoy himself knowing that Nick wasn\u2019t obsessively power hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mixture of boys and girls joined Ben as he did aerobics and yoga. He was leading the groups through various exercises. Most of the kids were out of shape, so the workout hurt them a lot. Ben stood by and encouraged them. They all saw Ben\u2019s sculpted body and swore to themselves that they would work hard to stay in shape like Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the class ended, a lot of kids were worn out. They were working out at a really young age, and were devoted. That\u2019s because they now have two leading muscle heads to guide them. Ben and Nick knew none of the kids would catch up that year because their orbs had given them a jump start. However, in a few years once they have had their growth spurt, then the kids would start to become a match. For now though, Ben and Nick were just getting them motivated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This day in the Gym, people were working harder than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was spotting a kid in gym as he tried to lift more than he usually could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cCome on. 3 more. You can make it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid Ben was helping was gritting his teeth. He let out a quick yell, and lifted the weight up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGood job. 2 more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid was in straining his muscles, but he was determined. Usually, you wouldn\u2019t lift like this but the kid was insistent. As the kid began to lower the weight, he felt his arms about to give way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt a little pity for it for the kid. Ben wanted to help him. Suddenly, their was a micro flash of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the kid pulled the bar in toward him and pushed it back up twice more. \u201cThanks Ben. I don\u2019t know why, but those last two were easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo problem. It looks like the lifting is paying off. Keep up the hard work.\u201d Ben watched the kid sit up slowly. The kid was sore, but still energized. He went and walked off the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen watched the kid walk away. Does he seem bigger? Ben looked at the kid and thought the kid was bigger than when he was sitting down. Ben tried to tell himself his eyes were fooling him, but he was positive the kid was bigger. His looked a little taller and his shirt seemed smaller. His muscles were a little more pronounced. He looked like really athletic. Like he could do any sport well. He was \u2018third\u2019 place in the school body wise now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was confused and decided to walk it off. He went around the gym helping kids out when they looked like they needed it. For some strange reason, Ben felt like he was seeing things. All the boys seemed \u2018Bigger\u2019. Like they had a growth spurt the moment just this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about and it led back to one thing. His orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked away into the locker room, and took out his orb. It seemed odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb was like before, but the stars of the mini universe were spiraling around the orbs in unpredictable patterns. It seemed chaotic inside, and there were occasional discharges of energy. What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The orb released a burst of bright green light that passed though out the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s eyes slowly cleared and he looked around the locker room. Everything seemed the same. Ben suddenly heard a lot of murmuring and screams. Ben ran out into the gym and was shocked by what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had changed. The girls, over all, were a little more tone, and other stuff\u2026 cough cough. The boys on the other hand were another story. They grew massive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smallest boy was 6ft tall at 300lbs of muscle. The largest was 8ft tall 600lbs of muscle. Ben was dwarfed by these titanic teens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was shocked. The girls had huddled together in shock and fear from the boys. The boys were separated. They gasped at there size while trying to comprehend their untold strength. They looked at their uncovered bodies for their cloths had no chance of survival. \u201cWhat happened? This is amazing! I feel so strong.\u201d Was all Ben heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo\u2026 we have a room full of highly developed boys (not just muscle). They have preteen hormones surging through their bodies created by their engorged balls. And they are excited! What can go wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne teen collapsed moaning. Trying to find respite from the intense feeling his engorged shaft was giving him. He touched it and soon went mad. He instinctively began to jack off. And so did the others. Chaos ruled the gym!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls began to fall to their desires as the young boys\u2019 musky pheromones flooded the air. They ran for what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResults in more chaos\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick were standing to the side looking at each other and the scene before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cThe orb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cYes\u2026 the orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cCalling Gramps?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYes\u2026 gramps.\u201d Ben took out his plumber badge and called gramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cMax Tennyson. What can I do for you?\u201d Then he heard the back ground sound \u201cWhat\u2019s that moaning? What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cThe situation is umm\u2026. Awkward. The orb is acting up. I need your help.\u201d They hung up and waited. Ben looked around and saw that Amy was on the other end of the gym shocked by what she was seeing. It seems that the heart stone protected her from the seductive scents. However, she was indeed more tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw Ben looking at her. She mouthed the words \u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said \u201cwait a sec\u201d. Then he started to walk around pools of ever increasing cum until he got to Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat happened. There was this flash and all the boys got huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThe orb did this for sure. But the question is why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cDid you get gramps?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah. He\u2019s on his way. He\u2019s also going to bring a few plumbers to help us resolve this issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded \u201cUmm\u2026 we should get out of here. The room is umm\u2026 you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cYah. Lets get out.\u201d Ben looked at Nick at the other end of the room and made a hand motion to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio met outside and were shocked to see a flash of purple light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat on earth just happened! I was in the middle of a spell when suddenly a wave of energy blew it up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled guiltily \u201cUmm\u2026 the orb is acting kind of funny. Gramps is coming over.\u201d then as a side thought \u201cSome advice\u2026 do not go in the gym. Trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen raised an eye and was about to ask why, but Ben said \u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HONK HONK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rustbucket arrived at the side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBen\u2026 you care to explain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll for kids went into the Rustbucket, and Nick, Amy, and Ben explained what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was silent \u201cYah\u2026 that is awkward. Any how\u2026 its seems that your orb is building up energy, and is discharging it when it reaches its peak. Can you take it out so we can take a look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took the orb out of his medallion. It looked like before the event. The green dots were stationary. Suddenly, there was a small green pulse of light, and the dots began to move. Though, it was very slow. The movement was barely noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then there was another tiny flash, and the dots sped up a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to feel strange. He felt the energy in the orb build up, but also inside of him. Ben had a feeling that he knew what was about to happen. He felt a boner coming about and ran out of the Rustbucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy yelled out from inside \u201cBen! Where are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen didn't here. He had taken off his medallion and had ran off to a secluded place before it was to late. As he ran, his legs rub against his ever increasing sensitive hard on making it more difficult for him to maintain control over his self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to get to the top of Mt. Everest when he finally lost it. Ben fell to the ground giving into his desires. Ripping of his pants, Ben began to jack of in one of the most desolate places on earth. He felt the pressure build and build until it came. Billions of gallons surged out at near speed of light. A long string formed and extended straight into space going past our solar system, but it still didn\u2019t stop. For the next hour, Ben lay there half in pleasure and half in a blissful dream state. Every nerve in his powerful shaft was sending billions of signals to the brain every millisecond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, his reserves began to run dry, and he stopped. Ben was silent\u2026 unable to do anything but wait out his blissful pleasure. He saw his orb rise up and flash once. Suddenly, every particle Ben\u2019s boyhood released was sucked into the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb began to get brighter and brighter as it\u2019s ties to Ben strengthened beyond measures. As the last molecule entered the orb, it released a small pulse of green light, and fell down right below Ben\u2019s mighty pecs. It rested there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt the orb beat in harmony with his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow\u2026 after having the talk with his dad, he knew what happened. Ben loved the feeling, but knew better. So he decided to stay abstinent for a while. Not forever, but for not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen put his pants back on. He brushed off the snow that collected on it. Then he put the orb back in the medallion. Even though Ben wasn\u2019t touching it now, he could still feel the orb beating in harmony with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen ran back to the Rustbucket surprising everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat on Earth took you so long! Where did you go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had a worried expression. He heart stone had been blazing bright white for the past hour. \u201cWhat happened? The heart stone was acting weird while you were gone.. What did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cNothing bad. Just having a good time. Nature was calling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone made a confused expression, but said no more. Gramps chuckled a knowing chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were lines of energy floating around in the orb. When a line passed through a dot, a small burst of energy was released. Though, it wasn\u2019t a sudden huge burst. It was just small ones that didn\u2019t get to far away. Ben then saw something forming at the bottom of the orb. A tine drop of green liquid was being formed. Ben touched it and felt a sudden shock. He felt his muscle double in density every fraction of a second. Then when the drop was gone, Ben felt his growth rate drop down to what it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWow\u2026 I don\u2019t know what just happened, but it felt like my strength was doubling every second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at the orb curiously and wondered what the drops were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI think that drop was made of pure energy.

Ben put the orb back into his medallion. He trusted Nick, but knew that Nick might be tempted to touch the drop of energy out of curiosity. Though, it might not work for him. Since the orb is tied to Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the orb was put away, the room grew dark for the green light was gone. Then Amy\u2019s heart stone began to glow to brighten up the room. It was a warm and safe light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell. It seems that instead of releasing one burst of energy, your orb is now converting that energy into a liquid. I don\u2019t think it will be a problem anymore. Just as long as no one touches the liquid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed, but knew it was for the best. \u201cIs the liquid just going to build up inside the universe made from gravitum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI think so, but only time will tell. I think it will make that liquid even faster as time goes on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThen what should we do with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cLets just keep it locked up inside that medallion. We\u2019ll need to make it so that only you can open it. Just incase. Some people might find out some how, and try to get inside your medallion. Gwen\u2026 can you help make Ben\u2019s medallion a safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded and began to mutter something. \u201cBen. Can you imagine that the medallion will only let you open it? This is similar to the process of making a seal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and did what she said. There was a green haze and fog that formed around Ben. Slowly, the medallion began to suck up the glowing green fog until it was gone. A tiny spark of green was released when the last bit of fog got sucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tossed it to Nick \u201cCan you open it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick caught the medallion, and tries to pry the thing open. The item didn\u2019t budge even though Nick was strong enough to crush the earth. It seems that the medallion had copied Ben\u2019s strength and density so it wouldn\u2019t be broken by him. Nick frown disappointed. He could always muscle out anything he wanted, though he didn\u2019t want to all the time. He sighed, but smile in the end to show that he was still good at heart \u201cNah\u2026 I can\u2019t get it open.\u201d Then he tossed it back at Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen caught it and tapped the center of the Omnitrix insignia. It opened to reveal a beam of green light. Ben tapped it again, and it closed. \u201cGramps\u2026 is it possible to go inside the medallion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps raised an eyebrow as he thought. \u201cYah\u2026 you can. It\u2019s a little difficult to get out though, but it has been done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cLets give it a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, Gwen and Nick watched expectantly. Ben opened the medallion and pointed the green light at himself. Ben suddenly felt as though he was being compressed into an even small size as the medallion sucked him in. The feeling was strange, and not overly pleasant. The feeling slowly passed, and Ben found himself in a green universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen popped out of a small hole at the center of the universe. Ben looked up and down and thought that off in the far distance, there was a green wall like object. The wall surrounded the whole entire universe, and the distance as still growing. As he looked around more, he saw different shades of green that indicated objects. He saw green stars and spherical asteroids floating around. In front of him was his orb. It was floating around at the center of this universe. The stars and asteroids were orbiting it in a slow but ordered fashion. The orb itself was coated in a green liquid now. The thickness of the liquid slowly increased, but was also slowly speeding up. Ben was amazed by the world in his medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reached out a hand and touched the liquid on his orb. Ben felt the surge in growth again, but something else happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis universe began to brighten up even more. Now stars were forming in the outer reaches of is universe. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d And still, the liquid was going into Ben\u2019s body. As he looked around more, he saw the asteroids grow in in size, and then divide. Grow and divide. The number of asteroids increased exponentially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one asteroid fell out of orbit and began to rocket towards Ben and the orb. Ben saw it rushing towards him and he knew that the planet sized asteroid was as strong as he was. He raised his hands in self defense, but nothing hit him. Ben opened his eyes and was surprised to see that his orb was sucking up the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt his energy spike as the orb sucked up the green planet, then it slow dropped a bit. Then Ben realized something. He wasn\u2019t were the medallion! He was in it, but does it still seal his intense gravitational pull?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben\u2019s looked around and then realized he made a mistake. His necklace sealed his gravitational pull. Not the medallion. Ben sighed in ignorant relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to test it out anyway. Ben took off his necklace and felt the walls of the universe halt their expansion. His gravitational pull was so strong it prevented this universe from growing any larger. Then suddenly, all the objects in the universe began to fall towards Ben and his orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic filled Ben. \u201cMaybe that wasn\u2019t suck a good idea!\u201d He screamed as he saw a star plummet towards him. Ben slammed the necklace back over himself, but it was to late. An object in motion can only be stopped by something of equal energy. See that nothing was going away from Ben, all the objects in the universe continued to plummet towards Ben. When they get near him, he saw his orb do something odd. It started to orbit him slowly at first, but then it got faster and faster. Soon all you saw was a green ring around Ben. When the Asteroids and Stars touched the ring, it got absorbed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt like he lost himself. His pants instantly tented. He ripened them off and began to jack off once again. Losing his will to abstain any longer. He pumped faster and harder than the speed of light. Every nerve in his mighty shaft sending waves of signals up his spine. The pleasure he felt can not be described with words.  The pressure built up as his highly condensed balls produced his young boy juices. Billions of metric tons were being produced every microsecond, and it was speeding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs star after star\u2026 planet after planer got sucked into the orb, a wave of never ending pleasure passed thought Ben\u2019s body. It was almost painful if not for the pleasure. Ben fell unconscious during that time. It was to much for his young mind to handle. But even then, the feeling entered his dreams! Nothing could stop the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all the starts and planets were gone. Slowly, Ben woke up from his first wet dream. He still had a hard on. He poked it, and a wave of pleasure passed thought him, but nothing else happened. His reserves were depleted. Slowly, that to turned flaccid, and order returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around and saw that there were no more starts or planets. The green walls of the universe were now growing again, and everything had returned to once it was before the orb showed up. That is\u2026 except for the ocean of searing white hot seeds floating around in the universe. There was enough to fill a galaxy now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the orb expectantly. It flashed once and all of the cum rushed towards the orb. Ben felt his connection with the orb grow stronger and stronger until he felt like he as part of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ben noticed something he never noticed before. The orb had a mind. Well not a train of thought, but a goal. It was a universal living force. Everything wants to grow and get stronger. The orb is the very embodiment of that force. Ben could feel the orb choosing Ben as its main target of concern. Though, now he could sense other things as well. There are still orbs in the universe. Ben smile and was glad that he was the one the orb chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen snapped into focus and looked for his pants. He saw them floating next to him, so he put them on. Then Ben turned his attention back to the orb. As he looked closer, he saw more dots than before. And they were brighter. The lines of energy floating around were still moving about and colliding with the dots. To Ben\u2019s surprised\u2026 he realized that those planets and stars were actually NEW Green Stars and Green Planets. Exact copies of the originals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked closer and then found another surprise. The liquid was being made as a rapid rate now. It was even speeding up! Ben was about to touch it, but decided against it. He\u2019d wait for another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked behind himself, and saw the Omnitrix insignia floating in one place. Ben tapped the center, and it opened. Then it ejected him back onto earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWow\u2026 that was so cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone buffeted him with questions. \u201cWhat happened? What was it like? Etc\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen answered \u201cEverything was green\u2026 blah blah\u2026 Green planets and starts\u2026 blah\u2026 sucked into orb\u2026. Blah\u2026. Etc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cImpossible! Energy can not be created or destroyed, but it looks like the orb had been generating energy without a source.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI agreed. It doesn\u2019t sound right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI know, but I also learnt that the orb is the embodiment of \u2018growing\u2019. It makes things bigger. So why not the universe. Adding stuff to it makes it bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just agreed with Ben. She walked up and looked at Ben in the face to make sure he was alright. She was worried because he\u2019s been awfully secretive. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk later. You have some more talking to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt like he was being lectured, and he shrunk into himself. He was still kind of shy around Amy when she was like this. Even though they declared themselves an item. Then Ben smiled \u201cYes mother\u2026\u201d with a sarcastic and playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick burst out laughing, and Amy just stared at Ben shocked. Then she smile and everyone joined in the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then made a serious face \u201cYour still in trouble mister.\u201d There was a silent moment, then everyone started to laugh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk\u2026 Ok. We\u2019ve had out fun. We still have an issue to deal with. What are we going to do with giant muscle bound sixth graders?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stopped laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cRight\u2026 I forgot about that.\u201d Everyone nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will they do about it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After their umm\u2026 recent activities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded, and everyone left for the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, all the boys were snoring on the ground totally naked. All some of the girls were napping on top of the boys\u2019 meaty chest and other locations. Some girls had practiced abstinence, and hung off to the side away from the temptation. The event must have been torture for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen gagged from the zoo smell of the room \u201cI see why you wanted me to stay out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor were hundreds of pools of cum. The boys were still hugely muscled. The average size was gigantic. Their pecs pushed almost a foot off their bodies. Thus blocking their view of their lower bodies. Some kids were as wide as they were tall. Their legs were so huge, that their thighs pushed their legs apart. Their arms couldn\u2019t go all the way down, and some kids couldn\u2019t touch their faces. The last, and more controversial part was their overly developed organ. The smallest was 13in long 2.5in diameter with baseball balls. The largest was a whopping 25in long 5in diameter with cantaloupes for balls. It longer than the arms of some girls and twice as thick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s face turned bright red at the sights. Even Gramps coughed and then said \u201cLets stay professional.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cCan we do that outside this room? I\u2019m still gagging from the smell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat are we going to do? Parents are bound to show up to pick up their kids. They don\u2019t want to find jumbo sized kiddies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cEven that is a minor problem. With kids this size, they\u2019re bound to get loose and someone will get hurt. Not even their parents can stop them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen nodded. Their female instincts said \u201cEspecially with their overly active hormones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps frowned. He didn\u2019t have any reasonable solutions. They involved sending the kids some place far off, or painful treatments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick then get an idea \u201cWhy don\u2019t we drain their muscle? You know that ray that make them grow bigger? Why not try it on reverse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all thought about the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cOf coarse. And it doesn\u2019t hurt them either.\u201d Gramps ran back to the Rustbucket and brought back a ray gun. \u201cThis is a plumber copy of the one found at that lab in the summer. We can\u2019t use it because it needs a source of energy. Though\u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need one to shrink people\u2018s muscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDoes it work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cOnly one way to find out. Lets go test it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all went back inside. Gramps opened up the small gun and switched a pair of wires. \u201cThat should reverse the effect of the ray.\u201d Then he pointed it at the largest kid. A white light came out and hit the kid. Then suddenly, the light turned green. It started from the kid and went back to the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cLook! He\u2019s shrinking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked closer and they were shocked to see that his mounds of muscle were getting smaller. His 1ft high pecs shrank down to .5in high. His biceps went from beach balls to baseballs. His 12 pack turned into a faint 6 pack. His thighs no longer pushed the legs apart. His legs were toner and more agile than before. Now his penis went from 25in to 10in to an above average 6in. At this point, Gramps stopped firing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s mouth hung open \u201cWow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cIt worked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded then fired it at the next kid. After a few minutes, all the giant muscle bound boys were shrunken down to a believable size. They were all still above average for their age in height, strength, speed, and definitely a certain organ. That organ even produced more product than most. It seems that the effects of the energy didn\u2019t leave the boys entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNow they don\u2019t look like walking piles of muscle. They were about the same shape as a block before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cHow are we going to clean up the mess? The floor is covered in \u2018you know what\u2019 and all the boys are naked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash, and the mess was gone. Only one person saw what happened, but even that was not much. Nick saw Ben run around cleaning up the place, and then returned to where he stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat mess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smile then gave Ben a playful push. \u201cJerk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cNow clothing\u2026 That\u2019s more of an issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cLeave it\u2026 If everyone\u2019s naked, no one can point fingers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat did that green energy turn into?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was curious as well. Gramps opened up the ray gun and saw that a pearl had formed inside. \u201cI see\u2026 their growth was converted into energy. Then the energy was crystallized into this time pearl.\u201d Gramps took out a small pearl. It was the size of a pea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI\u2019m going to send it to a lab for testing. Just to make sure that it is growthium. If news gets out about this, then their will be trouble. If you can turn regular muscle mass into a long term growing agent. This could reek havoc on the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThen why try at all? Why not just keep it a secret?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBecause we need to develop a plan to prevent it from happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick jumped in \u201cHow do we even know if it\u2019s a long term source. How do we know if it won\u2019t disappear if we fire it at someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps thought about it \u201cThat\u2019s a good point. Do you want to test it on yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick hesitated \u201cUmm\u2026 if its ok with everyone. I don\u2019t want it to look like I\u2019m getting a relapse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone smile. \u201cSure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps turned the gun towards Nick and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it a long term type of pearl, or is it like a battery and runs out of power.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gramps fired, and a green energy enveloped Nick as the ray did its stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt a warm and calming sensation pass over his body. He could feel his body\u2019s density skyrocketing. He looked down at his above average body and was shocked to see it actually growing. His pecs grew from .5in to 3inoff his body. His abs were a set of deeply chiseled 6 packs. His biceps were bowling balls. His legs brushed against each other slightly, and his calves formed a sharp diamond. His back\u2019s wingspan spread began to spread out. The final change occurred on his male organ. It snaked down his tight pants until it was 12in long with 2 softballs at the top. He was still 5f 6in tall. Then suddenly, the beam ended abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWow\u2026 wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was shocked. They thought he would be compressed like Ben, but he had grown considerable as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick tried to shrink down, but he couldn\u2019t get any smaller. \u201cI guess this is my new minimum.\u201d He said this with a smile. He finally beat Ben at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stuck a few poses, and stopped when a sound came out. RIP! His shirt tore straight down the middle, and his jeans ripped from top to bottom. All that was left were some briefs that looked more like speedos. Nick\u2019s face turned red as he realized what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else turned away, and Ben was doing a face palm. He ran to the Rustbucket and got a blanket. He draped it over Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cThanks\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo prob. Looks like our first now. At least when we\u2019re at our minimum. The only problem with this is how are we going to explain this to your parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI think I have an alibi. A truck with unknown cargo was passing by. The cargo was leaking and exploded releasing a strange energy. Nick was at the front door and took the full brunt of the blast, while everyone else got the remainder. The effects of the energy were advanced bodily development.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI guess that isn\u2019t to far from the truth. I think it\u2019ll work, but we\u2019ll need proof.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI don\u2019t think so. The people will be the proof. They can\u2019t say other wise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cGwen\u2019s right. Even if they say its impossible. It will be pushed aside by the fact that Seth doubled in size! And all the other kids got more muscle too. Ben though\u2026 looks the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile \u201cWell duh! I like my current shape!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smile. She did too. She walked behind Ben and gave him a soft hug. While feeling his muscle. There was a soft layer of skin and super thin layer of fat right under. It made Ben look strong and tone, but not like see every single tiny muscle type of tone. He looked perfect in Amy\u2019s eyes and the eyes of several girls as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grasped Amy\u2019s hands and hugged them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was still engrossed in his new body, and Gwen was thinking of possible flaws in the solution. Gramps had resigned to a chair and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a groan. A kid just woke up. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d His penis was erect and a tiny stream of cum rose out of his shaft \u201cThat dream was awesome\u2026\u201d He looked around and was confused \u201cWow\u2026 am I still dreaming\u2026\u201d He looked around in a daze as he saw all the naked boys and half naked girls. 75% of the boys had an erection that was still oozing a small trickle of cum. The kid looked on top of his torso and saw that a girl had fallen asleep on him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d He pushed the girl off and stood up. His hard on had deflated. \u201cThis had got to be a dream\u2026\u201d He looked himself over and saw that he had grown a little. All his muscle were more defined that before. Even his penis was now 6in long. He scratched his head and walked to the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang was quite and frozen. They wanted to see if the boy would notice them. When he was gone, they burst of laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cDid you see his face?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was smiling and suppressing the urge to burst out again \u201cIt was all confused looking. \u2018Is this a dream?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen frowned and looked at each other. They said in unison \u201cBoys\u2026\u201d With a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was smiling. He like his grandkids and their little friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the other kids slowly picked themselves off the ground. They all looked confused and they eventually trudged off towards the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick continued to laugh. They decided to be good sports and go get blankets for the other boys. They are all bound to have a bright red face by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny and Gwen did the same for the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps supplied the blankets. God! He has a lot of blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick walked into the locker room to find a bunch of confused preteen boys with overly developed bodies. They all had about the same sized body since Gramps shrunk them down to relatively the same size. They were about 5ft6in tall. With pecs that pushed .5in out of their body. They had a faint set of 6 packs. Their biceps were nice and firm baseballs. Their thighs were cut and tone. They had nice cut diamond calves. They all had about a range of 6in penis to 9in penis with golf balls for balls or a size that was slightly larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all muttering about their growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick had taken off their cloths as to not raise suspicion. Nick was huge compared to anyone else. Ben was second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was 5ft 9in tall making his 3 in taller than everyone else. Even Nick. His pecs pushed a little under 2in off his body. His abs were firmly tone and defined 6 pack. His shoulders were broad, but not overly huge like Nick\u2019s bowling ball shoulders. His biceps were about 2 softballs smooched together. His thighs were large, but they were fast. Their size were highly ergonomic. They were built to for speed, and their size didn\u2019t get in the way. His calves were bigger than most for his age, but they were perfect for his height and size. Ben could get a career as a model if he wanted to. Starting right now even. Maybe even porn, but we know he above that. His highly gifted 9in boyhood could full fill those requirements along with his large tennis ball  balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick on the other hand could going into junior body building if he wanted to right now, or porn. We don\u2019t know where he\u2019ll go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other kids were all in the middle. They could go either way depending on what puberty offered them. They saw Ben and Nick enter and were shocked to see their exposed bodies for the first time. No one talked about a certain organ, though they thought about it. \u201cWhen did Nick get so huge? We all grew, but Nick\u2019s massive. Ben looks about the same size as before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick decided to stop the questions. \u201cThere was a truck that exploded. It gave off some type of energy that made us grow. I was at the front door, and took most of the blast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started to mutter about why they weren\u2019t at the front door at the time, and then someone got smart. \u201cThen why are we naked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBecause the energy caused all of you to grow to tremendous sizes for a short time. When you fell asleep, the majority of the energy dissipated into the air there by shrink you down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids tilted their head in a confused manner. \u201chuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cYou shrank in your sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot of \u201cAhh\u201d and \u201cI get it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled and tossed blankets at everyone. They all caught their blanket more of less. They covered themselves in the blanket. While in there, we found that none of the boys were gay. Funny\u2026 you\u2019d think there\u2019d be at least one. Maybe they\u2019re just to young for the idea to cross their mind. Well what ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cOk\u2026 so I suggest that we all go home and try to explain this to our parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded and went home in their makeshift clothing. Ben was laughing on the inside\u2026 the boys were trying to make sense of the situation, but they all gave up. \u201cNick\u2026 want to sleep over at my house? We\u2019ll find a way to break the news to your parents. My will be ok with this, so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick though about it \u201cSure\u2026 let me call my parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou may want to raise the pitch of your voice a little. Your voice is a little deeper now that you grew. You kind of skipped the awkward voice change faze. Unlike me. Gwen wouldn\u2019t stop laughing for a week. Though I\u2019m good now.\u201d Ben\u2019s voice is a little deep, but it will get deeper later on. Right now, it\u2019s the right octave for his size making him even more appealing to the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cThanks for the tip. Does my voice sound that much deeper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo so much, but enough for there to be a difference. Maybe you can tell your parents that you were dared to talk in a lower voice. They\u2019ll believe that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick called his parents and did just that. They said ok for him to go over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They say Nick and Ben, so they waved them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAsk gramps. We wanted to tell us something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all turned to Gramps \u201cIt appears that the orb made from the size of other organisms is like a battery. When I fired it at Nick, it stopped suddenly because the pearl that formed was depleted. It shrank down to nothingness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked down \u201cSorry. So you can\u2019t get it tested now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled and patted the huge Nick on the head \u201cIts alright. We can make another one from muscle donors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at Gramps like he was crazy. No one would want to give up their hard earned size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cTrust me. Some people just keep growing, and can\u2019t stop. They want to get smaller, but we all no that the process can be rather difficult. This ray will make it easier for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI meant aliens!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they all let out an \u201cOhhh\u2026 it makes sense now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFACEPALM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell. What the plan guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNick\u2019s coming over my place to stay for the night. We\u2019re going to break the ice with his parents later tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen decided to sleep over at Gwen\u2019s place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk them\u2026 I\u2019m going back to the Rustbucket. You know how to reach me, so bye.\u201d Gramps walked away leaving the kids alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen squatted down ready to give Amy a piggy back ride home. Amy hopped on and they waited to Seth and Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Gwen saw what Amy and Ben were doing, and they looked at each other. Nick and Gwen\u2019s faces turned a shade of red. Nick slowly kneeled for Gwen to get on his back, and Gwen was about to get on, but said no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThanks, but I have a way home. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was a little hurt inside, but said \u201cWhere just friends\u201d Repeatedly. Over and over and over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAre we ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded, and Ben ran. It looked like he had vanished. Nick was barely able to keep up. Plus his bulky legs kept getting in the way. Gwen vanished in a flash of purple light. They all appeared in front of Gwen\u2019s home. Ban dropped Amy off, and said bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night at Ben\u2019s house, Ben and Nick were in Ben\u2019s room. Comic books scattered all over the place. Posters hanging on the wall. Video games jumbles together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gasped \u201cYour room! You seem so organized and clean in school, but this is\u2026 is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed before Nick could finish. Suddenly, his room was all cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cWell soooorrrrrryyyyy\u201d He said sarcastically. \u201cHow about those ideas to breaking the news with my parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cLets sleep on it.

With each passing heart beat, their muscle inflated to astronomical sizes. Even Nick for some reason. All the boys grew to the size they were before they had shrunken down. The sound of cracking bones and splintering beds filled the night. Soon mother screamed at the discovery of their giant children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was in an XL sleeping bag, but even that was getting to small. His already huge body began to grow even larger! His three inch pecs grew inch by inch as though all the growth he got from the ray was becoming uncondensed. He inched taller and taller. His arms and legs grew longer and thicker. His penis swelled to s mind numbing size. When we had done growing, he had torn through his sleeping bag. He was curled up in Ben room because it no longer fit him. He was at least 20ft tall now with unknown masses of muscle. Since he was all curled up, who knows what his true size is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on that night, Doctors were called to visits homes of enlarged kids for testing, etc. Mothers were crying, and fathers were trying to comfort them. The kids were all excited over their growth. Older brothers and sisters were horrified to see the people they bullied become the bully\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smelt and awful smell. Its like someone took condensed morning breath and shoved it up his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAww! what\u2019s that smell!\u201d Ben looked about and was horrified to see a giant hairless dick floating over his head. \u201cAHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woke Nick up. He tried to move, but he felt constrained \u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d He opened his eyes to see his arms wrapped around his head. They hurt painfully because his biceps were being crushed in towards each other. \u201cAHHH! It hurts. What happened. Why is everything so small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI don\u2019t know! You grew!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cNow what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought for a moment \u201cI\u2019ve got it. Go inside your watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at his wrist which as right in front of his face. He was so glad to see that his watch grew with him. It seems that gravitum truly is one of the greatest things in the universe. Nick stuck out his tongue and tapped the watch at the center. It flipped open slamming Nick on the nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cOuch\u2026\u201d then a small blue light shot at Nick, and sucking him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw Nick get sucked into his watch and was releaved that he actually still had his watch. Ben walked over to it on the ground and picked it up. There was a slimy substance on it. \u201cEww\u2026\u201d Ben held the giant watch away from his body and walked outside. Ben tapped the center and let Nick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant preteen materialized. He was actually 35ft tall with pecs that just out 5ft. With cars for calves, and buses for thighs. His biceps were 7ft in diameter. He was 20ft wide from shoulder to shoulder. His mythical 10 pack was so deep, you could stuff your whole arm in, and not touch the back skin. Not to mention if penis which was 12 ft long with balls that were 3ft in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gasped at his size \u201cWow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stood at his fullest height admiring his tremendous size. He stood over every house in the suburban area. Off a few houses down, he could see a group of huge boys playing basket ball. Their new sizes made the game even more fun until one of them smashed the hoop from his weight while doing a slam dunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cIt seems that that the people we shrunk didn\u2019t stay that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t know why I grew though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gave a quick answer \u201cProbably because the synthetic pearl wasn\u2019t a real one. Your compressed muscles only stayed compress for a short while, then it expanded until you got to this size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded, but he was still slightly confused \u201cSo what now? We have the same problem as yesterday, but its even worse because they\u2019re all awake, and everyone has seen them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026\u201d Then Ben though\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took out his plumber badge and called Gramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cMax Tennyson.

Just follow me. Can you ran at that size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shrugged \u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick removed his medallion and Nick turned the dial on his giant watch. They were gone in an instant. So were giant preteen boys all over town. Even at his new size, he had trouble keeping up with Ben\u2019s speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, all the kids appeared in a warm and comfy building at the base of Mt. Everest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all panicked \u201cWhere are we? What just happened? How\u2019d we get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had just woken up that morning, and he wasn\u2019t in a happy mood. \u201cBe quiet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone fell silent as they all turned to Ben. Some kids smirked when they all saw Ben. He was tiny in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largest kid there said smirking \u201cReally? How are you going to make us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen rolled his eyes and then sighed \u201cBecause I asked you to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t want to. You\u2019re tiny. You couldn\u2019t stop us if you tried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and disappeared and reappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid that was talking was still smirk when he fell to the ground. Then a surge of pain burst out from his gut. \u201cAH!!! It hurts. What just happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWill you be quiet now? I\u2019m not so reasonable in the morning, so if you cooperate, there will be less moaning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid \u201cBen! What did you do! Did didn\u2019t even move! No one is that fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and was about to say something. Nick stopped Ben and said \u201cLet me handle this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stepped forward. No one saw him because he was behind a large door. He stepped out of the door way. \u201cOk boys\u2026 you want to be quiet now?\u201d Nick said this while cracking a few knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys gasped at Nick\u2019s tremendous size. He looked freakishly big in their eyes. His body was huge, but he had a tiny head stuck at the top. Some of them wanted to laugh, but they knew what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid said \u201cHow\u2019d you get so big! Its not fair. I was suppose to be leading this group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Ben and everyone else raised and eyebrow \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid looked around and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cBen\u2026 this kid needs to be put somewhere out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid turned pale \u201cOk. Ok. Ok. I\u2019ll be quiet! Just don\u2019t do what ever you\u2019re talking bout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile \u201cThere we go. Aren\u2019t we all reasonable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the kids nodded frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk good. Now who wants to know how they really grew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was surprised. He Hadn\u2019t known what Ben was going to do until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys were curious. \u201cWasn\u2019t it that truck thing Nick was talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo. It was me and my orb.\u201d Voices began to rise, but Nick gave a loud cough and the room fell silent again. \u201cOk\u2026 the story starts here.\u201d Ben recounts only the important parts of what they would need to know in order to believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid from the start began to laugh \u201cHah! Growing orb? Aliens? Yah\u2026 and I\u2019m a Gerston from planet Gif.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at the kid with eyes of hate. The kid saw this and felt as though fiery hot pokers were stabbed though his soul. He back up behind a couple kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat is your name kid\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid was pale and nervous. He was sweating all over his naked self \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cIts ok\u2026 I\u2019 just want to know your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid stuttered \u201cS-s-s-s-s-see-seee-seee-seeett-seeeth-Seth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI see\u2026 Seth\u2026 Do you want to know what I did to the last person who acted just like you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cN-n-n-noooo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Nick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smile \u201cHe knocked me senseless. it\u2019s a lot worse than it sounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cThanks Nick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cNo problem buddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cSo\u2026 what happens now? Are you just going to suck up all our muscles again? won\u2019t they just come back like today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019ve got a more permanent solution. I know I sound mean, but as you all see. Seth has let his muscle get to his head. I\u2019ll be willing to compromise with you all. I\u2019ll take away all your bulky muscle, but I\u2019ll help you train to get them as you grow. And this includes you too Nick\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed disappointed, but he understood. It was for the best. At least he can keep his back up growth. Its just a turn of a dial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cHow are you going to take away our muscles? You think we\u2019ll let you. We\u2019ve kind of bonded with them in the past few hours.\u201d Seth had a sneer on his face along with another couple hundred boys. There were about 300 boys in the perfectly white room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBecause I can knock you all senseless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cHa! You verses us? We\u2019re an army!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed. They just don\u2019t understand. Smaller doesn\u2019t mean weaker. It means that they are strong enough to face the larger world. \u201cOk then\u2026 Who is siding with Seth. Please step to the right. Those who don\u2019t really care go to the left. Those who don\u2019t know what is actually going on step in the far back. The kids moved apart. About 50 boys moved to the left, and 50 went to the back. The other 200 or so went to the right \u201cOk\u2026 do you guys want to keep your muscles even if you need to fight?\u201d When he said that, a couple dozen boys moved out of the group and went into the center. \u201cThe rest of you want to fight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smirked and raised an arm \u201cHOOHA!\u201d (Corny\u2026 I know\u2026 I\u2018m sorry!) the other boys raised their arms in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cThen fight\u2026\u201d With that, the boys charged Ben. Strange what can happen to boys when they get greedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys all had their hate and anger focused on Ben. They loved their bodies. Suddenly, Ben vanished, and they all fell forward. It took a moment, but their brain recognized the pain in their gut. The room fill with yells of pain. They were all down for the count.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He reach into his pocket for his medallion, and he went inside. While inside, Ben was shocked to see that he had fallen into an ocean the size of the universe. Ben felt his density sky rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe instantly lost himself. His pants tented immediately and just before he exploded, he had enough sense to remove his pants and briefs. The moment those were off, Ben was sent into growth induced pleasure. Ben was sent to the brink of near madness. He was conscious, but he was also asleep. He was feeling pain, but it was covered up in pleasure. Oh the paradoxes! The moment he entered the liquid, the pressure buildup instantly. In seconds he began to orgasm. He didn\u2019t even had have time to grab his engorged shaft. Incalculable amount of cum was sent to the ends of this universe where it collided with a wall. It continued to build up, and seemed to never stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, new stars and planets formed. However, they formed in the middle of an ocean, and they immediately exploded releasing huge amount of energy. Products similar to the supernova of the Green Star were produced by the millions. Tiny crystal stars spotted the universe waiting for the ocean to disappear. Planets erupted into tiny pearls making fireworks in the liquid sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, Ben was still absorbing the liquid. The ocean seemed to never abate. Slowly, though (At least in this universe. Time moved differently. 100 years hear could equal a second on earth. Who know! Though, it should stay relatively close) For the next 36 hours, Ben had now stopped pumping out his young juices into the green universe. Slowly, the ocean of green energy abated, and the stars and planets stopped exploding in showers of energy and pearls. Soon, the last drops of the liquid was sucked into Ben\u2019s body. He stopped cumming, but his dream kept going. His amazingly wonderful dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe floated in his universe for an unknown amount of time, but when he came to, he saw a dazzling display. There were crystal gems floating everywhere! They sparkled with unrivaled beauty. Ben couldn\u2019t speak. Ben looked around, and saw that he still had a hard on. Ben distracted himself for a moment, and that too went away. Ben looked around again until he saw his orb. Odd\u2026 it stopped making that liquid. At least for now. Ben floated up to it and saw it flash green for a second. Then Ben\u2019s ocean of white hot cum rushed down towards the orb and was gone in a sec. It carries with it the products of the planets and starts. 6 pointed crystals and pearls. All of this entered the orb Sending Ben into deep pleasure once more! But his reserves had dries out once again, so nothing but pleasure came out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, Ben was panting from the feeling. Its amazing that Ben has been able to abstain from such activities. Ben got close to his orb and saw that it had changed once again. It now looked like a completed universe that was still growing and adding more to itself. Things were moving, and flashing and exploding on the inside. Like the outside universe actually does. Ben was amazed by the orb and then he realized that it wasn\u2019t complete. There were still sections missing, and sections waiting to be added. It will never be done adding to itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then realized he had a mission for coming here. He walked up to the orb and asked it to do something for him. They were tied together, so he knew it would do what he asked. He asked it to return the boys back to their regular sizes. Though, he let Nick be at a larger size than before. He wanted all the boys the exact same size in every aspect. The orb flashed once and it was done. Ben then turned and floated towards his pants. Then after those were on, he floated towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the orb, Ben had been gone for about 5 minutes. In those 5 minutes, Nick had a lot of fun. All the preteen muscle head got up and charged at Nick. They wanted to stop Ben from coming back through the medallion. The punch and kicked, but Nick didn\u2019t feel a thing though his armed hide. Suddenly, all the boys began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick knew why because he felt it to. They were all shrinking. Then suddenly, Ben popped out of his medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw all the selfish boys crying on the ground. The other boys on the side were a little sad, but they shrugged it off. They were still bigger then they were a week ago, so they were fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery boy was made 5ft 1in tall. With a skinny build. Their bodies looked like clones of each other with variations in skin tone, heads, hair, etc. They had the 'normal' 10-11 year old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept Seth who was now 5ft 9in like Ben with the exact same build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile at Nick \u201cNow there will be fewer questions. Just say you\u2019ve been growing for a while and had hid your growth spurt under a lot of baggy cloths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled at Ben. He would have hugged him, but decided to give his a hand shake. \u201cLets stay professional. Like gramps would say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. The he felt someone grab his neck. It was Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cGIVE IT BACK!\u201d His face was red with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen lost his temper now. He took of this medallion and punch the floor with a fraction of his strength. The ground was instantly turned into fine sand. All the boys froze where they stood. The ground wasn\u2019t solid anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had let go of Ben and was crawling back out of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen began to walk up towards Seth. He got up real close. When he was right in front of his face, Ben said \u201cBoo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth curled up into the fetal position and started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk\u2026 Nick\u2026 want to help me bring them to Gramps? I want to wipe their memory of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded \u201cSure</span></div></div>",

Lets go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ben felt a sudden shock, and pain enveloped all his muscle. \u201cAh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick crouched down toward Ben \u201cWhat wrong! Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen didn\u2019t hear Nick through the pain. He felt the orb\u2019s energy surge through every vein in his body. As though that liquid it made was being made directly in his body now. Their connection is so strong that they are practically one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was shocked and nervous. He had no idea what to do. All he did was yell and hope \u201cBen! Dude! You\u2019re going to be alright!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and the other kids were watching their captor in shock and some were happy about it. Seth smirk \u201cThat\u2019s what he gets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ben starts to glow green. At this moment, Ben\u2019s brain blocked out the pain. It was just to much. Ben could think clearer than before and see thing that he never saw. He sat up and looked at all the boys. He saw the hate in a couple of boys, and fear in a lot of the other one. Ben knew that something was about to happen, so he got back into his medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got in just in time. The tiny opening closed, and then Ben exploded in a flurry of green lights. The feeling was somewhat pleasant. Its like he was full of air, and now it was seeping out of his body. He felt the pain and tension ease away. Then the feeling was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen opened his eyes and was shocked by what he saw. In front of him were stars and planets as far as the eye can see. Out towards the ends of the infinite universe, he saw a strange sputtering of green lights. Ben thought about being near it, and suddenly the universe moved around Ben. It brought Ben closer to the strange display of light. Ben was surprised to see his orb. It looked like before, but now flared of green energy were escaping from it. Suddenly a huge flare shot out. It was huge, and made any other flare seem ant like. The flare shot out at unknown speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt his body burn again. He started to glow green and his he could feel the pressure build in his body again. The energy from before was flooding him. Ben bent over from the pain it caused once again, and it slowly faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the orb and saw that the huge flare had gone away, and the small flares had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat was that!\u201d Ben was shaking from the pain. He floated towards the orb and took a closer look. He saw that all the stars and planets were gone. Now it was just one glowing green ball of light. Its like there was to much energy inside and it was all compacted together to make one super star!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw tiny cracks appear on the surface where the flares escaped. Then at the same time, the cracks healed up. Suddenly, all the cracks healed, and the pressure inside began to build again. Ben had a feeling he know what would happen next. He felt the energy in his body build  up to the brink again. Then he bent over in pain, but he was getting a little better at handling it. He looked at the orb even though it hurt him to do so. He saw a tiny crack form, and a flare of energy escaped. Ben felt the tension in his body go down until he returned to normal. That tiny crack separated into more tiny cracks that healed instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen went up to the orb and grabbed it. Suddenly, a bolt of energy surged up his arm. Ben tried to let go, but he couldn\u2019t. Ben tried to move, but couldn\u2019t. Suddenly, the python in his pants started to shoot up until it poked out of the top of his pants. Ben started to panic. There was no pleasure\u2026 like his body was fighting him. Suddenly, both hand grabbed the orb and held it out from his body. Then his arms slammed the orb onto his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked. What just happened? Then suddenly, it got weirder. The top of his penis began to enter the orb. A surge of energy jolted up from his mighty shaft sending him into a frenzy of pleasure. The pressure in his balls began to build and build, but it never stopped. Ben looked at the orb and saw it growing dimmer. It seemed like it was emptying out its excess energy. His penis was sucking it up at a painful price. The pressure in his balls was to much. Ben started to moan in pain. He kept humping the orb trying to find any form of relief. Then suddenly, the orb had finished filling Ben with its excess energy. Ben felt the flood gates in his body collapse and the mighty body of fluid surged forward. Enough cum was shot out to fill this universe. The orb grew a greenish white as Ben\u2019s white hot seeds filled it. And still it didn\u2019t stop. For days, Ben was at the brink of fantasy and reality. Nothing was real to him. He kept going and going, and didn\u2019t stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, it stopped. Ben regained consciousness and looked down at his orb. The orb had detached itself from Ben\u2019s still diamond hard shaft. Ben looked at the orb warily. Out of fear and desire. He wanted to go through it all over again, but knew he had other important responsibilities. He saw that it now acquired a strange glowing pulse. Ben touched it, and he felt it beat in rhythm to his heart. He saw it pulse a green wave of energy with each beat. It seems that the orb had stabilized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, due to Ben\u2019s recent consumption of the liquid, and the orb having absorbed a huge amount of stars and pearls, the orb had began to overload. It was trying to process all that energy, and find a way to use it. Ben felt the effect of it changing. Then when he came into the medallion, by bonding with the orb (and giving it a universe sized amount of DNA), he made the process faster and more permanent. So next time, the orb can now handle such experiences. There by resulting in less pain for Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen held the orb in his hand and saw a drop of liquid form at the top and fall on his hand. He saw it get sucked in, and that new stars and planets began to form. However, that was it. It seems that more liquid is required to make Ben fall into that state once again. Though, with each \u2018event\u2019 the liquid gets more and more potent. Ben left the orb where is was and realized new stars and planets were still forming. The liquid the orb made was no longer appearing on the surface as much. All of it was being sent right into Ben\u2019s bloodstream. Thereby making more stars and planets. As he turned to leave, the stars and planets collided and release energy, etc. It was now a crazier universe. Ben turned and left. He looked for the exit and found it, but it had changed. Instead of the Omnitrix logo, it was now a moving picture of the universe he was in. He tapped the center, and it flashed green. Ben appeared on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cYour back! Are you ok? What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow long was I gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cHalf an hour. The boys are all going crazy. Seth started a riot. I settled it though. You know\u2026 with the watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cOk\u2026 I see.\u201d he thought about how time had really changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat now? All the boys that were making trouble are unconscious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ben decide?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Didn\u2019t you want to brainwash them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah, but now that I think about it, they could be of more use. I\u2019ll cut them a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the boys that didn\u2019t care about losing their muscles were listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNick\u2026 can you help me move the unconscious boys into another room? I want to talk to these boys that didn\u2019t start a riot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded, and moved all the boys out. Then he came back \u201cWhat now? I put them in the room next to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and looked out towards the other boys \u201cOk\u2026 since you guys didn\u2019t start a ruckus, I\u2019ll make a deal with you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys were wondering what Ben was talking about \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think that you guys will have better control over yourselves and your muscles. You guys didn\u2019t mind losing them right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen were iffy. Being big was nice, but it wasn\u2019t necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you guys a test run. If I think you can handle that much power, and use it well, then you can keep that body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and everyone else was astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWait? You\u2019re giving them back their muscles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded. \u201cWell\u2026 some of it. They can get more if I think they deserve it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys were excited, but calmed down. They were excited, but knew that if they got to eager, Ben might not offer them the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo\u2026 yes or no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tapped his new medallion and it released a flash of green light. It passed through out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the boys were significantly larger.<br>\r\nBefore<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft 1in<br>\r\nWeight: 100lbs<br>\r\nMinor description: Unimpressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow<br>\r\nHeight:5ft 5in<br>\r\nWeight:160lbs<br>\r\nDescription: These 10 kids (Yah\u2026 a lot of them hated Ben, and tried to stop him for what he was going to do) were at the top of the food chain. They stood at least half a head taller than kids their age. The could pass off as freshmen or sophomores in high schools if they had dressed up. Though, their heads still had they youthful appearance. They had a build that was larger than most kids their size, but they were still smaller than kids that worked out seriously. Their pecs pushed 1.5in out, they had a nice 6 pack. Broad shoulders, relatively developed wingspan, softball biceps, nice sized thighs that didn\u2019t rub against each other. Their body was built for speed, however, there was a thin layer of fat. The fat didn\u2019t look like fat. It made their bodies look bigger, but not hard. Theirs a difference between strong looking/strong, and hard looking (as in they are so tone that you can see every muscle fiber). They all looked strong, and were strong as well. Their appearance was not to hard, so it gave them a friendly aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey boys exclaimed \u201cWow\u2026\u201d They preferred this size. It seemed more normal than before. Before, they were just to huge! They were above human, and they felt alone. However, now they were able to participate in society, and they were more ready to take on life. Due to their larger build. They all thanked Ben in one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were murmurs on the other side of the wall. \u201cLook! They\u2019re gone. We\u2019re alone.\u201d Then one voice was heard above the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cOk guys\u2026 listen up. Ben took away our muscle, and I bet we can get it back. Some how.\u201d No one sounded confident. They saw what he did with the floor. \u201cThat floor thing he did was probably a trick. Even that green light, and everything else was a trick. However, our muscles were real. Now our gift is gone, and we have to get it.\u201d Seth continued to talk and gather people\u2019s hopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, Nick and the 10 kids were listening curiously. They were slightly disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cThey won\u2019t learn will they\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10 kids \u201cHey\u2026 we can try to get them to change their minds. Since you helped us a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cReally? You think you can take on 291 people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 kids \u201cYah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned to Nick, and Nick nodded \u201cWe can always help if they get in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cOk\u2026 you can do that, but what are your names?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10kids said \u201cPeter, Zak, Henry, John, Zeke, Keith, Ralph, Paul, Kevin, Jake\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen knew all these kids from school, but they only saw each other in the halls and stuff. No personal connection. \u201cNice to meet all of you. Lets go say high to out delinquents on the other side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shouted \u201cWoot!\u201d They were excited from the prospect of helping Ben since he can make them bigger, but they also thought that Ben would make their life more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other room, All the kids were gathered around Seth listening to his words of praise and power. All the kids were ready to go and attack Ben for what belongs to them. There is strength in numbers (they believed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doors opened, Ben and 11 naked muscle preteen entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cLook! Some kids stayed with Ben! They are ditchers and traitors. Get them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n290 naked boys ran towards Ben and his 11 followers with raised arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen yelled \u201cStop!\u201d He said it so loud and fiercely, that all the boys froze. Some tripped. From behind, Seth was fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cDon\u2019t stop! Look! He isn\u2019t fighting back. Its because he can\u2019t! He can only yell at you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys picked themselves up slowly. Some began to run, and this caused other to join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed again \u201cYou guys can get them now. I\u2019ll keep an eye out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the 10 boys were more than happy to join the fight. They wanted to prove that Ben hadn\u2019t made a mistake in giving them this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10 boys were faster, agiler, and stronger. They punch and kicked boys in the stomach just hard enough to make them fall to the floor, but not hard enough to main them. They did this for a while, but they soon began to tire. The larger mass of boys began to gain the upper hand and surround the 10 boys. They were about to smother the 10 when Ben stepped up. Everyone froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned and his face was hard \u201cEnough.\u201d Ben stepped up and disappeared. He reappeared next to Seth, and all the boys collapsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was still standing. He felt Ben behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou are worse than Nick was before\u2026 However, I\u2019ll give you a chance at redeeming yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was in turmoil on the inside. No one is that strong. Its just not possible. How can Ben do this? Seth turned around suddenly and threw his hardest punch at Ben\u2019s chest. His fist hit the soft tissue of Ben\u2019s pecs, then he had impact with the hard muscle beneath. Spikes of pain shot up Seth\u2019s arm and hand. \u201cAh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was slightly disappointed. \u201cOk guys\u2026 Lets get these people to Gramps.\u201d Nick nodded, and everyone vanished from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was in the Rustbucket watching inter galactic television when he heard a loud thud outside the vehicle. Gramps looked out and saw naked boys scattered all over the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock, and Gramps opened the door. He saw Ben, Nick, and 10 relatively large preteen boys. \u201cHey Ben. Who\u2019re your friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cThese 10 behind me are Peter, Zak, Henry, John, Zeke, Keith, Ralph, Paul, Kevin, and Jake. I\u2019ll explain more later, but for now, can I borrow a device than can erase certain memories?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWhat for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAll the boys on the ground are rather violent ever since I took away their muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYou mean they grew again, and then you shrunk them some how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026 But not they teamed up and tried anything to grow again. Kind of like how Nick was before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s face turned red from the sudden attention, but that quickly passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cSure you can borrow the memory erase, but I\u2019ll be using it though. it\u2019s a complicated instrument. We\u2019re dealing with the minds of living things. A lot of stuff could go wrong if done inadequately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cCan you just erase their memory of ever growing?\u201d Then Ben whispered \u201cIncluding the 10 behind me. I\u2019m giving them a test of character.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded, and took out  strange device with a helmet attached to it. Gramps walked up to all the boys and erased their memories of the recent event. When Gramps walked up to the 10 boys and held out the helmet, they were a little nervous, but knew this was part of the test, and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that, the boys\u2019 brains began to rearrange their memories to make sense of how their bodies changed. It even tampered with their past a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The parents of the 10 were satisfied. They still worried at what happened to them, but now they weren\u2019t abnormal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at school, everything went on as usual. Ben talked to kids to see if the brainwashing had worked. Most of them said they want to work harder to get a bigger body. The atmosphere was cheerful and not tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one kid that stood out from the rest. Seth stood to the side frowning. He saw Ben, who was a good friend, but for some reason he felt angry at Ben. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Seth pondered for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLater one, there was a school fitness test. All the boys had the exact same results due to the fact that they all have the same body strengths. The 10 boys that were helped by Ben did a lot better. They even cheered the other kids on, though the 10 boys hung around each other more than they did around the others. Its seems that they had formed a work out group a few years back, and have been working out together ever since. And of coarse, Ben and Nick got the highest results, though\u2026 Ben beat Nick since Ben knew how to manipulate his body better. Nick was ok with this. He\u2019d be working 200% to beat Ben eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, everyone that wanted to work out went to the gym. There was a faint musky smell, but other than that nothing was wrong. Though, the girls felt a faint desire to do something naughty. As usual, Ben can Nick went through their routine and then helped out the other kids. Then the 10 entered and did their routine. They followed Ben and Nick\u2019s example and helped everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for several months. (Now look... a lot has happened, so I think its only fair that we move on to Summer.  Like really?We have giant muscle 11 year olds! Time must move on.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the last day of school\u2026 Nick, Ben, and the 10 were hanging around with a bunch of other kid outside. The school had a traditional picnic event after school, so the gang went out into the fields and had lunch, etc. This wasn\u2019t mandatory, but most people did it because it was a nice way to enjoy the start of summer. Amy was sitting on Ben\u2019s lap, and they joked around. Everyone knew that \u201cThe couple\u201d were starting to heat it up a bit. Though they just pretended not to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut at the border of the area was Seth. He had learnt to deal with is strange mood swing when ever he saw Ben, but he still didn\u2019t know why it happened. He left the picnic early, and went for a walk. Out no where, a black van parks in front of him, and lowers the window<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA middle aged man appeared and said \u201cHey kid. Do you know where Ben Tennyson is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt his face grow hot from anger \u201cWhat? Why do you need to meet him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan \u201cHe did something to me that I can\u2019t forgive. Its time he pays up\u2026 But what ever. Its none of your concern.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt a connection to the man. They boy hated Ben, but why did he hate Ben. \u201cTell you what\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you where Ben is if you can tell me why I hate Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan smiled knowingly \u201cOk\u2026 Maybe I should show you instead.\u201d The man had been looking for ways to get back at Ben when he recently stumbled his old benefactor. The benefactor gave his a disk to show to Seth. \u201cBut any way\u2026 before I do that, I\u2019ll let you know my name is Ken. Now if you would look at this screen.\u201d Ken took out a small screen and showed it to Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn it was the room in which Ben had hid them all, and stripped Seth of his huge muscles. As Seth watched, his eyes said one thing, and his memories said another. When it got to the exact part where he lost his muscle, a door opened in his mind. Seth began to remember. He grabbed his head from the pain the mental recall was producing. \u201cAH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sat in his chair very professional like and waited to Seth to calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Seth got up and looked his body over. \u201cI hate him even more than before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cOk\u2026 that good. Now direct that anger to someplace of use. I can help you. I have a little machine that will help you grow bigger. Even bigger than before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt his greed consume him, but he still had room for reasoning. \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not a fake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cHow would a fake have this type of footage? How would I know to look for you? How would I know the source of Ben\u2019s strength, for it was this source that grew you. If you want to know more\u2026 then you have to make a choice. Follow me to learn and grow, or stay behind in anger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth didn\u2019t spend a moment on thinking. He jumped into the back seat of the dark van, and it drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ben looked down and saw his medallion glowing. \u201cThat\u2019s odd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat up \u201cWhat wrong?\u201d Then she saw the medallion \u201cAh\u2026 the orb? Do you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shook his head \u201cNo\u2026 I think I should go check out what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned, but nodded. \u201cBe quick. Remember\u2026 you promised me a movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. He had gotten his first pay check from his job with a moving company. He was being paid relatively high since he was fast, though he had to work under the table and receive only cash. He was to young to receive an actual check, or job. \u201cOk. I\u2019ll remember. Besides\u2026 its odd. When I go in the orb, I\u2019m in there for days, but when I come it its been like an hour or less. Anyway\u2026 I should get going\u201d Ben tapped his medallion and he vanished in a flash of green light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Ben looked around was amazed by the size of his universe. It had more stars and planets than the real universe. Ben looked around for a bit when suddenly, he saw strange lines of energy floating around this universe. He watched until he recognized them. They were similar to the orb, and the stars and planets were in the same place as the orb. It appears to be that the orb was in a copy of itself. Ben looked around for the orb until he saw it a few feet away. He went out and grabbed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, their was no liquid on the orb. \u201cWhy Isn\u2019t there any of the liquid on it this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if to answer his question, the orb flashed once. Suddenly, a gushing sound appeared behind him. Ben turned around just in time to see that a galaxy sized river was headed right at him. What he though had been lines of energy floating in space was actually a river of the fluid. The orb made the fluid, but it didn\u2019t appear on the orb. The very universe is saturated in energy. The only reason it doesn\u2019t explode is because (1) It grows infinitely, and (2) the energy gets converted into a stream of fluid. The orb simply emit\u2019s the energy now, and nothing more. The fluid passes through planets and stars quickly causing them to explode in a flurry of energy, crystal stars, and pearls. However, the planets and stars appear faster than they are destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the wall of fluid had hit him with enough force to destroy a couple hundred galaxies. Ben was able to withstand it thanks to his strong body. Time seemed to freeze for Ben. He knew what would happen next. And it did. Like a splash of arctic water, Ben was instantly showered in pleasure. He felt his penis fill up with blood instantly, but now he was powerless to even take off his pants. He felt every fiber in his body thrum to the feeling of pleasure. All he could do was rub and stroke his penis through his super stretch pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he exploded. His pants instantly filled with enough cum to fill a galaxy in a second. You could here the seems of the strong material beginning to reach their limits. Then, to the pants relief (if they were alive), the cum shot up there by shooting his pants right off. Like a rocket powered by white hot cum, it shot at near light speed. Ben hadn\u2019t even realized it was gone. He was gone and lost in pleasure. This fluid that was entering his body was billions of time more potent than before. It has been getting more and more potent with every passing moment ever since Ben last left. Which was a long time ago. Ben was simply laying in a universe of fluid while releasing his young hot seeds into the void of the green universe. All the while, billions of stars and planets formed in the fluid. They were instantly energized there by causing them to explode into crystal stays and pearls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crystal stars provide structure for the orb to allow it to handle all the energy while the pearls provided the energy. The cum that was absorbed allowed everything to connect together and work. It was the glue and bridge for the energy in the crystal. It also helped the orb develop new properties that help it handle all the energy and provide structural benefits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next week or so, Ben let there in a chaotic solution of energy and cum. His penis was engorged more so than ever from the abuse it was being put through. It had grown another foot just to handle all the pressure. Then the rush of cum slowed down to a trickle. Ben\u2019s engorged cock turned flaccid and was at its previous size. Ben was exhausted. That the was longest and hardest one yet, and he enjoyed every moment, and hated every moment. It felt amazing, but during that time, he had no control over his body. He could think clearly now, but how couldn\u2019t act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a prisoner of his own body. Be moved slowly, and he sped up a bit as he regained control over his body. Ben sighed \u201cI don\u2019t know how I felt about that.\u201d Ben looked at the orb and saw it flash. Suddenly, they universes (that means multiple universes) of cum rushed at the orb stabilizing it for the rest of eternity. Ben had stabilized the orb pretty well the last time, but this time, a more permanent solution was made. Now the orb will act out less because of built up energy. When all the cum was gone, Ben looked at the orb and saw that it was slightly bigger than before. It had encased itself in several atom think shells that will help it produce and convert the energy into something useful. Ben tapped the orb, and felt the solidness of the shell. He knew that even he could not break the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen left the orb there in space to do its business. Already, Ben saw streams forming in the universe, though they were less potent. They will in crease in potency over time. Ben looked for his pants and was surprised it was a couple light years away. He had the universe move the pants to him, and he put it on. They looked the same as before. They had shrunken down to their proper size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then turned to the exit. He tapped the tiny doorway, and he reappeared outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYou back! That was quick. You\u2019ve been gone for a few seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cReally? I thought it was a few days\u2026 Then again, things move faster in that world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cSo that movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled in return and they walked toward the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away, a strange ship was approaching earth. Ben\u2019s orb had not made those shells just to be able to handle energy, but to also handle more of the \u2018original\u2019 planet. Something is come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looks like it was hit by an asteroid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen frowned \u201cIts all his fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth knew who he was talking about. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed \u201cDo you know a kid named Nick? He should go to your school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cYah. I know him. He was like Ben. Had insane strength, but I could tell he was infinitely weaker than Ben. Why is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cLets get inside. It\u2019s safer to talk there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth made a questioning face \u201cWhat do you mean inside? Its all caved in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled for the first time \u201cJust that lab under the building. I came up the idea of having a lab near the lab. No one would think to look where I hid this one.\u201d He walked over to a group of plain looking trees and he moved around  a bush and waved for Seth to come over. Under the shrub was a well hidden hole. It was dark and cavernous. \u201cAfter you.\u201d Ken said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWait me? I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s down there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cIts my other lab. If no machines are need for an entrance, it makes it harder to find with technology.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled \u201cSmart\u2026 But I\u2019m not going in first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d He started to walk forward when suddenly he grabbed Seth and pushed him into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth screamed as he fell. Then his fall turned into a slide. He went looping and turning everywhere. He popped out with a slight thud on top of a memory foam bed. He turned and faced the exit. \u201cWait till I get my hands on you! If you were here \u2026\u201d And the rant continued. Then realization dawned on him. No one was coming down. \u201cDude! Where are you? When are you coming\u2026\u201d Seth couldn\u2019t finish because he saw a screen on the side turn on, and another, and dozens more. Arrows began to appear and move in a certain direction. Seth followed them until they stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, he had just stepped on top of a giant X mark. One screen turned from an arrow into a face. Ken was on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cSorry for the wait, but I had to hook my computer up to the lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was fuming \u201cI don\u2019t care! Why on earth did you have to push me down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cCause you wanted to grow right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth nodded \u201cYah, so that doesn\u2019t justify anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cWell be prepared. In 10 - 9 - 8 \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWait what are you counting for?\u201d He was silent. He heard a humming, and a green light appeared in 6 direction. In the front, back, left, right, above and below him. \u201cWait stop! What are you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201c2 - 1... Fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth saw his life flash before him. Everything moved so slow he thought. His brain was running even faster than before. All he could do was watch the green beam head straight towards him. All he thought was \u201cI\u2019m going to die now. Why now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the void never came. Instead, his eyes opened instantly from the energy surging through his body. He felt his muscle rip, and heal, and stretch repeatedly, He heard his bones crack and heal, and lengthen. His body was developing at hyper speed. The feeling started out pleasant, but as the energy continues to burn through all his cells, he began to feel pain. He couldn\u2019t even scream! He just sat there and grew, and grew, and grew. He felt at one point that the walls began to close in on him. He was quickly filling up the small space that was left for him. The pain began to increase when suddenly it was reduced. He was shrinking down, but he still felt himself growing. For the hours, he had endured, but he eventually passed out. Who knows how long he\u2019s been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Seth came to, he was in his room. It was morning and the second week of summer \u201cWas that all a dream?\u201d Seth looked around and went about doing his usual morning routine. He saw a not on the fridge \u201cSorry Seth. We\u2019re out of town on a business conference. Food money is on the table. See you on Monday. Love mom and dad.\u201d Seth read the note and smiled. He had the house to himself for the weekend. He went back to his room to let the video game binge begin. When he came in, he saw an envelope that he had missed earlier. It was for him, but no return address. He opened it \u201cHello Seth. Its was not a dream. I can prove it. First off, you\u2019ll need to play the CD enclosed. Sincerely Ken\u201d Seth looked in the envelope and found a CD. He put it in computer and ran the short film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA picture of an arm growing hugely muscle appeared. That was the logo. Then that vanished. Seth watched and saw a long presentation of Growthium and all of its abilities. He learnt that it came in the form of a pearl and stuff. Then he discovered that Ben had the largest one. It was his source of strength and power. Seth smiled because he now had a goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo bad for him, he doesn\u2019t know about all the difficulties in acquiring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the presentation on Growthium, a film on how Seth\u2019s body began. It showed that he had grown far to big during the process yesterday. His body would have been reduced to pulp if it had not started to compress itself. So this leads to the knowledge that his body is really dense, but he can control his size with practice. Then it said that if he was not compressed, he would be equal to a few Earths. In order to prevent his strong gravitational pull from killing him, there is a gravitum particles injected into his blood stream. They are harmless, and they gave him the ability to store things by touching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, it told him to just simply practice growing. However, it warned him that he should not go over board. \u201cWe can not afford to have Ben discover that we have acquired more Growthium. Our supplier will not give me anymore. So try not to grow beyond a believable size when you are traveling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth nodded to no one in particular and went out into his back yard. He stripped down to the skin and then imagined himself bigger. He felt a warmth spread over his body. He felt his body stretch and grow and length. He went from 5ft 1in to 6ft the 7ft. His .5in pecs went to 4 then 8in off his body. His faint 6 pack grew more defined and multiplied. It turned into extremely deep 8pack. He was 3ft shoulder to shoulder. His biceps were watermelons. His thighs were so huge they spread the legs apart. His caves were live beach balls. Even his penis was engorged beyond normal proportions. A whopping 3ft long with over grown cantaloupes for balls. The boy had the body of the kind of pro body builders. He dwarfed any person he stood next to. Ken started to giggle, then laugh. It built into a roar of joy that echoed through the neighborhood. The laughter was a deep bass sound. It should the very earth. Seth started to move, but realized that so much bulk was put on a small frame that he could barely waddle let alone walk. He couldn\u2019t even see the ground in front of him. There were to giant pecs blocking his view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth though of growing taller until he was 9ft tall. At this height, he was still HUGE, but not he could actually walk. Or waddle/walk. Then he yelled to the world \u201cLook out! Seth\u2019s Back and bigger than ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he let out another round of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ken was in his lab. He had left the address in the envelope. There was a knock, and Seth stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was smiling \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was in his basement lifting weights. He didn\u2019t stay in shape by just working out at school (at least not his minimum). While Nick wanted to lift light weights for a lot of reps to grow \u2018big\u2019, Ben worked on really heavy weights for fewer reps to be smaller, but several times stronger. He however, also did yoga and endurance training there for, he can lift heavy weights for a relatively large number of times. Though he chooses not to. He likes to be strong with out all the bulky muscle in the way. Anyway, he was lifting a lot. After working out, he took his shower off all his sweat. He had ran his usual 10miles with his hour of yoga. He even started to do hand stands and practiced walking around like that. He wanted to try running with a hand stand in order to train his arms for endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower, he walked over to Amy\u2019s house to fix the electrical problem they seem to be having. While he was walking, he heard a voice in his head \u201cHelp!\u201d And then he began to feel a little uneasy. He felt his stomach turn a little. He knew something was wrong with Amy, and he bolted for her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, he saw a stream of smoke leading away from the house. Someone had taken her. Ben ran though the front door (like through it. It was not even open) and went to Amy\u2019s room. He saw a note. He groaned when he ready it. \u201cNot this again!\u201d Ben looked up and saw the hole in the ceiling. He jumped out the window and began to bolt for the facility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the collapsed building and wondered why he was back here. Then he heard Amy\u2019s voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Ken has me again. I don\u2019t know where I am. I think I\u2019m underground though. Another person is working for Ken now. He is even stronger than Nick is I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk\u2026 its going to be alright. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cPlease be careful. They have this thing\u2026 I don\u2019t know what it is. Some kind of gun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what it is. I\u2019ll stop it before it gets you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIts not for me. Its for you. I overheard Ken talking about it. Another person with this really deep voice was asking questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI see. I\u2019ll there soon.\u201d Ben looked around trying to find out where Amy was. As he walked, he sudden felt a pull downward. Be knew that she was right below him. Ben began to dig at the ground. The dirt flew into the atmosphere incinerating itself as it shot up. Ben got to the bottom in an instant. When there was no more soil or bed rock, he had fallen a couple hundred feet to the floor. It seems like he has fallen into an old cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Look out! Behind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned around, but not fast enough. A red beam shot at him locking him in place. He couldn\u2019t move at all, but he could talk. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chuckle in the gloom of the poorly lit cave. \u201cHello Ben. So nice to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen snapped his head to the right and saw Ken. Ken looked the same as before, but now he had developed a crazed smile. It was full of greed and hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen chuckled \u201cYou know very well what I want. Your growth orb. I do believe it has changed since last time. It produced a liquid a little while ago right? Yes\u2026 of coarse it did. My benefactor gave me that piece of information from his own studies. Yes\u2026 yes! I\u2019ll be with him soon. Studying along with his greatness. With access to all the materials I need. Oh yes\u2026\u201d Ken sounded like deranged maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen getting frustrated with Ken, and tried to move and get Amy out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen started to chuckle again \u201cCan\u2019t move? Well I can help shed some light on that. The red energy enveloping you is blocking and redirecting the signals your brain sends to your muscles. Thus making it impossible for you to move. Hah! Once again, my genius will prevail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned and struggled even harder. \u201cAt least let Amy out. She has nothing to do with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cYes she does. It\u2019s the only way to keep you under control. I\u2019m taking no chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ben heard in his head \u201cHelp!\u201d Ben turned to face Amy again and saw that a large man in a ski mask was covering her mouth to keep her from talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man \u201cHello Ben. Its nice to big isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDo I know you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man \u201cBen\u2026 that hurts. Don\u2019t you remember? It was you who took away all my muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it for a moment, and realized \u201cSeth\u2026\u201d Ben\u2019s tone was filled with acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed and pulled off his ski mask \u201cThat\u2019s right and don\u2019t forget it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBut why? How do you remember\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cYou have Ken to thank for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s was silent for a moment. Then his voice croaked as he swallowed his pride to ask \u201cCan you let her go.\u201d Then he thought to Amy \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t protect you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy yelled in his head \u201cThat wrong! The only reason that Seth is restraining he is because that red beam couldn\u2019t even touch me. I can even tell that If He tried to hurt me that the heart stone would protect me. I can just feel it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth frowned \u201cWhat was that? You girl is in danger. don\u2019t you feel worried?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed causing Seth and Ken to feel nervous. \u201cYou will never hurt her no matter how hard you try because I will always be there to guard her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth frowned and lifted his arm to strike Amy in defiance against Ben. As soon as his hand went above his head, a white bolt of energy was emitted from the heart stone that attacked Seth. Seth flew 30 ft before he landed with a crash. Then a moment later, another bolt shot at Ben causing the red energy around him to disperse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen\u2019s face was of shock and turmoil \u201cNO! I was so close. Wait. Its not to late.\u201d Ken rushed for a red button next to him and pressed it. \u201cMaster! Get the girl! I have failed, but you may still succeed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Ken in shock and then back at Amy. There was a loud hum and then a white beam broke through the ceiling and surrounded Amy. She was being sucked up by the tractor beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Look out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned and looked behind himself. A giant fist was swung at him causing him to fly into a red net of energy. The moment he touched it, he was immobilized. \u201cAH!!!! Let me go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth limped over into Ben\u2019s field of vision. His whole body was covered in soot from burnt patches of clothing. Also, his cloths were ripped in several place. He had grown in order to punch Ben in spite. \u201cSay good bye to Amy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt his anger rise. He let out a yell as he struggled against his bonds, but it didn\u2019t work. The signals weren\u2019t getting to his limbs. He saw Amy slowly disappear through the hole. \u201cAmy! I\u2019ll come get you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI doubt you be going anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was in a corner rocking back and forth giggling. The shock of Ben breaking loose ad drove him mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at Ken defiantly. He inhaled and let out a yell as he stroke to break free of his bonds. He saw sparks shoot along the red web of energy as they redirected his electrical signals. Seeing this, Ben worked even harder. The sparks grew in numbers until a never ending stream of energy was flowing out of Ben, and still Ben continued. Ben was nearing his limits. Any normal prison would have no hold against him, but this was unique. He had to send so much energy through it that it would cause the web to lose stability and dissipate. Similar to what the heart stone did. Though it is tougher for Ben since he has to over load the whole web, and not just one single point like the lightning bolt. Ben was about to give in. his weariness was taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth staring at Ben as he tried to break loose. He was shocked. How can his brain send so many signals that it causes the whole web to jolt like that? Even I couldn\u2019t do that. He can\u2019t be stronger than me. I have to be more dense than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt his vision grow darker and the static on the web began to go down. Ben was about to give up when suddenly he saw a picture of Amy in front of his eyes. This gave his a single burst of energy out of desperation. He gave this one all he had, and overloaded the web. There was the sound of humming birds when the web overloaded. When it exploded, you heard small pop sound followed by a lot of crackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen fell to the ground with a thud panting. He felt a shock from his medallion and he felt reenergized. He got up and looked around. Ben looked up and saw that the lighting in the room was brighter. It seems that the energy the Ben redirected was used to power the web itself and the other machines in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth yelled \u201cHow!\u201d then he ran to swing at Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Seth \u201cI don\u2019t have time. Go away or you\u2019ll get hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth laughed while still running \u201cMe.. Get hurt? I\u2019m size of 3 earths compressed together. You can\u2019t beat me.\u201d Then he got close to Ben and landed a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt the impact, but no pain. All he heard was a loud crunch. \u201cI\u2019m going now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was on the ground clutching his hand. It was bleeding. He\u2019d broken several fingers. \u201cHow!\u201d He yelled, but his voice fell on no one\u2019s ears. Ben had already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben jumped up the hole made by the tractor beam and shot up into the sky. He saw a large spaceship moving away. Ben saw it and started to run towards it. When he was under it, he jumped and broke through its hull. He searched every nook and cranny until he found the command center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, he saw an enemy he though had gone to the Null Void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax \u201cHello Ben\u2026 Its nice to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cVilgax\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax \u201cWell\u2026 I see your manners haven\u2019t changed. Anyhow, I had a guest, and I\u2019m treating her with the utmost care.\u201d Vilgax points toward the side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was sitting in a chair inside of a red bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought \u201cBen! Be careful. The bubble is a bomb. If I sit up, it explodes. If you touch it, it explodes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at Vilgax \u201cLet her go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019m warning you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax let out a strange alien chuckle \u201cI don\u2019t think you will. For you see\u2026 I have 99.99% of the original green planet on my side, and I\u2019ve been devoting every ounce of spare energy my generators produce and sending it though these precious pearls. I believe that I am a fair match against your muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He felt the orb react to the information, but it couldn\u2019t sense the pearls. They must be hidden by some type of material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t try\u2026 I sealed the Growthium crystals away. They are still increasing my strength as we speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax laughed \u201cMy family always had them. I inherited them the moment I got out of the Null Void.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought for a moment. SO it has to be in something that relates to his family. What can it be. It also has to be made of Gravitum to keep him from causing hard to anything he touches. Ben looked and stopped when his eyes saw a silver crest with Vilgax\u2019s races\u2019 face on it. That\u2019s it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax \u201cAs you know Ben\u2026 I\u2019m reasonable. Lets say\u2026 you give me the orb, and this all gets left behind. If you don\u2019t, then I hope you have fun seeing your mate dissolve in 999 molar hydrochloric acid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gasped \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even exist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax chuckled \u201cIT goes if you mix in a little bit of Gravitum. Yes\u2026 Gravitum\u2026 such an amazing metal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought to Amy \u201cGo inside your heart stone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax continues to rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI can not give it to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax sighed \u201cVery well. Good luck finding a new mate.\u201d Vilgax snapped his fingers/tentacles, and the bubble popped. Then he started to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s voice was quiet \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax had expect what happened next. Ben charged at Vilgax at near speed of light, and Vilgax reacted just as fast. Ben punched and Vilgax blocked. They went back and worth at this. It kind of looked like a DBZ fight. However, Ben had the advantage of size. Hiw was just as strong, but less bulky. Ben was more agile, and quick on his feet. Eventually, Ben found an opening and struck, and then again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIs that ll you\u2019ve got? You and your planet of pearls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax let out an enraged yell \u201cDo not toy with me boy. I\u2019m a force to be feared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cRight\u2026 sure you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax roared and sped up his attacks. In his anger, Ben had slipped though his guard and plucked the crest off his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk.. This is getting boring. Lets finish this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax let out a breath of air. He got ina position that said \u2018Yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen hid the crest in his pocket and got ready to charge Vilgax. Then they ran. It looked like they vanished and reappeared on the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen clutched his stomach. There was a bruise that began t form there. Ben went to his knees and let out a cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax chuckled \u201cI told you\u2026 I\u2019m a force not to be reck\u2026\u201d Vilgax didn\u2019t get to finish because he fell down from the sudden burst of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to chuckle and walked over to where the bubble was. He looked for the heart stone and picked it up. It looked totally fine and unscathed. Ben felt the acid on it tingle his skin, but not go through it. \u201cI better neutralize this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen ran off the ship and went home. He opened his fridge and took out the baking soda, and dropped the necklace in it. There was a lot of bubbling and hissing. Then it stopped. Benn took the necklace out and rinsed off the baking soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought \u201cAmy. You can come out now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought \u201cReally? I think you should come in. This place is awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cOk them\u2026 I\u2019m going in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tapped the heart stone, and it sucked him in with a beam of white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his eyes cleared, he saw a white universe with countless white stars. IT was almost blinding to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cHey Ben! This place\u2026 I\u2019ve never been inside. I totally forgot you could store things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled \u201cNo everything Is going inside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 I think we should get out. Time moves differently in this universe then in ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cReally? Oh! Like how you were in yours to a week but it had only been a few seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cExactly.\u201d Then Ben waved we toward the floating pearl. \u201cLadies first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smile \u201cWhy thank you kind sir.\u201d Amy tapped the pearl and was sucked out.

Then Ben saw that the air seemed to compress around the ship. Vilgax doesn\u2019t have any Gravitum on him! His gravitational pull is going to suck everything in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen ran up to the ship and jumped in. When he got to the command center, he saw Vilgax, but he was coated in metal and junk. Then it started to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax faced Ben \u201cYou will pay for this Ben Tennyson. Return my family crest to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUm\u2026 no. Now please leave earth. Oh! And catch.\u201d Ben tossed a tiny piece of gravitum at Vilgax. He threw it so fast that when it landed on Vilgax, it broke through the pieces of metal and junk and permanently attached itself to Vilgax\u2019s skeletal system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the air seemed lighter, and a groan was heard. The ship began to feel like it was falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax \u201cWhat have you done! My ship!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSmile. You did it actually. Your gravitational pull was making it implode. Its funny. My gravitational pull would have obliterated the anything with in several light years. Yours was barely enough to get past this ship. Well got to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVilgax \u201cNo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen ran off and just before he jumped off, he set him self right ender the hull, and pushed off. The ship and himself were sent in opposite directions. Ben rushed at the Earth, but he caught himself. The sip flew into space with a newly created dent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was running up \u201cBen! Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026 I\u2019m fine, but we should tell this to Gramps. Gwen might want to come to. Can you caller her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and began to phone Gwen. She said she\u2019d be at gramps in an instant. \u201cShe already there Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and squatted down to give Amy a piggy back ride. Amy got on and Ben ran. The appeared at Gramps instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was shocked by their appearance, and spilled his lunch on the ground. \u201cI should be used to this by now, but why do you always come at unsuspecting time?\u201d Then there was a purple flash of light, and Gwen appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNothing yet. Vilgax came back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Gramps \u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah. He got out of the Null Void. I don\u2019t know how. But even worse, he had 99.99% of the pearls of the original Green planet. He had been pumping every joule of energy he had in his generators though the pearls. He was hard to beat, but I did it. We were evenly matched, but I had an advantage. I wasn\u2019t as bulky, so I could move faster and I was more agile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBack in space.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps and Gwen let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen wondered \u201cDid you get the pearls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think so.\u201d He took out the crest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps gasped \u201cThat\u2019s his family crest. It was fought over for centuries until Vilgax\u2019s father claimed it once more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cReally? Vilgax inherited it once he got out of the Null Void.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cInteresting. I\u2019ll have to call the plumbers on this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSo what about the pearls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh right!\u201d Ben tapped the family crest to see what was inside and was shocked by his discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he see? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben stuck his head in and he gasped at the size of the mass of pearls. Even the pearls were bigger. \u201cGramps! Why are the pearls bigger than normal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWhat? Come out here. I can\u2019t here you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pulled his head out and told them what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThat\u2019s peculiar. Maybe because he sent so much energy thought them that they absorbed some of it too and got larger. So you said the planet was about a couple thousand earths, and its made of all pearls. Though the size might vary from normal size to base ball size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYes. That\u2019s right. So, should I absorb them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cProbably. We don\u2019t want people to get their hands on these. It could be catastrophic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAlright then. I\u2019m going to go this in my world though. And gramps\u2026 can you explain to me why the green stars and planets were appearing in my universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI think because that orb had permanently linked itself to that area of space. I think its better that way though. Its better that they appear in there, and not out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded, and tapped his medallion. There was the flash of green, and he was inside. It looked the same as before, but he knew the drill now. He took off his pants and went to his orb. He found it a few feet away and then he opened the crest. As soon as it opened, the orb flashed green. Ben felt it call for the pearls. Then as if on queue, the pearls surged out. Ben let go of the crest as he felt his hard on come. He looked expectantly as the rivers of energy flow straight at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure washed away all sense of time and feeling. Ben moaned and stoked himself unknowingly. As the energy entered him, and the pearls of the original entered the orb, Ben received a dose exponentially greater than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime froze for Ben he could have bee there for days, months, or years. He could not tell. The only thing he could do was think and watch as his engorged penis shoot back universes of cum per second. It had to grow and lengthen itself inn order to not get torn apart. Now at 3 ft long and 6in in diameter, it was a water pipe of a penis. His balls had grown to medicine balls in order to keep up with demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this was how Ben was for the month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trickle of pearls began to slow to a stop, and the ocean of energy soon vanished. Ben was slowly returning to his senses. He looked forward towards the orb, and saw it had changed once again. The orb had like two sections now. The inner section was the same as the original, then the outer section had relatively larger dots orbiting the core like they were guarding its precious cargo. Ben was mesmerized. Then he saw his orb flash once, and all the cum Ben had made inward toward it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt the orb beat in rhythm to his heartbeat once again. He felt the changes the orb went through. Those dots were the \u2018original\u2019 pearls, and they helped generate energy, and keep it stored inside. They were permanent stabilizers for the orb. Ben looked around and saw the rivers return, but even faster. The practically grew to their previous size in an instant. Then they were getting denser and denser. They kept their volume, but it was becoming extremely potent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said goodbye to the orb, and put his pants on, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash, and Ben appeared outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen\u2026 that was fast. You were gone only a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cReally? I couldn\u2019t tell how long I was in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked Ben over and saw he was a little taller, and his hair was longer. \u201cI\u2019d say a month. Looks like you grew an inch and gained some more muscle. You\u2019re hair is definitely longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked Ben over and saw what Gwen said was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy worried \u201cDoes this mean he won\u2019t live as long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 it seems that the more time he spends in there, the less time is passed over here. Reverse logic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThen I shouldn\u2019t go in there any more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded \u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t think I takes that much away from you, and plus! You get healthier every time you go in, so it could potentially lengthen your life time moer than it reduces it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy said hopefully and looked at Ben \u201cMaybe only when you need to? Not to often ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cSure. I could do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled a little then decided to joke a bit \u201cBen needs a hair cut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen freezes. \u201cOh no\u201d he mutter so only he can hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled and whispers to Gwen \u201cWhat style?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to creep towards the door to run. To bad he already put his medallion back on. Gwen had encased Ben in purple energy to keep him from moving. When he wasn\u2019t sealed, he could get away, but now he was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen walked up to him with a comb, brush and scissors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNow Ben\u2026 don\u2019t squirm. We might mess up if you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled and looks at Gwen knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt like they were talking. \u201cWait! You two are talking in your heads. When could you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at him slightly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWe can both use mana, so when our manas are touching, we can talk. Actually, because the heart stone\u2019s mana is so large, I can practically talk to Gwen anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked. Then the girls started to walk forward. Ben continued to struggle, but then the purple energy encased the lower half of his head. Not he was immobilized. This reminded him of when he\u2019s having one of his \u2018episodes\u2019 in the medallion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Gwen released the energy. \u201cThere. Done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAny, I never knew that you could use a tooth pick on hair like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cLets say it took a lot of wigs to get it right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was sprawling all over the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cJust look in the mirror\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps, who had stayed said \u201cBen\u2026 your hair looks nice. Just give it a look see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned and faced a mirror and was shock to see his hair. It was like before, but now it had a curve to it. It looked stylish, and the wax (not gel) gave his hair a natural look. Ben groaned in defeat \u201cGirl!\u201d He said it like it was a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen laughed, and gramps did to. Ben couldn\u2019t help but smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Didn\u2019t you already deal with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHe met Ken, and got all his memories back. I\u2019ll go deal with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grabbed his arm. \u201cBe careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cWhen haven\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled in return, but then got serious \u201cDon\u2019t let him through you into space is what I mean. Even you could die if there is no oxygen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was glad that Amy was fussing over him, but reassured he that he\u2019d be fine. \u201cBye. See you in a moment.\u201d with that, Ben clicked the medallion of and he vanished from sight. He returned to the collapsed lab and saw the ground rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep ominous voice \u201cBen! You\u2019ll pay!\u201d Suddenly, the ground shot up into the air and a giant muscle preteen appeared. His waist was above the ground, and rapidly rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen yelled \u201cStop! You\u2019ll wreck the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled and said in his deeper than Bass voice \u201cSo? As long a you\u2019re gone, then I don\u2019t care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDon\u2019t make the same mistake twice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth laughed \u201cMy only mistake was being small. One hit goes a long way, but now it will disperse.\u201d Then he continued to grow larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen knew he wouldn\u2019t stop. Ben couldn\u2019t even see Nick\u2019s face anymore. His cliff like pecs blocked any view of above. As been looked, he saw that Seth\u2019s cock was sticking up as hard as a tree trunk. Does this turn him on? Well what ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had to stop Seth before he gets any larger. If he knocked him over, Seth could do serious harm when he landed. The only way is to talk. Ben ran up Seth\u2019s body until he got onto his pecs. His pecs were about sticking out 50ft and it was like a relatively flat platform. \u201cSeth. Stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled when he saw how small Ben was on his god like muscles. He pecs were big enough for a person to stand on. \u201cWhy would I? It feels so good, and I like looking down at you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to worry. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt a lot of people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cHa! Like I care anymore! I\u2019m their god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it for a moment. So reasoning won\u2019t work. May be I should tempt him. Ben tapped his Medallion and the orb popped out. \u201cHey Seth. Look what I\u2019m holding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s eyes pointed down at his growing pecs. \u201cWhat!\u201d then he saw the orb, and felt his greed and desire spike \u201cGive it to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen taunted \u201cTry and get it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth lifted his arms and tried to grab it, but he couldn\u2019t. His shoulder muscles were so huge that he could barely stick his arms up horizontally. His biceps prevent him from bend his arms but a few degrees. Seth roared in frustration and started to shrink down. When he was small enough to get his arms onto his shelf like pecs, he started to chase Ben around with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen easily avoided the huge, but slow arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth yelled \u201cStop moving! I\u2019m just trying to crush you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled inside and thought \u201cAnd that\u2019s suppose to make me stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth knew this wasn\u2019t working, so he shrank down even more until he had more mobility. Now his pecs were only 10ft out, and He tried but continued to fail. He gave up on being big and shrank down to his fastest size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what Ben had been waiting for. Ben quickly put the orb back in his medallion and tackled Seth to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth yelled in his usual kid voice \u201cGet off of me!\u201d then he tried to grow larger again to force Ben off. However, he felt a sharp pain on his shoulders. Ben was squeezing Seth\u2019s shoulders so that if he tried to grow, it would be forced to stay in one shape. \u201cGet off! Stop that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled at the sudden change in tone. His voice was deep and god like, but now it was small and higher pitched than before. Ben said \u201cI don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth started to cry \u201cNo! Don\u2019t take them away from me again! Please! I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen yelled \u201cLike what? Huh! You were willing to destroy the earth! To kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cBecause you\u2019re selfish! You don\u2019t want to share the power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scoffed \u201cThat\u2019s wrong. DO you know those 10 kids from school who were bigger than the rest? I let them keep their muscles because they were going to do good with them. And don\u2019t for get Nick! He would have ended you! He doesn\u2019t have nearly as much self-control as I do. And even now, I\u2019m struggling to keep it in check. Do you see what could happen if people like you and me were left to do things as we wished?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth started to cry \u201cI don\u2019t care! As long as I keep my muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo! You won\u2019t know how to control yourself.\u201d Then Ben started to pick Seth up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth pleaded \u201cPlease! What if I tell you where the other pearls are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen froze \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth realized he had something to bargain with \u201cYes! I know where the rest of them are. Well at least a large chunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cKeep talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cOnly if you promise not to take away my muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it \u201cNo. I can find them in an instant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth yelled and cried \u201cNo! Never! You Can\u2019t take away my muscles. They\u2019re mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to look at Seth with scorn. Then Ben took a deep breath to calm his ever increasing anger. After a moment \u201cOk\u2026 I\u2019ll cut you a deal. I\u2019ll keep an eye on you. You can have \u2018some\u2019 of your muscles. I\u2019m going to seal the rest away until I think you can handle that power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth froze and realized what Ben was doing and rapidly nodded his head \u201cYes. Yes. Yes! I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let go of Seth \u201cYour test begins now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth stood up cautiously and turns to face Ben. \u201cThe pearls are still under ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cOk. You\u2019re coming with me though.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to get hem yet. Maybe later when Seth was dealt with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth understood why and followed grudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grabbed Seth\u2019s arm and ran back to the Rustbucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang was surprised to see Ben back with Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhy\u2019s he here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said sadly \u201cI decided to sea his muscle until I though he was could handle the power. If we erased his memory, he\u2019ll still hate me subconsciously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was listening and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned to Seth \u201cDo you have any gravitum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth nodded \u201cYah\u2026 its in my blood stream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps raised an eye brow. \u201cThat\u2019s new. I\u2019ve never heard that being done. Then again, Anything is possible with Gravitum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cSo what were you going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen stepped up \u201cActually, its what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen spoke to Amy \u201cI\u2019ll start, and you can help. Since I doubt he\u2019ll be willing to think the requirements, I\u2019ll need more mana than before to alter the gravitum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded \u201cOk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen began to chant and a yellow fog appeared around Seth and get absorbed into his body. Gwen began to sweat from the exertion, so Amy jumped in and supplied the mana. After a moment, the spell ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt his body get heavier \u201cWhat just happened? I feel heavier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWe sealed away your strength. Only Ben, Amy, and I can unseal you. We just need to think of the size that you deserve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s mouth hung open. He though about being bigger to prove he wrong, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen frowned \u201cYou don\u2019t believe us.\u201d she imagined Seth a foot taller, and Seth shot up a foot, but then she imagined him smaller, and he shrank down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWhat just happened. I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThat\u2019s right. We did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth began to shake. He felt anger toward the world. He used to have enough power to make nations cower before him. He could look down upon everything. Even the tallest buildings. Everything had to bow down to him. Now, however, he had to bow down to these three insignificant kids, but he must if he ever wanted to get big again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI think he\u2019s a little cold. He\u2019s shaking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen ran inside and got a blanket and draped it over Seth\u2019s naked body. Seth sat there and did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bye.\u201d He waved his hand and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reappeared at the collapsed lab. He went back down the hole and saw ken was still in the fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cKen! Snap out of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen turned his head in Ben\u2019s direction, but he didn\u2019t see Ben. He kind of looked past Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cKen. Are you still there? Say something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen mumbled \u201cYes master. The orb should follow the boy. The orb\u2026 the orb\u2026 the orb\u2026 Its my ticket to a new lab. Experiment, hypothesize, test and examine. Yes\u2026 just get the orb to him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was listening. He\u2019s gone mad! I wonder I can get him out of it. Then he had an idea. Ben tapped his medallion and the orb popped out. \u201cKen\u2026 look. it\u2019s the orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen\u2019s head snapped upward looking at Ben, then it turned toward the orb. \u201cGive it to me!\u201d He reached out a hand and tried to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pulled it away \u201cSorry. You\u2019ll have to get up to get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stood up and started to chase Ben. \u201cGive me! Give me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSorry\u2026 you\u2019ll have to be a little faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen started to run with all he\u2019s got, but he tripped. \u201cOh! Dang. It got away again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stopped running \u201cKen\u2026 are you ok now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at Ben with more focus. He looked down sadly \u201cI you mean physically, then yes. If its emotionally or \u2018spiritually\u2019, then I\u2019m crushed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt some pity for Ken \u201cTell you what. Have you heard of the plumbers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen raised an eyebrow \u201cYah. What of them? They\u2019re just the dogs of the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled. \u201cTrue\u2026 true\u2026 but I hear they\u2019re making a new lab somewhere in the universe, and they are looking for scientists. Its about the size of the earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cHow much freedom do they have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cThey start out with minimal, but it builds up to near infinite. I think the only limit for the highest rank is no killing. Plus or minus a few limitations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen felt disheartened. His life was nearing its end in a few decades. He didn\u2019t all the time he used to have to work up the ranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cThen again\u2026 if they know someone important then they can jump up to the top depending on how persuasive that person is. And I can be pretty persuasive. Also, Gramps is pretty important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen perked up instantly \u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cI can help you get to the top of those ranks if you promise to use your brain to help the universe, and tell me where the pearls are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled as his hopes relit themselves. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cNo problem\u201d He isn\u2019t such a bad guy\u2026 just a little crazy. \u201cAbout the pearls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKens was to busy think about what he\u2019ll be studying. He subconsciously pointed to a wall on the other end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked down, and saw it was a dead end. \u201cIt\u2019s a dead end! Ken\u2026 are you sure you\u2018re ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cIts past the wall. Just walk through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen lifted a hand and slowly touched the wall. His hand passed through as though it was made of air. \u201cIt\u2019s a hologram.\u201d As his hand continued through, the wall began to buzz. Ben continued until all of him had passed the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side was a small chamber with a hole in the ground. Ben walked forward an saw that the hole was filled with pearls. The pool could fill an Olympic pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gasped once again. He could feel the energy permeate from the up from the pool. His medallion began to glow and flash. It seems like the pearl inside was attacking the entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen knew what would happen next once he opened the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cKen! I need you to do something for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen heard this and walked into the room. \u201cWhat do you need? I\u2019ll do anything I\u2019m capable of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cCan you block a certain feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen nodded \u201cSure. Though the block is only temporary. It is blocked for about a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cPerfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cWhat feeling do you want to block?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is that you tell no one about what is going to transpire. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen raised his hand and swore he wouldn\u2019t \u201cOn my honor as a scientist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cI need you to block the sense of pleasure created during an orgasm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen raised an eyebrow, but knew that Ben had a reason for such a strange request. He went to his storage and brought out a pill. \u201cThis will block the feeling, but the erection and ejaculation will not be stopped. You\u2019ll be able to think as normal though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was glad he didn\u2019t ask why \u201cOk\u2026 I can deal with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen handed Ben the pill and a bottle of water. Ben drank the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt a tingle in his groin, but that ended quickly. \u201cOk Ken. I\u2019ll call my Max Tennyson to come and pick you up. He\u2019ll help you get a position at the lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen called Gramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cMax Tennyson. What can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI need you to come pick Ken up and get him a position at the lab near where the Green Star was. He\u2019s not a bad guy. Trust me. Just a little eccentric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was a little shocked \u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYes. You can ask him a few questions. He just wants to be a devoted scientist for the rest of his life.\u201d Ben looked at Ken to see if he was correct. Ken nodded his head yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cAlright. Why aren\u2019t you bringing him to us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI need a little time to look the place over. It might collapse if I do things wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded \u201cBe careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI will\u201d Then he ended the transmission. \u201cKen\u2026 you should go outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was alone now. His medallion was starting to get hot from the fact that the orb was trying to get it to open. Ben tapped the medallion and it let out a beam of green light that passed over the pearls. They were sucked in instantly. Ben felt his penis grow hard, so he took his pants off. Then he inserted his penis into the medallion, and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ben felt a fluid enter his body though the skin of his penis, and that he was pumping out incalculable amounts of cum. However, he was still in control of his body, so he put his pants on with the medallion still on his penis. Ben walked around and found that it was relatively easy compared to the immobile feeling he felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to do various positions in front of full body mirror to see if it will look odd to have the 3in diameter where his penis had been. They all looked normal. Now the only problem is that he doesn\u2019t have the Medallion around his neck. Ben looked around for a piece of metal that he could shape. He ripped some off the wall and started to mold it. He turned it into a perfect copy of the shape of the medallion. Now he needed to paint it. Ben looked around and found a canister of iridescent green. Ben proceeded to put dots and shapes around the medallion. Ben looked at it under some light. It looked like the dots were moving, and the way he painted. It was so detailed that they could have been twin medallions. Ben put the medallion on his necklace and left the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well\u2026 at least when he\u2019s not trying to abduct me or take something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, everyone was eating ice cream, and Ken was telling stories about how much of a rebel he was in high school. Then when he went to college, that something clicked in his mind and made him realize that he had better knuckle down and get serious with his future. He went to the library in all his free time and studied until he was tired. He got the highest grades and what now. He even joked about mistakes he made and laughed it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was having a good time. Gramps was laughing, but Ben could tell that he was looking for flaws in his character. So far, he had none besides his mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen saw Ben \u201cBen! I can\u2019t thank you enough. Vilgax kept tempting me like a dog. IT was in my grasp, but he kept pulling it away. You sir a good man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I mess with my cousin enough to be bad.\u201d He gave an innocent smile at Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked away and displayed a little attitude \u201cHm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps whispered to Ben \u201cI think you were right. This guy is just obsessed with science. He\u2019ll do anything to do science.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDid you talk to that lab?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cYah. They\u2019re considering it. I think they\u2019ll say yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Thanks Gramps. I appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps winked and went back to talking with Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wondered \u201cKen. It seems that you lived at the lab? I doubt it\u2019ll be warm with a hole in the ceiling. Where are you going to stay for now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen paused and thought \u201cI don\u2019t really know. Until I get that position at that lab that Ben talked about, I guess I\u2019ll stay in a shelter to a week or two. I don\u2019t have any money since Vilgax funded my whole operation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was shocked \u201cNo! I won\u2019t stand for that. A genius like you can\u2019t be in the streets or anything like it. Gramps\u2026 can you do something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps fiddled with his spoon \u201cWell\u2026 I guess I could put out a set of sheets where your bunk beds were, and have him stay there. That is if he is willing to do the dishes while he stays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen laughed \u201cDeal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAlright!\u201d Then Ben remembered something \u201cWhere\u2019s Seth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opened \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned toward the entrance and saw Seth. He looked at Ben sadly \u201cI was think. You know\u2026 about what I did, and how I felt. It wasn\u2019t right of me, and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for taking Amy. I\u2019m sorry of attacking you\u2026 though I doubt I could hurt you, and I\u2019m sorry I got greed. Even after all this, you still had it in you to give me a second chance. Can you all forgive me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy smiled and looked at Ben expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked down as he thought \u201cYes, but not now. You had a bad start, but you can always redeem yourself. Ask me when you think you\u2019ve changed for the better. And prove it to me with your actions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps nodded approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled \u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s more that I hoped for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen smiled. At least Ben was willing to forgive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ben said gravely \u201cBut I you ever mess with my girl again, I\u2019ll make you wish you never asked for forgiveness. Do you here me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth saw the truth in Ben\u2019s eyes and gulped \u201cYes sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen broke into a smile \u201cSir! Yes\u2026 I like that, but its to old for me. Just call me Ben. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cYes sir-- mean Ben!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAlright! That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about! Lets make a fire and have some smores.\u201d Ben walked past Seth and burst outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was standing at the door way shocked and then he smiled. He new that he just passed one of Ben\u2019s personality tests. \u201cIs it me, or is he more out going than usual?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen, Amy and Gramps were looking at each other confused about what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen called from out side \u201cWhat are you guys waiting for! The fire is roaring! Someone bring the marshmallows!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen smile and got the chocolate, crackers, and chocolates. Seth was still confused, and Gramps was just smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps said to himself \u201cI love my grandkids.\u201d Then he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, they all came to the decision of stay over at Gramps in the woods. They called their parents to get the \u2018ok\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the boys and girls separated and picked opposite sides of the campfire to stay on. Seth and Ben fell asleep instantly. Gwen and Amy chatted for a while. Then they heard a deep moan and the rustling of a sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat\u2019s that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI don\u2019t know, but its coming next to the boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cShould we worry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNah\u2026 they\u2019re to dense to get hurt. I\u2019m more worried for who ever wants to attack them. If they try to bite, they\u2019ll break their teeth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cYah. Goodnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ignored the moaning and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Ben had fallen into deep sleep and found himself in a dream. He was floating in his universe and he was immersed in pleasure. He was stroking and pumping his hard on. Strangely, he felt his penis grow in his hands, and inflate beyond any known size. It grew and grew until it was even bigger than him, but still it grew! 10ft 20 ft 30 ft. It still kept going. Then it started to pump itself and convulsing as it released dimensions of cum. And it still grew! He had grown a mountain of a cock. It was hundreds of miles long and still growing. He was dwarfed by its size. Now lets not for get his balls. They are about 200 miles in diameter. The universe filled with cum in a fraction of a second and burst up into an abstract space. But even that was filled! It kept bursting from space to space until Ben woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen jolted up gasping and panting. It was early, and no one had woken up yet. Ben looked down at his groin and he felt the surge of cum rushing through his engorged shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s happening?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben looked at his groin in fear and awe. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Ben got up and went off away from camp. He left a note \u201cBe back soon. Off on walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen went into the forest. When he was far enough into it, he put his pants to his ankle and tapped the medallion. There was a flash and he went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gasped. He was in the liquid once again, but that wasn\u2019t what shocked him. It was his goliath cock! It was shooting a stream of cum that was a few miles in diameter. He penis was indescribable. It was so long that you couldn\u2019t see where it ended. Ben couldn\u2019t even see anything but his giant penis. It was so wide, all he could see was his prepubescent hairs. The sight of this cause his penis to grow even longer and jizz even harder! He\u2019s broken the first dimension of his universe and traveled past into hundreds of more dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next month, Ben endured. The sense of pleasure was not there to numb the sense of time. All of a sudden, at the end of the month, Ben felt a change occur over his penis. It him like a bulldozer. The sense of pleasure was overwhelming. The sense of pleasure cause his penis to grow hundreds of times faster and ejaculate billions of times faster. He\u2019s broken though a few hundred thousand dimensions, and its only speeding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another 3 months, Ben\u2019s seemingly endless reserves had ended. His inter-dimensional cock was immeasurable. His balls filled hundreds of universe. His young boy seeds went far beyond the anything thought possible. Ben was gasping from the sudden absence of the pleasure. His body was convulsing and pleading for more. Then after a few hours, his body stopped fighting him and calmed down. His giant cock deflated at a rapid rate. After a few minutes, it had receded back to its original size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverywhere Ben looked, all he could see was an cum! It filled every nook and cranny of this dimension and googolplex more dimensions! It was inconceivable. Ben looked at the orb and saw it vibrating. It was still processing the pearls it had absorbed a few months ago. Ben saw it flash, and call for Ben\u2019s young seeds. Then a rushing sound came. All the cum from every dimension rushed into this one dimension, and surged into the orb. Ben stared at it for hours, and still it didn\u2019t stop. After a day had passed, the surge had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the orb and saw it humming with power. It was feeding energy into Ben at tremendous rates making him even denser every fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a millisecond. Ben felt his heart race as his strength grew beyond anything he ever though possible. He could tear this dimension apart as easily as he tore a piece of tissue paper! Ben shook from the growth. His body began to glow and energy shot out from every part of his body. Ben began to scream from the pain. Then it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was panting and was on the brink of falling into deep sleep, but for some reason, he stayed awake. He went up to the orb and looked at it. It had changed form. If you stared for to long, you\u2019d get lost in its depth. It not only showed this universe, but all of its dimensions. You saw layers in between layers. Somehow the orb didn\u2019t explode from all this power. Probably because of its glowing sentinels that were streaking across the subsurface so fast that they were practically invisible to all but Ben, but even he could barely see them. They were creating and converting energy into precious products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen some how looked up from the orb and saw that his universe had grown dark. All the stars and planets had been sucked in. Then suddenly, it flared into existence. Stars appeared every where in this universe and all its dimension. The cum had broken all the rules that were made by the wall of this universe. A new rule of chaos was made, and it was no rule. Stars appeared and morphed into odd shapes as the appeared in different dimensions. Some of them were swirls and other were 2D discs. It was an amazing sight to behold. Then suddenly, all the dimension mixed together and became one super dimension. With one controller. Ben! It will end to his will because it was created by him and his cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was breathless. He was practically a god! Ben imagined a ball of energy in his hand and gasped when it happened. Then he called the orb over and it came. It had stopped buzzing and had started to shine brightly. It looked like a perfect crystal. Not fissures or cracks. Just a perfect sphere with unknown chaos inside. The spirals of stars and spheres and every shape though possible was forming inside and exploding into something else. The orb was  another universe and dimension all together. And the one he was in was a copy universe and dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was silently thinking. Thoughts buzzed around. It was tempting to stay, but he knew Amy was waiting outside. Ben materialize a mirror and saw that his hair had grown down to his shoulders and he had gained a couple inches in height. His face was starting to grow peach fuzz. It looked like he\u2019d been in here for a year. Ben though about what he looked like when he entered then suddenly, his hair started to shrink down, and he got a little short and his muscles a tiny bit smaller. He looked exactly like he did when he came in (not including the mountain cock). Ben smiled and looked for his pants. Once he had those on, he left the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash outside, and Ben appeared. He picked up his medallion and saw that it had changed once again! Instead of a one dimension single dimension, it was now several mixed together. The chaos going on inside was infinitely greater than before. Ben looked for a while and then put the medallion back on his necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the sky and saw that the time was roughly the same as when he had entered. Ben strolled back into camp to see everyone sitting around a small fire. The morning air was damp and slightly chilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw Ben and smiled.

Then how it got into his dreams and what happened in his universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWait what! You can manipulate space and time in your universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scratched the back of his head \u201cUh\u2026Yah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked Ben over carefully and sighed \u201cAt least you were honest about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt like something was wrong \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Amy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYou kept something secret. Though, I don\u2019t expect you to tell me everything, I think that would have been important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and was a little nervous \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to know what happens when I put pearls in the medallion or anything of the sorts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was curious \u201cWill it hurt me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNot physically. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll lose some of your respect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned. She thought\u2026 what would make him lose his respect? \u201cI don\u2019t think I will. We\u2019ll muddle though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cWell\u2026 when ever I enter the orb, you know I\u2019m in there for long periods of time. I didn\u2019t want that to happen this time. The reason I\u2019m inside so long is because\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy put her hand ever Ben\u2019s hand \u201cTell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cIts because I fall into a pleasure induced coma when ever the orb absorbs the pearls and other thing created in the universe. Though, it only happens when I go in. However, I only go in when I need to put the pearls inside. But that\u2019s not all. I\u2026\u201d He whispers into Ben\u2019s ear and she just listened patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat there quietly \u201cIs that it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was befuddled \u201cUm\u2026 yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOk. What\u2019s wrong with that. Its not like you chose to. It just happened right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed admit tingly \u201cYes at first, but the temptation started to get harder to resist. The only reason I come back at all is because I have someone waiting for me back outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cWell\u2026 lets keep the medallion to a minimal ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded but frowned \u201cI have to let you know\u2026 there\u2019s this river of energy in that universe and it makes me grow at abnormal rates. It causes intense pleasure, and as more time passes, it gets more and more potent. And it last longer each time. This time, it was about 3 or 4 months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s mouth hung open \u201cThen you made yourself younger by just commanding it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYes. I could probably do it to anyone in that universe, but I\u2019m not sure about this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen jumped in \u201cSo that\u2019s why your mana is different. Though, it doesn\u2019t effect this universe as much. I think you might have minimal abilities. Similar to that of an Anodite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo maybe I can make a ball of light?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cExactly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThen why haven\u2019t I felt anything from the heart stone? I can usually tell when something is wrong. Why not then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI think it because Ben\u2019s medallion contains a lot of dimensions right now. I\u2019m not surprised if the signals your heart stone sends gets scrambles into oblivion on the way to Ben while he\u2019s in there. It must have pasted through a few billion on the way there. Maybe more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSo\u2026 I can\u2019t talk to Ben ever if he\u2019s in the medallion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cMaybe, but it might be difficult. We never know. Something may happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy started to feel weighed down. She could always sense Ben\u2019s presence because of the heart stone. She even learnt a few spells from Gwen, but she wasn\u2019t a serious mana wielder. This morning though, she was scared. The warm and safe feeling that the heart stone gave her had vanished, and came back only recently when Ben had come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt Amy\u2019s sadness through the heart stone \u201cAmy\u2026 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThis morning. I thought something happened to you. The heart stone was as cold as ice. It lost its connection with you and I was scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen realized he caused Amy some pain and walked up to her and gave her a hug. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d (so clich\u00e9)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sniffled a bit \u201cIts ok. You didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019ll try not to do it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy heard him say try, and new that there would be a time that he would be forced to go back into the medallion \u201cOk\u2026 just try\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen realized this was one of those movie moment and coughed in her mind \u201cThis is kind of awkward for me.\u201d Gwen felt a slight loneliness see them so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy let go of each other and life continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seth\u2019s parents weren\u2019t home, so he was good. Amy\u2019s mom was a little reluctant, but when she heard Ben\u2019s name she said yes instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! I think my mom likes you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gagged \u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cNot that kind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had been asleep that morning and had not heard a thing. They had to repeat everything minus the movie moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWho\u2019s ready for smores!\u201d This got everyone to gather around, and eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy remembered \u201cHey guys! What happened to Nick! We haven\u2019t seen him in ages. He must be wondering where we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pulled out displacer badge and dialed Nick. Nick picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cYour alive! Haven\u2019t seen you in weeks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cWe\u2019ve been preoccupied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick got serious \u201cWe? Who\u2019s we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUmm\u2026 Amy, me, Gwen, Gramps, and Seth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSeth! What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cJust stop by Gramps and we\u2019ll fill you in. Ask your parents if you can stay for the summer. All of us are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded \u201cGotcha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, a rather bulky teen appeared next to the fire. There was a black lash of wind that blew up some ember. They started to flow towards Amy and Gwen. Nick saw this and quickly got in the way. His cloths got charred slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cCareful! You\u2019ll set the forest on fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cI doubt that. The air and ground it to damp. Now what\u2019s he doing here?\u201d points as Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was about to explain, but Seth jumped in and told the story. You heard his tone change from anger to confusion and then anger again, regret, and then peace of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded \u201cOk. I\u2019ll take your word for it since the others did to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSo what else is going on tonight? My parents let me stay for a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick did a sarcastic face palm \u201cNothing! That\u2019s odd. I thought we\u2019d head off to the far reaches of the universe or something, but nothing! That\u2019s boring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cWell we just decided to stay for the summer. We haven\u2019t planned anything yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWell ok then! Consider you night full of events now. We\u2019re gonna do something and I\u2019m your host.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone as confused, but then Amy said \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ben laughed and agreed. It was unanimous after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cOk. I propose a set of competitions. Yes\u2026 no?\u201d Everyone agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo what kind of competitions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI say we use our minimum sizes and just wrestle, race , etc. The girls can watch and then they can do something they think will be a challenge. We can each pick an event for all of us to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThat\u2019s not fair! My quote on quote \u2018minimum size\u2019 is like half of both of you. And only a third of Nick\u2019s\u201d I forgot to say that Nick had been working out like crazy and made some serious gains. He looks big, and is strong, but Ben is still stronger in some areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s true. We could give you a handy cap until you start building up your minimum size. Is that ok with you Nick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shrugged \u201cI\u2019m cool with it. What kind of handicap are we talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow about we just let him grow to a larger size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth perked up \u201cThat sounds nice. I\u2019m cool with my body now, but being bigger helps with a lot of other things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought of Seth growing to a larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRECAP ON CHARACTER SIZES<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Minimum Size:<br>\r\nAge: Almost 12<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft10in<br>\r\nWeight: 210lbs<br>\r\nDescription: Considered cute and hot, but people know he\u2019s taken. Ben\u2019s body is built for strength, speed, and agility. He does not build for size, but strength, tone, flexibility, and to impress Amy (He thinks Amy really likes his muscles, but they are not her main focus). His pecs push a little under 2in off his body. His shoulders were larger than boys his size because he worked out a lot. His 6 pack was cut and defined, but covered in a thin layer of body fat which is a totally healthy amount. The tiny layer of fat makes Ben look bigger than he is, but not that much bigger. They make him look less \u2018hard\u2019 and less aggressive. He appears more of the really fit side and appears to be very friendly. His biceps are 3.5in in diameter. His thighs are powerful and thick, but they do not rub against each other when he walks or runs. Ben\u2019s manhood is a whopping 9in long with 1.5in diameter balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick at Minimum Size:<br>\r\nAge: 12 years old<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft 9in<br>\r\nWeight: 230lbs<br>\r\nDescription: Considered \u2018hot\u2019, but can be aggressive. He is built for size and power. He wants to intimidate anyone who wants to hurt him or someone he cares about. His size is his weapon. His pecs push 3.5in off his body (that\u2018s huge!). His 6pack is deeply cut, and you can start to see an 8pack. They are deep enough for you to put half an index finger inside. His shoulders were a little smaller than bowling balls, and his biceps were 6 in in diameter. His thighs pushed against each other slightly, but the do not impede mobility. His cock is 7in long and he has gold ball balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth at Minimum Size:<br>\r\nAge: Almost 12<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft 3in<br>\r\nWeight: 130lbs<br>\r\nDescription: Some girls call him cute, and other say adorable. Seth however wants to be big! He\u2019s been small his whole life and wants to get as big as possible. He has little muscle, so its not worth describing. The reason for this is that he has had little time to work out. The more he works out, the more his minimum grow to match his maximum. Nick and Ben grow so fast because their maximum is influencing their minimum a little bit., but they need to work out for the effect to occur, and even then, their body molds into the shape they want. \u201cThe max only has a minor effect!\u201d, or else Ben\u2019s minimum would be a sky scraper. We\u2019ll have to see how Seth looks in a few months. Maybe by  the end of the summer he\u2019ll be near Ben\u2019s current build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt a tingle crawl over his body and he saw that he was at Ben\u2019s current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThere. You should be able to compete now. We\u2019ll have to shrink you down later because you need to train your minimum. The larger your minimum, the larger your maximum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth didn\u2019t know that \u201cSeriously? I didn\u2019t know that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLaughed. It\u2019s true. Does this mean you prefer to be at your minimum now? It leads to a potentially larger max.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cLets get this over faster! I need to start working out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick frowned \u201cHey! Don\u2019t steal my thunder. I\u2019ll always be the biggest.\u201d then he did this thing with his face that showed sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth laughed \u201cNo what? You can be bigger that me if you want. I just want to get B-I-G Big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy were laughing at the muscle competition the boys were having. \u201cBoys!\u201d Like it was a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWill you stop! I\u2019ll be morning before we start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got their attention and they got serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Running, swimming, and climbing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Ben nodded determined to win. Nick wanted to win to prove he\u2019s stronger than Ben. Ben wanted to win to impress Amy. Though she already like him. Seth just wanted the work out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOnly one problem\u2026 We don\u2019t have a cliff\u2026 we don\u2019t have a body of water\u2026 we don\u2019t have a clear run way.

I can make all of that stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Nick didn\u2019t really care, but Gwen and Amy were a little cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen. Are you sure? Won\u2019t that liquid attack you or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo\u2026 only if I\u2019m willing it to. Which I probably wont for a few years I think. So are we in? We\u2019ll be out in a second anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy finally caved and said yes. Gramps decided to stay outside to keep things clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and tapped his medallion. There was a flash of green, and the kids were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, even Ben, was amazed by this universe/dimension. It was so abstract and foreign, but it was friendly and inviting. Ben\u2019s will to make things safe for the world affected the formation of this world. When ever something exploded, it released energy, but it didn\u2019t hurt if you touch it. Everything was safe. Except for when Ben gets hostile. He\u2019ll do anything to guard his girl, his friends, and his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThis place is amazing! Look at all the shapes and stars!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI\u2026 what\u2026 how\u2026 its\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but its just to awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth felt a tingle from this world, but that was it. Their cells remembered the energy that passed through them, and they were vibrating in recognition. They, however, were not growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat\u2019s this tingly feeling I have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cSame here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wondered what was going on, but then Ben suddenly knew for some reason. \u201cYour body is responding to the energy that saturates this dimension. You\u2019re fine though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk\u2026 now you said you can do thing in here. Care to demonstrate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and clapped his hands. The space around them shimmered and the setting melted into something else. There was a flash of green, and they were at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWhat are we doing here! We were just floating in space!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI created atom out of the energy in the universe and transformed it into what we see. All of this is made by the energy of the orb and my imagination. Though, I think that you guys being hear helped influence the formation of this place. Once we finish, it will disassemble itself and turn back into energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. This proves that atoms and their sub atomic particles are form from the most basic of all things. Energy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled at Gwen\u2019s exclamation. She\u2019s loving the science involved. \u201cOk\u2026 lets start. The we run the track 100 times, go to the pool and do 100 laps, then we climb the cliff I made over there.\u201d Ben points to the side and a cliff began to rise up from the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cAre you mad! Not even Olympic athletes could do al this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The energy in the air reduces your fatigue. This is a good work out for you because you gain all the exercise as though you did this with out the aid of the energy in the air. That way, you increase the size of your minimum a lot faster. That\u2019s the way I designed the playing field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was awestruck. He fell to the ground and began doing push-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at Ben \u201cWhat you said\u2026 its no joke right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled innocently \u201cNope. Its true. Watch\u2026 I bet by the end of this event that you\u2019ve put on 5lbs of muscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was amazed \u201cThat\u2019s a month or two of working out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou might even grow a smidge taller. Though, I think I\u2018ll stay at my size just because I like it this way. I doubt this place will effect me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was jumping with anticipation, and Seth was still doing push ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy and Gwen. \u201cHey Amy\u2026 can you count us off? And Gwen, when we start running, can you take Amy and yourself up to the top of the cliff to see who gets there first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded \u201cSure. I can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled and began \u201cReady\u2026 on your mark\u2026 get set\u2026 go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth, Nick, and Ben were off. Nick and Seth sprinted the first couple dozen and got a huge lead on Ben, but now they were dying. Nick wasn\u2019t used to this type of exercise. He never built his endurance. He just lifted heavy weights for a short amount of time every day. Seth on the other hand has a build similar to Ben\u2019s, but he doesn\u2019t understand it. They exhausted themselves at the start. Ben on the other hand kept a consistent pace and made sure to know how much his limit was. Soon, he caught up with Nick and Seth. They were surprised to see him, so they sped up again only to fall behind again in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had some pity \u201cDon\u2019t run like that. Keep a speed you ca maintain. You\u2019re burning out to fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey listened to his advice and stopped dying in the middle, but they were still relatively slow compared to Ben. Nick had all his bulk to carry, and Seth was\u2026 well\u2026 he just wasn\u2019t used to this body. He isn\u2019t accustomed to it. That\u2019s why Ben and Nick stayed only in their minimum. The more you know about it, they better you can use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 100 laps were up for Ben, and he made his way for the pool. Then Seth came and finally Nick. Ben got 10 laps in while the other 2 were running. By the time Nick came, Ben had 17 and Seth had 9. Seth had learnt how to swim from his grandpa who was an Olympic swimmer. He got the gold. Seth was forced to learn how to swim as a toddler. He stopped going swimming once his grandpa died. Luckily, he didn\u2019t forget all the techniques he learnt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick on the other hand wasn\u2019t fairing to go. He can swim, but not so well as the other two. The run had left him exhausted, but his desire to win over came that. Somewhere in the middle, Seth passed Ben and slowly gained a lead. Nick however was lagging behind Ben by 20 laps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth finished first in this and began jogging toward the rock climbing wall (aka - cliff). It was an imposing half-mile high climb. Practically impossible, but since the energy in the air help them recover from fatigue, they should be able to do it. Seth started up the imposing wall. Ben followed behind quickly. After a few minutes, Nick finally was able to carry his giant bulk out of the water and towards the cliff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is his forte. Even though it required endurance, he had trained his arms and upper body for this type of activity. Ben and Seth had gone up a couple hundred feet during the time he spent swimming. When Nick got to the wall, he began to climb it with increasing vigor. Slowly, he closed the gap between him and the other two. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Its like someone poured molten rock into their limbs, and the magma hardened, and that the rock was trying to give them cramps in every part of their body. Ben was drenched in sweat, but his cloths were dry (Special plumber clothing. Remember?). Nick and Seth weren\u2019t as luck. Nick\u2019s cloths were so thoroughly drenched, you could see his giant pecs flex with every move of his arm. Seth was in a similar situation. However, in all cases, it looked like they all took a shower, and that gallons of water were pouring out of their pores every second. It was like a water fall of sweat. It seems that the lack of water caused their bodies to take fluid from their Max body. That\u2019s how they are able to stay alive with out a sip of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finished was insight for all of them and they climbed with new energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ben, Amy was just around the corner, and he just had to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Nick, he was so close to beating Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Seth\u2026 he just thinks this is an amazing workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10ft - 9ft - 8ft - 7ft - 6ft - 5ft - 4ft - 3ft - 2ft - 1ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all raised their hands over their heads at the same time and they grabbed the ledge.

They can pack a punch\u2026 even when they are sealed. Their bodies are still just as dense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen looked over and saw the 3 boys on the ground asleep and snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBoys\u2026\u201d like a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 they look kind of cute that way.

Since it was a tie, the prize will be split up. Their minimum will grow 33.33% faster than before (at least in this universe because all rules created in this universe stay in here). That\u2019s not all! The triathlon had cause their muscles to tear a lot, so they were repairing themselves to be stronger than before! Based upon what they wanted, their muscles molded to match what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wanted to stay the same size, so it converted all that muscle into pure strength. His new muscles were not compressed into his frame, but they didn\u2019t grow his muscles. He simply got stronger! Now instead of gaining 15lbs of muscle, the muscle can be described as a ghost, and it doesn\u2019t affect anything but his strength. His mobility had not decreased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s body bulked up significantly. He gained a good 15lbs of muscle due to his extensive hard work. Along with the increased muscle mass was strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had shrunken down to his minimum size. However, even that was bigger. Like all people who just started to work out, they beginning contains the largest growth. Seth grew a lot! He gain a massive 30lbs of muscle. I forgot to mention before, Seth\u2019s cloths had been loose since Ben handed him a pair of looser clothing to wear since he had grown. Now the cloths were looser than before, but not as much as you would think. Ben had given Seth a tight build that had endurance and strength, but not so much size. This gives a smaller body, but harder muscles. Now, Seth went against that. He went for all size, and definition. He had a similar goal to Nick\u2019s. His pecs fleshed out, his torso filled up. Everything about his was \u2018big\u2019! He was even bigger than Ben muscle wise. Though, his muscles weren\u2019t as dense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gained the strength of a 15lb increase in muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gained the average size and strength of a 15 lb increase in muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth gained a lot of size, but not as much strength from those 15 lbs of muscle. Maybe that isn\u2019t so bad. It means that they aren\u2019t as dense, so he should be a faster swimmer now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen were talking on top of the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cHey Gwen\u2026 can I ask a favor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSure! Ask away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cCan you show me how to teleport? I feel that when Ben goes away, that there\u2019ll be a day he won\u2019t come back. You know what I mean right? I doubt anyone could beat him physically, but a man can be tempted. I\u2019m worried he might stay here forever one day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen\u2019s face grew solemn. \u201cSure. I think I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Gwen starts to tutor Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day of rest later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sat up with a jolt. He felt like someone had given him a full body massage. He felt perfectly fine compared to how he felt yesterday. Then he felt something was off. Ben looked at the ground around him  and gasp. It was all inclined toward him. He was in a crater! Ben stood up and walked out of his hole. As he walked, something else felt off. \u201cI feel lighter than yesterday.\u201d Ben tried jumping and he was jumping higher than he normally could. \u201cThat\u2019s odd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben was experimenting with his augmented strength, Nick had started to get up. His cloths felt tighter \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Then he remembered Ben saying something about gaining muscle. \u201cIts true!\u201d Nick started to look over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard Nick yell, so he turned and looked at Nick. Ben was shocked to see the dramatic growth. Then he looked at Seth to see if he was ok, and Ben gasped at what he saw. \u201cWow! Look at Seth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked toward Seth and was shocked by what he saw. \u201cHe\u2019s huge!\u201d Seth\u2019s body clung to the fabric of his clothing. His muscles were half as dense, but twice as huge. It looked like he gained 60lbs of muscle and not just 30lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth woke up from all the noise \u201cHuh? 5 more minutes.\u201d Then he started to hit an imaginary alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSeth! Get up. You\u2019re huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth opened his eyes \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He started to rub his eyes and was shocked to see his a giant arm. It was bigger than Ben\u2019s arm, and almost as Big as Nick\u2019s. \u201cOmg! I\u2019m huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was slightly jealous, but he was even more shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen got curious\u2026 only he didn\u2019t grow. Maybe he thought\u2026 Ben punched the ground and saw that he may a tiny indent I the ground. He was a stronger than before. His old strength could never make a hole in the ground. \u201cGuys\u2026 I think I got stronger. MY muscles aren\u2019t any denser. I can tell that. I just simply stayed the same, but my strength is like 2 times stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick went and picked Ben up \u201cYah\u2026 you are as heavy as you look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUm.. Can u put me down? Its kind of awkward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was still engrossed in his muscles when Nick went and picked him up. Nick had expected more resistance, but there wasn\u2019t as much as he thought. He through Nick into the air slightly by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth landed on his knees \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSorry. You aren\u2019t as heavy as you look. I can tell just by how little resistance you body had to begin pulled up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to say your more air than muscle, but its still real muscle. Just not as dense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled \u201cOh well. I\u2019m still huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled inside. \u201cLets see if we\u2019re right.\u201d Ben though of a weight scale appearing, and one popped up in front of Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth stopped on and it said he was 140lbs. \u201cWhat! I look like I\u2019m 170lbs\u201d He looked huge since all that muscle was on a 5ft3in frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYour muscles are probably half as dense as normal muscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys continued to talk for a bit about their changes when suddenly where were waves of white light and energy shooting out from the top of the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, Nick, and Seth looked at each other. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Little did they know, they just agreed to another competition. One of the rules of this universe is that the victor gains muscle. First place got the most, and second got half as much, and third got a quarter as much. If there is a tie for first, it is the average of the amount of muscle gained for first and second. If its tied for second, then it\u2019s the average muscle gained from second and third place. It\u2019s one of the rules that Ben subconsciously made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all started off slow because they were trying to get used to their new strengths. Then as they learnt how to use their bodies, they started to speed things up. Nick had lost a little mobility since he grew, but he made up for it by making long strides with his arms. Nick had the advantage of a light body, but his muscles kept getting in the way. That slowed him down a bit. Ben on the other hand was relatively lighter, had free mobility, and was stronger than he should be. He had the greatest advantage, so he quickly gained distance over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben got to the top, he stood up and smiled \u201cI won.\u201d Suddenly, Ben felt himself get lighter. \u201cWow\u2026 what was that?\u201d Ben had a hunch. He punch the ground again, and made a deeper hole than before. \u201c\u201dI got stronger!\u201d He looked himself over, and saw that he was still the same size and shape. That\u2019s good Ben thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over the edge and saw Nick and Seth neck in neck with each other. They mirrored each other as they climbed. Then they got up here both at the same time and something surprising happened. Nick\u2019s cloths felt incredibly tight. Then a tearing sound was heard. His muscles pushed out even more than before. \u201cWow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth on the other hand had snug fitting cloths. They had been loose, but now they showed off every single one of his muscles. They were more like tights than anything else. \u201cI\u2019m huge! I\u2019m nearly your size Nick! Maybe 5 lbs smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cIt wont matter because its practically air.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled \u201cOh well. No one else knows that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another pulse of white energy. Ben saw it coming closer. Suddenly it passed through his body, and he knew who it belonged to. Ben started to sprint in towards the forest toward the source of the energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Amy floating in the middle of a magic circle. Boulders with symbols were orbiting her. There was a copy Ben standing in the middle without a shirt on with a rather close resemblance. Balls of energy were whizzing around her in all direction. Under her was a pool of water that the fake Ben was swimming in (rather in a slow-mo and dramatic type of way).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw Amy not breaking a sweat like Gwen had when she performed this spell. IT was because the heart stone supplied all the mana. And it had a lot of mana. Like a lot a lot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, all the spells ended and Amy fell to the ground. Ben ran up and caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYou did that on purpose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy did an innocent look \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cFine\u2026 I\u2019ll play along. Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think you\u2019ll have to carry me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and carried her. She felt lighter than usual due to his increased strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy snuggled against Ben\u2019s strong chest and listened to his heart beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen  came out of the clear to congratulate Amy, but saw Ben holding her. She was happy for them. Then she pretended \u201cAmy! Amy! Where\u2019d you go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy heard this and asked Ben to let her down \u201cGwen! Over here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen ran over and pretended to be surprised by Ben \u201cOh! Hi Ben. Have a nice nap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026 but I have to warn you. The other two are\u2026\u201d There was a rumbling of giant footsteps and 2 giant hulking preteens appeared. \u201cYou know what I mean right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen stared at the two in shock. \u201cwow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth loved that reaction. They puffed out their chest in pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUmm\u2026 yah\u2026 I found out that the universe has this rule that I accidentally made. When ever a boys enter a competition. The victor gains muscle/strength in what ever form they want. I just wanted to keep my size and weight the same, so it turned into strength. Seth wanted size, so his muscles are twice as big, but half as dense. Nick wanted equal proportions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI see that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYou made this rule?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said defensively \u201cI didn\u2019t know I did. I guess I subconsciously thought it would spice up the events.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth happily agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen then said sadly \u201cThough, you can\u2019t keep all of those muscles. You can have a fraction of it. I think that for every 10lbs gained here, you get a 1lb out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth realized that this was a chance at easy growing. \u201cBen.. How about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cMe? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll grow any larger. Maybe my max will get bigger, though I doubt it\u2019d a noticeable difference. My Max crosses over into several planes of existence. Its bigger then any known universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded expectantly, but Seth was awestruck once more \u201cThat\u2019s massive! No wonder I could never beat you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cDe ja vu.\u201d Ben looked at Nick and so did Amy and Gwen. Nick\u2019s face turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had a feeling that Nick had a similar experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was eager to change the topic \u201cSo how about another competition?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was rearing to go. Ben was ok with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat event is next and how much muscle should be rewarded?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m god with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and thought of a few weights. There was a clanking of metal as 500lb weights appeared. \u201cLets give these a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Nick walked over to the weights and gave a grunt as they picked them up. Seth took a little longer since he was weaker. Ben went an picked it up with more ease and the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick saw that Ben was doing it with such ease, well easier than he was carrying it. \u201cBen\u2026 how can you pick it up so easily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI told you. The victor gets the most muscle or strength. I\u2019ve converted all the muscle I gained into strength. That\u2019s why I\u2019m stronger. Plus, I\u2019ve already won a competition, so I\u2019ve gained more than both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick frowned and them smiled competitively \u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to beat you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cNot that\u2019s the Nick we all know and love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cSo what are the goals?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen were sitting on the sides talking about who\u2019ll win. Amy bets on Ben, and Gwen bets on Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow about for every time you lift the weight, you gain a pound of muscle. Who ever lifts it the most with get double their gain. Second place with get a 50% increase, and 3rd place gets 25% increase. If there is a tie for first place, the people who tied with gat a 50% increase in their gain, and a tie for second is a 25% increase?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Nick \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAlright! Lets start lifting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they began. After a dozen lifts, there was a ripping sound. Seth\u2019s shirt and pants had torn off, but he continued lifting anyway. For Ben, it was getting easier and easier. So easy it came to a point there he could lift it the moment he put it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt it getting lighter as well, but his muscle were starting to get in the way. He saw that he was losing visibility of his feet as his pecs pushed 5in. His biceps and shoulders prevent the weight from going over his head. \u201cTime out! Ben can you make it so that our bodies grow taller as well? Just enough so that we can still move out limbs around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth saw the need for that rule. He was losing a lot of mobility and sight as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the to and nodded \u201cI\u2019ll make the weights grow heavier to. Since they are getting so light now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was as stretching sound as Seth and Nick got taller. Rip! Their underwear flew off their bodies revealing jumbo cocks. Nick\u2019s was so long it almost touched the ground. It was like 3 ft long and melon balls. Seth\u2019s was similar but thicker since he wanted size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked away. Ben though of stretchy cloths for them and they put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Nick \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned back around \u201cTime in. Lets start lifting again.\u201d Ben picked it up and felt the increased weight. So did the other two. However, if you did it fast enough, you can grow stronger than it got heavy. That was Ben\u2019s goal. He lifted and set down, and lift and set down. His muscle burned with each lift, but he noticed the slow decrease in the strength needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two hadn\u2019t realized it yet, so they were going slower than Ben. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few dozen more, Seth was 15ft tall with bulbous muscle. Nick was 10 ft tall with proportional body builder muscles. Ben was the same size as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth\u2019s muscle were searing in pain as they neared their 50th lift. Ben felt comfortable at his 75th lift. Suddenly, Seth dropped his and fell to the ground fast asleep. Nick saw this and wondered when he\u2019d drop. He kept lifting until he got to 65. Then clunk. It fell to the ground. He was shocked. Then he smiled when he saw his muscle bulge out as he gained 32.5lbs of muscle. Ben was shocked to see the 750lb weight suddenly become lighter. He had lifted it about 100x, so he gained a total of 150lbs. Ben was now about 350lb o muscle strength. Seth was about 250lbs of muscle though he looked heavier. Nick was 325lb of lean hard muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWoot! I knew you could do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cOh well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Nick fell to the ground fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLooks like this is taking a toll on their bodies. Should we stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cNah\u2026 let them have a little more fun. Besides, they like growing. Might as well let them enjoy it as much as they can before they lose 90% of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI wonder if they\u2019ll go out willingly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cThey\u2019ll get out\u2026 trust.\u201d She smiled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy back away slightly scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can have some fun every now and then.\u201d She snaps her fingers and a ball of purple light appeared in her hand. Suddenly, it turned green and expanded rapidly. Gwen let go of the ball, but it still grew. Gwen ran back shocked by what is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGwen! What\u2019s going on.\u201d The green ball was about 5ft in diameter and growing. \u201cEveryone\u2026 get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen backed away. Amy dragged Seth and Nick away with magic. Ben stood where he was to confront the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to eradicate the ball since he can control this universe, but it stayed. Suddenly, it jumped and consumed Ben. Then it dissolved the ground Ben stood and sank down. It kept going until it got out of Ben\u2019s illusion of his school and floated in space. Then it popped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d Ben looked around, but he soon heard the sound of crashing water. He looked around him and saw a giant bubble of liquid had surrounded him. It closed in on him. He prayed that it was fast because the others were waiting for him. He also didn\u2019t want them to get flooded by his cum. It hit him like a surge he had chewed mint gum for an hour and then drank a cup of cold water. It over whelmed his senses until he was practically numb of everything except for one feeling. Pleasure\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen lost all ability to think clearly as the magic growing liquid surged into his body. He strength soured even higher than the limits\u2026 even beyond that as well. Suddenly, as though something opened up, he exploded with cum and growth. His cock shot out and grew at a rate of a light year per second. It sprayed galaxies of cum every microsecond. And it only got Faster! It grew and spewed and grew some more! All the while, Ben was unable to think of nothing more than try to relieve himself of the ever increasing pressure in his balls. He punched and rubbed his outrageously galactic cock sending explosions of pleasure up his nerves to his brain. They shook his body to the core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe filled out every plane of existence in his universe and every dimension in minutes. There wasn\u2019t a single empty corner except for his illusion of a school. He quickly broke into trillions of new dimensions every moment. Time slowed down and sped up. It morphed and reversed. Space contorted as dimensions broke free of their shells, and merged with others. Though, one thing remained unchanged. Ben and his giant endowment. It continued to lengthen until it covered several trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion dimension. The cum spewing out was drilling through walls and divides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in a burst of time, Ben finished. All the cum for the next 10yrs had been released in a fraction of a second. It broke through an immeasurable number of planes/dimension/universe. His engorged cock shrank down to its previous size so fat that it left a vacuum in this new unified dimension. Ben slow awakened from his pleasurable dream of torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around and saw his pants hanging by his feet. He pulled those up. \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d Ben turned to the orb floating ear by. It flashed green once and everything got sucked in. The ocean had vanished in a fraction of a blink. Apparently, it had sped up time so that it wouldn\u2019t take years for it to absorb all the cum. Ben had already felt it heart beat even before it began to absorb his cum. But he felt as though his heart was actually in the orb. He felt his chest, his felt a beat there, but the heart of his soul was in the orb. He had merged with the orb at a subatomic/subconscious level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wanted the orb to come closer, and the orb sense what he wanted. It came closer and let Ben observe it. Ben saw not that there was only one universe inside. The perfect universe. A place where everything existed, everything was created here and destroyed here. It happened every moment. There was an odd balance of destruction and construction, chaos and harmony, chaotic flares and moment of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen touched the orb and felt kind of odd. It felt like he was touching himself. Ben gave the orb a tap and he felt a tap on himself. He gave it a punch and he felt a slight punch on himself. It seemed that they had a literal mental/physical connection. Ben wanted to float here forever just simply feeling himself through the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a white stone appeared in from of him and flashed a brilliant bright white, but it didn\u2019t hurt. It actually made Ben feel warm and more calm. Suddenly, he saw a face. It was Amy! She reached out a hand to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparition \u201cCome back\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reached out his hand and grasped Amy\u2019s hand. She smiled and pulled him into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of white light in every corner of this 1 dimension. Ben appeared in a white universe filled with white stars and all. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d Suddenly, a pair of arms grasped him around the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYou came.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYah\u2026 I came.\u201d Then he remembered \u201cWhy are we hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cThe place you made for us lasted a little while\u2026 a week maybe, but then it began to dissolve. We needed to hid somewhere your cum couldn\u2019t burn us or drown us. It also need to be a place that was strong enough to withstand your power. And the only place that could do that was either your medallion or orb, or my heartstone since you made it. You can see where I\u2019m heading with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026 I do. Where are the others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThem? They are on the other end of my universe. I kind of wanted to do this alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow long have I been\u2026 you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cA few weeks. A month tops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cReally? It felt like years had gone by in a second. I felt like time was morphing around me. Only a few places were untouched.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYup\u2026 that would be here and you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to cry \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was a little surprised by hugged Ben close \u201cYou did nothing wrong\u2026 Its ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sniffled \u201cYah but you all could have gotten hurt. Especially  you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cWell I didn\u2019t so stop crying. What happened to that big macho attitude you usually have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cHa! I think a little to mellowed out for that. That\u2019s more Nick and Seth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy made a thinking face \u201cKnow what? You\u2019re right on that. Fine then\u2026 how about that happy go lucky attitude that I like so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cOk\u2026\u201d He paused for a moment, and surprised her by picking her up and running around her universe hundreds of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed the whole time, but at one point she began to fall asleep listening to Ben\u2019s heart. She rested her head against his soft pecs and nuzzling the hard muscle beneath the soft pillow surface. His heart beating against her ear. Slowly, she drifted off to blissful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He let go of Amy, but held her hand. They floated in space together in a white sea filled with countless lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYour back! Took you long enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed but felt slightly guilty \u201cHehe\u2026 yah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Nick turned and faced Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised a questioning eyebrow. \u201cHey\u2026 both of you got smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts true. As soon as Seth and Nick stepped into Amy\u2019s heartstone, they had emerged a fraction of what they had been. Nick was 5ft9in, but still immense in size. Since he had gotten shorter, all his new growth was further packed into his frame. His pecs pushed out 5in, his shoulders were giant bowling balls. His arms looked as though they could snap a tree in half, and his legs looked as though they could crack the ground open with a hard enough kick. His abs were like the muffins you see in your oven. Lets not to forget his pride. It was a whopping 8in long and 4in thick. His balls were engorged coconuts. It looked as though there was a basket ball in his shorts. It looked almost comical. All the enlarged proportions, but still\u2026 he was not someone to be messed with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was a little more proportioned, but still huge. He had grown to 5ft7in tall. His pecs were a huge 3in off his body, and his abs were well defined. You could see every indent they made. His shoulders were large and strong looking, and his biceps looked to be 6in in diameter. His legs were a strong enough to out strangle a boa constrictor. His young pride was a large 7in long 3in wide. His balls were like softballs. Some might call him \u2018hot\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cYah, but I\u2019m ok with it. We\u2019re still huge! Bigger than before.\u201d He flexed both his mighty arms to show 2 giant mountains form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cYah\u2026 though, being big was nice. I\u2019m still ok with it. I\u2019ve definitely made extremely quick and fast gains while we were in your universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. \u201cWell\u2026 we should get out. We\u2019ve been in this place for to long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah. I think its been a month and a half. I doubt much time has passed outside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cNeither do I, but we should still get out now.\u201d Amy called for the door, and a white circle opened up. On the other side there was a chaotic, but orderly, green universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stepped through to make sure everything was ok, and he opened his door as well. Everyone filed through. When Amy went out of her world, the heartstone appeared back in her necklace. Before, they white leaves held an empty slot, but now it was filled. \u201cHey\u2026 it came back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cOk\u2026 lets get out before I get assaulted again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grabbed Ben\u2019s hand and dragged him through his gate with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was still about to turn and get a chair to wait, but the everyone had already come back. \u201cWow! That was fast. How long were you in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cA little more than a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cReally? Its only been a second here.\u201d Gramps looked at everyone and saw that Seth and Nick were larger than when they came in. \u201cI see\u2026 so you two grew a lot while in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth smiled with pride, and did a double bicep flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen did a face palm\u2026 muscle heads!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had a question \u201cWhat did you eat when you were in Amy\u2019s universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cNothing! We didn\u2019t even get hungry. It was like we were suspended in time. Nothing changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLike Peter Pan\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud roar filled the air. Then another and another. Ben looked down at his stomach and after he felt it rumbling. Seth and Nick did the same, though theirs were not a deep and loud as Ben\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWow! It was like a lion had come and gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen started to smile, and decided to joke around \u201cNurse Amy\u2026 we need utensils stat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYes Doctor. Should we go get the sides as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAnd the butter! Everyone hands in the kitchen immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone ran into the kitchen and prepared a feast. They laughed and joked the whole time, but there was always and air of serious determinations. Then another round of rumbling came, but even louder. It made the Rustbucket vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked down and scolded his stomach \u201cWow there tiger. Food\u2019s coming soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as if in response to Ben, his stomach gave off an annoyed grumbling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was dumbstruck \u201cDon\u2019t you use that tone with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was staring at Ben is shock and confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps started to chuckle and nod his head slowly \u201cTime to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth felt their stomachs rumble in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cMaybe it not just Ben\u2026. Boys in general I guess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was already salivating \u201cWho cares! Lets eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps past down plates of food. Pastas and salad\u2026 sandwiches\u2026 etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours of gorging on food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth lets out a belch, and Ben let out a loud fog horn of a belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled satisfied \u201cThat hit the spot\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Ben\u2019s pile of dishes \u201cYah\u2026 after a dozen plates\u2026 it amazing that 6 pack of yours isn\u2019t covered in a thick layer of fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen punches his rock hard stomach and smiled \u201cSuper fast metabolism!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI think I can beat that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cReally now?

It held a special poison capable of blocking all the senses\u2026 blocked all though\u2026 except for pleasure and desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts jewels held a powerful liquid energy that was rapidly building up until\u2026 Bam!

And so it continued\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Rustbucket, Ben was in his bed, but his blanket had a near 18in high tent. The tip of the tent was a dark wet color, and the tent moved as Ben stoked the pole that held it up. He let out silent moans and stroked even harder. The blanket was not toughly soaked and musky. Underneath, there was a faint green light pulsating and releasing a steady trickle of a glowing green energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up in the sky, there was a final thrust and a powerful blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Rustbucket, the tent suddenly flew up another foot and fell off to the side. Ben\u2019s eyes snapped open he looked around. His body was sore from the night\u2019s events. He was panting. He looked around and saw a glistening blanket coated with steaming white bubbly liquid. Ben knew exactly what had transpired, and was glad that no one was awake. Ben quickly grabbed the blanket and tossed it into his universe. Then he pulled it out as good as new. The orb had sucked in his \u2018minimum\u2019 cum. His body is sealed in almost everyway except for density.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked down at his penis and saw that it was still erect at about 20in long, 3wide, and with ever inflated tennis balls. Ben quickly ran into the bathroom until it calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is going on?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This results in an increase in hormonal surges, and production of hormones to feed his ever growing body. I wonder how the orb is responding to the Ben\u2019s unstable body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen went back to bed and imagine nothing happened. When everyone was up, Amy gave his a look that said, \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gave her a nod and looked off into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy understood a d continued like nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as no one would notice, Ben and Amy disappeared into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just me last night was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo. We were up in the sky\u2026 right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI don\u2019t really remember. All I know is that you were a radiant green, and I was blaring white, and that we were doing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI know. What do you think it means? The medallion was acting up again. I think the liquid inside is becoming to concentrated and compressed, and it leaking out to reduce the pressure inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was silently thinking of what could happen to Ben \u201cWe need to find a way to stop it before it escalates into something worse. I don\u2019t want to lose you because of a possible addiction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cKnow what? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get addicted to it, but I do think it should be dealt with soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cSo maybe a spell of two might work. Maybe reinforce the gravitum or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLets ask Gwen. She\u2019ll know a spell or two that can help I think\u2026 I hope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both go back to see everyone relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked up from her spell book \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day. Did you two have a nice walk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled politely, but she still had some worry on her face. Gwen saw it and her intuition told her something was off \u201cWhat wrong. What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThe medallion if leaking. I feel the orb telling my the energy inside is becoming far to condensed, and to much of the liquid is being made. Normally, it just gets compressed, but now its far to dense, and needs a way to reduce the pressure inside. It is coating everything inside my universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI see. I think that we could try to make the medallion stronger, but that will only be temporary. I assume it will continue to build up until your medallion burst open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cYah. Even as we speak, its bursting though countless dimensions, but those are filled up in an instant. That\u2019s how fast it forms now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk. So we need something more permanent. Lets ask Gramps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tell Gramps what\u2019s going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThat can be a problem. Lets just brainstorm. Strengthening the medallion is a short term. Maybe we could create some black hole inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shook his head \u201cIt won\u2019t work. The energy is dense enough to form a black hole. Right now, it could smother one to death. I know it doesn\u2019t sound like it makes sense, but its just one of the rules of my universe. I can influence my universe to a huge extent, but things are still bound to specific rules.\u201d Then Ben had an idea \u201cMaybe\u2026 since my universe I composed of near infinite dimension, and each having its own set of rules, maybe we could use it to out advantage. When they all merged into my universe, and became one, they obtained a set of \u2018constant rules\u2019. However, there are still patches of random rules floating in my universe that escaped change. They aren\u2019t major one. My universe wants to protect, so those rules are probably things it decided to keep that will better protect me, or anyone I connect it to., maybe they are just neutral rules\u2026 like gravity or something. I think we can use one or two of those rules to help us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThat might be possible. Or maybe we could make a new rule that applies to the energy in your universe. I could apply some mana and make it more binding that it normally would. Amy can help to\u2026 it will take a lot of mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat sounds safer then what I was planning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Amy though of something \u201cMaybe we can make a clone of Ben, and tie it to him with mana. We can send it into the orb to absorb the energy and do what Ben\u2019s body would do in that situation. Then when the real Ben steps in, the two merge and Ben gets all the growth he would have had if he had been in side. Or maybe the real Ben will just get all the growth while the fake Ben absorbs the liquid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Amy in awe \u201cAmy! You\u2019re a genius! Did you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cNot really. I\u2019m just resourceful. That\u2019s all.\u201d Amy did a click/wink thingy with her face (it\u2019s a movie moment).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was curious \u201cSo you\u2019re going to clone me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was a little worried \u201cYou can clone him, but it might take a little longer than we hope. It takes about a month for the clone to grow and match the size of its creator. Even then, its just a vegetable. It can only perform the basic functions needed to live. We even have to feed it with a tube.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cAt least we know it won\u2019t do anything wrong. Though, it\u2019ll feel awkward seeing another me. I wonder what I look like as a buff 5 year old.\u201d Suddenly, there was an opening and closing of doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Sorry we\u2019re up so late. I fell into a food coma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled \u201cSame, but also because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve slept in like a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cYah\u2026 we couldn\u2019t fall asleep in my world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed at the thought, then went back to business \u201cBen\u2019s orb is acting up. Apparently, there is to much energy being built up inside. We plan on cloning Ben and send the clone in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was amazed \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! Can I have a clone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled but said \u201cNo. I\u2019m only allowing this because its an emergency, and that it is most likely the safest solution and most permanent solution we have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was interested \u201cSo how do you clone someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cWell\u2026 its really quite ingenious. You have to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne explanation and questions later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Lets go get to Mt. Rushmore. I want to stop worrying about being sent into a pleasure induced coma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gramps began to stab the needle into Ben\u2019s skin, but instead of going in, the needle began to curve and bend away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cHe\u2019s to dense for an ordinary needle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed in relief. \u201cSo I guess we\u2019ll need to find some other solution.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cNot quite yet. Ben\u2026 can I see your teeth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and Gramps saw that Ben\u2019s canines were relatively sharp and pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBen. I need you to bite your thumb with your canine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded. At least it wasn\u2019t a needle. Ben bit his finger and quickly removed it. A single drop of blood formed and fell in a test tube that Gramps pulled out. Ben\u2019s finger healed almost immediately after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cAlright\u2026 lets get this in a vat.\u201d Gramps put the tube into a machine that began to process it. Then a large chamber of liquid appeared. \u201cBen Junior should be growing in there. It\u2019ll take a month for it to reach Ben\u2019s size and development, but after that, it will grow at a rate similar to Ben. However, I don\u2019t quite know how it will develop to match Ben. Since Ben was small and became big. Now, he is giving DNA when he is big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOnly time will tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cI\u2019ll get a camera set up to keep an eye on the chamber. We can study the growth as we wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started to jitter \u201cIts still awkward knowing that another me is going to grow up in that vat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cIts science. You\u2019ll get used to the feeling eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow\u2019s mini-me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cHe\u2019s growing differently from you. He practically skipped to age 5 in the past week. And his muscular/skeletal growth is beyond normal. Its as though it developing in a way that you would have grown in order to get to your current size naturally. I also see tested for regular strength and density. Its clear to me that it is not connected to the orb. I don\u2019t know if that is a good thing or a bad thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeek 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen began to worry. This morning, he woke up sore and surprised. His room was flooded in a 5in high pool of cum. Ben cleaned it up quickly, but new that things will get worse. Now only that, he felt the pressure in the medallion increasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen Junior slowed down in his growth a bit, but it was still relatively fast. He was now about 9 years old and very well muscled. He was a good 6in taller than most kids his age, and was a dozen times more stronger and built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeek 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was pacing down the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw Ben as she came back from the lab. Ben Jr. was as cute as a kid could get, but Ben was even cuter in her opinion, and hot too! Though, she like his personality more than his body. The body is a plus. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Ben Jr. is growing to look more like you everyday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cIts not fast enough though. Look.\u201d Ben pulled out the medallion from under his shirt. There was a tiny crack forming on the strange surface. \u201cIt formed this morning. I felt a bolt of energy shock me when it happened. I think that the impossible has occurred. The infinite number of dimensions are all about to be breeched by the energy of my universe. I don\u2019t thin this universe is safe either. Or yours, and I can\u2019t stop it. Unless\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen didn\u2019t finish. Amy put her finger on his mouth, and gave him a heart felt hug \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. There\u2019s only on week left. I think that we can survive till them. If not, then you can go inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed but agreed to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeek 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cIts an exact replica! Minus the scar on Ben\u2019s hip which he got while riding his bike.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cI just realized you have no more secrets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen interpreted for Ben\u2019s sake \u201cOk. We need to strengthen the genetic links between Ben and Ben Jr. I\u2019ll need your help Amy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stepped up , and Gwen began to hum and chant. Ben felt slightly odd as the chant finished, but nothing else. There was an odd presence in the back of his mind. It was like window, or a switch of something. Ben looked at it inside his head. He turned the switch and the world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Ben! Get up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s head hurt slightly, but he was mostly fine. He was warm and comfy. Ben opened his eyes to see he was floating inside a liquid filled chamber. Ben\u2019s eyes snapped open wide. He started to moving his limbs for the first time and began to hit the glass of the chamber. His \u2018normal\u2019 muscles did no damage to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWhat the. He\u2019s conscious! That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026. that\u2019s impossible. Nothing like this has ever happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned and faced Ben Jr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOh my god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThis is amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth had no idea what this really meant, but the knew it was cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps pressed a button, and the liquid drained out, and the chamber opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen Jr. stepped out and started to cough out some residual liquid. \u201cGuys. Its me. Ben! I don\u2019t know what happened. There was this think in the back of my mind. Its like a switch of something. I mentally flicked it, and I appeared in this body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps was amazed. He was making hundreds of mental notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIs it you? How did.. What just.. When.\u201d Amy began to feel light headed and the world began to tilt. Ben saw this and ran up to caught her. Amy felt herself fall on strong arms thick with muscle, but covered in a soft layer of skin. She heard a familiar heartbeat, and she felt her head rest on a familiar chest. She began to nuzzle Ben Jr. \u2018s pec. \u201cIt is you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled hearing those words. At least she know me when I hold her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cUm\u2026 is the switch in the back of your mind still?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it, and felt the presence in the back of his mind \u201cYah, its still there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat up \u201cCan you switch it? I kind of miss you in your body, and not the clone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cAnd in cloths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked down at his body and realized he was nude! He unknowingly retreated to the back of his mind and flicked the switch. He felt the world flip, and not go black this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground was warm because his body had been giving off heat. Ben felt the pull of the fabric on his skin and knew he was back in his body. He sat up \u201cI\u2019m back. I guess I can be in two places at once\u2026 at least physically. Mentally, I\u2019m only in one place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned an face Ben and gave his a hard hug that could have killed a regular kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen returned the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

The medallion had developed a dozen more cracks that were steadily growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBen! Put your clone in quick. The walls of your universe can break any second!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tapped the medallion and it opened revealing a light filled with lighting. It touched Ben Jr., and sucked him in. As soon as Ben Jr. went in, he began to ejaculate like never before. His empty mind had only one memory, and it is pleasure. The purest and more intense for of it as well. The clone\u2019s cock naturally stiffened to a rock hard 20in python, but then it kept growing to release more of the clone\u2019s cum (Ben\u2018s cum, but same difference). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Ben felt a sudden tingle pass over his body. It got more and more intense until it became painful. His body was growing at a new level. The super concentrated liquid was causing the real world Ben to grow immensely stronger, while the one in the medallion just got a longer cock in order to feel more pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was over. In that second of pain, a couple years had passed in the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood up and looked at the medallion. Lines of energy were running along the cracks repairing damages. The medallion quickly became whole once again. Suddenly, Ben felt another presence in his mind. It was the orb. It had absorbed all that cum and bonded with Ben even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen went to the back of his mind and touched the orb. He felt a bolt of energy shoot through his mind. He felt his muscles grow exponential, but it didn\u2019t hurt. It was rather pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI felt the orb in the back of my mind. Its like its alive. When I reached out and touched it, it grew even more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was curious. She spoke to Ben with her mind \u201cBen\u2026 can I see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let Amy probe his mind and guided her toward the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s mind was a strange place. Spacious and ever growing, but filled with thoughts and ideas. They went to the back of his mind and opened a door. Amy was shocked by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYou universe is right here in the back of your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYah. It feels like that. I guess I can go here when ever I want. Is my body still outside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYah. You kind of just froze where you were standing.\u201d Then Amy saw something that caught her eye. She looked and saw a giant fleshy rope off in the distance. It went off into the distance. You could make out a white steamy cloud at the end, that it seemed to shrink and grow as though something were sucking it in, while it grew.<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think that\u2019s Ben Jr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gasped \u201cThat\u2019s huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned red. At least she hadn\u2019t seen how big he got. \u201cYah. We should get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, and they both exited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen opened his eyes, \u201cThat was weird.\u201d He tells everyone what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSo you can go there mentally now. Did you actually step in, or did you hang back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWe stood at the door. We didn\u2019t pass through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI see. Could you go through?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYes. If I wanted to. Though, I thought against it. I could feel the energy in the space. The doorway was blocking it from flooding into my mind. If I went through, I think I would have been seduced instantly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed in relief that Ben was capable of staying above the influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw that and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWe should get to Bed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Ben fell into a deep sleep. Deeper than usual. He was dragged to the back of his mind and came upon the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened it and felt the pull of his universe. It pulled him in. Then a bubble formed around him as though it were guarding him. He was dragged all the way to Ben Jr.\u2019s body. His body was like before. The same size as Ben, but also normal density. Except his godly boy hood. It was stretched beyond the imagination. It convulsed and pumped and released a flaming hot passion. Ben looked at his clone and saw that he had fallen asleep. His clone had been knocked unconscious from the over flow of signals from his pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt himself getting pulled to the head of his clone\u2019s giant endowment. At the end, Ben saw a rapid stream of cum rushing out into a cloud of steaming cum. Ben looked back and around himself and saw that the liquid energy was rushing and pushing its way into his clone\u2019s body. It was feeding his pleasure induced coma. Ben looked at the cloud and saw that it wasn\u2019t growing. Suddenly, he was dragged into the cloud, but his bubble protected him. He was surrounded in a hazy white glow. It should be dark, but his cum was so hot that it emitted its on light. Then he stopped when he got to the center of the cloud. He saw his green of acting like a black hole. The cum was orbiting it at a tremendous rate. There was a steady flow of cum entering the orb. Ben went up and touched the orb. He felt a massive spike in his growth. It was a strange pleasurable sensation, but it didn\u2019t stop. It built and built until Ben saw that his pants had started to tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen knew what would happened next. He saw a disturbance in the white cloud around him and then a green fluid appeared and attacked his bubble. Ben knew there was no stopping it, so he waited. There were cracks beginning to form. Then it shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElectrifying energy entered Ben\u2019s body and stimulated every nerve that he had. He was aware of everything, but also lost to everything. He felt himself growing and getting compressed. He noticed the intense pulse of his penis as it held back his body\u2019s fluids. Suddenly, he saw the 20in long cock gain a burst of growth. His balls surged outward filling his pants. Ben had just enough control over his body to toss his pants aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the cloud. The cloud looked like it was growing. Suddenly a giant fleshy spear shot out into the distance and kept growing. It grew to a size even larger that the clones, and it still grew longer. At the base of this spear were galaxy sized balls that were only getting larger. Then the balls began to inflate rapidly as though it was being filled with something. Then the spear began to widen as it too began to fill up. It worked its way to the top quickly and burst forward. It shot out and broke through this realm and into another and another. It pieced the heavens and beyond. There was no stopping the assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy in the universe began to lessen as two giant cocks absorbed it. Then there was none. The energy wasn\u2019t produced fast enough to meet the demand. Ben\u2019s cock slowly shrank down to it original size. The clone\u2019s cock however grew just as long and more. The energy in the universe began to build up slightly, but stopped increasing. It had reached equilibrium. As in it was made and absorbed at the same rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen began to regain conscious. He saw that the universe was rearranging itself as it incorporated the newly broken dimensions. Ben then saw the orb flash and begin to absorb the cum. It began to speed up until there was next to none left. Then a surge came forth as the clone released even more from its ever growing cock. The flow increased at the same rate the orb absorbed. Everything was in balance. Ben felt the orb in his mind as felt it giving him more energy than usual, and it only increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt increased until Ben was lost in it. Then suddenly\u2026 he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen bolted up from his bed gasping for air. He was panting from the intensity of his dream. He looked at the back of his mind and saw that the door was closed. However, the key hole was still releasing a stream of energy into Ben\u2019s mind. Making him grow faster than his usual rate of increase. Right now, if Ben was not compressed, he could have filled his universe and broken through countless more. The outside universe wouldn\u2019t even stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben was curious. He floated to the orb and passed through the cloud of cum. He wanted to see what would happen if he took of his necklace. Last time, it made the universe freeze its grown and everything inside got pulled toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen held the orb and felt its energy enter him through the contact. Then he prepared to take off his necklace. He imagined his clone in a pocket of space that was protected from the influences of gravity. Suddenly, his clone disappeared into a new dimension. Then Ben took off his pants in preparation. Finally, he slowly lifted his necklace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime froze. Spikes of gravity shot out of Ben stabbing at his universe and making ALL OTHER dimensions burst open. His gravity pulled everything in. All the stars, planets, energy, etc\u2026 were pulled towards him. He felt himself explode with pleasure. Then it was gone. His universe became empty. The boundaries of the universe had frozen and were slowly shrinking. All other dimensions (ALL of them except the ones made by gravitum, and Ben\u2018s original universe.) and merged with Ben\u2019s universe. His gravitational pull tugged even faster at the walls of the universe until you could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boundary was iridescent green. You could see bubbles pop on the other side and meld with the universe. Then all the bubbles were gone, and all that remained was a shrinking universe. Then it got so small that Ben could touch opposite ends just be reaching out to either sides. Suddenly, it passed through him. He felt his hands go through the walls of the universe. It was a strange sensation. Totally indescribable. The universe shrank down till encased the orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure on the orb began to increase as the walls tried to grow even smaller. Then the orb let out a burst of untamed energy. It shocked and energized the walls forcing them to expand even though Ben\u2019s gravity had pulled it in. The universe quickly expanded to its previous size and still grew. Ben on the other hand was confused. His mind had blanked out when he had passed outside his universe. Everything was inconceivable, so his brain ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around his universe. It was growing again, but faster. He put his medallion on and he saw the boundaries burst forward even faster. They rushed forward and away from Ben at untold speeds. Ben moved around and felt the universe. It was different. He looked at his orb and saw that it was also different. It was a radiating  a strange light. It fluctuated and pulsed with a regular, and irregular pattern. Ben touched the orb and it sent a shock up his body, but the universe also let out a flash and shocked Ben. The universe was the orb now. That\u2019s why they were both different. It was because they changed so that they were the same. The orb let out a flash and the universe was filled with green light. When the light faded away, it was filled with everything. The universe had merged every rule from all other dimensions into one. Everything that can exist did exist. There were flat stars, squares, triangles, paradoxes, fractals, and more. Ben was mesmerized. He looked the orb and saw that it also looked like the universe. It was like a prefect universe in Ben\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the walls of the universe and saw that it was flooded with liquid. Ben opened up the pocket in his universe and let the clone out. It\u2019s giant cock had shrunken down. Ben changed the universe so that the cock would stay that size, but could increase in sensitivity and production. The cum can be made and shot out at a rate faster that it was before it it needed to. Ben looked off into the distance and saw strings of energy weave there way toward the clone, and enter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone\u2019s eyes snapped open and it began to jack off instinctively. It released a thing stream of cum that was supper dense and concentrated. It was flaring white hot and steaming. Then it rushed into the orb. The universe suddenly flashed green and began to make more stars and what not. It\u2019s overall energy increased, so the cum produced increased, and the orb\u2019s ability to absorb also increased. The cycle will go on and on. Ben felt a tingle go over his body as he grew more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt a sense of pride in his universe. It was amazing. Then suddenly he remembered Amy, and panicked. He had almost been seduced into stay again. He quickly left his universe using the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the medallion had gone pitch black when the universe had shrunken down, but then it flared green and gave off the energy of the universe. The gravitum it was made of was changed. In order to contain the ultimate universe it held, the gravitum had to convert some of the energy made from inside into more gravitum. The madallion was getting denser and denser with every passing moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder what that does to it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben held medallion in his hand. It had vibrated and gave off a strange energy, but that stopped shortly. Ben looked at the medallion and saw that it was one picture now. It didn\u2019t change except for the frequent shifts in stars and astral objects. Then suddenly, it began to gain \u2018depth\u2019. You could tell that some objects were deeper than others. Before, it was just a plain 2D image, but now they looked more like 3D objects. Ben looked at it and was shocked to see that it was changing more than that. The gravitum was restructuring its atomic geometry. It began to become more crystalline, but also more random. The way light went though it, and left wasn\u2019t always the same. It changed rapidly. As though the bonds between atoms broke and reformed in another pattern. At some points, lights was totally lost. As Ben held it in his hand, he felt it change shape. Before, it was like a .5in thick cylinder with a 3in diameter. Now it was bunching up and forming a ball. Slowly, it shrank and reformed itself until it was a perfect sphere. \u201cThe perfect sphere\u201d because every other sphere as at least 1 atom sized blemish. This one had none, thereby giving it untold amounts of stability there by allowing it to contain the faster that rapid growth of the universe it held. Ben now held a 1in diameter medallion in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben held it, he felt the intensity of its binding prowess. It was holding back an ever growing force. A force that was just an inverse of infinity less than Ben. The medallion looked similar to Amy\u2019s heart stone, but different. Like it was a fusion between the white metal and the stone of her necklace. Stronger, and more chaotic, but that chaos provided more stability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the orb began to float a few inches above his palm. Then it tapped the hook that it usually went on clung to it with out the need to hook onto it. Ben felt his strength drop to such a relatively small level that he wondered how he ever survived before. Then he heard a noise behind him. He looked and saw that Gwen was on the top bunk. She was still asleep since it was still early, so Ben went back to the bottom bunk and pretended to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYou make a lot of noise. Even when you want to keep a secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s heart skipped at beat. Then he smiled. At least Gwen wasn\u2019t going to tell Amy \u201cHa\u2026 Should have guessed that you were awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell\u2026 I woke up right after you got up and went into the orb. What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen told her about his dream, and how the universe seemed to have changed. He went to find out, and hinted to what happened inside. Then he told her what the gravitum felt like and how it changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAt least the seal is still working. I don\u2019t think there\u2018s anything to worry about. It looks like everything is alright. Its unlikely that the medallion will get near to breaking open again. That could have been disastrous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scoffed a little \u201cYou\u2019re telling me. The world could have been consumed with that energy. Everything will grow to such huge sizes that the earth wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain all of them. Well\u2026 that\u2019s what I think would have happened. Its that, or both universe merge together. I don\u2019t know what will happen then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell. That didn\u2019t happen, so don\u2019t think about it to much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell her\u2026 are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cWhat for? Its none of my business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHowever, even if I don\u2019t tell, I think that if I were you, I would tell her. Secrets, and ill will can degrade your self esteem, and positive energy. Basically, you\u2019ll feel guilty. But don\u2019t listen to me. Listen to yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was silent, \u201cIts funny. You\u2019re only 12, but it sounds like you\u2019re a relationships expert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cI\u2019m a girl. Everyone knows we\u2019re more mature that the boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cSure they are, but you aren\u2019t a girl sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat\u2019s that suppose to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat ever you want it to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNo seriously!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI was serious. What ever you want it to mean!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cFine. Be that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cBen 1 point. Gwen 854 points.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a door opened. Amy stuck her head out of the door \u201cWhat\u2019s all the ruckus about? Its like 7AM. A girl needs her beauty sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cTell you later. I think I\u2019ll go back to bed too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, Ben decided to tell them what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was looking at Ben\u2019s medallion. Ben discovers something he didn\u2019t know about before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Especially when he found out his shows no longer fit him. Ben\u2019s pecs pushed a little under 3in off his body. His 6pack was defines and each line was cut nicely. His shoulders were bowling balls, biceps were 5in in diameter, stronger thighs that still didn\u2019t touch each other, and diamond cut calves. He had a thin layer of fat that protected people from being hurt seriously if they punched his super dense muscles, but that thin layer of fat also made his look bigger that he was, and he looked better that way. He muscles didn\u2019t look hard and mean, but more friendly. Also, his large penis was enlarged further to a whopping 10in long, 2.5 wide, with softball balls. It looked like some stuffed a shirt into his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick is now<br>\r\nAge:14 years old<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft tall<br>\r\nWeight: 250lbs<br>\r\nDescription: Seth disliked the fact that he had to look up to see Ben\u2019s face, but he wasn\u2019t angry or anything. He was still huge. His pecs pushed 4in off his body, his biceps were 8in diameter. His 6pack abs were large and deeply cut. Deep enough that you could put most of your index finger in it. His thighs were massive. They brushed against each other as he walked down the halls. Not to mention that fact that when he walks, the bulge in his groin bounces. It contained an 8in python that was 2in thick.

They had until graduation senior year. Ever since 2 summers ago, he\u2019s been working non stop, so he matched Nick proportionally in size. Being a couple inches short packs more muscle in a smaller frame thereby making him look bigger than he is. His pecs puched 4in off his body. His biceps were 7in diameter, his abs were as good as Nick\u2019s, his thighs also rubbed against each other as he walked. His bulge was composed of a 7in anaconda, 2in diameter, with tennis balls for balls.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://instinctmagazine.com/images/stories/blogs/jhigbee/november2011/lipnicki.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://instinctmagazine.com/images/stori...</a><br>\r\nBut 2x larger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the big 3 with their 10 followers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10<br>\r\nAge:  14 years old<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft 8in<br>\r\nWeight: 225 lbs<br>\r\nDescription: These kids were highly motivated body builders. They have been working out together since the summer prior to the 6th grade. They stove to grow as strong as Nick in muscle, and a few hoped to match Ben in height. They all knew that no one can match his speed. He was like lightning. Their pecs pushed 3in of their body, their abs looked like freshly baked cupcakes. Their shoulders were like bowling balls. Their biceps were 6in in diameters, and their thighs brushed against each other slightly. Their build varied very little since they all had the exact same routine. Their pride was 7in long, 2in diameter, and their balls were tennis balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was freshmen orientation, so only freshmen were in the school. Everyone was given thirty minutes to wander and then come back for lunch. Apparently, they school is hoping for a few million dollars to get renovated. They were embarrassed that their elementary/middle school was nicer than their high school. Ben would need to fix that, but he can\u2019t. His strength is still sealed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked down the hall looking down slightly to see everyone. They were all shocked to see that they had to tilt their head slightly to look at Ben\u2019s face. Amy wasn\u2019t as surprised since she had see Ben occasionally during the summer. Ben saw Amy and waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy waved back to her \u2018friend\u2019. Apparently, both of them decided to become friends just for high school, and may until after college. They need to work hard and get an education. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had gotten a girlfriend over the summer. She was fairly nice, but it was clear that she was moving on. Nick was still stuck in the past however. He got a job and sent flowers, chocolates, and other things. He even sent her a dumbbell for their week-a-versary. Slowly, it came to dawn on him that things wouldn\u2019t get started again, so he stopped. He went to the gym everyday afterwards and pumped iron until he couldn\u2019t anymore. Lets see where this leads him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had decided that he wasn\u2019t going to go through what Nick is going through, he is going to abstain permanently\u2026 at least until he changes his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had decided against going to a fancy high school and decided to go to this high school because it had more \u2018character. She could be with her friends, go to their school library (the largest school library in the world!), and participate in a whole series of events. Not to mention the school has hired a new set of faculty members. The teachers all had the title \u2018Dr.\u2019 which is suppose to make them experts in their fields. Most were in their 40\u2019s, so they had been working in their field for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ben walked in the front making small greeting to people he knew. Seth was trying to cheer Nick up, and Amy and Gwen were just talking about their plans during and after high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the new teachers, an astronomer and an alien enthusiast saw Ben walking down the hall. He saw the necklace Ben was wearing and saw its strange quality. \u201cThat\u2019s strange. No rock on earth has that type of quality.\u201d This is Dr. Comet. (Funny right? Well, that\u2018s just my opinion.) He thought about that chain and medallion for a little while when the bell had rung. That means that students would be filing in to their home rooms. They would follow their schedules, and go to their proper class to be told what they needed. At the end of the day, they would all go to an assembly to be told their expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny that all 5 kids had the same homeroom with Dr. Comet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most were surprised at Ben\u2019s amazing growth spurt, but they left it at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Comet felt it was time to introduce himself \u201cHello homeroom. Seeing that this is both of our first days, I find it necessary to start off with introductions. My name is Dr. Comet, and I\u2019ll be teaching astronomy at this school. Maybe some of you will have me as your teacher, and I look forward to it. My hobbies include alien sci-fi movies, looking at the stars, and listening to music.\u201d Then he pointed to Nick. \u201cYour turn. Large young man in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick realized it was his turn \u201cHello. I\u2019m Nick. My hobbies are weightlifting, cardio, and I hope to start football this year. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Comet \u201cVery good. Now you point to someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick turned and pointed at Seth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cMy name is Seth. I also do Weightlifting, and cardio, and I want to start football. I believe that hard work can get you anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Seth. Nick muttered \u201cShowoff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled and them pointed at Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI want to join gymnastics, and start a yoga club. My hobbies as yoga, volunteering at the YMCA, and reading mystery books. Big fan of Sherlock Holms. I want to major in biology, and continue to work in a lab to study stem cells and muscle tissue.\u201d then she pointed to Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cLike Amy, I love Holms, and yoga, but I also like karate and track. I want to major in neuroscience and anatomy. I want to study brain and all it little quirks.\u201d Then she pointed to Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cMy name is Ben. I want to try out for football. I weight lift, do yoga, cardio, run, and other thing. A total fitness geek.\u201d Ben smiled and then continued \u201cMY other hobbies include anything hands on, so I know how to make a house and a car, and other things. I even craft among other things. I love sci-fi movies, I want to be an astronomer as an occupation. So maybe I might see you, Dr. Comet, later on today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Comet nodded and let Ben point to someone else. Everyone got to say their hobbies and goals, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, everyone went to their \u2018required\u2019 classes. The school was doing something new. Homerooms would be one group that would have all the same courses except for electives. So all the kids from this morning found themselves in the same Geometry H. class, English 9 H. class, US History H. class, Biology H. class, and Gym class. They had one extra class of their choice. Ben chose astronomy, Gwen chose to do a schools to career with Dr. G. Matter, another neuroscience fanatic, Amy chose to do anatomy, Seth picked an extra gym period to go to the gym, and so did Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny how, every went to gym. They all got a uniform to wear. A pair of shorts and a T-shirt, though they were not required to wear those specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth had specifically brought a change of cloths since they were going to lift weights after school, but now was as good as ever. Ben and may students did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was a fitness test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir was an optional weight lifting section if you were interested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher Mr. Tuff (Get it? Tough --- Tuff?) \u201cOk. We are doing a mandatory fitness test today. Everyone go change and be out in 5.\u201d Everyone went and changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stepped out with his usual fitness attire along with Nick and Seth. Their sleeveless shirts showed off their hugely muscled arms and hugged their chest nicely. The clothing they chose showed off their muscles well, but Ben was a little more modest. Unlike out 2 muscle heads. Ben still had a sleeveless shirt and shorts, but they were a little looser on him than the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tuff \u201cOk. We are doing the optional weightlifting first. Who wants to participate?\u201d All the boys raised their hands. They have been lifting since the 6th grade when their school had its sudden renovation. They were all more built than kids from other schools. Because of it, they all had relatively nice bodies that you couldn\u2019t complain about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tuff brought the kids to a set of 3 bench presses. Ben, Nick, and Seth stepped up. Ben was in the middle. \u201cOk. Lets begin. How much weight do you want?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all said \u201c400lbs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tuff had already been shocked by the fact that these boys were extremely huge, but they even lifted outrageously. Any they were only freshmen! What will they look like as senior!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had been building for body for endurance, strength, and flexibility. So this means ha can lift heavy weights for many reps. Its amazing he kept such a tight built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had been lifting lightly for a lot of reps. This results in a large build, but isn\u2019t as strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick tried to cope Ben in strength, but he also wanted size, so he ended up having to lift slightly lighter, for few reps than either, but still very heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo all three laid down and got ready to see who was strongest. Based on looks, it seems like Nick will win, but on muscular structure, it looks like Ben will win. Seth will probably lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began nice and strong. They Seth started to slow down since he wasn;t used to the heavy weights. He got to the 6th lift before his muscles couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He sat up slightly satisfied that he got that far. Nick and Ben were still neck in neck at 10 lifts\u2026 then 15.\u2026 At 17, Nick began to shake harder than he had before. He managed an 18. Ben got to 18 then did 19 with some difficulty. Not as much as Nick. Then nick got ready for the 19 and some how managed. Ben did 20, and Nick simply stopped because he was done. Ben stopped as well, and shook hands with Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled competitively \u201cNext time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNext time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tuff was awestruck at the immense power these two boys had. He decided to let everyone do what they wanted to do. \u201cOk class. Change of plans. Go do your usual workout routine. The test will be tomorrow. You three. Come with me.\u201d He pointed to Nick, Seth, and Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tuff brought them to his office. \u201cI have some advice for you three. Join the football team. I think you guys have a clear chance of making it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, Seth, and Ben \u201cThat was out intention. We planned on doing it this year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tuff nodded and dismissed the boys. When they were go, he did  jump of joy. They football team has been getting worse and worse each year until recently, they lost 9 out of 10 games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang took it easy and did a few cardio exercise, but nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they took a shower and they went to their electives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked back into his homeroom \u201cHello Dr. Comet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Comet \u201cHey Ben. Good to see you. Have a seat. Everyone should be coming shortly.\u201d After a few minutes of trying to find their way through the halls, 29 more kids had filed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Comet \u201cHello class. I am Dr. Comet. I\u2019d like to take a moment to ask you why you are interested in the heavens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class to turns sharing. Ben\u2019s turn came \u201cMy family has had a long history of looking at the stars and they got me interested. Besides. If I\u2019m going in to space, I should understand it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Comet smiled. He had been designating teacher\u2019s pet in each class, but so far Ben was at the top. Besides, he was still interested in that medallion. \u201cBen. I\u2019m just curious. Don\u2019t hold it to me, but where did you happen to find that stone around your neck. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s tone a little more serious \u201cIf you want to know\u2026 I might tell you after school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone grew quiet. Ben had never use any tone besides his usual cheery one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ben laughed \u201cGotcha! I\u2019ve been waiting to use that tone. The stone\u2019s been in my family for a long time. Supposedly, it came crashing down from the heavens, and my family has cherished it ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Comet was silent. He has more to tell. I\u2019m sure of it. \u201cThat\u2019s really interesting. Maybe you can tell me more, but not now. I have a whole agenda to get through before the bell rings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, he went through a list of percentages, and stories about how people thought the stars had come about and the origins of the universe. He was practically in love with the universe. Which was totally fine in Ben\u2019s eyes. He respected people who devoted to their interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should happen now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wanted to see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crashing sound in the back of the room in the closet. Ben ran in to see Mr. Comet buries unto maps, charts, and other space related material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet \u201cLittle help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen began to dig Mr. Comet out of his mountain of stuff. Then suddenly, Mr. Comet\u2019s arm rushed out and made a grab for Ben\u2019s medallion. Ben was yanked forward, and he was shocked. Ben pulled back and Mr. Comet got yanked out of his pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat was that for?!?!\u201d He was slightly pissed, but more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet smiled innocently \u201cSorry. It was getting hard to breath. I needed to get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cSorry if I sounded rude, but this has been in my family for a long time. I\u2019d get killed it I lost or broke it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet looked a little sadden \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean  to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cIts ok. This is very durable. I put it through a lot worse. You kind of surprised me. That\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet jumped suddenly. \u201cHey Ben. Can you step outside my room for a moment?\u201d Mr. Comet seemed slightly anxious and a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cOk. Should I just come back tomorrow? I have to be somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet nodded \u201cYes. That would be good. See yah then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen left Mr. Comet\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet reaches into his pocket and pulls out a disc. It had a screen like a TV. It sizzled and vibrated. Then the shadow of an image began to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice \u201cYou have made contact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet nodded \u201cI believe so. Though, the medallion will be an obstacle. I tried using the spell you taught me to pry it out, but it proved to be more resilient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cI had anticipated as much. Study him for now. Then we\u2019ll proceed from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet \u201cUnderstood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had felt a stab of foreign energy when Mr. Comet had reached out and yanked himself out.

Come and see for yourself.\u201d The rest droned on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst block today were their electives, so Ben went to Mr. Comet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet says to the class \u201cCongratulations! You have all survived the first day of school. Lets get started right away. Turn to page one of your text book and look at the picture to the right. Tell me what you see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gave meaningful observations about starts and empty space. Ben took a different approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI see chaos held together by chaos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet raised an eyebrow. That\u2019s new\u2026 \u201cCare to explain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 the universe is always getting more chaotic. That\u2019s just how it is, but gravity pulls all that chaos into clumps thereby organizing it. Its kind of like clumping chaos into groups of chaos. The when there is so much chaos in one spot, you can get a star or a black hole! Both of which are chaotic at a microscopic and macroscopic level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet smiled. Though, inside he was feeling slightly hurt because he\u2019s going to have to do something he would rather now. \u201cKnow what? I like that. A mass of swirling chaos. I\u2019ll think about that.\u201d He pauses \u201cTurn to page 2 and begin reading.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s what the class did for the rest of the period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day: Ben, Nick, and Seth went to the boy\u2019s locker room and waited for the coaches to come out and tell them what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting, they were spotted. A group of young adults saw The 3. \u201cHey\u2026 are those seniors? I never saw them before.\u201d These kids were 18yo seniors. They were for the most part 6ft 5in and heavily built. Almost as big and Nick, but not quite. Nick was short, so it made him look bigger. Kind of like Seth as well. Ben on the other hand looked well balanced. A jack of all trades, or in this case, a jack of all sports. Tall, lean, and muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the seniors \u201cYou three! What year are you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned and face them \u201cFreshmen. You guys are seniors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seniors were shocked. These freshmen were giants! \u201cNo way! You guys are to huge to be freshmen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cWe get that a lot. We\u2019ll make it quick. You can believe us or not. Its up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seniors were still shocked. Then the biggest (the alpha male) felt as though his authority might me over turned if he didn\u2019t  show these newbies who\u2019s the boss. His name is Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cOk. I\u2019m captain letting you three know. We follow my rules. Understood?\u201d As though to make his point clear, he puffed out his chest and tried to stare down at the three. He was 6ft 5.5in, so he some could looked down of Seth and Nick, but Ben was a different story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned. He new that Ralph was creating authority through intimidation, but that wouldn\u2019t work on Ben. If he wants respect, he\u2019ll have to earn it. However, Ben would play along for now. \u201cSure. It was kind of expected since you have more experience. Also\u2026 can you get your face out of my face. I kind of have a feeling that you\u2019re trying to intimidate me. Not working just to let you know. Show me through your actions.\u201d <br>\r\nRalph was confused. This freshmen had some nerve! He gave Ben a glare, and brushed off Ben\u2019s \u2018lecture\u2019. Ralph had been using intimidation for years, and it has never failed him. He gave Ben a glare. Ralph made a silent vow to get Ben off the team, and if not that, then have he become a bench warmer or water boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had a feeling that Ralph was the reason the team lost so much. He was a horrible captain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, the coach came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Tuff and Mr. Buff were the coaches, and they were both on the strong and heavy side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuff whispered to Buff a few words and phrases. Buff looked over the Ben, Nick, and Seth and was shocked as he heard Tuff\u2019s words. He whispered \u201cSeriously? They\u2019re freshmen? 400lbs? 20reps? God!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff smiled. This could be our turn around. Everything we\u2019ve been looking for! \u201cOk. We\u2019re starting off with agility exercises. You know.. The tires and what now. Did everyone put on a uniform?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few mutters \u201cYes. We have\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff \u201cOk. Out into the field. Sprint there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began to run as fast as they could out into the fields. Ralph somewhere in the middle, so he pushed and shoved his way to the front. When he got there, he sprinted even faster. He planned on being the first in the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had other ideas. Ralph should be more humble, so Ben would help with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was feeling the pump of his heart as he ran and enjoyed being the top dog. Suddenly, he heard a thudding of feet right next to him. He looked to his right and saw that newby running right next to him like it was no big deal. Ralph picked up the speed in an attempt to breeze past Ben, but Ben had anticipated that. Ben picked up the speed and went even faster. Soon he was whizzing past Ralph. By the time Ralph had gotten onto the field, his face was red from exertion. He\u2019d never ran like that before. He\u2019d always been able to take it relatively easy. Ben on the other hand was already stretching and looked totally fine. As though that wasn\u2019t to hard of a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff look from far off and had seen his top dog racing the new kid. He turned to Tuff \u201cDid you see that! That kid has speed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuff nodded \u201cTold you. He could be the next quarterback. I don\u2019t know how Ralph would feel about that though. He\u2019s\u2026 well\u2026 you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff \u201cHe\u2019s used to be good in sportsmanship. Maybe this will be a good wake up call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuff \u201cYah\u2026\u201d That he pointed out \u201cWe should get down that. The other boys are almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey get in a gold cart and drive down to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff \u201cEveryone! Make two lined. Ben and Ralph in the front!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Ralph stood in front of the tires and waiting for the call to be told to go. Ralph had caught his breath and was sneering at Ben. He was hating Ben more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff \u201cGO!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Ralph stuck their feet in the first tire. Then the next\u2026 etc. They were an even match at first. Ben had to go a little slow that usual, but he quickly understood the footwork and went faster. He started to gain a lead ahead of Ralph. Ralph saw this and began to speed up. Then suddenly, he tripped since he wasn\u2019t used to this new speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he got up, Ben was already done. He grumbled and finished his course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff was astonished again! \u201cTuff. It wasn\u2019t just me who saw that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuff shook his head \u201cNo\u2026 he\u2019s amazing. I tell you! He\u2019ll bring us to nationals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff got the other players to do their course. He had gotten a bit of interest in Nick and Seth, but he was focused on Ben and Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff \u201cNext is agility. How fast can you move around something? Ralph! You\u2019re up first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled inwardly. This was his forte. He waited for the go, and went. He dodged around the cones in record time, and waited in the other side. He looked at Ben smirking. As though he were saying: \u201cBeat that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Ralph with a monotone expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff \u201cBen. you\u2019re up.\u201d Buff watched Ben attentively. He was thinking \u201cSurprise me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen got up and began to dodge around the cones beyond record time. He tall, but balanced body was easy to maneuver. Plus the fact that Ben has been training his body to the point that he understood it to near perfection. He new just how to move it so it was would always be balanced and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the other side, Ralph was dumbstruck. How????<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff was of similar reaction, but it was more joyful, and not angered like Ralph. Buff got the others to finish. \u201cNext is throwing! Each of you will throw this as far as possible, and we will also be testing for catching performance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff handed Ben a football and had prepared himself for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took the ball and threw it. It whizzed though the air. As soon as the ball left his hands, Ben ran as hard as he could and he some how maintained a speed faster that the ball he through. Then he caught it! And at the border of the field to boot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff and Tuff was awestruck. Tuff had expected his to throw it far. Not far and also catching it! Buff was of same opinion. Buff got everyone else to go. When Ralph went up, he through as hard has he could and attempted to go and catch it, but missed by mere inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuff was getting anxious \u201cFinally, tackling! Push the other as far back as possible. Ralph and Ben. You\u2019re up first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph and Ben were of relatively the same height, but differing sizes. Ralph was more like Nick. Really big and bulky, so that was one of his advantages. He had to exploit it. I fell sorry for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran at each other as fast as they could. Then they collided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud and defined cracking sound upon impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was a little groggy, so he thought he was dreaming \u201cWho are you?\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter yet. Lets just call me your fairy god father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cHuh???\u201d Ralph tried looking around for the source of the voice, but everything started to get blurry. The last thing he heard was: nighty night\u2026 sleep tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at school, its been about a week since Ralph had gone unconscious from ramming into Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ben the incident, Ben was really sorry. He had forget how dense he was. He got picked Ralph up and ran him to the nearest hospital. By the time he got there, the ambulance was just leaving. They saw Ben with Ralph and rush him into the ER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, at school, everyone was talking about Ben and how good he was tryouts. However, there was always that shroud of doubt about whether he had intentionally hurt Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome kid yelled to Ben \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat do you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid \u201cWere you mad at him? Gave him a punch no one could see? I doubt a big kid like him could have been hurt by you. Since you are smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI wasn\u2019t mad. It just happened that way. You know as well as I do that I don\u2019t resort to something as low as hurting someone else with anger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid seemed slightly chastised, but he still had a lingering doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked up to Ben \u201cIts alright. It\u2019ll blow over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the front doors opened and a kid walked down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cRalph. You back. How\u2019re your ribs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled cockily \u201cVery good actually. Good as new. No thanks to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scratched the back of his head \u201cYah\u2026 sorry about that. I guess I should have distributed the force of the impact a little more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph laughed \u201cYou know what? Its ok. I\u2019m in a good mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was  a little surprised \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. You got better pretty quickly. It usually takes people a month or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled \u201cIts in the family. We just heal quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled a sincere smile and raised his arm to shake hands. \u201cWe\u2019re cool right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled an inner smiled. He snapped his fingers and there was a black spark. \u201cWe\u2019re cool.\u201d He went to shake Ben\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Time seemed to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard this and turned toward Amy and hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph glared at Amy and made a grab at Ben\u2019s hand. Suddenly, his hand was enveloped in white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was shaking from fear and shock at what she just did. It seemed like impulse to her. She had only one goal and it was to keep Ben safe, but she couldn\u2019t get there in time. So her mana did it for her. \u201cBen. Get away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was furious at Amy. He resisted the mana as best he could. The voice had given him this power for one purpose, and he intended to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-flash back-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his dream while at the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was standing in a dark landscape surrounded by darkness. It was lit by darkness and only darkness. \u201cWhere am I\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice \u201cWelcome. This is our home and your world. Please sit down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was very confused, and tried to make sense of things \u201cSit? Where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cAnywhere. You can just make a chair if you want to. Think about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was getting more confused, but he could feel his temper rising \u201cAre you messing with me? I can\u2019t make a frigin chair appear out of no where.\u201d As he spoke, he felt the darkness in the air compress into a form. Then a chair appeared. \u201cWhat just happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cWe told you. This is your world. We have been waiting for you for a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cThis is one of the last sanctuaries the \u2018green\u2019 has not yet touched. We fear that it will be consumed some day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cSo? What does this have to do with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cIts your home as well! Your soul has been here since its creation. You vanished a millennia ago and we have waited for your return. We had lost hope for a few years when he felt the \u201cgreen\u201d on the boundaries of our world. If this world if gone, then all is lost for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cWhat do you mean us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice suddenly changed. It became louder and it seemed like there were more of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices \u201cUs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph panicked slightly \u201cWhere! I can\u2019t see you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all the shadows in the world appeared to peal off the walls of the universe and its objects. The shadows came together to form various humanoid shapes. \u201cUs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph looked at them. They went as far as the eye couldn\u2019t see. They embodied emptiness and lack of light. They were a void. However, Ralph felt a connection to them. As though they were a long lost friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadows \u201cPlease\u2026 help us, and we will help you\u2026\u201d Their voices were as hollow as before, they seemed more pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph froze where he stood, and for some unknown reason he said \u201cOk\u2026 I will help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silent wind that rushed over the world. It charged at Ralph and entered his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph felt like every molecule in his body was being charge with energy. Enough to extinguish the sun and more. Then it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices \u201cThat is out power\u2026 you it and save us\u2026\u2026.\u201d The sound echoed in the back of his mind and then he had woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-end of flashback-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph wouldn\u2019t lose. He had the power to destroy. It undo the making of things. He can do this. He focus his power on the white light attempting to end its existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt a sudden drain on his mana. The heartstone around her neck began to glow brighter and brighter. \u201cBen get away! He has some magic too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard this and regained his composure from the shock, and started to back away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the light on Ralph\u2019s hand went from white to black. The heartstone around Amy\u2019s neck stopped glowing and became a dull stone. Ben felt his strength being sapped as the heartstone tried to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph turned his attention to Amy \u201cYou! How did you do that!\u201d Ralph\u2019s face twisted in fury. His hated being humiliated. And he hated everything in general. His family, friends, and even people he didn\u2019t know. Animals\u2026 plants\u2026 rocks\u2026 everything is inferior to him and no one defies him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph made his way to Amy, and Amy froze. He hearthstone was cold to on he neck. She looked at Ben and saw that he was on the ground nearly unconscious. The stone had drained to much of his energy to sustain the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat did you do\u2026 with your hand? What\u2018s on it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph stopped and smiled. He raised his hand and looked at it \u201cNothing\u2026 absolutely nothing.\u201d He laughed as though he made the funniest joke in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt the air grow colder as that evil darkness on Ralph\u2019s hand sucked up the warmth from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Ralph in total fear. He saw Amy shuddering from the cold and suddenly, Ben\u2019s anger flared. He was out of energy\u2026 and he knew it, but nothing could stop him from doing everything he could to save Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy lay where she was shuddering from the strange presence. Then suddenly, everything seemed warmer and more comforting. He looked at her heart stone, and saw a tiny glow at the center. She looked at Ben and saw his eyes filled with fear and hate, but most of all was a piercing will to protect. She saw Ben mouthing the words\u2026 \u201cRun! Run\u2026 please\u2026\u201d then his eyes started to get all teary as he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled \u201cI think I\u2019ll get rid of you. I don\u2019t like people who oppose me. No\u2026 now at all. Since this place is mine now\u2026\u201d He began to reach for Amy when he saw her mouthing strange words. \u201cWait\u2026 what are you doing? Stop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was frantic. She was doing something she didn\u2019t want to do. The hearthstone was making her mouth words she didn\u2019t want to say. It was not listening to her, but instead, it was listening to Ben\u2019s will. Ben want it to protect Amy it all cost, and that\u2019s what it was doing. It was forcing Amy to teleport away\u2026 to some place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Ben longingly and she began to cry. Ben and Amy were connecting through their eyes and their minds. Ben mouthed \u201cBe safe\u2026 don\u2019t come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at him \u201cStop it\u2026 please. Let me stay\u2026\u201d then there was a bright light and she vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph covered his eyes from the light. When they cleared, she was gone. He let out a yell of fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Ben saw was the light and he knew Amy was some place safe. At least for now. Then he went unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When the white light passed over them, they were cured of the feeling. At least temporarily. They ran away from the source as fast as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell\u2026 except Nick and Seth. They had just arrived to see a knocked out Ben and Ralph with a hand covered in a dark aura. Then there was a purple light and Gwen appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph turned his attention to them. He was still fuming from the escape of his first target. Then he saw Nick, Seth, and Gwen. He smiled\u2026 They will have to do. He began walking towards them, but before he could even get close, he saw Gwen chanting words similar to what Amy said. \u201cNo! Stop talking. You\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d Ralph began to charge at the three. Nick and Seth saw that and made a run for it. They had a feeling that they should not be touched by the black light. Nick grabbed Gwen and ran away. Seth dashed around Ralph to get Ben, but stopped. He couldn\u2019t get around Ralph. He was just to fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had stopped chanting when she saw Seth running for Ben. She began to chant faster. She planned on teleporting everyone out, but in her haste, she forgot Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of purple and they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeplace near by, Mr. comet was laughing. He pulled out the screen. \u201cMaster\u2026 your underlings have seduced the \u2018Voyde\u2019 to join us (Voyde Rhythms with Void). You plan worked perfectly. Ben is unconscious. Should we proceed to make contact?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadowy figure in the screen chuckled a hollow chuckle. \u201cPatience. We will wait a little longer. We must test the resilience of out latest \u2018Voyde\u2019. Keep an eye on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cYes Master. I shall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow \u201cMake contact as soon as the best opportunity reveals itself. I\u2019ll let you be the judge of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cYes master.\u201d With that, the screen went black.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Ralph and Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph had started ripping the school apart by punching it and tearing at it in his anger. The dark glow on his hand began to work its way around his body until everything he touched began to dissolve into nothingness. After a moment, he calmed down and the glow faded away. He turned to look at Ben and he walked up close. \u201cFunny\u2026 you\u2019re the unconscious one now\u2026\u201d He tried to call up his power again, but it didn\u2019t come. Then suddenly, a wave of exhaustion washed over him. And he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph got up with a jolt. His whole body sore as though he had done every known exercise known to man. Even the muscles in his eye lids were sore. He tired sitting up. A hand pushed him down. He snapped his eyes open in anger. Who dares to touch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA human voice said \u201cTake it easy. you\u2019re recovering from the effects of your power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was astonished. \u201cWhat do you know about my powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cMore than you think. Any how. I\u2019m Mr. Comet, the astronomy teacher hear at this school. Though, I think its on lockdown till further notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was getting more confused \u201cOk\u2026 Mr. Comet. Care to elaborate on my powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cWell\u2026 they can destroy things basically, but you already knew that. You want to know something new. Am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cWell dah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet laughed a little \u201cWatch your tongue. There are forces in act that could kill something as insolent as a little misconduct.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph scoffed \u201cNothing is stronger that me. I look down on everything, and everything must look up to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet sighed \u201cThat\u2019s not true at all. Ben is stronger that you\u2026 the only reason he was defeated yesterday was because his true strength is sealed. He presence could eradicate you power in an instant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was to proud to accept that \u201cI doubt it. He\u2019s just a normal kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet sighed \u201cReally? Do you remember getting knocked out be Ben when you two collided? That was just a fraction of his strength. His body is beyond infinitely dense. And his strength is ever growing. The only reason the universe isn\u2019t consumed by his strength is because he has chosen to suppress his strength. That necklace around his neck is made of Gravitum, a strange metal that has limitless possibilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph couldn\u2019t believe the things he was hearing. \u201cThen I\u2019ll get rid of him now while I still can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet sighed again and shook his head \u201cI doubt you could. You power was able to bring Ben\u2019s energy to a low level because he was using it to defend Amy. Then even that was gone. That was his \u2018active energy\u2019. the energy he can use for what ever purpose. Though, he has little control over it, so he used that girl\u2019s hearthstone to send her somewhere safe. His dormant energy is still on his and waiting to be used. That energy could eradicate your power. I doubt it will let you kill him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cThan what do I do? And where is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet chuckled \u201cHe\u2019s sealed away somewhere. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll go anywhere for a while. That\u2019s the only thing we can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was wallowing in his anger. How can it be that he\u2019s stronger than me? I tore this school apart just by touching it. Suddenly, his hand developed a dark shadow, and the ground below It began to dissolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet watched it \u201cBe careful. You don\u2019t want your power to consume you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the aura around his hand vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cYou are not trained enough to use your power like you had earlier. Luckily I had a few spells that kept it at bay or else you\u2019d be dead. When you have to proper training, you can use it to an unlimited extent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled \u201cWhat training? And when do I start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet smiled \u201cNow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben was in the back of his mind. He was running as fast as his limbs could carry him. He was running from the darkness that was slowly consuming his mind. Everywhere, lights were being extinguished. He ran until he got to the back of his mind where he saw the door to his universe. It was glowing a bright green the covered a decent area of his mind. As he stepped up to hit, he felt the darkness fade away. He raised an arm to open the door. When he tried to turn the knob, it wouldn\u2019t turn. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you open?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen hadn\u2019t entered his world in a long time, so he had never noticed that the medallion had changed once again. He couldn\u2019t even get in if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something caught his eye. He looked to the side and saw the shadows coming. Suddenly they stopped. It seemed like they had hit a wall. The light from the door was repelling the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen huddle closer to the door in order to get away from the shadows. He Hasn\u2019t felt afraid like this in a long while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a crack began to from in the shield of light. It slow grew along with Ben\u2019s fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Amy:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had teleported out away from there and appeared somewhere in the future. She popped up next to Gwen in a flash of white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOh god! You\u2019re ok.\u201d Then she saw Amy\u2018s face. \u201cYou\u2019re not ok\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy fell to her knees crying. Even though Ben and Amy had agreed to be friend for now, these were the tears of a lost love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt a heavy weight on his chest when he saw someone crying. It was even heavier since he know this person. \u201cAmy. Ben\u2019s a tough guy. He can take care of himself. Trust me.\u201d Nick said it with more confidence that he had for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cSeriously. I think he\u2019s getting away right now. He won\u2019t lose so easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paused and then cried some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy said quietly \u201cHis strength is still sealed, and he can\u2019t even get the dang medallion off!\u201d he voice was full of anger and resentment towards Ralph, but it had a back drop of fear and hopelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen coughed to get her attention \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI said who are you? Describe yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stopped crying as she though. She was kind of confused. \u201cI\u2019m a 14 year old girl who has most likely lost one  of the most important people in her life. I am a scared and fearful little girl who can\u2019t even help get that person back. I\u2019m a nobody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, Gwen stomped he foot down \u201cLies! You are a strong 14 yo girl who stands for what she thinks is right and won\u2019t back down. She loves life and wants to protect it. She never gives up, but she can be dissuaded like she is right now. Hopelessness is and illusion to her and she must brush it aside. Now tell me. Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paused as Gwen\u2019s words sunk in. \u201cI am Amy. I am a person who loves Ben and a person who will get him back. I am a person who also thanks Gwen for getting her off her feet.\u201d Amy smiled as she stood up. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen did a thing with her eyes. \u201cIt was nothing\u2026 You\u2019re just easy to manipulate. Anyone who is connect to Ben is easy to manipulate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy lashed out \u201cWhat\u2019s does that make you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cA regular person. I\u2019m and exception to the rule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed a hopeful laugh. It was full of confidence and joy at the prospect of saving Ben. The sound filled Seth and Nick with joy, and it gave Gwen a bit of satisfaction. Then she got serious \u201cLets make a plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Ralph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph let out a yell of pain. Comet was chanting a series of words that were meant to heal and repair. Ralph had just lost control of his powers again and it had backfired on him. There was a hole in his gut right now that was slowly getting smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cDone. Good as new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was panting from exhaustion. His body had calmed down, and the pain slowly subsided. He had just tried to direct his powers as certain things like he was shooting a gun. However, it didn\u2019t quite work. Comet said it was possible, but it takes practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph decided to take a break and learn a little more about himself \u201cWhat am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet smiled \u201cYou are the last \u2018Voyde\u201d That lives. You\u2019re race has slow vanished upon the creation of the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cBefore the creation of the universe, there was nothing. Its not like the nothingness of space. The \u2018emptiness\u2019 in space is \u2018something\u2019. I talking about true nothingness. Something indescribable. In this nothing, there was one being. One day, this one thing separates into countless beings. These this were made of the \u2018nothingness\u2019. They are called the \u2018Voyde\u2019. At the same time, the universe was created. The voyde were scattered all throughout it. Ever since, your numbers have dwindled to one. That is you. The shadows of the place you went to were the spirits of the voyde.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was dumbstruck, but this didn\u2019t stop him from being surprised: \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s frigin awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet smiled \u201cYes\u2026 it is awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph then got curious \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet froze \u201cI am nobody. Just an dispensable human life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph froze \u201cThen how do you know so much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet smiled \u201cYou will learn the answer to that later on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph sighed \u201cYou know what? I really hate it when adults keep things from me. I\u2019ll make you an exception. At least for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet laughed \u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cOk. Think I\u2019m good to go. Lets try that gun exercise again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey get up and Ralph managed to dissolve a chair from far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each time, another shield formed, but it was smaller. Each time, the shadowy darkness got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Ralph had finished his \u2018training\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph turned and faced the school. He held out his hand and imagined it dissolving upon itself. Suddenly, the school groaned as it collapsed and melted into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled. The action had not tired him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cGood job! You did better than the last Voyde that I trained.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled in self pride \u201cThanks. I fell like I could take on the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet smiled, but then his face grew serious \u201cI warn you. I understand your confidence, but do no approach Ben. I know that you know where he is, and that you have tried to contact him. Trust me. The seal I put on him will not be broken. Not even by you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph frowned \u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d He raised his hand and it glowed a black aura.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet frowned \u201cNo. Also, it isn\u2019t powered by me, but by a greater force. It has the same power as you, and even more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph frowned now \u201cWhy is it that everyone is stronger than me? Ben\u2019s stronger, and this thing you\u2019re talking about is stronger. How can I get stronger then both of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet sighed \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea crossed Ralph\u2019s mind \u201cYou\u2019re just stopping me. I bet you\u2019re just keeping me from my true strength. I bet I could beat Ben right here and now.\u201d He raised his glowing hand for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet paused for a moment. He pulled out the screen \u201cMaster. The boy is resilient. Should we let him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice said \u201cHe is no used to us if this continues. He is of no use right now as well. Let him dispose of himself if he wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet sighed \u201cYes master. I really thought he would be the one to turn the universe back on its self. To return you to your former glory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice \u201cI\u2019ve lived a long life. Eternal actually. I have reconciled myself to my limits. I will endure if I must.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cVery well master. I will let the boy go.\u201d with that, the transmission ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cYour making your own grave. Have fun.\u201d With that, Comet left Ralph alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled to himself. Free at last from the nagging old man. Ralph snapped his finger, and a dark hole appeared. He walked through into his universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proceeded toward the center of the dark world. There, Ben was floating in a dark sphere made from the ghosts of deceased \u201cVoydes\u201d. They were attacking his mind with their dark powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph smiled \u201cEnough! Let him go.\u201d He waited for something to happen, but nothing did. \u201cLet him go or else\u2026\u201d Ralph snapped his fingers and a hazy ball of black energy appeared. Still\u2026 nothing happened. Ralph had a enough. He through the ball at the prison, and the ball vanished. As though it had no effect. \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph tried a few more, but nothing happened. \u201cWhy Won\u2019t you break!\u201d Then he proceeded to though dozens of giant balls of emptiness at the prison. Ralph stopped once he became to tired to continue. He floated in space and tried to think of a way to get the prison to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, the gang had been preparing for that month, a plan to get Ben out. It was relatively simple. They had to find him first, and then simply transport him here. If that didn\u2019t work, they would try something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk\u2026 lets try to find him. We can use a spell to do that.\u201d Gwen began to chant a series of strange words. Slowly, a ball appeared in mid air. It showed Ben , but that was it. Everything around him was black. Total darkness..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhy is everything dark? Is he ok?\u201d Amy walked up to the ball and tried to touch Ben, but her hand just passed through the image. \u201cI\u2019ll get you soon. Just wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cCan we get to where he is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI think so. We should be able to. We just need to be sure we can get him out. Getting in and getting out are two different things. One might be easier than the other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cOk\u2026 we\u2019ll get in where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThen what are we waiting for? I doubt we\u2019ll learn anything new. Even gramps said he doesn\u2019t know where Ben is. The plumber badge isn\u2019t responding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Amy since this affects her the most \u201cShould we go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked down as she thought. \u201cYes\u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll gain any new insight, so we\u2019ll just have to place our bets on this one attempt. Everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen liked it when Amy was like this. Her confidence was contagious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dark world, Ralph had just thought of a possible way of getting Ben free. If he couldn\u2019t get Ben loose, then maybe Ben can\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The gang vanished in a flash white and purple light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reappeared in the dark universe in a flash or purple and white light. Suddenly, the light that was made was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, the gang suddenly reappeared outside. It felt like they had ran into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d He was holding his head from the head ache he just got. Everyone else was doing the same more or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIt felt like we had gotten somewhere, but got kicked out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it must have a lot of mana to stop to mana wielders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cSo how do we get in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cThe same way he got in. Which is through Ralph I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned. She had developed a hate towards Ralph. She generally forgave people like she had for Nick and Seth, but now it involved Ben and not her. She can never forgive that. \u201cLets go then! I want to give him a piece of my mind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI second that. There\u2019s no point waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk. Lets give that another show.\u201d Gwen began to chant this time and they appeared school, or where their school was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWhere are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the air grew a little colder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph chuckled \u201cThis was our high school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen were horrified. Everything was gone. The fields, the school, the \u2018life\u2019 that the area had was gone. It was just the soil now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cLooks better now. Its not as crumby now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cAre you mad! There\u2019s nothing now. The school had character. It was old, but it had creativity. Things have existed in those halls. Joys, tears, stupidity, and brilliant ideas. You eradicated it all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph laughed \u201cI know! And I enjoyed every moment. No one could stop me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cReally! How about now?\u201d The hearthstone flared a brilliant white light as it responded to her emotions. Without words, she let loose a new level of mana never before seen. It came forward like a tsunami. It surged forward as a force that was newly made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph saw it coming towards him. His will faltered a moment, but he focused on his power again. He would do everything to prove that he was above everything. Nothing could beat him. He held out his hands and focused all his power in them to contain the force of the mana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of mana froze in his hands. It was like Yin and Yang. The two sides collided and formed distinct sides. There was a silent battle of will going on. Amy was letting loose all her frustration and anger of the last month in this wave. It was meant to destroy Ralph. Ralph was sweating from the exertion. The force of her spell was different from last time. He felt his hands straining and the darkness around them began to fade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, the white light dissipated. The hearthstone stopped glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy understood why it stopped. She had calmed down now and her head cleared a little. She realized she had become obsessed with getting rid of Ralph. Then moments ago, then when she realized her reasons, she lost the will to sustain the spell. She let is go and vanish. She felt guilty for her motives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph sagged a little as the spell vanished, but then he began to laugh. \u201cSee? Nothing can stop me. Not even Ben. I\u2019ll deal with him shortly, but I have to get rid of you guys first. I think that will get him to fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was on her knees crying because she felt like she had turned into a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had seen the destructive force behind Amy\u2019s spell and was afraid of its force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth watched the spell dissipate and were glad it was gone. Their bodies were shaking from fear of the intensity of the anger that the spell released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, Seth, and Gwen saw Amy on the ground crying and ran up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIt\u2019s ok. No one was hurt. You\u2019re ok.\u201d She said reassuringly to Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy cried \u201cBut I almost killed someone! All because I hated him. Is that going to happen every time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick frowned \u201cNo. Pull yourself together. I\u2019m just happy you remembered yourself. I thought we lost you. That you had been consumed by your hate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth just nodded in agreement. They said everything he wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly laughter filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cThat\u2019s funny. You\u2026 kill me\u2026? That\u2019s a good one. I\u2019ll treat you guys.. I\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Ben\u2019s head, he was watching the whole thing through the hearthstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was crying and screaming at Amy \u201cGet away! Are you nuts.\u201d But deep inside, he was glad that she was trying to save him from the darkness. But when he heard, \u201cI\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d, he knew that Ralph wasn\u2019t kidding. Ben felt his fear turning into rage. No one threatened his friends and got away with it. Especially if its toward Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness was a foot away from Ben, and the shield was about to crack. Ben had had enough of this fear. He stood up and got ready to attack it. Suddenly, as though responding to his sudden need to protect and fight, a key appeared. Ben had a feeling as to its purpose. He grabbed the key and stuffed it into the keyhole of the door. He turned the key and heard a loud shattering sound. The darkness had broken through. It surged forward a few inches until a new force stopped it. It was even greater than before. The darkness was repelled and shot out of Ben\u2019s mind as brilliant green light flooded Ben\u2019s mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d Then suddenly, Ralph felt a pang of pain. Something had gone wrong in his universe. He opened a portal to see it flooded with green light. \u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, Ralph stepped back as he got punched be an arm. Ben stepped out of the portal. \u201cNo one threatens my friends and gets away with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph laughed and wipe off a little blood on his cheek. \u201cIt worked. Now I can kill you. That prison was the only thing stopping me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at Ralph \u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cEasy\u2026 you can\u2019t even stop me because your power is sealed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smirked \u201cReally now?\u201d Ben lifted his hand to his medallion and yanked. There was a clicking sound like when you force two magnets apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were looking at Ben, you would see that the air around Ben vibrate from the unsealing of his strength. Ben took a step, and the air moved with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph took a step back as he caught Ben\u2019s glare. It was like someone drove a sword through him. Then he regained his composure \u201cHa\u2026 is that all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as Ben\u2019s strength began to peak, he developed a green glow around his body. It was the power of the orb and creation. He felt like the world had become nothing, but the orb told him that even the smallest thing have a life, and that it should be helped. That is the power of creation. Death is part of unmaking, and that wasn\u2019t the orb\u2019s job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph saw the glow and grew a little more fearful, but he let his cockiness take over again. He got into a running stance and a darkness enveloped is body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen copied Ralph\u2019s stance and got ready to run. Then they ran and tackled each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aura around Ralph dissipated as Ben\u2019s power overwhelmed it. Then following it was the sound of ribs cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few things that were forgotten are that an earth quake had hit Bellwood and that only the high school had collapsed. Its had an old structural design that made it easy to collapse.

By the end of the day, there were enough supplies to build a couple sky scrapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, the supplies vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, a new structure stood where the old one was. It was a giant pentagon shape dome. With a smaller pentagon in the center. Surrounding the building were floating pentagonal platforms that orbited the school in a petal like formation. The school had the latest human technology, and a few very well hidden alien technology, and a few minute traces of gravitum. The school was surrounded by a large grass field, and paved with sleek solar panels protected by a stronger type of glass. The school\u2019s exterior was made of solar panels as well along with the floating panels. If you looked closely, you could see even smaller panels orbiting the larger panels. The structure was similar to that of the middle school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked up to the school and smiled contently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same day, a series of officials went and checked out the building for safety reasons.

Teachers who got their first were amazed and made a charge for the higher floors where their were more windows. All the rooms were made pretty much the same, but some had more access to the sun than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard a voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIt was you again!

This being because of the awesome gym the had gotten last year. Latest exercising equipment, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Comet had stayed with the school without incident. He and Ralph had a little chat, and Ralph came out missing something from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the year started back up, everyone was shocked by voices that got deeper, people who got taller, and other masculine things.

Solids A\u2019s, and our quarterly is to lift as much as we dare lift. I\u2019m cool with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cI bet I could be all of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph \u201cAre you kidding me? Did you get so tall you hit your head on the ceiling? I think you lost a few dozen IQ points.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYou\u2019re all just jealous of my height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cI know I am, but what are you going to do? Shoot my with calcium shots? I\u2019ll die before getting as tall as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell. Being tall is a prop, but\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Study! List the 30 largest galaxies in the universe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frown and scrunched his forehead as he thought. \u201cMy universe or this universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cThis one. Now stop joking! This is serious. You\u2019re doing good in all your classes, but you keep getting distracted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had gotten used to the consistent yelling and laughing. He mind blocked it out when she studied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick saw Gwen and snuck up behind her. He quickly covered her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cWhat\u2019s the question?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat are the major parts of the brain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Nick have been playing this game for the past month. They have to sneak up on one another and cover the other\u2019s eyes. They can\u2019t let go until the other answers a question. They pretty much new everything about the other\u2019s subject because they had done it so many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen made a list of important things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cOk. You got them.\u201d Nick uncovered her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThanks for helping me study.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cHa! Its because I\u2019m the only one who can. We spend so much time quizzing each other, I bet I could even Ace your test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI could probably learn your subject if it wasn\u2019t weight lifting. You had me quizzing you on all the muscle and how to train them! I could get a job as a weight trainer now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Gwen entertained each other for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Ralph was happy for their friends, but slightly appalled by the idea of having to give up so much freedom. The reward can\u2019t be that great. Can it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy were declared friends, but they act like super close BFF\u2019s. It was like they were in a relationship. Minus the kissing and mushy stuff. They shared everything though. Thoughts, ideas, and troubles. <br>\r\nThis is going to be a quick year.

She was as friendly as can be, but she coached like the devil. \u201cIt\u2019s a new year, so I thought I\u2019d give another sport a shot. If you don\u2019t mind having me on the crew team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Ben was like a cheat code if you put him in the right position. If he could learn to row properly, he could be the best rower in the state. Even the captain wouldn\u2019t mind so much if Ben brought the team to the Head of the Charles Regatta. \u201cSure. We\u2019re a little lacking on rowers, so we can take all the people we get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo do I meet you guys on the water platform?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the floating platforms were designed for different categories. There were the water sports like pool and crew, then track because of all the events, field sports like football and soccer, court sports like basket ball or tennis, and one for miscellaneous things like catch, or 3 legged races. Basically, the last one was for sports that weren\u2019t as competitive nation wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace \u201cYah. Practice is at 3:00. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, the whole crew team (about 14 people) were surprised when they saw Ben walking towards them. The water plat form had a series of pools, and its own river. The river was just a long loop that circled around the platform. The water even flowed for some unknown reason. It moved in a clockwise direction at a speed that can be controlled by a dial in the coaches office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain, Zeke, was just as surprised as anyone. Zeke was 6ft 5in, with a strong but tight build. His muscles were built for endurance and power because that\u2019s what is needed for crew. Height helps a little. Especially when trying to grab boats from higher racks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace \u201cYour here on time! Another minute, and you would have been sent home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSorry about that. I took a little longer than I hoped the get Buff and Tuff off my tail. They really didn\u2019t want to let me go. I don\u2019t know why they are complaining. They have 2 of the largest kids on the state, and one of the best assistant coaches. Seth and Nick could probably take anyone down, and Ralph had graduated, but decided to stay to help the team out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace \u201cWell. I think they were built for that sport. That\u2019s just my opinion. However! That\u2019s not about crew! Everyone go change quickly. Ben\u2026 grab a uniform on the way in.\u201d She told him where to find a set of spandex shorts his size, and a T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got in the locker room, he saw the boy 9 boys of the team changing quickly into their uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke had the most balance and athletic appearance in the room (besides Ben). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke smiled cheerfully at Ben \u201cWhat brings you to the crew team?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI just wanted to try something new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. We can get as many people as possible. You can see that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah\u2026 I can see that alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cWell. Its good that you joined. If you\u2019re good enough, you might make the Charles. That is\u2026 if we get a slot. We barely managed to get in last year. Since some of our players don\u2019t know how to put 110% in their rowing. Well see you by the river.\u201d He patted Ben on the back and made his way out of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boys were relatively average. 5ft 7in to 5ft 10in in height, and similar builds. It was apparent that their only physical activity was crew. They didn\u2019t even visit the weight room. Ben thought about helping the team out a bit. Their muscles were apparent, but nowhere near Zeke\u2019s build. It was clear he was a devoted rower, and did everything he could to get where he was today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys quickly finished changing and filed out. Ben did the same as soon as he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp top, Ben saw the boys running laps and warming up. Ben had long ago discovered that he didn\u2019t need to stretch or warm up. His body was changed so that it was always ready for peak performance. That doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t get tired. He can, but slower since he was built for power and endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace \u201cBen. Zeke is going to show you how to row. There are certain forms you have to follow. Follow Zeke and he\u2019ll show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked up to Zeke and saw his standing next to an machine he never saw before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cThis thing is a rowing machine, or what we call an Erge. It helps train your body and simulates rowing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk\u2026 so what do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke told Ben to sit on the seat and push or the foot stretcher. The he showed Ben the various positions. The catch, pushing off, the lean back, finish, punch out, lean forward, slide, and repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen muttered the steps and did it a few time till he got a the hang of it. He took it nice and slow as he memorized the forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cThere we go. You\u2019re a natural. Now add some power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pushed off the stretcher. There was the sound of a chain snapping and Ben flying back a couple yards. He landed with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke\u2019s mouth hung open \u201cTo much power there. Lets get you on a boat. Try not to break an oar. They\u2019re very expensive.\u201d Zeke lead the way to a boat with a slightly happier hop to his step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was just curious as to how good or bad he\u2019d be at this sport. When he got to the other rowers, they eyed him curiously. Who was he taking the place of? Since this was an 8 boat (made of 8 rowers, and a 1 coxswain). Someone would have to opt out of rowing today in order to let Ben row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace came over \u201cMark. You\u2019re off the hook today. You can go home if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was a relatively average kid except for his brains and extreme devotion to crew. \u201cWhy me! can\u2019t you take Kent out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace sighed and thought about it \u201cI want him to try your seat for today. Just to see where he fits in. don\u2019t take it personally. I want him as 7th seat today so he can follow along more easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark protested a little more, but stopped when Trace threatened to kick him off the team. He left muttering silent curses at Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen watched Mark leave and felt a little sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace \u201cOars across! One foot down. And down! Count up from bow when ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went through various drills to see Ben\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. It appeared that his only weakness is using to much strength. He nearly snapped the oar 3 times. He was currently on starboard side, to the boat would turn to port when ever he pushed off the foot stretcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace \u201cBen! Power down! You\u2019ll tip the boat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was to late though, Ben had already executed the stroke, and the boat tipped to one side and flipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started to freely float as they tried to organize themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace sighed. Ben might be more trouble than they hoped for. \u201cOk\u2026 lets get the boat back to the dock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone glared at Ben at first, but they al started laughing as they went back. They started to splash each other, etc. Tracy was on her motor boat watching them mess around. She just smiled and let them have their fun as long as they made progress towards to dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the get there, they get the boat out, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke got on land and lets out a sigh of satisfaction \u201cHaven\u2019t had that much fun in a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone soon joined him and they lay around in a circle looking up at the sky. Watching the clouds pass by as the sun went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy \u201cSo\u2026 I need comments on how practice went today. And some feed back on Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all agreed that this was a fun start to the season, and that Ben would make a nice contribution to the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side watching with jealousy was Mark. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I be the one to flip the boat.\u201d He continued to mutter and think unhappy thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day after school, everyone met up again for practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy \u201cAlright. Yesterday was a little hectic. Lets try not to flip a boat today.\u201d She gives a look at Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and so did everyone else. Someone even let out a snort and got everyone laughing. All except Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey \u201cOk. Everyone in go warm up! We\u2019re doing ab workout today. Then you\u2019re in for a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people groaned. They didn\u2019t like Tracey\u2019s surprises, but they went a long with it. Ben took it relatively easy on the warm-up since he was always ready for any physical activity. When everyone was all stretched out, Tracey had them get in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked like they had taken a shower. They were soaked in sweat and laying on the ground exhausted. Even Ben was having a hard time pulling himself together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey had a monotone expression \u201cOk. Take a 5 minute break. Stretch it out. Be back before then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome kids picked themselves off the floor and started walking off the tension in their body. Ben got up and did a quick walk/stretch, and then came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke did something similar, but he took a little longer to recover, but not to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark came back last, and just on time too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey smiled \u201cWho\u2019s ready for their surprise!\u201d She did it with a straightforward, but happy tone. All the kids groaned except Ben. He didn\u2019t know what to expect, but he knew it had to be bad. \u201c5K!\u201d (short for urging 5000 meters on a rowing machine, aka. an erg.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tried to be optimistic \u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke laughed \u201cThe 5K is relatively standard. Its how to finish it that matters. The harder you row, the faster you finish. It usually takes 20 minutes if you row at a perfect 2 min per 500m split. My fastest time was 18minutes on the erg. The others have a range of 21-23 minutes. The lowest is 25 min.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey clapped her hands for their attention \u201cOk. Everyone on an erg!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone got on an erg and strapped their feet in. They set the machine for 5000 meters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey \u201cBegin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were the sounds of whirling fans as the rowers pulled on the handle and chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery 500m, Tracey called out a power 10 (ten strokes of power). Some kids let out yells and grunts. Some counted out loud as they did their power 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke and Ben were started at a crazy 1min 45sec slip and maintained it for the first 2500m. Then after that, they slowly died down to a 1min 50sec split. The last 500m went by quickly. They rowed as hard as possible and got the split down to a 1min 30sec. They finished at 17min 35sec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey was screaming at them at the end to row harder. When they were done, she smiled \u201cGo get a drink of water. Then she said to Zeke. You work better with competition.\u201d She gave then a pat on the head and walked to scream at the other rowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke did a light chuckle, but stopped. He was sore from the exertion. \u201cGood job\u2026 for a newbie.\u201d He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let out a short laugh \u201cGood one.\u201d He felt the soreness in his muscles \u201cIs it always this strenuous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke laughed \u201cIt is now\u2026 I kind of like having you as a rival. Keeps me on my toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cYou better keep an eye open then. Stroke seat is going to be mine soon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke sighed \u201cIts not out about the seat you have, but which one you can work best in. I don\u2019t mind letting you have it if you are better at fulfilling the roll. But for\u2026 its mine.\u201d there was a hint of a sarcastic challenge as he finished talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYour on.\u201d They shake hands and start walking around encouraging the other rowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the last person is Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cMark! Give your all! This is the last 500m. Everything you\u2019ve got!!!!\u201d Everyone else was yelling and cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled inwardly. He like the attention. He was usually a side thought. His only qualm is that he is the last to finish. Why did he have to be so weak? Then he saw Ben and got jealous. Ben was a star at the school. Everyone knew him. Mark glowered inside. He wished he were Ben and that he had the athletic body. He worked hard. As hard as he could, but his body wouldn\u2019t grow to meet the size and strength requirements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw Mark slowing down as though he were distracted \u201cMark! You got this. Don\u2019t slow down.\u201d Then everyone started to chant power 10... Power 10! This got Mark back in reality and he realized that he was still rowing. He finished at 24minutes. 1min faster than last time, but not enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark finished and walked away from the group. They said good job and other encouraging phrases. The words bounced off of Mark\u2019s eardrums though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark: as senior that is expected to be valedictorian. He had a 5.0 GPA and as already receiving requests from various AV league schools. He is rather cocky and looks down on people because he is smarter than all of them. He is president of the chess club and math league. He his brain was off the charts, but his physique couldn\u2019t be any lower. That\u2019s the thing that peeves. He opt out of gym by doing crew. He knew he wouldn\u2019t do so well in gym. 80% at best. Besides, he really like crew because it was a perfect stress reliever. Though, it seems that its starting to give him some stress as well. He was jealous of everyone. He realized that he had to be the weakest on the team, and the only reason that he even got to row was because they didn\u2019t have enough players. Now that Ben was here, he was basically off the team!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark walked. The group was talking about how awesome Ben and Zeke had been. They had to get a slot in the Charles this year. Mark had spent many practices looking at Zeke\u2019s physique while want to copy it. Everything from shoulder to toe. Now, he was looking at Ben. Ben was a little bulkier than Zeke, but not to much. Mark wanted it. That body\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw Mark looking and smiled. He waved for him to come over and join the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark turned away and began to walk to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was a little confused. Was Mark ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mark headed home and thought he would do some research on Ben. Apparently, he was average until 6th grade. At which he got a super huge growth spurt that made him relatively jacked. After that, no one had come close to his size until Nick came along. Then after that, Seth and the 10 followed. However, no one has beaten him in height. He was to tall to be beaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mark looked into Ben\u2019s family. No one had anything close to Ben\u2019s height or size. Some of Ben\u2019s ancestors were big, but mostly from farming, and they had light builds. Nothing huge like Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cI wonder what happened.\u201d Mark felt that something was off. It seems a bit strange to him that Ben was the only on to ever get that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then went though his complete set of the human genome that was on his super computer. He had made all of these machines himself from older parts and some newer one as well. He got the complete genome from a friend who worked at a private company that works on translating the genome. The had recently finished with a lot of yells of success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark though of a plan to see how Ben\u2019s body really worked. He would do it by looking at the very blueprints to his body. His DNA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was relatively easy to acquire. He simply stopped by Ben\u2019s place after school and told Ben\u2019s parents that he was collecting old unneeded clothing. Lucky for him, Ben\u2019s parents had already made a box of Ben\u2019s old clothing. Ever since his growth spurt, nothing seemed to pit for long. For some reason, Ben was obsessed with one set of shorts and a T-shirt that Gramps had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny how, Mark got Ben\u2019s DNA off of his cloths. Then later the next day, when Ben had finished his lunch, he through away his trash, etc. Mark rushed over and found Ben\u2019s milk carton. There was Ben\u2019s saliva on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Mark went home and got his computer to analyze sets of DNA starting from when he was youngest up to now. Now he had to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, his computer was done analyzing all the sets of DNA. And it revealed something intriguing. Ben\u2019s DNA was the same up until the sixth grade. After that, it changed. He was originally supposed to be a short, but relatively easily muscled kid, but then that changed. His DNA made it so that he could grow to really tall heights and he can recover from fatigue easily. Which was why it was easy for Ben to strengthen his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was curious \u201cWhat exactly happened to Ben in the summer just before 6th grade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was ready to find out, but before that, he decided he wanted to synthesize the some of the proteins that the changed DNA produced. His rich friends from the company gave him a mini bio chamber. It inserted specific DNA into bacteria. And the bacteria make the protein you want. You just had to feed then occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark inserted the DNA inside and squirted a solution that was high in nutrient in to the bio chamber. It would take a while for the bacteria to make a sizable amount of the proteins that stimulates Ben\u2019s growth. A few days at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark waited\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week of suffering through crew and school finally came to the day he wanted. He began putting the chamber through a filter to collect the proteins he wanted. He was shaking with anticipation. After a moment, a glowing green pill popped out. If this did what he hoped it did, then he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about size ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe popped the pill into his mouth with a small gulp of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a while, Mark concluded that it would take time for any changes to occur, so he decided to go to bed. He left his webcam on so he could make observations later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Mark looked himself over and was amazed and disappointed to see that only one part of him had grown! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, he had a dream\u2026 (Lets just say it was rather pleasant).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality that night, a tent began to form. There was the sound of ripping boxers and a fleshy pole shot out. It grew and grew. Well\u2026 that\u2019s what the footage showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark gasped at the profound size of his new endowment! It had to be like 16in long flaccid. Who knows how long it was hard. Thinking about its size caused it to quickly fill with blood thereby answering his question. Nearly doubling in size, it grew to a monstrous 30in! Unknown size of this universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grasped his cock and it in turn sent back hundreds of pleasurable signals. Mark gasped in euphoria. Quickly, he started to jack off in his room with his giant cock and orange sized balls. They quickly inflated with cum. Like a gate opened, a flood surged forward. A gallon of cum shot out his hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown at the time, every muscle fiber in his body ripped and repaired itself as it grew a tiny bit larger! After half an hour of with a dozen orgasms, it looked like Mark had gained 10lbs of muscle. It didn\u2019t look like mush since it was distributed all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was on the floor gasping from the intensity of the pleasure, and soreness he got from his newly grown muscles. Slowly, he was able to get a grasp on reality. Mark looked on his floor and saw a pool of cum. He went and got some old shirt to soak it up. He disposed of them in the fireplace. Luckily for him, it was a weekend. His parents were on a business trip in New York.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark walked up to his mirror and was happily surprised to see that he had grown a little muscle from his latest episode. He was ready to go again, but he had to come up with an explanation. If he suddenly grew, then what would people think? He needed to work the growth in subtly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was 18, so that is basically the end of any large growth spurts. That was going to make things a little harder to explain. For Ben, he was young when his DNA changed, so his hormones could be blamed. Mark on the other hand, was nearly done. His body was stabilizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark paced for and hour\u2026 then 2 hours\u2026. Then 3 hours. It was a little past noon before he stopped pacing. He only stopped because his stomach let out a horrendous growl. Apparently, his \u2018average\u2019 sized muscles demanded more food than his previously under-average sized muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark went to the kitchen and began constructing a Mama Burga. It was basically Texas toast and a variety of Deli meats. Every time he put a new layer of meat on the sandwich, his stomach let out a growl. It wanted more meat! When Mark had finished piling up the sandwich, it was about a foot tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at the sandwich in fear, but also in desire. He was staving. With out waiting a moment more, he attacked the sandwich. It never stood a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark let out a burp in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he was overcome with a tingling sensation. Using the new fuel he just ate, his body turned it into growth. His already engorged cock extended to an unprecedented 18in long with cantaloupe sized balls. More so this time, his muscles stretched and grew repeatedly until he had gained about 30lbs of muscle. As a bonus, he even got taller. He grew from his previous 5ft 7in to a nice 6ft tall. What ever that pill was made of, it had changed his body forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark felt his cloths hug his muscle tightly and smiled. He removed the nuisance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stared at his body in awe. He couldn\u2019t even talk. After a moment, he started to laugh out of joy. After 18 years of \u2018average\u2019, he was slowly making his way above it and beyond. Mark looked in the mirror and struck dozens of poses, trying to get a glimpse at what ever power his muscles hid. He wanted to get bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark ran to his fridge and started stuffing himself with left over pizza, pasta, salad, etc. He downed it all with a gallon of milk and let out a burp of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, a tingle that was more intense than before came forward. However, this time it focused on his cock. Mark looked down at his lengthening rope and felt a surge of hormonal imbalances. He grabbed it and began to stroke as fast as he could. It was like being struck with lighting. Thousands of electrical signals shot up Mark\u2019s spinal cord into his brain tell it to feel pleasure. After a mere 10seconds, he had an orgasm. This one made him gain 10bls of muscle. Then he orgasmed 14 more times, with 5bls of muscle each. In total he made a whopping 80lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his head cleared, Mark looked at his body in total desire. He craved muscle and size now. He wanted more and he didn\u2019t care what anyone else thought! He opened cabinets and drawers and managed to scavenge a bag a bag of chips, but that wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t hungry anymore, but he would keep stuffing himself just to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mark ran to the mirror and admired his body. He wanted it to be bigger and more perfect than anyone else. He was already nearing Ben\u2019s size. This gave him a lot of satisfaction. However, there was still a problem. How was he going to explain his sudden growth? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Mark went back to pacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he stopped and went to the place where all answers are found. \u201cThe Internet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went online while brainstorming possible ideas that could explain his growth. Maybe say he got an inflatable muscle suite that got stuck, and he couldn\u2019t take it off. He put that idea aside because people would eventually find out it wasn\u2019t a suit. After another hour, the internet gave him a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the side in and advertising window, an image of a book with a strange title on it: \u201cRewritten\u2026 Its your story.\u201d Then below was a series of comments stating the satisfaction it gave to various users. It was free and it didn\u2019t even require that you give any personal information. Mark concluded that it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark clicked on the Ad and another text box appeared. \u201cYour copy will arrive in 3...2...1...\u201d When the countdown finished, his doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark raised an eyebrow in amazement: \u201cThat was fast.\u201d Mark went to the door and opened it. Outside was a box with his name on it. There wasn\u2019t a return address. Mark brought it inside and opened it up. He went through a mountain of packing peanuts. Then he pulled out an old looking leather bound book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark opened it and was amazed by what he saw. From the first page to the book mark in the middle, was his entire life written down. Mark turned around and looked out the window. Either this thing was magic, or someone has been stalking him his whole life. And the only two people who have down that were his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was a man of science, so magic was impossible, but this book said otherwise. He went to the bookmark and saw something amazing. Words were slowly appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words \u201cAnd Mark opened me up for the first time ever and read what\u2019s happening to him. He can\u2019t believe\u2026\u201d Mark slammed the book shut. \u201cNo way\u2026\u201d He put the book down and dumped everything out of the box. A smaller booklet fell out. They were the instructions on how to use the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, all you had to do was erase the part of your history you want to change and write over it. If everything goes wrong, all you had to do to fix it was burn the book and everything you changed would be reverted to what it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark wanted to say impossible, but it never hurt to try, so he did. He wanted to start small. He thought about what he wanted to change. Then he remembered the week he spent worrying about all the pimples he was getting. He turned to that page and erased the pimple part and wrote down that he always had flawless skin. The book glowed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a couple new memories appeared in his mind showing that he always had perfect skin. He still remembered having all the pimples, but the old memory felt like it was fake. Mark looked in the mirror and saw that the zit on his forehead had vanished. Mark started to shake with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark opened up the book and started reading from the very beginning. As he read, he rewrote parts he didn\u2019t like. With ever passing moment, he began to feel the changes in his history. Surrounding him were dozens of sports and academic trophies. His genetics were made so that he had grown to his current size. As he read further in, he saw that many parts had changed of their own accord. Since changes done further back affected things that were later on. Quickly, Mark became the man he wanted to be and more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made it so that he could grow every day, and no one would think the wiser. As he sat, he felt the effect of his latest change. There was a stretching sound as he gained another 10lbs in growth. Mark simply smiled and fell asleep hugging the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All weekend, Mark had been messing with his history. Trying to make it perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Amy and Gwen felt a disturbance in the mana of the universe. Mana, once it settles, follows a pattern. If you disrupt the pattern, you cause a kind ripple effect. It changes the pattern of other things as well. Mana users like Gwen and Amy have a permanently stable mana pattern which helps them manipulate mana. However, it makes them susceptible to being able to see changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time Mark erased and rewrote his history, Gwen and Amy felt a shiver up their spine and turned to look in Mark\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Amy\u2019s place, Ben and Amy were studying for a test that they would have in history. They were on the civil war\u2019s unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was about to ask Amy a question when he saw he shiver slightly. The room was relatively warm, so it couldn\u2019t be the temperature that made her shiver. Was she sick? \u201cAmy? Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stopped shivering as the new reality set in. She looked at Ben \u201cI\u2019m ok, but I felt like something just happened. Something that\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned \u201cWe should get Gwen. I think she\u2019ll know more on what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and called Gwen on his plumber badge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen pickup \u201cAmy felt it too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 she felt something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded \u201cI\u2019ll right over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of purple and Gwen appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI was wonder if I was hallucinating. However, I feel that the mana around earth is fluctuating. It\u2019s not stable like before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cEverything feels the same to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen\u2026 I think it has to do mana, so Gwen and I both use it, so we can feel it better than you can. I wonder what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk\u2026 I understand. Though, I don\u2019t think we should get to worked up about it. It might just be sun spots of something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Amy and Gwen felt a shiver run up their spines again, and they both said \u201cNo. Its important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy with a worried expression. He hoped that his necklace wasn\u2019t going to get her hurt. Because if it did, then it was his fault. \u201cSo, what are we going to do? We don\u2019t even know what\u2019s causing all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNot yet at least.\u201d Gwen faced towards Mark\u2019s direction. \u201cWe should go that way. That\u2019s where the epicenter of all this is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and so did Amy. They began walking towards the disturbance. They stop if front of a giant marble mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOh My God! This wasn\u2019t here before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy curiously \u201cWhat do you mean? This is Mark\u2019s place. His family is rich beyond belief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Ben and then at the mansion. Something was definitely off. \u201cBen. Are you ok? Look at the houses.\u201d Gwen pointed to all the average looking houses, and then at the mansion. It was so miss placed. \u201cDo you think this was here the whole time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned \u201cAre you two ok? Mark\u2019s family has been funding the town for years. Why do you guys sound like he has just appeared? I thought you two were better than this.\u201d However, as Ben spoke, he felt as though he was lying. However, he was telling the truth\u2026 he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Gwen with a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a few kid from school were passing by. Their eyes passed over the mansion like it was nothing new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI think something if affecting all their memories. This stuff was never here before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen thought for a moment \u201cI\u2019m thinking that we can tell that things have changed because we are more resilient to magical changes. Everyone else is more vulnerable. Maybe if we get Ben into his orb, his mind will clear up a bit. The effects of mana can\u2019t breach his world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOk.: Amy turned to Ben. \u201cBen\u2026 we need to get into your medallion. Its very important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed impatiently. He was getting tired of feeling crazy, but then again. Amy and Gwen have always been logical. They don\u2019t play around unless its serious. \u201cFine, but if this is a joke\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t need to say more. They knew that if they were joking, then they would lose his trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tapped his medallion and all three appeared inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ben entered his reality, he felt as though someone had pulled back a veil. The truth revealed itself. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy yelled in joy \u201cYour ok!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cSo we know it has something to do with mana. I wonder what made all those changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned \u201cWhen I was out there. I felt as though that\u2019s the way things had always been. I remember Mark as a really athletic and smart senior. He had a couple hundred awards and stuff, but now. I remember him as a super smart kid, but he wasn\u2019t as strong. I think he rewrote history. Well\u2026 at least his history. I don\u2019t remember anyone else changing. Unless it was involved with his history, it stayed the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSo he changed his past. I wonder how.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIt has to be mana. I just know it. Maybe we can revert things back to the way things were. If mana made the problem, then mana can fix it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah, but we need to know how to counter it. And to do that, we need to know what the purpose of the spell was. Then we can develop an appropriate counter spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhy can\u2019t you two just guess and check?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBecause it can have undesirable effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIts safer to find out the purpose and then create a specific spell specifically counter that on spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded in understanding. \u201cSo we just need to get in and interrogate who ever was doing all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSort of. We don\u2019t know if he\u2019s good or evil. I\u2019m just going to say greedy because it appears that this person chose only to improve his own life and no one else\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThe person we are talking about is Mark. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI looks that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk then. Lets just knock on his door and see how things go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYah, but will you remember what just happened when we get back into our universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d The three went out the exit and into reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he remember?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll have to pretend that his spell worked when we confront him. Maybe we can find out why everything is changed once we get inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, Amy and Gwen made their way up to the mansion on the hill. They walked along a gold paved walkway. When they got to the front door, an imposing polished oak door guarded the front entrance. Ben stepped forward and knock three times. They waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door opened to reveal an 8ft tall behemoth. The person\u2019s biceps were like watermelons. Their pecs were like beach balls. Their 8 pack, which showed through their rather tight shirt, was deep enough to put half your hand in. Their thighs were massive tree trunks. Not to mention the bulbous sack where their groin was. It had to contain a 20in monster with melon balls\u2026 at least!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cHey Ben. What\u2019s up? Hey! You brought Amy and Gwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYah. I thought I\u2019d show them your house since I\u2019d been in it a few time. I kept telling them how awesome it was, so they got a little jealous. You don\u2019t mind if I take them in for a look see? Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled pleasantly \u201cGo ahead. I just got a chocolate pool. There are some crackers next to it and some strawberries. Feel free to dip them into the pool. I have to go attend to something. Being a senior isn\u2019t all fun and games.\u201d With that, he turned and left. You could hear him cursing homework for all its worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and then turned to Amy and Gwen. \u201cThat was easy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cI think you two had gotten to know each other pretty when in this reality. you\u2019re both addicted fitness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scoffed \u201cI\u2019m addicted to fitness! Mark\u2019s addicted to size. There is a difference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen walked between Amy and Ben, and then passed them. \u201cIf you two are done. We have to look for something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy scratched the back of their head and let out a cough. \u201cRight\u2026 sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled inwardly. She thought to herself \u201cThose two are perfect for each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhere should we start?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cI say we visit the chocolate pool. I want some strawberries. Who knows? We might even find something there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen let out sigh of resignation. Ben\u2026 \u201cOk. it\u2019s a start. Can you show us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let the group through a few corridors until they came upon chocolate heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOh\u2026 My\u2026 GOD!\u201d There were fountains of chocolate the bled into a pool of chocolate. There was also a waterfall and small river of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLets take a break. I want to try some of this.\u201d Ben went over to a strawberry bush and plucked a plump strawberry. He dipped it into the pool and ate it. \u201cWow! That\u2019s sweet.\u201d Ben had another and another. He would have had more, Amy and Gwen were giving him a look. \u201cOk\u2026 back to searching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked around the hallways again and looked through various rooms. They were about to give up for the day when suddenly, Amy and Gwen felt shiver run up their spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw that and braced himself for a memory wipe, but it never came. Ben still remembered Mark a weak brainiac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy still felt a trace of mana that the spell just made. The ran down various halls until they came to a dead end. Ben had followed right behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were standing in front of a fireplace surrounded by a shelves of books and a few well disguised electronic devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIts behind something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked around trying to see what could be the source. Suddenly, the fire place sputtered and Mark stepped out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three stared as Mark dusted himself off. He got a little soot on himself, but other than that he was clean. He looked a little different. He was even taller than before. 9ft tall with even more abnormally large muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark saw them after a moment \u201cOh\u2026 how long were you there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLong enough o see you step out of a fireplace. What was that about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled and whispered \u201cIts my little hideout. Don\u2019t tell my parent, or they\u2019ll take that away from me. Now lets get out of here. I have to get the house cleaned up before my parents come home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWon\u2019t that take a while? It\u2019s a large house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark laughed \u201cI meant clean my room. While I\u2019m doing that. I\u2019d prefer to have my house empty.\u201d He gave Ben a look hoping that he\u2019d get the two girls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cOk Amy\u2026 Gwen. I think we should leave our host alone. He\u2019s obviously very busy.\u201d He gave Mark one last look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark mouthed thanks \u201cSo I\u2019ll let you walk yourselves out. Ben, you know the way right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah. Have fun cleaning your room. See you at practice tomorrow. I heard it\u2019s a 10k. So get some sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark groaned \u201cShe\u2019s going to make me row at a 1min15sec split the whole time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for being a giant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighed \u201cWell. What ever. Peace.\u201d With that, he turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, Amy, and Gwen started to walk out when Gwen whispered to Ben. \u201cUnseal yourself and get the book in his back pocket. I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were at the entrance, there was a clicking sound as Ben removed the medallion. Then it looked like he simply reattached it. In his back pocket, covered by his shirt, was a leather bound book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The book isn\u2019t ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cTrust me\u2026 its better we did this now before he found out what the book could really do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cTake out the book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen slipped the book out of his back pocket and gave it a look over. It looked like an old antique leather bound book. He gave it to Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThis book is the \u201cBook of Memoria\u201d, or the Book of Memory. It changes history, and in doing so, it changes that memory. It is an incredibly beneficial and dangerous Anodyn relic. It appears and disappears every now and then only to reappear in odd and unsuspecting place. We can make it vanish for the next thousand years by burning it under the next solar eclipse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo\u2026 when is that? Aren\u2018t those supposed to be super rare?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI heard there was a solar eclipse in a few day. We can do it then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk, but we need keep it safe for the time being. Ben, can you put in your medallion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSure.\u201d Ben takes the book and places it in his medallion \u201cDone. Everything is good now. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWe still have to deal with a giant Mark for now. Once we burn it, everything should return to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cSo\u2026 if everything is going to go back to normal, why don\u2019t we have a little fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy \u201cNo! Absolutely not!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was amazed at the seriousness of their tone. Ben resigned \u201cOk\u2026 I understand. Can we at least change everything that he\u2019s changed back to normal? I don\u2019t feel that its fair that he\u2019s gotten so strong so fast that he could replace the whole crew team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was about to retort that Ben wasn\u2019t so different, but Ben cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDon\u2019t say it. I sealed my strength and try to be normal. I worked for my body. He cheated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed and looked at Amy. They nodded\u2026 \u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled took the book out and opened it. He turned to the page that said that Mark found the book and erased it. He then wrote that Mark found the book and forwarded it to Ben\u2019s house. Also, Ben, Amy, and Gwen remember everything that has transpired. The book glowed a little and the old reality returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. That was a little weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell. At least we\u2019ve dealt with the problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOMG! I just forgot we have a history test tomorrow and we didn\u2019t finish studying!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy started to get a little frantic, but Gwen jumped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cYou might call it cheating, but can\u2019t you go into either of your worlds and study their for ages? Nothing will change outside right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy were silent as they looked at their saving grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGwen\u2026 have I ever told you that you were a genius?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell, you are, and don\u2019t forget it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell\u2026 get to it!

As he studied, he saw the Book of Memoria float by his head. Ben looked at it for a little while and then wonder what it would say about him. He reached out and grabbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened it, it showed to him everything about him! As he read, he found out that his DNA had changed when he first met the orb. It made it so that he could grow really tall and recover from fatigue more easily than others. However, his muscles were average. It was all his hard work that made them as large as they were. Ben was kind of glad that it was mostly his own doing that made him fit, and not the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got to the end, he thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt to change himself so that he knew all the answers to his upcoming history test. He took out a pencil and wrote in the next line that Ben knew all of US History. The book glowed, and Ben felt his head fill with knowledge. He smiled and closed his history book. He didn\u2019t need that anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen for some reason, he though of Mark and kids that were like him. Those people had a hard time training and building their muscles. Ben thought that maybe if he was able to find the most effective way of getting anyone the body they want. However, that person would have to work for it. Ben contemplated it and decided that this would be the fairest way to help people while not directly giving it to them at the same time. Ben wrote in the next line that he could somehow tell people the best way to train their body to get their desired results. Suddenly, Ben felt a window open in the back of his mind. It was like a 6th sense. He could tell people what they had to do just by looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he closed the book and let it drift away. He hoped that Amy and Gwen couldn\u2019t feel the changes inside their universe. Now, he could help a few people before the solar eclipse. When that happens, he\u2019d forget most of US History and lose the ability to help people get the results that they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen drifted in his universe for a while just thinking and relaxing. He doesn\u2019t got here often, but when he does, he takes his time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, Ben junior was still firing unprecedented amounts of cum. His cock had shrunken down to a large 30in long. (well\u2026 compared to what it was, 30in is small). The orb was still absorbing the cum, and the universe was still growing. The very space was still saturated in energy. Everything was at peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts as though once Ben\u2019s hormones had started to settle down, so did the universe. Ben looked around and fell asleep. When he woke up, he looked around once more, and nothing changed. He collected his pencils and book, and then he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of white and green light as Ben and Amy appeared. Gwen was still standing in the same place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHow was studying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cI think I have it down. It took me a few days, but I got it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cThat\u2019s good. We can quiz each other now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they quizzed each other. Gwen jumped in every now and then. Ben got most of the answers right, but he got a few wrong on purpose so that nothing felt suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day at school, everyone was at their lockers doing their business. Suddenly, a giant 6ft6in tall kid strolled in confidently. His build was very similar to Ben\u2019s (though slightly smaller), and the bulge between his legs was far larger. There was an explosion of gossip as Mark walked down the hall in his to tight sweats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned to Amy. \u201cI thought we fixed all of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSo did I, but apparently we didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWait\u2026 he\u2019s smaller than yesterday. What ever it is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the book\u2019s fault. Do you feel any external mana around him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy focused on Mark \u201cNo... Nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen caught Mark\u2019s eye and they looked at each other. Ben looked in amazement, and Mark glared. Mark\u2019s eyes said \u201cBe ready. I\u2019m the next alpha athlete.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mark walked away leaving Ben in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Ben slightly worried \u201cI don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about. You\u2019re still stronger I bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI\u2019m not worried about strength. I\u2019m worried that he got a hold of a pearl of something. I though all of those had been collected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought for a moment. Then she focused on Mark again. She sensed a faint disturbance in his mana. It felt like something that wasn\u2019t part of him before. As she focused more, she sensed a strong source of mana in his ball sack. As soon as she saw it, she recoiled because she had to much humanity to even think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw Amy recoil a little \u201cWhat happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shuddered \u201cHe has a crystal in his um\u2026 genital sack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s mouth hung open \u201cUm\u2026 Ok. So we have to get it out somehow. Minus surgery. I don\u2019t think anyone is willing. At least not right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cHow do we get it out? Its to awkward!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d If the crystal was in a pocket of a safe, Ben could muscle his way and get it, but this was a physical human body. It was just to wrong! \u201cWhat is it? Is it growthium?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYes, but not exactly. It feel familiar. It has a bit of you in it. Like it originated from you. I can\u2019t really explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo\u2026 if its from me then maybe I can manipulate it. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t think it\u2019d hurt to try. Wait till he gets in the bathroom or something. I don\u2019t want this to cause a commotion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded in agreement and waited a few minutes. Before homeroom, Mark walked into the bathroom. As he went to take a wiz from his 18in hose, Ben though of the crystal ejecting itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ben was doing this, Mark felt a tingle in his groin and started to smile. Luckily for him, he was in a stall, so no one saw his 34in erection. Mark began to stroke his cock and pump. He quickly lost himself and let out fait moans. Slowly, the pressure built\u2026 and built\u2026 and built. It didn\u2019t stop! Soon, the pleasure turned into searing pain! And it kept growing. Mark started to cry and yell. He squeezed his monster cock trying to crush what ever was lodged in it. Then the pressure became strong enough to push the blockade forward. It was like an eruption. A volcano of cum shot forward into the urinal filling it to the top where it flushed itself. At the bottom, a glowing green pill shaped crystal laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one super orgasm left Mark a goodbye present. It made him jump up to 7ft tall with more pronounced muscles and an even larger penis. Mark leaned against the wall panting from the pain he just experienced. He wanted to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeacher \u201cIs everything ok Mark? Some students reported painful yells from this stall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark spoke in between breaths \u201cYah\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 Good\u2026 Just\u2026 Need to\u2026 eat more\u2026 Fiber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeacher sighed \u201cOk. But I want you to check in with the nurse afterwards. See if you\u2019re ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cWill do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Mark zipped up his even tighter pants and left the stall. When he was out of sight, Ben slipped in and braced himself for what he had to do. He had ran and got a plastic bag, but that didn\u2019t help his situation. Ben put the bag around his hand and grabbed the crystal from the bottom of the toilet. When Ben saw the crystal, he knew that it was similar to Growthium, but it wasn\u2019t exactly that. Ben went to the sink and washed the crystal in a lot of soap and then before he picked it up, Ben washed his hands in even more soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ben left the bathroom and went to homeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark went to the nurse feeling like something was missing. He had grown considerably, and no one has confronted him. However, everyone had acted surprise upon his entrance. Maybe they thought he was a new student. That\u2019ll have to wait. When he got there, he faked being sick and got sent home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had done so that morning as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked out the result of the morning and found that his blood plasma had minute traces of a green compound. The compound got absorbed into his bones and muscle readily, so that\u2019s why there was so little in his blood. Now ever, there was none in his blood. Its like the source had vanished, or got used up. Well that could be remedied. He just had to make another crystal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark went and got his Bio-chamber and insert Ben\u2019s DNA again. Now he just had to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school today, Ben walked Amy home and then he went back to his home. When he got there, he took out the crystal and looked at it. It had a fainter glow than a pearl, but it was a deeper green. Ben decided to call gramps about it. Ben gets Gramps on the Plumber badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cMax Tennyson. What can I do for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey gramps. Its me, Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cBen! You haven\u2019t called in ages. I started to think you died before I did! You have to call more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen coughed \u201cSorry Gramps. I\u2019ve been preoccupied. I have state exams to prepare for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cNo excuses! All I need is 5minutes a week! Ok? Can you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cSure gramps. I can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk good. Now what did you call for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised the crystal up to the visual display on the badge \u201cThis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps paused and thought \u201cThat\u2019s isn\u2019t what I think it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI don\u2019t know. Its kind of like growthium.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cOk. I\u2019ll be over in a few hours. I\u2019m about a hundred miles away from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThanks gramps. See you soon. Also\u2026 you look paler. How much sun are you getting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed \u201cWe\u2019ll talk more when I get to you.\u201d Gramps hung-up after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and waited. After an hour or so, there was a honking sound. Ben looked out the window and he saw Gramps parked out front. Ben ran for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was inside, he saw something that surprised him. Gramps had gotten thinner and a little paler. He seemed like a shadow of what he was. Ben held back a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed \u201cNow I don\u2019t want any of that sappy emotional stuff. I\u2019ve lived happily, and that\u2019s that. Now show me the crystal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood still for a moment. Then he said in a croaked voice \u201cDoes Gwen know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps sighed \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhen will she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cJust after I finish dealing with your issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhen would you have told me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cTonight. Your dad called me over for dinner. We would have told you then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk\u2026\u201d Ben reached into his pocket and pulled out the crystal. \u201cThis is what I called you for. If its what I think it is, then you can keep it. Maybe it can help you a little. Not much, but enough so that you can live easily the rest of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled at Ben. At least he wasn\u2019t crying. Gramps was beyond proud at how Ben was able to control himself. Well\u2026 at least in his presence. Ben probably doesn\u2019t want gramps feeling sad before the moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to prolong the inevitable. Lets make the most of what\u2019s left. Ok? I don\u2019t want any special treatment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was silent \u201cOk.\u201d Then Ben\u2019s tone returned to normal. \u201cGramps\u2026 I wanted to know if you could help me find out what this crystal is. It\u2019s kind of like growthium, but Amy said it had a bit of me tied to it. I can manipulate it to an extent, but nothing to drastic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps took the crystal from Ben\u2019s hands and set it under a microscope. \u201cIt is made of growthium. That\u2019s a fact, but the atomic structure is different. It takes the form of a double helix. Kind of like DNA. Actually! It is like DNA. Your DNA I bet. What ever made this must have had access to your DNA and I don\u2019t know how they got the growthium to make this. Maybe they stole the muscle mass from something. I don\u2019t know. Maybe they stole the growthium from bacteria. Since bacteria can simply grow back, it wouldn\u2019t be to hard to take mass from bacteria and make growthium from that I guess. Someone is manufacturing growthium using your DNA as a basis/platform to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought for a moment. \u201cMark\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cMark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cMark. It was in his body. I got the crystal to eject itself out of his body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cAny idea on how he\u2018s getting your DNA?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIts not to hard. I can think of a bunch of way he can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cWell\u2026 you\u2019ll have to stop him somehow. I don\u2019t feel comfortable knowing that these crystals can be produced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. I understand.\u201d Then Ben remembered \u201cYou should come in for dinner. Dad was expecting you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps smiled \u201cOh right! Lets get to it!\u201d Ben walked out of the Rustbucket and held the door open for Gramps. Ben was heartbroken to see Gramps struggling down the stairs to get out. Gramps tripped on the last step, and Ben quickly caught him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGramps \u201cThanks.\u201d Ben set Gramps up and waited for him to regain his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled a sad smile \u201cWe should get inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went normally for the rest of the day, but everything was filled with sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lets fast forward a couple days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow: Mark went about spreading the rumor that he didn\u2019t know how he grew. He blamed a dormant gene in his DNA that had recently become active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after: Gramps is admitted into the hospital after he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe after that at 12:00 noon: Friends and family come together and saw their prayers to Gramps. <br>\r\n\t\t6pm: The biochamber is nearly finished with another pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow\u2026 the day after:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark collected the pill from the chamber that morning. It was a Saturday, so his parents were out of state. He had the house to himself. His parents had freaked out when they saw their larger son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark held a glass of water in one hand and the pill in another. \u201cHere we go again.\u201d He swallowed the pill and finished the glass of water. Then he waited. The effects came faster this time. His pants tented and tore around the groin. A giant fleshy pole shot out. It was nearly 40inlong. At the base was a pair of cantaloupes on super fertilizer! The pole shot out and got pulled back as Mark lost himself in pleasure. He pushed and pulled and did anything in order to relieve the building pressure. Then it came out. Gallons of hot white lava erupted out the volcano like cock. It rose up to the ceiling and then fell in waves. Mark gained dozens of lbs in this one episode. With each orgasm he gained a massive 8lbs. When he was done, he had gained a whopping 100lbs. He was 7ft tall now with muscles that out shown Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he calmed down, he saw that he had outgrown his cloths. His shirt was in tatters for they had no hope of containing the mountainous muscles that we call Mark. His pecs pushed 5in off his body. His shoulders were nearly 2ft apart because of its size. His neck was as thick as a tree. His biceps were giant watermelons. His 8 pack abs were cut so deep, you could fit your whole hand inside. His legs were massive Red Wood trees. Lets not forget his pride. It was a monstrous 23in long with cantaloupes for balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was on the ground panting from the episode. Once again, he pick himself off the floor and cleaned up his mess. He burnt all the paper towels in the fireplace and got ready for school. Anticipating the massive size change, he had pre bought a set of XXXL cloths. When he put them on, they hugged his muscles nicely. They showed off his size, and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he went to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, Gwen, Amy, Seth, Nick, Ralph, Amy\u2019s mom, and the rest of the Tennyson family arrived at Gramp\u2019s funeral. There were a lot of tears, but not from Ben. He was done with crying. He had done so for the past 3 nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was crying on Nick\u2019s shoulder, and Amy was crying on Ben. Seth and Ralph held a monotone expression. Seth had really like Gramps. Partly for the secret help that Gramps gave Seth on chemistry homework, but mostly for being an awesome guy to hang around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was here just because he wanted to see the man that everyone looked up to and loved. Apparently, Gramps was indeed a great man. Not behind the scenes either. He lived the secret life of a plumber, but he also helped in getting schools started and did a variety on miscellaneous acts of charity. Gramps was loved not just by humans, but aliens alike. Hundreds of light years away, a series of funerals were being held in Gramps honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood in a line in front of the coffin. Each person walked up and said something private to gramps and then left. Ben, the last person, stepped forward and placed a small disc in gramps hands. If you could see it, it was playing various videos of when Gramps, Gwen, and Ben were playing with each other as kids. Ben whispered to Ben \u201cJust in case you forget.\u201d Then Ben walked outside into the cleansing rain. As it soaked his cloths, he felt it wash away old pains. It cleansed a picture he had long forgotten. It was when he was young and vulnerable. When he was weak and unable to protect anyone. Ben felt exposed. He fell to his knees and started punching the ground. These weren\u2019t tears of the current Ben, but of the Ben from years past. Of when he was small\u2026 weak\u2026 and vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ben felt someone grasp his shoulder with a firm grasp. This hand grounded Ben. Held Ben in reality instead of letting him fall through his mind in chaos. Ben was silent for a little while. Then he muttered \u201cThanks Gramps.\u201d Then the hand ruffled Ben\u2019s hair and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had to prepare to burn the Book of Memoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go to the darkest part of the eclipse in order for the book to actually disappear for the next millennia. If not, then it will just rematerialize somewhere else. I kind of want to avoid that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. So where are we supposed to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cThe center of the school. Though it\u2019s going to be a little difficult because their will be an assembly at the time. The whole school is going to watch the eclipse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWe can just hide ourselves with mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThat\u2019s what I was planning on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Its settled. We\u2019ll burn the book during the assembly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment after, the three heard the doors open and the thudding of heavy footsteps. Ben turned and saw an even bigger Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark passed Ben, he gave Ben a glare and a smirk. \u201cYou\u2019re going down\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Mark defiantly \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled and passed Ben a note, and then he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood there holding the notes. A few dozen students saw the transaction and wondered what the note said. When Ben didn\u2019t open it, the majority of them left. Amy and Gwen stood next to Ben expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the note \u201cShowdown at Cafeteria. 12:30.\u201d Ben crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it into a nearby waste basket. He walked around the corner. Once he was gone, a snoopy teen ran up to the basket and took out the note. He passed the message on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*At Lunch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was announcement on the loud speakers \u201cAll students that wish to attend the Solar Eclipse this evening are free to attend. Sun glasses will be provided. It is recommended that you bring something to sit on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sat at the center table in the cafeteria. Then the doors open and Ben comes strolling in. Everyone watch as he walked. The air was full of excitement. No one has been a real challenge for Ben in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou called?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smirked \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark laughed \u201cTo know that you are about to become second best?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cThe feelings mutual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark frowned. He was expecting a more temperamental reaction. \u201cFine then. So Thou dust not mind having a test of strengths right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cWhat\u2019s with the medieval talk O\u2019 noble sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark laughed \u201cJust easing the mood. I want it to be a happy defeat for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s good of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark motioned for Ben to sit on the opposite end of the table. He raised his hand and left his elbow on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAn arm wrestle? Are you sure? I haven\u2019t lost yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smirked \u201cThat\u2019ll make it all the more humiliating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sat down and continued with this act of sarcasm \u201cFine.\u201d He grasped Mark\u2019s giant hand. The moment he made contact, he felt a presence inside Mark\u2019s body. It had to be the crystal Ben concluded. Maybe he can you it toward his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Flash back*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had just thrown the paper away and walked away. When he was out of site, he spoke with Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGwen, I have a question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah. What about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI want to know how well I can manipulate the crystals that Mark are making.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen thought for a moment \u201cDo you have a sample?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took out the crystal that he had acquired and gave it to Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at it for a moment and then muttered a few incantations. The crystal glowed purple a little and then it turned back to green. \u201cThe crystal is set to grow what ever it touches to an extent. However, you can change what it does since it is connected to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cSo I can make someone grow if they hold it, or make them shrink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah. Something along those line. I\u2019m assuming this has to do with Mark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End Flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen could sense that there was a crystal somewhere inside Mark, and he intended to use it. If mark thinks he can grow so easy with so little effort, then he can just as easily shrink down. Ben thought of the crystal making Mark his original size, but slowly. Slow enough that Mark wouldn\u2019t notice it right away. Ben looked at Mark and saw nothing yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at Ben with a happy glare \u201cWhat are we waiting for? Are you stalling? Trying to enjoy your last few seconds as number one?\u201d All his talking was giving Ben more time too. The irony\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smirked inwardly and saw a slight difference in Mark\u2019s size. He had shrunk about an inch now and slowly getting smaller. \u201cI\u2019m not stalling. I\u2019m just waiting for someone to step forward and get the match started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark paused \u201cOh. Fine then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone in the crowd stepped forward. Funny\u2026 it\u2019s the same kid that refereed Ben\u2019s previous matched. Remember him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid set his hand on top of Mark and Ben\u2019s hands. \u201cWhen I let go in 3... 2... 1... Wrestle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Ben pushed arm against arm. Mark was surprised that Ben could put up such a fight, but then again. Ben wasn\u2019t one to go down easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared at Mark part of the time, but he had to actually devote energy in order not to lose to Mark. Ben\u2019s shoulder had started to burn sometime during the match, but that slowly eased a bit as the match wore on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Ben saw that changed in Mark was that he has shrunk significantly. Instead of being a 7ft giant, he had gone down to 6ft. His muscles went from king of the bodybuilders to a light swimmer\u2019s built. Then his jumbo 23in cock shrunk down to 5in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome students were gasping and muttering about Mark\u2019s change in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was when Mark finally realized what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cWhat\u2019s going on! When did.. How did\u2026 Noo!!!!!\u201d Mark pushed Ben\u2019s hand away and ran out of the cafeteria. To bad for him, Ben had the crystal set to \u2018original size\u2019. Mark ran into the bathroom and looked himself in the mirror. All his strength! Gone! He looked at his extremely baggy cloths hoped that there was something worth seeing underneath. He was in denial. He took off his shirt and saw that he was as big as he was before the pill. Mark fell to the ground crying. He thought about being big again and prayed that something would happen. Suddenly, he felt a tingle in his groin and hoped that it was what he thought it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stood up and went into one of the stalls. He slipped his pants and saw his penis get erect. Its size had diminished greatly compared to what it was before. Mark prayed for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grasped his shaft and felt hundreds of tendrils of pleasure run up his spine. He lost himself in it once again and started to jack  off like never before. He felt the pressure build inside, and build. It didn\u2019t stop. A part of Mark knew what was happening, but was drowned out in pleasure. So still! Hi kept going. After 15minutes, it turned into pain. Mark started to cry while at the same time feel the pleasure of it all. It was like a gun shot. The crystal was ejected out at hundred of miles per hour. The urinal cracked open as it filled with cum. Mark clung to the wall as he was about to fall over. Then he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot of commotion out of the bathroom. In the end, a teacher went in and rushed Mark into the nurses office. He was perfectly fine except for the fact that people might look at him differently from this day forward. He was naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the bathroom could be sealed off, Ben snuck in took the crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some kid just gave up and called Mark\u2019s muscle fake. They were just air, so they deflated when Ben\u2019s killer grip popped the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after lunch, kids funneled into the center of the school to see the solar eclipse. They could already see the moon in the sky, so there was a lot of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou guys ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah. I have a match.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI\u2019ll cast the spell now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk.

Everyone is looking through us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the moon was about the enter the great circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGet the fire ready. I\u2019ll get the book.\u201d Ben tapped his medallion and the book appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy found some rocks and made a stone circle to prevent the flames from spreading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was in the center of school except one person, Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark got off the bed groggily. The nurse had gone to see the eclipse as well. They don\u2019t pay her enough to stay with the kids. Mark made his was towards the assembly of students. In the center, he saw Ben, Amy, and Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Amy\u2019s spell affected everyone who was present at the time. Which was everyone but Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at Ben hatefully. He looked at Ben\u2019s sculpted body and wanted it. Then his heart skipped a beat. He looked at the thing Ben was holding. A leather bound book \u201cRewritten\u2026 its your story.\u201d The sight of it brought back dozens of false memories. Mark remembered rewriting a lot of his past, but it was erased. For some reason, he forwarded the book to Ben. \u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at the book greedily and started to make his way towards Ben. At the same time, the moon just entered the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot of \u201cOh\u2019s and Ah\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark got closer and closer, but then he saw Gwen pull out a light. \u201cNO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the area turned to Mark. He was dressed in his baggy clothing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, Gwen, and Amy turned to face Mark who was now running towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen said in a rushed speech \u201cGwen! Can we burn it yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNo. Not yet. Its has to be at the peak of the eclipse. We need a little more time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. I\u2019ll make time.\u201d Ben ran and charged at Mark. To Ben\u2019s surprise, Mark slipped between Ben\u2019s legs and continued toward the book. \u201cHow the\u2026?\u201d Ben was confused, about how Mark was able to do that, but he didn\u2019t care. He ran and charge again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was almost completely blocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was almost at the book, so Ben made one final leap and managed to grab Mark\u2019s foot. Mark fell forward and his hand hit the book out of Amy\u2019s hands and caused it to hit Gwen\u2019s lighter. The book fell to the ground burning in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cNO!\u201d Mark pushed Ben\u2019s hands off started to pound at the fire. To no avail, the fire did not go out. Mark kept pounding until his hands were all burnt and the book was a pile of ashes. \u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Gwen worried. He whispered \u201cWas it to soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen started at the book \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 It was burning when the sun was totally blocked, but it was set on fire to early. Maybe it worked. I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, then how will we know if it reappears?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI read that the mana in the air will flare for a brief moment, and then go out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhy didn\u2019t that happen last time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI think it was brought to earth instead of materializing here. We won\u2019t need to worry about it if it appears somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow fast does it reappear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAbout 1 anodyne day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow long is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201c31 hours\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo now we wait?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYup\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy poked Ben \u201cDid Mark hear all that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNo. While he was attacking the book, I cast a spell to make us invisible again, and to conceal our voices. To him, we are just an empty patch of grass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was still bent over crying. He was yelling at everyone he hated in his head. All his problems could have been solved with the book, but then \u201cThey\u201d had to burn it. He cursed Ben and his two lady friends. He would have stayed a while longer, but a teacher called his parents to pick him up. He\u2019s going to meet a psychiatrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is there something I can do with these crystals? I don\u2019t even know how they are made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWell\u2026 you could always hide them in your universe. No one can ever go there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cYah, but I want to make a more permanent solution. If its this way, then anyone can just get a little of my DNA and grow to what ever size they want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen thought for a moment \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I guess we\u2019ll just have to deal with it as the issues appear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed. \u201cOk then. I guess that\u2019s it then. Hopefully, no one else finds out how to make these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYou may want to put those away. Someone might be tempted to steal them if the secret gets out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and went into his medallion. There was a flash of green and Ben popped up in his universe. He didn\u2019t know what to do with the crystals. Would the orb absorb it? Ben floated up to his orb and clone. They were still at it! Ben  looked at his clone who had fallen asleep. It looks like the clone is in a pleasure induced coma. The orb on the other hand was still absorbing all the cum that was being produced along with the occasional star crystal and pearl. Ben held out the crystals in his pocket. They flashed once and rocketed into the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the orb began to glow a brilliant green then die down a bit. Ben looked away from the light, and when he looked back, he saw that the crystals were gone. The orb looked similar to before, but the atomic structure of it had changed. It had turned into an exact replica of Ben\u2019s DNA, but it was made of Growthium atoms. Ben was amazed that a pair of crystals did that to his orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at it and saw that it was just a super dense form of his DNA, and getting denser! Then suddenly, the orb began moving towards the clone. It was absorbing cum faster than ever! As the orb made its way towards the head of Ben Jr\u2019s cock, it let off a faint glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it touch the head of the penis, Ben Jr\u2019s eyes snapped open as he entered a new level of pleasure. Ben Jr began to make cum at an even faster rate. He absorbed the liquid energy in the universe at an even faster rate than before! But it wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb kept taking it all and when it didn\u2019t have enough, it continued forward. Suddenly, Ben jr\u2019s cock entered the orb. The orb was absorbing Ben Jr. now! It made its way up the extended shaft until it absorbed his balls too! Then the orb flared green as it absorbed the rest of Ben\u2019s clone. As soon as he was gone, the orb died down to its original glow. Ben stared at it and was surprised to see in the center of the orb was a humanoid shape that was shooting a jet of liquid. Its seems as though Ben Jr. is entering new levels of pleasure every moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, there was a sound of rushing water. Benn turned around and saw a wave of liquid energy head towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen braced himself for impact, but it never came. Ben opened his eyes and saw that the liquid was moving around him and entering the orb instead! Amazingly, the orb was releasing energy into the universe. The energy condenses into a liquid. Then the liquid enters the orb (which is a copy of Ben\u2018s universe) in order to feed Ben Jr.\u2019s everlasting orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the chaotic cycle and wonder what he had just done to the balance of his world, and himself. Only time will tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben looked one last time to see if anything else changes. What he saw was that liquid was seeping in through the extended boundaries of his universe and rushing towards the orb. Along with the energy coming from the walls, there was the energy the orb was releasing into the universe that was also converted into liquid as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe concluded that since the orb was a paradox copy of this universe, anything that enters the orb also enters this universe. (Don\u2018t think to much about it. It\u2019s a paradox of coarse). Therefore, the liquid entering the orb is also entering the universe at the same time. Which means the amount of liquid is increasing beyond the exponential rate from before. This was what Ben worried about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore things got anymore out of hand, he thought he should get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of green as Ben reappeared. He looked at his medallion to check for any changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Ben\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was still looking at the orb. This was his problem. He\u2019d deal with it. \u201cNothing\u2026 Nothing that you need to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Ben slightly worries. She used to be able to tell when he was lying or not, but it\u2019s gotten harder ever since he became more mature. Actually! Ben doesn\u2019t lie anymore. Though, he might not always tell \u201call\u201d of the truth. Sometimes, he gives you part of the truth and lets you assume the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIf something is bothering you, you can tell me. We\u2019re cousins for god\u2019s sake! And if not me, you can tell Amy. She\u2019d understand you more than anyone. Including me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked up at Gwen and smiled \u201cI\u2019m serious. There\u2019s nothing you need to worry about. I\u2019m fairly sure I can deal with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Ben trying to see what he was hiding. Of course she could just use mana to get the truth, but she didn\u2019t  want to. The mind is the \u201clast sanctuary\u201d. You have to respect it. Gwen \u201cOk\u2026 but if die, then I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled at the irony in her comment \u201cWhat ever you say\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled a playful smiled, but stopped when she felt the air around her burn. Then it stopped. \u201cThe book rematerialized!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood to attention \u201cDo we know where?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cMaybe, but the mana in the air is still unsettled. It\u2019ll take a little while for it to calm down. I might be able to get a general idea of where it is, but I\u2019ll need Amy\u2019s help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019ll give her a ca-\u201d Before he could finish, Amy appeared in the room with a  blinding flash of white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cDid you feel that Gwen! I thought the earth had caught on fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah. I know. I read about the experience, but I never actually felt it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cCan we find out where it is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know about an exact location. The air is still thrumming with mana. It\u2019ll be like trying to look for land in the middle of a fog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk\u2026 Amy, I need you to supply some of the mana. I don\u2019t have the strength to locate it on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and began to channel a steady stream of mana into Gwen. Gwen on the other hand was focusing it into a locating spell. They continued until Gwen sighed and said \u201cOk. I can\u2019t get a closer location.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAt least we have a general area right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYes. Whish leads me to tell you two things. We have good news, and we have bad news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat\u2019s the good news?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cIts in town!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIts in town\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo its good and bad that its here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYes because I had a sense that it was in town, but also closer to a person we\u2019d rather not deal with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cMark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded \u201cBut its just a hunch.

We would, but he\u2019ll be smart this time around. He might make it impossible for us to get the book somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cHas anything ever been impossible for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy rolled her eyes \u201cWe\u2019re just being cautious, Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell, I could just search the town right now if you want.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mark\u2019s parent had drove him back home where they locked him in his room to give him time to reflect on what he\u2019s done. It was supposed to a time for recompense. However, for Mark, it was a time to blame everything and get angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ben showed up at crew, he was relatively satisfied. Then when he saw Ben, he saw in Ben every thing that he wasn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t athletic. He wasn\u2019t fit. He couldn\u2019t even stop sophomore bullies from bullying him, and he was a senior! He hated Ben because his body commanded respected. It had an air of authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he lay in his bed muttering curses and insults at Ben, he saw a flash of orange light on his bookshelf. Mark stood up and went to the source of it. He saw a book glowing with some words he couldn\u2019t read. Then as the light faded away, the words morphed into English. Mark reached out and grasped the book. His hands shook with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a leather bound book. Its looked fairly new and unused. It had a title \u201cRewritten\u2026 its your story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark put the book down on his desk and opened it up to the first page. The moment he read the first line, he knew the book was real. He looked over his shoulders cautiously. He\u2019d have to be smart. Ben took it once, and he could do it again just as easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sat their thinking. He had to write something that would make it impossible for anyone to take the book from him. Something that would make him the soul owner of the book. However, he knew he couldn\u2019t do that. The instructions even said that he is a user of the book. Not the owner. Its possible for him to lose the book, so he\u2019ll have to be smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe issues:<br>\r\n-He is to weak to protect the book<br>\r\n-He didn\u2019t know how Ben got it the last time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark decided that he had to be stronger in order to stop anyone who want to take it. Also, he was extra cautious of Ben. Ben got it the first time some how, but he didn\u2019t know how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark wrote \u201cI will grow until I an stronger than the person I am facing. I will also know how Ben was able to steal the book from me last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished writing, there was a faint glow, and a memory popped up inside his head. It showed Ben vanishing and reappearing with the book. All that Mark could see was that Ben had some how gotten super fast and had stolen it in a fraction of a second. Well, that won\u2019t happen again. All he had to do was challenge Ben and he\u2019d become stronger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen,  there was a tap at his window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked out the window and saw Ben sitting outside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smirked. He wouldn\u2019t be defeated so easily this time. Mark got up and walked outside his house. Ben would have to see someone slowly gain the ability to overpower him. The thought gave him some satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got outside, Ben was already waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cHello Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face was monotone \u201cMark, you shouldn\u2019t meddle with time or space. Once things are set, they should stay that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cHa! Why should I listen to you? You\u2026 you are everything I wanted to be, but not for long! I challenge you. I doubt you can beat me this time. Do you accept my challenge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at Mark defiantly \u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark let out a loud laugh. \u201cI hoped you would.\u201d Mark developed an orange glow as the new reality changed Mark. Mark got taller and taller until he was 7ft tall again. His pecs fleshed out until they tore his shirt off. They pushed out 7in. His abs were like giant muffins of steel! His shoulders were 3ft apart. His biceps looked strong enough to crush a tank. His legs were pushing each other a part a bit. And his cock hung low past his knees. \u201cI\u2019m glad you accepted. I see that it takes a man this size to take you down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Mark as he grew. When they were eye level, Mark stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo you think muscle is the only thing that can stop me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled \u201cI don\u2019t think. I know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked and studied Mark\u2019s body. So far, every person he\u2019s fought thought that massive muscles were the only way to beat him. Well, that works to his advantage. Looking at Mark, Ben could see that he\u2019s hugely bulky, and most likely very slow. If Mark grabbed Ben, then Ben could basically be done for. Of coarse he couldn\u2019t be hurt since he is to dense for that. However, if he is immobilized, then he can\u2019t remove his seal. What will happen once removes it? Ben had a sense that Mark would grow forever if Ben removed the seal. Then again, Ben could write something down real fast to prevent that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smirked \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Are you scared? Does my size intimidate you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared at Mark as though he was looking down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark saw the look in his eye. \u201cStop that! No one will ever look down on me again! I\u2019ll by the smartest and the strongest of them all!\u201d As though to prove his point, he punched the ground leaving a small crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked down at the hole and frowned. Mark used to be able to use his brain, but now he\u2019s all about brawn. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark smiled \u201cPower\u2026 I was given power, and I took as much as I could get. And I\u2019m still taking! Just you wait. I\u2019ll keep challenging people who are stronger than me until I become the strongest! You see\u2026 I made it so that I can grow stronger than the person I\u2019m fighting. I\u2019m stronger than you, so you lose!\u201d He tone was full of downplaying mockery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen rolled his eyes slightly. \u201cFine. You think your so strong. Then wait till you see this.\u201d Ben unclips the medallion. Ben felt the everything become clear as his strength sky rocketed. Nothing was an obstacle to him. He looked at Mark and scoffed at his in superior strength. Ben stood there waiting to see how Mark reacts. As he waited, he the air around him thrummed with energy and glowed a faint green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark felt as though someone hooked him up to an air compressor. The moment Ben unclipped that medallion, Mark felt himself growing.  His already abnormally large muscles exploded in growth. The grew and grew. 10ft tall\u202620ft\u2026 30ft. Mark was lost in joy, but he had a question. How strong was Ben? Mark looked at Ben got smaller and smaller. The book was making him grow until he could out match Ben in strength, but that would literally take forever! Therefore, Mark will always be weaker than Ben. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on! What did you do? How\u2026 strong are you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scoffed \u201cHow strong am I? Even I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark felt the ground beneath him get pulverized into dust under his sheer weight alone. He wanted to be looked up to and fear. This was everything he wanted! His brawny muscles told him he could end Ben right here and now, but his ever shrinking logical half was telling him that something was off. How can one adolescent teen be strong enough for you to grow this large! Mark listened to his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark raised a foot and stomped down on Ben. The ground beneath the now 150ft giant shook. Windows shattered. Pavement split. Old wooden houses collapsed. Mark felt the power in his limbs and continued stomping on Ben. He let out a roar of laughter. \u201cNo one can look down upon my now! This is what you get Ben. Who\u2019s number one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to Mark\u2019s surprise, he felt his foot being lift against his will. Mark applied some force, but it was to no avail. Suddenly, his entire leg was thrusted forward revealing Ben unharmed. \u201cI am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark gasped \u201cHow! The book\u2026 it makes me grow stronger than anyone I\u2019m fighting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat is your opponent never stops getting stronger? What if he\u2019s strong enough to eradicate a universe? You\u2019ll have to out grow untold numbers of universe before you can beat me. And you\u2019re not the first to try. They all lost. What makes you different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was screaming in his mind. Impossible! How can\u2026 \u201cHa! You almost got me there. You used the book didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s the only way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cOk\u2026 Now tell me. What happens when you burn the book?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stated \u201cIt erases everything that was changed. So?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cUse your brain! I thought you were smart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark retorted \u201cI am! That\u2019s the undeniable truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThen explain to me why I can be so strong after we burned the book at school? You\u2019ve held onto the book ever since it rematerialized. So when could I have had the time to write into it?\u201d Ben had to yell now since Mark was nearing the 500ft mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark paused as his brain tried to process what he just heard. He was in denial \u201cNo\u2026 it can\u2019t happen. You had to have\u2026 How did you get so strong?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s not important. What is important is that you give me the book so that we can sort through the mess you\u2019ve just created!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark held onto the book. Surprisingly, it had grown with him. \u201cNo! Its mine.\u201d He hugged it close to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen groaned \u201cFine. We\u2019ll do this the hard way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at Ben closely to see what he might do. Then he vanished from sight! \u201cWhere\u2019d you do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tapped Mark\u2019s giant thumb \u201cWhere are you looking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had enough time to look down to see that Ben had already slipped the book out of his hands and jumped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben fell, the book shrank down to a size that matched Ben. Before Mark could do anymore damage, Ben whipped out and eraser and erased the newest things Marks wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark saw what Ben did \u201cNO!\u201d then there was an orange flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll need to know the changes that occur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was curious \u201cSo you\u2019re ok with me using the book to help him grow a bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen pointed out her index finger \u201cJust once. This once. Amy, are you ok with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYah, but won\u2019t we burn it eventually? Mark would lose everything he gained.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cThe book has a permanent function, but don\u2019t tell anyone. The function is permanent once the book is burnt, but that\u2019s under an eclipse. I read that if you write in gold, the book will make it more permanent than in pen or pencil. However, it can still be over written if you change it before the book is burnt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen has dumbstruck \u201cSo we can make it so he doesn\u2019t shrink back? That makes life so much easier. But how do we write in gold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen frowned \u201cThat\u2019s the tricky part. I don\u2019t know how.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cCan we just use mana or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI though about that, but when I tried to actually cast a spell on the book, the book kind of swallowed the spell. It feels like it has a defense against mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow about I try going into my world and convert the energy in space into gold. I can make it appear on the pages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen thought about it \u201cThat could work. Then we can just keep the book in your world and burn it at another time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBut Won\u2019t we have to take the book out of his universe to burn it? And then the gold will just turn back into energy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI think it would be possible to burn it in Ben\u2019s world. As long as the medallion itself is located in the darkest part of the eclipse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk then. We can give that a shot when the time comes. Now we deal with Mark. Lets get into my universe!\u201d Ben was about to tap his pendant, but stopped. \u201cUmm guys. I need to tell you something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen got their serious faces on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cMy universe used to have a perfect balance, but I think I disrupted it for the worse. You know how the orb is like a paradox copy of my universe, right?\u201d Gwen and Amy nodded since they heard it once before. \u201cWell\u2026 the two crystals I got from Mark messed up the cycle. It made the orb more capable of absorbing more, so it ended up absorbing Ben Jr.\u201d There was a faint gasp from Amy. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s perfectly fine. He\u2019s just in the orb instead now. Though, the liquid energy in my universe is entering the orb to feed Ben Jr.\u2019s never ending episode\u2026 And since the orb is a paradox copy of the universe, anything entering the orb also enters the universe. Do you see where I\u2019m heading?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded with some understanding \u201cSo basically, you have an exponentially growing supply of liquid energy? The more that enter the orb, the more that appears in your universe. And I assume that the orb is also still releasing energy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSo then you also have that energy being converted into a liquid as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cSo I don\u2019t know if the pressure will build again or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry to much. I remember you saying that the medallion is absorbing some of that energy in order to strengthen itself. So I don\u2019t think that the energy will escape. I just think that the pressure inside will build unless we do something about the ever growing supply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThat\u2019s the conclusion I came to, but then I won\u2019t ever be able to go back in with out being stuck there forever doing you know what!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked down worried. She\u2019d seen how long it took Ben to get out last time years ago. Who knows how potent the energy has gotten, and how much volume of it remains? Then she had a thought. \u201cUse the book!\u201d She stood up in her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Gwen looked at Amy as though she were a saint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen jumped and hugged Amy for all she\u2019s worth. \u201cDid I ever tell you that you\u2019re a genius?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cOnly as much as you called me cute and adorable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell I\u2019ll say it again! You\u2019re a genius.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at the two \u2018friends\u2019 and smiled \u201cHe\u2019s right. I hadn\u2019t thought of that. Lets give it a shot. We should write it in pencil first and then make it gold inside Ben\u2019s universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen opened up the book and turned to a blank page. \u201cWhat should I right? The liquid gets compressed into a confined space? Or\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThat sounds good. That\u2019ll help keep it all in an area that won\u2019t be in the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cMaybe write it so the medallion can reinforce itself more. I don\u2019t want there to be a single chance for the liquid to burst out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Amy and then at Ben \u201cYah, its better to be safe than sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about what to write \u201cSo I guess I could write that the liquid energy appears but then is immediately absorbed by the orb. And that it materializes around the orb forming a super thins shell? That way, the orb can still absorb the liquid and the pressure problem is resolves. Then I could make it so that more than enough energy is absorbed by the medallion so that it is always more than strong enough to hold the liquid inside should things get out of hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy were satisfied with that and nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen proceeded to write down his length command. The book glowed orange slightly and then Ben\u2019s orb glowed green in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ben felt his heart skip a beat. The amount of liquid being formed is increasing astronomically, and it getting sucked in faster and faster than ever. In the back of his mind, he could partially feel Ben Jr. orgasming in a level of pleasure that seemed almost to painful to bare. It was inconceivable. Ben looked down at the medallion and saw it beginning to glow brighter and brighter! The light peaked and them vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, Amy, and Gwen had stare at it in astonishment. They had expected something to explode or at least a dramatic flair. Fortunately, the medallion simple got brighter and then died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his medallion and saw that it had shrunken down to the size of a large marble. Maybe an inch in radius. At the center, there was a faint glow that Ben assumed was the orb. Around it was the rest of the universe with its random shapes and stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWow\u2026 we should go in and check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen nodded, but they were wary. Amy got her hearthstone ready just incase. She would suck all three of them in to her universe if the need arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tapped his smaller medallion and they all vanished in a flash of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside His universe, everything was normal. Except for the vacancy of liquid energy. There was usually a couple dozen streams of it nearby rushing about, but now there were none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around and was surprised that nothing to bad had happened. He looked around until he came to the very center of his universe. There it was. His orb in all its green glory. You could see it pulsing with ever growing power. Like a heart beat\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen could tell that there was a thin film of liquid on the orb. He could feel the density and power in it. Other than that, everything looked fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWe should write all this in gold now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that reminded Ben of the reason they were here in the first place. \u201cSo how should we change Mark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scrunched her face as she thought \u201cHe wants to be stronger right? Why not make it a little easier for him to grow? We know he works hard for it, but his body isn\u2019t adapted for that kind of growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Gwen to see if she agreed, and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk then. Umm also, do we mind making forget about the crystals and my DNA? I don\u2019t want to have to put up with those anymore.\u201d The all agreed to that, so Ben engraved it in gold. Mark can now grow a little easier. They even gave him a height boost so that things won\u2019t get to suspicious. They gave him the growth spurt when he was a freshmen, so things would follow some type of order. Then after he started crew, he would gain a decent amount of muscle. Maybe a little more than decent. Though not as big as Zeke. Zeke was the captain, and he works by far the hardest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk. That\u2019s done. Lets get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash and they appeared back in the usual universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben went to the next day of school hopeful that Mark had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mark went down the hall Ben saw that he had bulked up considerably. He was not 6ft4in with a decent amount of muscle on him. He was just under Zeke\u2019s size. His pecs were pushing off 2in and his well chiseled 6 pack abs were shown slightly beneath his shirt. He had developed a set of broad shoulders and a strong looking back. You could see all the tiny muscles that were there. His legs were rock hard, and strong looking, though thin enough that they didn\u2019t get in the way of each other. His body was more towards spring crew. Short races that require speed and a whole lot of power. However, since he was one of the better players, he did fall crew as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark passed Ben \u201cHey Ben! You\u2019re going to love practice. We\u2019re doing 5000m races a couple of times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen made mental notes on how Mark had changed. He was friendlier now, and less self centered. He didn\u2019t call himself Mr. Superior anymore. Maybe he didn\u2019t have a need to. He had all he wanted. Brains and a decent body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen groaned \u201cWe\u2019re going to feel that tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark let out a humored laugh \u201cIf you say you\u2019re going to feel it, then the rest of us are going to feel it even worse! You recover the fastest, so we\u2019ll be feeling it for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smirked \u201cJust do some yoga or something. Stretch your muscles and get the lactic acid out of your system. Trust me, it pays off in the long run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark rolled his eyes \u201cBut no one on the crew team is as flexible as you! Well\u2026 maybe those 3 girls on the gymnastics team, but other than them, we\u2019re all practically iron nails. It hurts for us to be flexible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen patted Mark on the back as he was about to leave \u201cJust practice. It takes time. I got to go. Homeroom starts in a couple minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark waved bye as he left \u201cSee ya at practice. don\u2019t forget to hydrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThanks!\u201d And then he ran for homeroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at practice, the team was gravely disappointed. One of their rowers was moving that day and had to leave the team. However, that frees up a seat for another row which would be Mark, but in this reality, he wasn\u2019t the one picked off. Any how, there was a perfect number of rowers and the correct number of seats. The boat was faster today than ever before. At least for Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark could row at a 1:45 split for about a 1000 meters, but after that, he slows down a bit. He continues as a 1:55 for the last 4000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had improved quite a bit, so he can manage 1:40 for 2000 meters, and then drops off the a 1:50 for the last 3000m<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was working hard to keep up with his two competitors. He managed to go at a 1:40 for 1500m, and then drop to a 1:50 for the last 3500m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese statistics come off of the ergs when they were measuring their strengths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace decided that Mark, Ben and Zeke would be 3 of the 4 people in a 4 boat. The coxswain being the 5th person. She still needed one more person to be in the head of the Charles boat. Maybe she\u2019d make it a competition. Who ever rowed the hardest got the last seat. She\u2019d have to sleep on the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone got out of the boat and put it away, Trace made announced that they have a 4 boat in the Charles this fall season. Everyone was excited about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was extra excited. They did poorly last year mainly because the other rowers were relatively weak and they didn\u2019t know how to give their all. This year would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter practice, Zeke called Mark and Ben into a small group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cOk you 2. I already know that we are on the four boat. I\u2019m not being cocky.  Trace already told me. Anyway, the reason I got us here is so that we can start training together. I want us to get strong and faster. You understand? After practice starting tomorrow, we\u2019ll go to the weight room and start working out overtime. I want to leave a good mark in my senior year. I know you two can help. What do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Ben were all for it. Especially Mark. He was always ready to work out since school and learning came so easy to him. He had a lot of free time since he could just glimpse at a page and read it in a moment. He had a perfect photographic memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was ready to do just that. He worked out after school anyway, so this fit his schedule just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cNow I just need to know who the last person is. Once I know, I can start getting him buffed up for the race. He\u2019s going to need a lot of work. And I\u2019ll be ready to give it to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled nervously. He\u2019s never seen Zeke like this before. Zeke was always easy going, but hardworking. It seemed like he was totally obsessed with his race and winning. Ben hoped that Zeke would be able to remain the fun and admirable team captain that we was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day at practice, Tracey had everyone row a 5k again. This was a race to see who would be on the Head of the Charles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark: 18min 50sec<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen: 17min 40sec<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke: 17min 50sec<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing these result made Zeke wonder. Last time, the winner finished at 16min. They had to beat that time. He would get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4th person was Jake who got 20min 50sec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke looked Jake over again. He had a slim build. Really compact muscles making him look skinny, but tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cJake! Looks like you\u2019re with us. Let me fill you in with our training regimen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake walked over \u201cWhat regimen? I though we were doing this at practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke smiled \u201cTrace gave me permission to do an extended practice. We\u2019ll need it to win this year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked flabbergasted. He didn\u2019t sign up for this. He just wanted a resume builder! This was totally outrageous. \u201cNo! I don\u2019t have the spare time for an extended practice. I have to many classes. To much studying!\u201d Jake was trying to make up as many excuses as possible. Though he was really just a lazy senior with more study classes than recommended. It was his last year and he already filled out most of his requirements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke scoffed \u201cThat\u2019s not what I hear. You just sit in Tracey\u2019s room all day playing games until you have her class. Nice try buddy, but you\u2019re not off the hook.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake continued to be resistant for a few more attempts, but Zeke gave him one cold look and Jake froze where he stood. He wasn\u2019t going to get out of this alive if he kept this up. He just muttered and grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke smiled seeing that he had won the argument. \u201cOk. So today, we\u2019ll be heading to the weight room to work on our power. Legs today. Abs tomorrow. Chest the next day. Then Arms. Next week, we repeat the cycle. On Monday, we\u2019ll talk about eating habits and diets. Any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake\u2019s hand shot up \u201cAre you nuts! Who do you think you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke looked at Jake and stated \u201cI\u2019m captain and what I say is law! This is not a democracy while I am here. If we win, then I\u2019ll cut you some slack. Any other questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter practice, they went over the weight room, slightly weary, but still able. They did a bunch of squats with waits and leg presses. The whole shebang. When they were done, Zeke brought out a bunch of protein drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cDrink up. You\u2019ll need it.\u201d He handed each person one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the drinks distastefully. He preferred that his build be all natural, so he didn\u2019t use any muscle growing products. \u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019ll have some steak tonight.\u201d He pushed the drink away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke glared at Ben, but left it at that. He had \u2018some\u2019 respect for Ben\u2019s choices since Ben had enough experience to know what he\u2019s doing. He turned toward Jake and tossed him Ben\u2019s bottle \u201cHere. You\u2019ll need it more then Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake caught it and started to drink. It was the worst thing he ever tasted, but Zeke was staring him down. He just pinched his nose and finished it. Once he\u2019d finished, Zeke eased up a bit and dismissed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! Mark drank his protein drink like it was a necessity. It appears that he\u2019s used to those drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for the rest of the week. By then end, Jake was still not happy with the progress. He made them work hard and longer. Then when the day was done, he made them drink twice as much of the curse protein drink. Jake ended up with 4 and Mark had 2 and sometime 3. Ben remained at a constant 0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more week passed and they made serious gains. Everyone had buffed up a bit except Ben who some how maintained a tight build while getting stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark brought his race time down to 18min.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen:17min<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke:17min 10sec<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake : 19min<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Zeke was still not happy. He wanted an instantaneous growth in progress. This was to slow for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following week, he drove them harder than ever. Even Ben left nearly ready to collapse. And again, they made serious gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had never seriously worked out at the gym, so these new workouts were more strenuous than before which made him grow the most. In just 2 and a half weeks, he made a 20lbs gain. This is totally unprecedented! At least he gained something worth while from all his hardship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one month till the race, and Zeke wasn\u2019t lightening up at all. He kept adding more and more in order to get then below 16min. You could practically call him an obsessed tyrant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following week, Zeke started to become desperate. While Ben, Mark and Jake weren\u2019t looking, Zeke injected something into the protein drinks with a needle. He made Jake drink 5 bottle each day this week and Mark willingly drank 3 each day. Ben remained at 0 bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued and by the end of the following week, there they were making even larger gains! Jake made a huge leap and put on 20lbs. Its totally un heard of. However, he started to have a lot of acne break outs and at home one day, he saw something frightening. His family jewels had shrunk a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was having similar symptoms and had begun to suspect the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we are at the week before the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey worked out like usual, and Zeke handed out the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked at the drink \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke looked up shocked \u201cWhat? Did you just say\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cHe said no. And I\u2019m saying no today as well. You put something in those. haven\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s eyes opened a bit more as he was listening. \u201cMark\u2026 Jake\u2026 why would you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Jake turned red a bit but they said their reason soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Zeke in shock \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke looked away \u201cIt was what we needed. Look at our progress! We\u2019re so close too! Hey, I\u2019ve been drinking it to and I\u2019m fine. Look at us! I can finish in 16min 15 sec. Ben, you\u2019re at 16min already. I don\u2019t know how, but you\u2019re just that good! Mark, you have one 20sec to go! And Jake look at how far you\u2019ve come. 20min to 16min30sec! That\u2019s an immense leap of growth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake \u201cBut how do could you! You know the effects of steroids right? Did you think about how we\u2019d feel? Messing with our hormone level? Mine are barely large than raising light now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke laughed \u201cHa! Mine are raisins. Do I care? Nope! As long as we win!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cYou\u2019re insane! All you care about is winning. Look at Ben. He\u2019s at 16min and he didn\u2019t drink a single one of your protein drinks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cWell he\u2019s Ben. He has his own routine. Besides, I don\u2019t think I could have forced him to do it anyway.\u201d The he pointed to Mark \u201cYou on the other hand, I can make.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark laughed \u201cHA! Not this time. I quit. This isn\u2019t worth it. Just you wait. Once Tracey hears about this, you won\u2019t be rowing till you can afford your own boat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke looked at Mark in anger. Then his expression calmed down. \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re right. I was being crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at Zeke suspiciously \u201cKeep talking\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke slowly walked towards Mark \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been giving you guys steroids. I was being stupid. Let me make it up to you. I promise I will, but can we get through the Charles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark felt that Zeke was being sincere enough. \u201cFine, but no more steroids. You\u2019re going to give us the money to buy our own protein drinks. And recompense, I want you to get rid of all the steroid you bought. Then you\u2019ll have to make it up to Jake some how.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke held out his hands in a reconciled gesture \u201cOk. I accept those terms. What do you want Jake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked at Zeke with half hate and half confusion. He hated Zeke for feeding him steroids and he was confused because he always thought of Zeke as a cool and collected guy. Not some winning obsessed teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake \u201cI want you to\u2026 to\u2026\u201d He paused for a while \u201cI\u2019ll asked later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke smiled \u201cOk then. Consider this an I.O.U.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just stood there with his mouth open in shock. He had never expected this from Zeke. He could never look at Zeke the same way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke saw Ben\u2019s expression and felt partially guilty \u201cI\u2019m not sorry for what I did, but I will recognize that it was a mistake. I thought I was doing what was best for the boat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scoffed \u201cYou should have done it the natural way instead. It makes victory so much sweeter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke sighed \u201cI know. Can you ev\u2026\u201d He stopped the thought short \u201cNo. Don\u2019t forgive me. Just help me get the Charles over and I\u2019ll be grateful for that alone. That\u2019s all I want. I can see why you\u2019re the best athlete in the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and submitted. \u201cI\u2019ll help, but we\u2019ll being training my way after today. I have a few tricks up my sleeve. It\u2019ll be more painful than before, but the results are all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke did a face palm \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Zeke \u201cI did try. You never listened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey concluded practice and went home until tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked at a box under his desk labels trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cFine! If they won\u2019t, then I will!\u201d Zeke made his way toward the box and opened it up. \u201cHere I go.\u201d An hour later, the box is empty. (Oh dear. I thought he was smarter than this. How obsessed is he?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Ben, Jake, and Mark waited for their captain like usual. Ben led them in their stretches as they waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cI heard that Zeke wasn\u2019t in school today. I hope he didn\u2019t catch anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah, but he gave me a call. He\u2019d be here for practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake \u201cHe\u2019s taking a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud bang as the gym door slammed open. Zeke came strolling in looking a little different. He looked more bloated like he was full of water. His mobility was shot, so he fumbled his way through the gym. When he was about to fall, Ben managed to catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cZeke, what happened? You looked like you drank a tank of water and forgot to stop drinking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke pushed Ben\u2019s arms away. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine\u201d His speech was partially slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Jake glanced at each other nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke walked (sort of walked) to the bench press. He tried to lift the weight, but ended up lifting it, but then dropping it. He wasn\u2019t in control of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Zeke worried \u201cZeke. You should sit down. I\u2019ll get the guys started on the work out. You take it easy. Go home or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke waved the advise off \u201cNo! I\u2019m captain and I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d he didn\u2019t finish his sentence. He fell to the floor and started too shake violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake \u201cHe\u2019s having a seizure! Get 911!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark ran for the nearest phone and dial 911. \u201cHello? We have an emergency. Our captain is having a seizure. Yes. The high school. We\u2019re in the gym DO you want us to carry him up front? No\u2026 ok. We\u2019ll wait. Should we do anything while you\u2019re coming? Restrain him? Ok. Will do.\u201d He turned to Ben and Jake \u201cHold him down. don\u2019t let him hurt himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Jake grabbed Zeke\u2019s flailing limbs and held them down in place. Jake had a little trouble keeping his legs down. Ben was hold both arms down and was trying to keep Zeke\u2019s torso from turning everywhere. He placed a wad of paper towels in Zeke\u2019s mouth to keep him from biting his tongue off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, the doors burst open and guys in uniform carried Zeke on a  stretch out of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men had a hard time carrying the giant muscle man, so they handed it to Ben and Jake. They rushed out at a fast, but stable speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke woke up groggy and partly lost \u201cWhere am I?\u201d He looked around and saw that he was in a hospital hooked up to an IV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at his door. \u201cCome in!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom and dad enter. His mom was crying and his dad was giving him a glare. Zeke turned away avoiding the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cYou were taking steroids!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cI though we raised to better than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke continued avoid their eyes. Especially his mom\u2019s eyes. They were so sad and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cWhere did we go wrong? What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cIt was those 3 boys wasn\u2019t it? What\u2019d they do? I can sue if you just tell me they did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t them. I did it on my own. And mom. You guys did everything right. No one did anything wrong. I was going what was best for the team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cSo it was crew! Where\u2019s the honor! If you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cDon\u2019t bother telling me about honor and all that stuff. I already thought of it all. I made a huge mistake, and it almost killed me. Can we leave it at that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned to dad \u201cGive him a moment. He\u2019s a good boy. He just got a little lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed and nodded. He took his wife\u2019s hand and they walked out. They gave Zeke one last look before closing the door. There were silent whispers on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Ben, Jake, and Mark strolled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake \u201cYou doing ok? They got a gallon of that stuff out of you. You were officially dead for 16 seconds. How\u2019s it feel to join the living?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke grunted in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cNow don\u2019t be like that. Jake was just trying to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke grunted anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was glaring down over Zeke\u2019s shoulder. Zeke could feel it. The lost of respect and disappointment. He let them all down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry guys. I thought\u2026 I thought\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what I was thinking. Maybe I felt like I had to make up for you guys not using them. I don\u2019t know, but now I feel like a complete fool. Almost killing myself just because I was obsessed with winning. We you three this year. The biggest, strongest 4 boat we had ever! So I wanted to have the honor of bring this boat to first place. I wanted it to badly. I\u2019m sorry. Especially for giving you guys that poison, and for pushing you guys so hard. I had the best interest in mind at the time, but now that I look back, I feel awful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let out a short laugh \u201cOk. Good. I thought I\u2019d have to tell you myself. It sounded so much better coming from your mouth and not mine. Anyway. They say you can get back out tomorrow. You\u2019re relatively stable right now. You\u2019ll be resting over night, and you will most likely go home tomorrow. The best part is that we can still race the Charles as long as we remain drug free for the next 2 weeks. The pushed the race forward because there\u2019s a 90% change of lightning on the original date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke scoffed \u201cOk. So we meet and practice tomorrow. Ben, can you show me these exercised you mentioned later on? I\u2019m kind of curious. We\u2019ll work hard, but I won\u2019t drive you to death like before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark frowned \u201cDang. I felt like I really worked on those days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke laughed \u201cAsk Ben. He\u2019ll be giving the workout. He probably knows more than me about it considering he reached the 16 min goal with out any help from you know what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at Ben pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cI\u2019m making individual workouts because our bodies\u2019 are different. I\u2019ll make yours a little hard if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark punched the air in front of him to show his enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was settled, they\u2019d get back to their schedule the next day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Zeke hobbled slightly. His body was still a little weary from being pumped with water like a balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cHey guys. I thought of a problem yesterday. And its mostly my fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cWhat else did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cIts true we got stronger, but we also got a lot bigger and heavier. Our bodies have more mass and its broader, so it catches more wind. Ben\u2019s build is more compact, so he may weigh as much as us, I don\u2019t know, but he\u2019s more aerodynamic. I\u2019m just pointing it out since wind is a factor in whether you win a race or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shrugged it off \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to row hard to make up the difference. No biggy.\u201d He tried to make a point by flexing his now large biceps. He was a massive 200lbs of hard bulky muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell, its kind of to late to change that. We\u2019ll have to get stronger now and not gain much more volume.\u201d They left Ben alone for a moment as he though of a workout that would have remedy their problem. \u201cOk. I got it. We\u2019ll be doing a lot of aerobic this week and strength building. Aerobics will help our stamina and I\u2019ll think of a few ways to get stronger. This is going to hurt more than before. But the results are so much sweeter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3hrs later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was on the ground panting. He crawled to the water fountain and tried to drink from it, but he couldn\u2019t get up. He felt the blood pound in his ears. His muscles were screaming at him. He was regretting the fact that he asked for a harder routine than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was in a similar state, but mainly because he was already weary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was on the ground stretching. He lets out a yell as he got a cramp from stretching the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was in the best position. He was walking the work out off, but its odd because he had the hardest workout of them all. He was probably used to them after spending years training his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke said in between breaths \u201cI thought\u2026 Tracey\u2019s\u2026 workout\u2026 were hard\u2026 Ben, you\u2019re\u2026 insane!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smirked \u201cTrust me. Tracey is much harder. You\u2019re bodies are just more adapted to those than they are to my exercises. I\u2019ve been doing them for years, so I can recover faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake \u201cThen doesn\u2019t that give you less results?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo. They help me get stronger while keeping my muscle from getting huge and in the way. Speed an power is all I want, and nothing extra. My routine can be manipulated to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was still catching his breath \u201cIs it always this strenuous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cAt first, but your body gets used to it. Then you add more on top. I got a couple of my friends to help me make some smoothies. Their high in protein. They\u2019ll help you recover for tomorrow.\u201d He handed out some containers of a white blend. \u201cOh. If you\u2019re allergic to anything tell me, so I can give you a different one. We have some with fruits and other with out them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake took the smoothy and sniffed it suspiciously. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cNo. Its just a smoothy. Nothing foreign. Trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake trusted Ben enough, so he downed it in one sitting \u201cThat was pretty good. Nice use of pineapple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIt was Amy\u2019s idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke and Mark followed and complemented the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cFeeling better already.\u201d The workout and then the smoothy helped Zeke\u2019s body get out of sleep mode. It was practically as good as before he overdosed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen watched them drink the smoothies and frowned inside. He didn\u2019t lie to them, but he bent the truth a bit. Nothing was foreign, but the fruits were changed a little. He had Gwen make the fruits high in protein, etc. To help the team recover faster and get stronger as well. They were still fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen drank some water to get the strawberry seeds out of his mouth. \u201cOk. Tomorrow them. Same time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Zeke went home and ate dinner. The usual stuff. A little while after practice, he started to feel a little queasy again. He decided to sleep it off. As he slept, he didn\u2019t notice that his raisin balls were growing to the size of tennis balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after he overdosed, the testosterone levels in his body were off the charts. A couple hundred times more than they should be. It should have killed him, and would have killed him too! If not for the speed at which he was rushed to the hospital. A minute later and he would be in a rectangular ditch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body, after the traumatic experience had decided to recognize that level of testosterone as its \u2018homeostasis\u2019, so it would try to get back to it. And what\u2019s the only way it can? By making more testosterone. That\u2019s why his balls grew abnormally huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole day, he felt sick because his body was trying to get to homeostasis. Basically, they were withdrawal symptoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does this high level of testosterone do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCAUTION: DO NOT DO WHAT ZEKE DID! IT WILL MOST LIKEY LEAD TO YOUR DEATH. SO HEED THIS WARNING WELL.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zeke woke up the next morning. He sat up and was surprised by the extra weight he felt on his torso. \u201cHuh? What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke thought that he was still a little tired from yesterday, so his limbs felt heavier. With that, he pushed the notion aside and went through his morning routine. When he went to take his shower though, he was shocked. He felt a giant mass where his groin was. He looked down and gasped. He already was well endowed, but he lost a significant amount when he started on the steroids. Now it was bigger than before. A giant 11in snake hung between his legs with a pair of tennis ball balls. Seeing this, he failed to notice the fact that he had gained like 10lbs of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn impulse, he started to stroke himself. The moment he touched it, he let out a moan. It was so sensitive. He stroked faster and faster until he was thoroughly lost in it. Suddenly he felt the pressure spike and he couldn\u2019t hold it any longer. Hot white fluid shot into the air and some how landed only in the shower tub. He continued for another few minutes until he ran dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he got off the ground and looked at the tub. It was filled till it rose a around 5in. That must be like 10 gallons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was shocked \u201cI did that\u2026 what! How?\u201d Zeke was still totally confused about how this happened. Did it have to do with his binge? Or\u2026?  He ponder for a bit until he saw the time on a small clock. He rushed into the shower as soon as the tub drained out. He rushed through everything and then ran to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing baggy cloths, no one noticed his muscle growth including him. As the day continued, he felt like his cloths were getting less baggy. It was like they were getting tighter, or he was getting bigger. But people can\u2019t grow like that\u2026 can they? His bulging groin proved that things could grow that fast, but he couldn\u2019t totally believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before practice today, he ran to a scale in the gym. As he stepped in, he saw that he was 225lbs. 15lbs more than yesterday. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Then the gym doors opened revealing Ben, Mark, and Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk guys. Get stretched out. The usual.\u201d Then he saw Zeke on the scale \u201cHey Zeke. Is everything alright? You seem a little shocked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke looked at the Ben and then at the scale \u201cUmm. Its nothing. I just wanted to see how heavy I was way. I need to get stronger to pull my weight in the boat. Literally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDon\u2019t worry to much about it. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be working on until the race.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was a little distracted and gave a short reply \u201cKay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractice went the same as yesterday except for Zeke. Mark was on the ground feeling the pain from the workout. Jake was stretching himself out. Zeke however, was doing better. He recovered a lot faster than yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Zeke slightly surprised \u201cWow. You got up pretty fast. Then again, we have similar builds. Maybe you were just tired yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke looked himself over \u201cYah. That\u2019s the reason.\u201d Though he knew it was because he had grown! Somehow\u2026 someway. It happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw Zeke looking himself over. Did he look bigger? \u201cHey Zeke. You\u2019re not on it anymore right? Cause you look bigger. Yah\u2026 you are bigger. I can tell. You\u2019re shirt is clinging to your body more. It was looser yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke grunted \u201cNo. I\u2019m not on steroids anymore, but I think I am bigger. I don\u2019t know how. I kind of woke up like this. Maybe it\u2019s a side effect? Or maybe some excess testosterone in my system. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll blow over tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just nodded, but he still had a feeling it was more than that. Zeke seemed truthful enough, but he didn\u2019t sound so confident about tomorrow. \u201cAlright, but for now. Who wants a smoothy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got the other two\u2019s attention. Mark somehow got the strength to stand up and get a drink. He downed it in one go. So did everyone else. How good can the drink be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Zeke got out of bed and felt even heavier than the day before. He looked in the mirror and saw that his sleeveless-T was hugging his chest. It was almost straining to cover his torso. Zeke did a flex and the shirt ripped apart. This surprised Zeke, but not as much as it gave him a silent satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dressed in his baggiest cloths which weren\u2019t really baggy. They clung to his 6ft 6in tall body. With 5in pecs and rock hard washboard abs. His now bowling ball biceps and watermelon thighs were accented by the patterns on his cloths. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d He wanted to know just for the sake of knowing. He kind of didn\u2019t want it to stop. If this kept up, then he\u2019d get below 16min in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring school, he avoided any excess attention, so there weren\u2019t many questions. However, at practice, he knew that he would be questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark walked in \u201cWow! When did you get so huge?\u201d Mark was astonished when he saw a much larger Zeke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was standing on the scale. He had made a 30lb gain making him a heavy 255 lbs of mountainous muscle. He bet he could finish a 5k in 15minutes if he put some effort into it. \u201cToday. I don\u2019t know how.\u201d He knew there was no point in denying it. It would become common knowledge eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake walked up to Zeke and poked his giant pecs to make sure they were real. He finger made contact with solid rock. \u201cThey\u2019re real!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke laughed \u201cYou bet they are. You can\u2019t do this with fake pectorals\u201d He started to bounce his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Zeke nervously \u201cYou should go have the doctors check this out. Its not normal.\u201d Ben was a little suspicious. He knew it wasn\u2019t steroids. Those made growing faster, but not this fast. He thought it might be growthium, but he wasn\u2019t positive. It seemed unlikely considering how Zeke\u2019s been acting. Previous encounters show that people with growthium tend to keep their growth secret for a while and then go all out and attack Ben or his friend Amy. This was not the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cI know. I should, but the thing is\u2026 I don\u2019t want it to stop. I love this feeling. Of getting stronger. I don\u2019t want it to go away.\u201d He started squeezing his bicep to test its hardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wasn\u2019t as shocked as he though he\u2019d be. Zeke did go half insane over getting everyone strong enough for the race. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the race. Is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke smiled \u201cNot entirely. It will help definitely, but I just like being strong. And I don\u2019t care if you know and think its cheating. Its happening, so accept it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed. So it wasn\u2019t a relapse. Then it had to be something recent. The overdose maybe? \u201cZeke. If you don\u2019t want to see a doctor, can you at least get your testosterone level checked? I think something has happened to your level of hormones. Its just a hunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke shrugged \u201cWhatever. As long as I get to keep these babies.\u201d He kissed his giant biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was worried. What was Zeke turning into? A totally self-absorbed jock! \u201cHow about we do that now. Can you bite your finger or something. I have a test tube from chem. You can put your blood sample in there, and I can get it looked at. I\u2019ll tell you what it says.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke frowned. He didn\u2019t want to come off as emo, but he did it anyway. It was for the sake of science, he reasoned. He bit his finger and a few drops of blood formed. Ben caught them in his test tube. Ben took out the first aid kit and put a sanitary band-aid over the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cK. I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s up tomorrow. For now, lets get to work. Jake and Mark, do what you did yesterday. Once it starts getting easy, let me know, and I\u2019ll get you on another regimen. Zeke\u2026 you\u2019re with me. I think you can handle something new considering your bigger bulk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke smiled cockily and flexed \u201cA bit more than bigger.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scoffed \u201cLets get to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter practice, Ben was walking the practice off. Zeke was on the ground soaked with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cMaybe you weren\u2019t as ready as I thought\u2026 Your muscles are built differently. I\u2019ll have to make you a new regimen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke said between breaths \u201cNo\u2026 I can\u2026 keep\u2026 up with\u2026 you\u2026. Just\u2026 need\u2026 some\u2026 time\u2026. Continue\u2026 tomorrow\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cSure. The workout may or may not get easier since you\u2019ll keep growing. I don\u2019t know how effective the work out will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke laughed then stopped when he was out of breath \u201cI may not even need practice. Its more of a habit now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scoffed \u201cSure, but it\u2019s a good habit.\u201d Ben looked to see how Jake and Mark were doing. They were recovering a bit faster than before. They\u2019re getting used to the work out. Sooner than yesterday, they walked over to Ben and asked for their smoothy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen handed them out and they finished them in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cI might have to bring you guys a second serving tomorrow. I\u2019ll ask Amy if she\u2019s up to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark \u201cYou go do that. These things are amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk then. Practice is done. Get some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Ben went home and asked to borrow his mom\u2019s microscope and a type of machine that measures testosterone levels. Surprisingly, she had both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the results show?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So\u2026 basically we are nearing the end of the fall season of Ben\u2018s sophomore year.<br>\r\nAlso, don\u2019t hold me to ever correct measurement. I forgot some of their stats, so I went back and hunted for them. I missed some, so I made them on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen - Sophomore<br>\r\nAge:15 years<br>\r\nHeight: 7ft tall<br>\r\nWeight: 275lbs of strong compact muscle<br>\r\nDescription: After a lot of nagging from Amy, he was finally forced to change his hairstyle. Its was ruffled, by organized. She did his hair so that it flicked to one side a bit. It had a healthy but natural brown. Kind of earthy. <br>\r\nHis body his a towering goliath. Being the 3 tallest kid in school makes him look down 99% of the time.  His muscled torso consisted of 3in pecs, and a powerful looking 6 packs, with a shadow an eight pack. His back spread out with a large wingspan from his intense endurance training giving him a perfect V taper.  His neck was strong like a tree, but not humongous. He developed a bubble but from his endurance running among other exercises. Also from his runs and weight workouts, he created legs of pure power. When he attempted to do high jump in track, his managed an awe inspiring 7ft high jump. For long jump, he managed 15ft with a bit of effort. He could run 3minute miles for a short time, and a 2minute mile for even a shorter time. However, he prefers just to time at what ever pace he wants. He reserves these sprints for sports. Lets not forget his pride. it\u2019s a large 13in long with base ball balls. How\u2019s Amy going to take it?<br>\r\nAfter a bit of searching, I found a perfect image for Ben.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/240/d/5/d51d6957f0eeeb371313d4cd40637e2d-d2xg7d7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/2...</a><br>\r\nNow, just remember he doesn\u2019t have a watch. Also, his muscles look strong, and they are, but they don\u2019t look like they want to tear you apart. They have a friendly aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark - Senior<br>\r\nAge: Almost 18<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 5in<br>\r\nWeight:260lbs<br>\r\nDescription: He isn\u2019t as tall as Ben, or as compact. Which makes him look even bigger than he is. His pecs jut out 5in and his massive 8pack  is chiseled deep into his body. His bowling ball shoulders are only matched by his even larger medicine ball biceps. His thighs rubs against each other as he walks since they were like watermelons. However, they didn\u2019t impede his rowing. Between his thunder thighs, he had a 15in lighting rod with it is  softballs for balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke - Senior<br>\r\nAge: 18yo<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 6in<br>\r\nWeight: Has now grown to 270lbs<br>\r\nDescription: Through recent events, he had gained even more muscle, bringing him to a massive weight of 270lbs. His height has appeared to stabilize. His build is a cross between Ben and Mark. Big and bulky, but also compact at the same time. His 4in pecs were stacked on top of 8 major building blocks that we call his abs. Resting on his pecs would be bowling balls. His arms were super cantaloupes pumped with fertilizer. His legs rubbed slightly against each other as he walked. Slightly smaller than watermelons, he could snap a tree if he tried hard enough. In the middle was his own tree. It was a monster 11in with tennis balls for balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake - Senior<br>\r\nAge: 18yo<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 4in<br>\r\nWeight: 230lbs<br>\r\nDescription: Make a massive jump from his previous stick figure. He gained nearly 70lbs of muscle due thanks to Zeke and his \u2018drink\u2019. Lets hope he can maintain it. His muscles were more bulky than they were compact so he was similar to Ben in size. Think of it this way. He is proportional to Ben in size, but a bit bulkier. I\u2019ll let you guys imagine what he looks like. However, his organ is 9in long with grape balls due to the effects of steroids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth - Sophomore<br>\r\nAge: 15yo<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 2in<br>\r\nWeight: 250lbs of pure bulk<br>\r\nDescription: Unlike Ben, he went for all size. His fleshy pecs went out 7in. His 8pack abs were deep enough to fit you hand. His shoulders were like medicine balls and his biceps were watermelons. His thighs constantly touched each other, and yet, he can still run. In the middle, his organ was a larger 11in python carrying a pair of tennis balls. His giant body intimidated opposing football player making him incredibly feared. AKA - The Wall since he was practically a wall of muscle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick - Sophomore<br>\r\nAge: 15 yo<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 2in<br>\r\nWeight: 270lbs<br>\r\nDescription: His build is a fusion of Seth and Ben. He wanted power, but also the size. His pecs pushed out a big 5in. They were not as compact as Ben, but they were still huge. His 8pack abs were like muffins of steel and his bowling ball shoulder were think with muscle. His biceps were medicine balls of power. His thighs rubbed each other less than  Seth, but they did every so often. His thighs were like turkeys. Between his legs was his giant 12in python and tennis ball balls. His size, like Seth, struck fear in the opposing team, but unlike Seth, his muscles hurt more. Seth isn\u2019t as compact, or dense, so there isn\u2019t much pain. Nick was like a tank. His huge build along with its density made it hurt on impact. He\u2019s known as the Crusher due to the number of ribs broken upon impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph - Just Graduated from High School<br>\r\nAge: 19yo<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 7in<br>\r\nWeight: 270lbs<br>\r\nDescription: Basically, he\u2019s an exact copy of Nick. Big, strong, and bulky. The only difference is that he\u2019s older. Also, his man meat is a mature 13in carrying a large pair of baseballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there we go. Now we have something to look back at. Ha! Seth, Nick, and Ben are only Sophomore. How much bigger will they grow? Its pretty obvious that Ben\u2019s going to be the tallest. The two other tall kids are both juniors. Ben might dwarf them next year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back to the story. What was Zeke's testosterone levels?</span></div></div>",

There were bits of silver crystal floating around in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat are those?\u201d He asked his mom. She had a doctorate in biology and a long history with biological compounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cInteresting. This isn\u2019t your blood is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo. it\u2019s a friends. He wanted me to take a look at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cWell\u2026 I would take him to a hospital. Either he\u2019s injecting drugs into his body, or there\u2019s a high concentration of something in his body, and it is precipitating out of his plasma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYou said precipitate. Chem vocabulary for produces a solid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled \u201cYes! Now we just need to know what that solid is. I would worry since it could clog his veins and arteries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked down as he thought. \u201cI should give him a heads up asap, but he\u2019ll want to know what it is first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on que, the machine dinged and a roll of paper spilled out displaying the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked it over and covered her mouth in shock \u201cHis testosterone level are off the chart! They\u2019re hundreds of times the normal amount. He should be dead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s eyes opened in amazement. He said he was off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cBen, is something else wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his mom \u201cNo. Everything\u2019s good. I\u2019ll have to talk later. I have a phone call to make.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom \u201cOh. Ok. Dinner\u2019s done in 30min. See you down.\u201d Ben\u2019s mom left hoping that nothing was wrong with Ben\u2019s friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cThanks Mom.\u201d Ben turned back to his desk and looked at Zeke\u2019s blood again. He sighed and picked up his plumber badge (which works for intergalactic calls, or simply earthly telephones).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound dial tones going off followed by a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey Zeke.

What\u2019s my blood type?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIts AB+ (the greediest of all blood types since the owner can take all types of blood), but more importantly, I found something in your blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke heard Ben\u2019s grave tone \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI was looking and I found crystals in your blood plasma. They turned out to be testosterone! The concentration is so high that they precipitated (solidified, or to make a solid) out of solution!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke was silent for a moment \u201cWhat\u2019s it mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cIt means that if those crystals get big enough, you blood vessels will get clotted up. I\u2019m surprised it hasn\u2019t already done so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke, at home, was look in the mirror at his body in disbelief. He couldn\u2019t believe that he got it from insane amount of testosterone. He looked at his arm and was shock by what he saw. One of the large veins on his arms was pumping insane amounts of blood through his arm. However, there were tiny white dots scattered along the stream of blood. \u201cBen\u2026 we need to hurry. Someth-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Ben\u2019s end, he head the line disconnect. \u201cZeke? Zeke! Are you ok? Zeke!\u201d Ben stared at the plumber badge in shock.

Lets get Gwen over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nOne moment later, there was a purple flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Then she saw Zeke\u2019s body suspend in a bubble separated from time. \u201cHow home you don\u2019t ever call me to have a part or something? Its always in dire situations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cDire situations are my parties!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smirked at the reply. \u201cYou should change the theme later on. No one likes being stuck in the past.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen made a thinking face \u201cI\u2019ll think about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cOk. Now why\u2019s Zeke in a time pocket?\u201d<br>\r\nAt this time, there was a white flash as Amy returned to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYour back. Did you search the file?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYah. I got the computer searching, but it might take a while. There's a lot of info to comb through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Lets hope that we get an answer.\u201d Then he paused, \u201cBut more important Is that the news is good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and recounted everything that happed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI didn\u2019t know that the human body could do such a thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen frowned \u201cNeither did I, but nothing is impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYah, but it is very unlikely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed in agreement \u201cOk. Lets see what I can do.\u201d Gwen paused as she thought of some spells that could help. \u201cLets see what else is wrong with him first.\u201d Gwen cast a simply detection and reading spell to see what was going on with his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, in his time suspended body, his testosterone level was about a thousand time over the average. There were several stops clotted or near clotting with the large amounts of crystalline testosterone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk\u2026 so there are various problems. One, I can\u2019t make the crystals vanish lest you want Zeke to implode from the sudden drop in pressure. Two, I can\u2019t rip it out of him or there would be micro punctures all over his body. Therefore, my only solution is to have his body slowly move the excessive crystals to a certain spot in his body for extraction. Though that will require that he be put back in current time. I have a spell that will help the process, but it will have to be fast or he may\u2026\u201d her lack of a description told them exactly what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cThere\u2019s no other way?\u201d Gwen nodded. Ben looked down disappointedly \u201cOk\u2026 then there\u2019s no choice. We can\u2019t have him locked up in time forever.\u201d Ben turned to Amy \u201cCan you undo it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and wrapped herself on Ben\u2019s arm for comfort. She snapped her fingers and the protective white glow on Zeke\u2019s body faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen started chanting a spell immediately. She quickly developed a hazy purple glow that spread over Zeke\u2019s body as well. The she yelled \u201cAmy! Use your mana to get his heart jump started. I get most of his blood vessels unclogged, but I can\u2019t stop or they\u2019ll reform.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and channeled a steady flow of mana into Zeke\u2019s chest cavity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Zeke coughed and began to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed at that action, but she wasn\u2019t done yet. She was getting his body to create another organ to store crystal testosterone and dispose of it when the crystal got too large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so, Gwen let out a sigh of relief and exhaustion. \u201cOk. Done. He should be good for now. I can\u2019t seem to do anything to change his DNA so that it will stop mass producing HGH. However, I could get his body to make a pouch to deposit excess HGH.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat happens when it gets to full?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThen two things could happen. It could either be expelled from the body, or I could use mana to compress it for the rest of his life. Or maybe it can expel the crystal, and I make it so that the excess HGH instantly warps into the crystal. That would make it easier to explain. Since we can hide the crystal. Though, if the level of testosterone level drops, i don;t know what else will happen to him. We can only wait and see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That way, we can keep it in a safe place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded: \u201cAmy, I\u2019m going to need some help with this. Currently, the HGH is still pretty high in his blood plasma, so I wasn\u2019t to speed it along. We\u2019re going to try to get it to all go into that pouch I talked about. Ok\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cGotcha. Lets do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy walked to opposite ends of Zeke and began to chant. A series of symbols appeared on the floor and on his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was watching for signs of error, though he\u2019d never be able to tell. Suddenly, he saw what Zeke had talked about. There were miniscule white dots in his blood stream, but there were all rushing along. Slowly, their numbers dwindled to nothing as the level of HGH  dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen stopped chanting and the lights and symbols faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk. Almost done. We just need to extract the crystal.\u201d At this, Gwen began chanting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Zeke and saw a strange bulge appear near his ball sack. Suddenly, Zeke\u2019s eyes snapped open. They had a glazed look, as though he wasn\u2019t really awake. He began to jack of. Suddenly, his hardened shaft pulsed and grew longer and wider. Something dropped itself in his ball sack and began to work its way up his pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke started moaning in lust and in pain. His man hood slowly growing. By now it was about 25in long and disproportionably wide. With every pump he made, a bulge type thing moved up a couple inches. Then suddenly, there was a sudden burst and a pale green crystal fired out followed by a burning stream of his juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crystal got cemented to the wall by the onslaught of cum. However, that quickly ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke stopped pumping and fell back asleep. His engorged cock shrank down a size that was larger than before. 15in with softballs for balls. It lay limp on his muscled thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy had turned around during the ordeal, and Gwen didn\u2019t even see what happened. He vision had been flooded in purple light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen put a blanket over Zeke\u2019s  exposed organ and quickly got rid of the mess. Afterwards, he pulled the crystal from the wall. Its was a pale green ball or testosterone. Suddenly, it doubled in size. Ben dropped in it surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOh\u2026 I forgot to make it compress itself. Woops. Amy, can you take care of that? I\u2019m dry on mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSure. What\u2019s the spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThe orb is currently gained HGH from Zeke\u2019s body. All you need to do is imagine it getting compressed into a certain size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and looked at the orb on the ground. A purple light began to envelope the now soccer ball sized sphere. There was a crunch sound as it compressed itself. \u201cDone. That was easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reach down and picked up the orb. Suddenly, his medallion flash as if responding to the presence of another growing orb. \u201cHa! This thing is like a cousin to growthium. I can feel that it\u2019s structure is very similar. However there are minute differences. One being that one of them needs no power source and the other one does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWait, so growthium is basically testosterone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSimilar, but no. Growthium is made of one type of atom, however, the atoms arrange themselves a certain way. The structures are currently a copy of my DNA, but the protons and neutrons in the atom are arrange so that its similar to testosterone. So, the two compounds are like distant cousins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat would happen it we added a ton of energy? Would it act like growthium?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen paused \u201cI really don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard a loud growl. Everyone turned to Zeke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke mumbled in his sleep \u201cSo\u2026 hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shook his head and chuckled a little. \u201cI think that all the testosterone that is made takes a lot of energy. We should fix that or he\u2019ll be able to eat a restaurant out of business one day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded and made it so that his body used energy more wisely, and that when he ate food, every atom of the food would be turned into energy. That way, he won\u2019t have to eat to much, and if he does, the excess turns in to testosterone. Which is sent into the crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk then. I guess we\u2019re good. When will he wake up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Zeke\u2019s eyes snapped open and he ran for the kitchen. Ben, Amy, and Gwen just stood in the room shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Actually, even more now because of the suddenly drop in his body, and also because Zeke eats like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Zeke come to school like usual. His muscles were still the same size. He was bigger than Ben, but Ben weighed more since his work outs make his muscles really dense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke says to Ben, Mark and Jake \u201cWho\u2019s ready for practice today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cI hope the answer is yes because you\u2019re all going to die if you aren\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of practice\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was half awake on the ground. Ben had made his workout harder at Mark\u2019s request. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 killing\u2026 me\u2026 slowly\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cIts your own fault. You asked for it. Also, I told you guys to be ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Mark was Zeke and Jake. Jake was trying to sky some water but his hand shook so badly that he couldn\u2019t. Zeke was taking a nap on a bench press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWho wants smoothies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, all three teens were fully away and functional. They hands were held out in waiting. \u201cGimme.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gave each person two and they downed in a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes for another week or so, and guess what! With Ben\u2019s help. They reached their goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts now that day of their race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke did all his captain duties (ie. Give a speech, etc).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen got the team to warm up correctly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Mark were being Jake and Mark. Not in that specific order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke \u201cWe have this in the bag. Now guys, I want you all to pull 200%. We race only once, so make it count. Got it? I know it\u2019ll be competitive, so we\u2019ll have to pull all the harder. Thanks to Ben, we made to out 16min mark. Now I want it to be 15min today. Now lets get on that boat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they got on the water and rowed to the starting point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 min later, they were told to line up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 min later, they were told to row up to the starting line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 sec later, they started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir coxswain, Jenny, whom I forgot to mention was a friendly and down to earth kid, Everyone like her. However, the moment she got in the boat, if you didn\u2019t row 200%, she\u2019ll make you. She prepared a speech and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7min later, they had passed a dozen boats and Jenny was still yelling at them to row harder. \u201cCOME ONE GUYS! IS THAT ALL YOU\u2019VE GOT! I\u2019VE SEEN MY GRANDMA ROW HARDER THAN YOU GUYS ARE! ARE YOU GOING TO ACCEPT THAT! NOW POER TEN IN TWO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 min later, they passed the finish line and passed out.

Now how are we supposed to get this boat of the water? They all passed out! Oh, by the way, good job. You finished in 13 minutes. I have it on camera and everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiled \u201cOk, so what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrace smiled \u201cI have an idea. Can you get out of the boat?

For some reason, it was more massive than before. Maybe it had to do with the orb, but whatever. He grew a huge 8in making him the tallest person in school if not the town. Along with that, his muscles grew larger to match his new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen - Junior<br>\r\nAge: About 17<br>\r\nHeight: A towering 7ft 8in!<br>\r\nWeight: 300lbs<br>\r\nDescription: Amy complains that her neck hurts to look up at him\u2026<br>\r\nAt school, he towers over everyone and he constantly has to look down in order to meet their eyes. The tallest kid, next to Ben, is Xen, but that\u2019s  beside the point.<br>\r\nOver the summer, despite Ben\u2019s defiance, his body grew more muscle to match his height. He worried that they would grow to abnormal sizes and that would ruin all that he\u2019s worked for. His biceps were pushing for 5in diameter and even more when he flexed. His pecs jutted out a good 3in making it only marginally hard for Ben to see his lower body. (He can still see it, but he has to try harder). When he looked past his large pecs, he sees an eight pack that fits perfectly into his taller torso. His thighs muscles up and increases his speed. They only, just barely touch, so they don\u2019t implied his speed. Not to mention his bubble butt, etc. His pride, though he doesn\u2019t think to much about it, could hang just about his knees. At a monstrous 15in long with softballs for balls, he could make enough cum to fill Amy and them some. That\u2019s what he worries about\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeke graduated and moved onto a college somewhere in Europe. With a full scholarship to boot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark, after winning the race, was hunted down by dozens of colleges offering him a full ride! His smarts and his muscle were a powerful asset to what ever school he chose to go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake, after his time in Ben\u2019s boot camp learnt how to really commit to something. With his victory at the HOTC, he could go to any college with little resistance. He got some decent scholarship, but not a full ride. His grades weren\u2019t all to amazing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth - Junior<br>\r\nAge: About 17<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 6in<br>\r\nWeight: 270lbs<br>\r\nDescription: With his natural growth coming to and end, and his hormones settling down, its amazing that he even grew 4in. With help from Ben, he managed to put on another 20lbs of muscle. However, its all in size. He was gigantic! 8in of pec just of his body like a protective shield. His biceps were earth shattering watermelons. When he walked he had to waddle just a tiny bit to move. Not to mention his schlong. 12in of baby Seth hung between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick - Junior<br>\r\nAge: 17<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 4in<br>\r\nWeight: 300<br>\r\nDescription: What ever was left of his growing mostly went into his muscles. His height leveled out to its current 6ft4in, but muscles were able to gain 30lbs with Ben\u2019s work out. He was peeved when he realized that he was shorter than Seth and even more so when he had to do a full tilt of his head to see Ben. However, he discovered that he beat Seth at least two things. One is strength. His muscles match Seth in size since he is shorter and has more muscle mass, however, its more dense, so he\u2019s stronger. The other is, though he found out be accident, that his dick was bigger. (Lets just say it happened in Health class while they were learning about how the reproductive system worked). All in all, he was satisfied with life and with his 14in rod and softball balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph: Still works as an assistant coach at his favorite high school<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grew quite a bit. It seems that handing around Ben more and more influenced her hormones. Her body molded itself into and hour glass kind of shape, but her breasts were huge. For some reason, they waited till the end of her puberty to expand. She has to get new bras soon since her latest pair were digging into her.<br>\r\nThis caused quite a bit of panic of Ben when he found himself in less control of his own endowment when ever he look at Amy to long.<br>\r\nAmy had been unable to do gymnastics and other balance based activities until recently since her new growth threw her off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was of similar change, however, not as much. She grew into EE\u2019s and she developed some curves. However, it stopped there because her karate classes prevented her from going further. She put to much demand on her body for it to do anything else but stay tone and agile.<br>\r\nHowever! It seems like her Anodite growth spurt just kicked in. Her species, at this time, experience a massive explosion in mana, and their mana begins to strengthen in some areas of magic more than others. They cans still do all spells. Its just that some will be stronger than others.<br>\r\nNick wasn\u2019t as scared as Ben about the changes. He hinted that wanted to try doing \u2018it\u2019 if Gwen felt up to it. If not, then he\u2019d wait.<br>\r\nBen was of the same manner, but was afraid he might lose himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is going to be an interesting year\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew how he was reacting to her body, and she knew he\u2019d be fine. Its just some left over hormones from his growth spurt that was getting him all worked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was looking at the board and saw a bunch of elements, etc. All the science made her remember another scientist she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy: \u201cHey Ben. Do you remember Ken? I wonder how he\u2019s doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was kind of glad for the distraction \u201cI don\u2019t know. We should call him after school. You know\u2026 to check up on him. I think he\u2019ll be fine though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cI know. Maybe we should visit him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cKnow what? That\u2019s a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, their teacher Ms. Que stated \u201cBen\u2026 did you know its hard not to notice a near 8ft tall kid trying to whisper to someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen paused than shook his head \u201cSorry. won\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Que (First name is Molly. Get it? Molly Que\u2026 molecule?), nodded her head \u201cI hope so Mr. Tennyson. We don\u2019t want to see what will happen when report cards come out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen swallowed his fear and nodded vigorously. \u201cI totally understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Que smiled \u201cGood.\u201d She turned her attention to the class \u201cNow, who know the periodic table?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday after school, Ben called the gang together to go visit Ken. Their parents said ok one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Then, its settled. We\u2019re off to space\u2026 again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cActually, its my first time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSame here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSame\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh\u2026 ok then. I guess we\u2019ll need to get you some suites and what not.\u201d he turns to Gwen \u201cGwen, Do you remember where Gramps put those see-through suites? Those were pretty nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen thought about it and then snapped her fingers. There was a purple flash and a 5 plumbler badge/suites appeared. \u201cHere they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cSo, basically, you just put this over your chest and press the middle. Give it a shot.\u201d  A moment later, they were covered in invisible suites, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cShouldn\u2019t we call Ken first? To see if he\u2019s free?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cLets surprise him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scrunched her face \u201cShould we get him a present? Just incase we come at a bad time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBen, she has point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat should we get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI say we let him perform an experiment on Ben. Maybe give a little of your muscle tissue just to see how dense you really are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cFunny, but no. That\u2019s not happening. Someone already got a hold of my DNA and that went horribly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cIf anything, I think we should get him something made of growthium. That stuff can do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey agreed on it, so\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOff to Gravitron!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of purple, they appear on the desolate planet of Gravitron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhere are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWe\u2019re on Gravitron. Its composed entirely of Gravitum and its about the size of a few hundred thousand suns. Though, it weighs almost nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSeriously!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSo how much do we need? And what are we making?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI say we make a laboratory dimension for him. You know\u2026 with test tubes, beakers, etc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth agreed. What ever time they spent with him was spent mostly talking about science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen lets them talk about the design and stuff for the present \u201cI got to go check something out. I want to see something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all let him since he could take care of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen ran around until he found the giant hole he had made to find the heat stones. He jumped down and fell for a good 20 minutes. No sound was made since there was no air to carry the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was pitch black. Responding to him, his medallion began to glow a brilliant green so that he could see. Ben walked along until he found the entrance to the chamber he was in before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo\u2026 Gravitron is made of gravitum\u2026  and when gravitum is formed into a circle, a universe is made\u2026. So where is this universe?\u201d Ben strolled around until he got to center of the chamber. Then he got another question \u201cWhat does gravitum turn gravity into? The energy has to go somewhere\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen decided to test it out. He took of his necklace and then\u2026 nothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! Cross that. The intense pressure at the center of the planet was already huge, but now there was something else increasing the pressure. Ben\u2019s gravity stabbed at the planet. The only reason that Ben\u2019s necklace didn\u2019t collapse is because its was made of near infinite gravitum. The amount of gravitum in his necklace was larger than the universe in order to counter act Ben\u2019s gravitational pull. Gravitron was no where near enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber grew smaller and small as it collapsed on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the surface, ground was shaking. Gwen and Amy had cast a spell to counter act Ben\u2019s gravity on anything beyond gravitron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThat idiot! He took of his necklace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cHe\u2019s just being curious. I guess he thought that Gravitron would counter act his gravitational pull.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWell! He thought wrong. How\u2019s the spell holding up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIts fine. We\u2019re using Ben\u2019s mana field as a power source. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYah. His mana field expanded so much that its beyond this universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was looking for some changes. first off, the chamber was getting small, so his gravity was having an effect. However, the majority of his gravitational pull was being  converted into bond energy (energy that holds gravitum together). The more energy in the bonds, the more unique the gravitum is. This also how Hearthstones are formed. They are one of a few things that the gravitum can turn into. One other is the metal that protects Amy\u2019s hearthstone. However, those are formed under intense conditions. What will be made from the beyond extreme conditions that Ben makes?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Then suddenly, chunks of gravitum got ripped off the wall of the chamber. As they rocket towards Ben, they shank down and then collided with each other. Slowly, the newly amassed chunk of gravitum began to glow a metallic silver as it converted Ben\u2019s gravitational pull into bond strength. Quickly, the strength grew massive and the mass of gravitum began pulling at the walls of the chamber. Thin strings of super charged gravitum webbed its way towards the ball. The string was as thin as an atom, but as strong as Ben himself (since its formed using the strength of his gravity). The string began to weave around the ball/chunk of gravitum in a random, yet ordered, pattern. However, it was impossible to copy. With every passing moment, the ball gained more and more energy (in its bonds), and the string wove even faster. The ball was flaring iridescent silver, white, and black all over the chamber walls. As soon as the web of string finished weaving itself around the ball, it burst into brilliant metallic silver light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething told Ben that he should put his necklace back on, or the gravity that isn\u2019t absorbed by the gravitum will rip apart the universe. As soon as the necklace touched his neck, the tremors in the planet stopped. Floating in front of him was the a ball of Nexus Gravitum. A ball held together by bonds that are stronger than the universe itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at it. It was glowing a hazy silver. Ben reached out and grabbed it. He felt a shock run up his arm and then it stopped. He could feel the ball controlling his gravitational pull. It was containing every bit of it inside its infinite bonds. This tiny ball has more anti-gravitational powers than the planet gravitron itself. Ben let the ball go and it began to float just above his hand. He could still feel it containing his gravitational pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grabbed it again and began to walk out. As the green and silver glow of his orb and the gravitum mixed, it revealed of much the chamber was changed. Its once rough contours had been stripped till it was smooth. Ben looked around for the exit and saw something he hadn\u2019t before. The chamber was pulsing with energy now. The exit/entrance was covered by a thin silvery film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond it, he saw a colorful terrain filled with multicolored plant life (well\u2026 they looked like plants), and other peaceful looking animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIs that this planet\u2019s universe?\u201d Ben made his way towards it and touched the silvery film. His hand passed right through it. Ben pushed on through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he got through, he felt his body being repelled by the planet. What ever it was made of, it didn\u2019t listen to gravity. It was tugging on everything else\u2026 why not him? Then Ben saw something. The plants and other living things had tiny silver dots. They were the only plants that grew on gravitum. They were made of it! Ben pulled out the Nexus (I\u2018m going to call it the Nexus because calling it a Gravitum ball is to much of a hassle), and prayed that it would be attracted to the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a magnet, the nexus pulled Ben toward the planet the moment there were no barriers in the way, such as skin of cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ben landed, he grabbed a nearby plant and held on. He slowly let go and finally released the plant. The Nexus has attached Ben to the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhere and I?\u201d He looked around until he realized what he was standing on. The soil felt like soil, but it was grey and metallic. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Ben knelt down and picked some up. He let it trickle between his fingers. Then he stood up to his fullest and towered over the vegetation. There were tree like things, but they were a mix of green, blue, and yellow. He looked up and saw 3 great suns blasting down on the planet. When he looked off into the distance, he saw a dozen more. This planet was huge! It was like a copy of Gravitron, but with life. Where did those suns come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pulled out a small container and put some of the soil inside, and then he picked a few plants. \u201cI hope I can come back here. This place is pretty awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen didn\u2019t have his bag, so he had to settle with putting this stuff in his large pockets. Then he made his way back to the portal/gateway and went through. He was back in the chamber now. He looked around and realized that the portal was the only exit, but he didn\u2019t want to break that. Then he remembered that he could talk to Amy telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought \u201cHey Amy. I have a small situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy let out a small laugh. She could hear the sarcasm in his voice. \u201cWell\u2026 that\u2019s not good. How can I help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWell\u2026 I discovered a parallel universe that is connected to Gravitron. A portal to this place formed when I took off my necklace. However, the portal formed at the only exit in this chamber at the center of Gravitron. Care to teleport me out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s thoughts were silent \u201cWhat! You found another universe. You mean one that hasn\u2019t been obliterated by your semen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed at how nonchalant her statement was \u201cUmm\u2026 Yah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWell alright. Did you bring something back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou bet, but I can\u2019t show you till you get me out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a white flash and Ben appeared on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSo what did you find?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cYou\u2019re back! What happened down there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI thought this place would implode!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stormed up to Ben and glared at him. Suddenly, with lighting speed, she slapped him so hard that even his super dense muscles couldn\u2019t protect him against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s cheek started to turn red from the impact \u201cWhat was that for!?!?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThat was for nearly obliterating the universe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh\u2026 I thought the planet would contain it. Wait a minute\u2026 how did that slap hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen scoffed \u201cI put some mana into it. That\u2019s why!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cWell\u2026 its alright because I found life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen paused \u201cWhat in the name of Andromeda do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reached into his pockets and pulled out some plants and the container of soil. \u201cThis life. Gravitron has a parallel planet that is filled with these things. Everything is made of gravitum. I think the liquid there is too! Though, the moment I stepped through the portal, I was shoved off its surface.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cHey guys\u2026 guess what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at him \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth picked up a plant \u201cWe have a present for Ken. He\u2019s going to love this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others paused and thought about what he just said and then agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The movie just gave me a lot of ideas. =D)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe OOPS (Olympus Of Plumber Scientist) was formed and funded by Dr. D. Matter along with Co-funder and creator Dr. G. Matter, or better known as the Matter Twins. They are the revolutionary new thinking scientist of the millennia. In their search for knowledge, they discovered a planet and named it Gravitum since it went against gravity. Their discovered branched off into new studies, namely Gravitology. The study of Gravity and all its tiny quirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe facility had an amazing start. Studies in a vast area of subjects expanded and grew. They found away to turn common graphite into diamond with a simply contraption, and vice verse. Four years of this type of progress, and then they had a fall out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week prior (earth time), Ken was in the bio synthesizer lab. He was trying to make a life form that could basically become a clone of another organic life form. If this were to succeed, then he\u2019d finish his dream to create a second chance at life. If someone died of an unnatural causes, then this life form could be put into that body to copy it and continue living as though it was never killed. It\u2019d be live a video game, you have more than one life. (Memory and all)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was taking notes of any changes in what he saw before him. In front of him, a large vat/contain fill with a special liquid contained a strange life form. It was a basically a pinkish clump of goo that could potentially bring back the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn assistant comes on \u201cWe have a dead sample for out test. Where and when shall we proceed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen paused writing \u201cHere\u2026 and now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant nodded and called for the body. The assistant, a diamond head/ghost freak hybrid, was Ken\u2019s assistant because he\u2019s the only one that would talk to a freak like her.(No one even knows how that happened). However, Ken thought differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen watched the other transport aliens come and go. \u201cThank you Rika (short for Rikaringabinta). I really appreciate you helping me out. I don\u2019t think I could do this with out you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika blushed (well\u2026 it looked like a blush. Who knows what a hybrid blush looks like?). \u201cIt was my pleasure Doctor. No one else lets me work with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cI don\u2019t know why. You\u2019re such a nice person. If they spoke with you once, they would be able to tell instantly. They\u2019re just a bunch of discriminate hypocrites if you ask me. I\u2019ve seen citizens of their own species commit more treachery than you. And that doesn\u2019t take much effort seeing that you haven\u2019t done a single wrong thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika simply glowed with adoration for the doctor \u201cDoctor\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cOh\u2026 and one more thing. If you want to continue working with me, you have to call me Ken. Understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika paused \u201cOf course Doc\u2026 of course Ken\u201d she said correcting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cOk. Now lets see if all our work has paid off. Rika, can you drain the vat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika smiled \u201cAlready on it Doc\u2026 I mean Ken.\u201d She thought\u2026 Oh! This is so weird calling him Ken. She did what he asked and collected the pick organism inside an air tight container. \u201cRetrieval complete\u2026 Ken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so hard. Now can you please inject the specimen with the organism please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika smiled and did what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe specimen was a Wildbeast killed in an accident with a space cruiser (orange with fangs\u2026 remember?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika stuck a tube into the wildbeast and one into the sealed container. Slowly, the pink organism worked its way into the wildbeast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was watching and taking notes like never before. You could barely see his hands because they were so fast. Rika moved away and stood by Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wildbeast began to bulge and ripple as the organism did its job. Suddenly, the stomach ripped open and out stepped a wildbeast. An exact copy as well! It started sniffing the air and looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika burst with joy \u201cDoctor! I mean Ken! You did it. You\u2019re a genius.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cI didn\u2019t do it alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika blushed \u201cNow guess what! You can present this to the Matter Twins and rank up even higher than you are now! With something like this, we can minimize war casualties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed \u201cYah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cOnly the creator and the specimen can go before them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika \u201cOh\u2026 Its ok. You\u2019ll do fine. I\u2019ll try to see if I can watch you from a window or something.\u201d She already knew that there were no windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen sighed \u201cWell\u2026 Unless we were co-creators. Then I guess they\u2019d have to let us both go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika gasped \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re\u2026 going to share credit??? This could be the greatest find of the century. I\u2018m only on the first rank. This could ruin your chance at the 11th rank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wildbeast began to move around and sniff things. However, it was acting strange. Almost aggressive, or stalking its prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled \u201cWell, credit is due where credit is deserved, and you\u2019ve worked far harder than I have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika denied it \u201cNo\u2026 not more! At most is equal, but I doubt that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen continued smiling \u201cWell, in any case, we\u2019ll be going tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika was bursting with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was looking at his notepad and saw the wildbeast stalking Rika. Suddenly it jumped to attack. \u201cRika! Look out!\u201d Ken charged at Rika to shove her out of the path of assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika look turned and saw the wildbeast, and froze from surprise.

A dark ghostly energy surged out of the crystal and dissolved the wildbeast. It thrashed in pain and agony, and then it lay still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira ran up to Ken. \u201cKen! Ken! Stay with me. Don\u2019t go. Come on\u2026 come on!\u201d She was shaking his head lightly. Trying to nudge him awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen coughed a little and looked at Kira. She had a single tear on her beautiful geometric and crystalline face. Ken reach out and collected it on his finger tip. \u201cSuch a beautiful and horrible thing this liquid is\u2026\u201d he grasped the tear in his hand and place it over his heart. Then his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika \u201cKen\u2026 Ken\u2026 KEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can\u2019t leave me. Not now. We were going to present it\u2026\u201d She realize that this was all it\u2019s fault. She looked at the decaying carcass of the wildbeast and fired assault after assault of dark crystals. Suddenly, she felt something grab her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen\u2019s eyes were bugging out from the strain of staying alive. He reached for Rika and grabbed her leg. He tried to instill a sense of calm in her mind, and it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika didn\u2019t wait a second longer. She picked Ken up and went ghost freak. She phased through wall after wall after wall, and each time it hurt her. She had discarded this form a long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared in the infirmary \u201cQuickly! Ken\u2019s hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn assembly of nurses and a doctor can rushing out. The nurses took Ken from Rika\u2019s arms and put him on a gurney. They rush him into the ER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Rika was brought into interrogation. They were exceptionally hard on her, and terribly bias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrogator 1 \u201cWhat did you do to him!?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. We had just finished an experiment, but it went wrong\u2026 really wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInter 2 \u201cLies. There was a decaying wildbeast when we searched. It was to violent to have been a simply accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika\u201d Exactly! I didn\u2019t say simple. I said terribly wrong. Get your fact straight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInter 2 fumed  and grabbed Rika by the neck \u201cNow listen here. We don\u2019t need your attitude. We\u2019re doing our job. This is an interrogation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika spit in his face, and he threw her down and kicked her. Rika said \u201cHa! This isn\u2019t interrogation. Its formality. You\u2019ve already decided the culprit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInter 1 \u201cShe\u2019s admitted her guilt.\u201d A pair of hands seized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika \u201cNo I have not! I\u2019ve said nothing of the sort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis verbal/physical assault on Rika continued for the next 3hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, a pair of inspectors are recording the crime scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 1 was looking at the decaying wildbeast \u201cTalk about ugly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 2 \u201cYah\u2026 what ever. Just get a blood sample and get out. Its starting to stink in here. Smells like methane gas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 1 \u201cUmm\u2026 sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 2 resigned himself, and stepped outside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 1 \u201cOk\u2026 blood sample. Just stick the needle in and then take it out. Simple\u2026\u201d He approached the wildbeast, and stuck the needle in. Suddenly, in an instant, a pink substance shot straight into the alien and vanished inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 2 \u201cWhat\u2019s taking so long? Hurry it up! They\u2019ll run out of those things at the station. What do the earthlings call them? Do\u2026. Nuts\u2026. Donuts? Yah. Donuts. The earthlings actually made something cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Alien 1 came out. \u201cSorry. I lost my wit back there. Here\u2019s the sample.\u201d He raised a needle filled with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 2 \u201cOk. Good. Lets get back to HQ.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 1 \u201cCan you take the sample? I\u2019m not feeling to hot right now. I\u2019m turning it in early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 2 sighed \u201cAlright proby. Take it easy. Don\u2019t do anything to wild.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien 1 \u201cKay. Thanks\u201d He hands over the sample, and Alien 2 walks away. Alien 1 began to walk back to his room.

I\u2019m dying to see what Ken\u2019s created.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth spoke in a diabolical voice \u201cHe\u2019s created life!\u201d The irony is that he\u2019s right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen did a face palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOk.

Alarms sounded and light flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntercom \u201cOOPS is under lockdown. No one is to leave or enter. Disobedience will be considered an act of hostility. Punishment will be severe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that, a series of red lasers shot out and surrounded the gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntercom \u201cSorry\u2026 no visitors. Have a nice day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth\u2019s mouths were hanging open from shock. \u201cWhat just happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face got serious \u201cSomething\u2019s going on inside. We better get in there. Ken might be hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy looked at each other and thought of a spell to use. Just as they began chanting\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth unsealed themselves and grew to massive sizes. They jumped into the air and smashed the lasers. Then they shrank down. At that same moment, they felt the divine fury of women. They could feel the angry glares of to mana users.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the feeling stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntercom \u201cHostile actions have been recognized. Prepare to be terminated in 10... 9... 8...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they felt the divine fury of women again, but even angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThe idiocy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked down feeling ashamed like a small school boy being lectured by his mother. \u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cDon\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cGwen\u2026 spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cFollow my lead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they started to chant. A purple and white sphere began to form around the gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth snickered at Nick, but got a glare from both girls. This shut him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was doing a face palm\u2026 \u201cMy friends\u2026 are all crazy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen\u2026 what was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cMy friends are all crazy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought you said. don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntercom \u201c3... 2... 1... Terminating.\u201d a red laser fired at the gang. As soon as it hit the shield, it was reflected back on itself thereby destroying the laser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shield went down and Ben stepped up to the main entrance of OOPS. He unclipped his medallion and punched the enforced barricade. It never stood a chance. The structure crumbled into nothing but rubble and dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang moved forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOOPS was one giant facility. In summary, OOPS is a planet all to itself. The Matter Twins funded a dig out of a death planet and hollowed it out. The overly compulsive twins even paid extra so that the surface of the planet was made smooth (like a giant marble!). The surface of the planter is completely black. The reason is that OOPS created a liquid solar panel. They spilt it all over the planet thereby turning it into a giant solar planet. It collect enough energy to power hundreds of planets and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main building that Ben just open up is kind of overly extravagant. OOPS allowed visitors in to inspire new thinkers and ideas. The moment the gang strolled in, they saw a room filled with countless display cases. Only some of them were filled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked around and saw a giant signed with hundreds of languages. The one in English said \u201cWelcome to OOPS.\u201d and right below it was a hologram showing how this place got its name and how it was formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSo what now? It doesn\u2019t seem like the place is under lock down. Everything is running.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThere\u2019s no activity. Where is everyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on queue, a dozen armed aliens marched in and surrounded the gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth were about ready to pounce, but Ben told them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA larger than average fourarms walked up. He saw Ben, and assumed Ben was in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms \u201cYou are trespassing. This is considered an act of hostility. Name your purpose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen started at the fourarms eye level. \u201cWe came to visit an old colleague Dr. Ken. Is he well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms narrowed his four green eyes \u201cYou are friends of Ken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYah. Though, when we got here, this place just went into lock down. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms watched Ben cautiously and then turned to his minions \u201cArms down. They don\u2019t appear hostile.\u201d Then he turned to Ben \u201cWe\u2019ll trust you for now, but don\u2019t think we aren\u2019t watching you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised his arms in resignation \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask for more considering the circumstance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms \u201cFollow me.\u201d He turned and walked down a labyrinth of corridors. When he stopped, they were in front of a dead end. He walked up to the wall and tapped a few spots. Then the wall phased out of existence and they continued through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in a white room with white lighting and white desks and chairs and white everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen narrowed his eyes as he adjusted to the bright setting \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the white?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms frowned \u201cI don\u2019t really know, but ever since lock down, all the lighting in this place has gone on the fritz. The coloring should tone down soon.\u201d Just like he said, the white coloring faded away into variety of other colors. He sighed \u201cMuch better\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo what\u2019s the issue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms \u201cWe need help, and soon. Your friend Dr. Ken created something. No one has any idea what it is. Our only clues were from this lady we interrogated, but the idiots were discriminate to take any not of what she said. Now its taken her too. This thing\u2026 it\u2019s supposedly pale green. Its supposed to basically bring someone back to life. Not the original body. Some of our men have been attacked by it, and\u2026 Well first off, it enters the body and I we assume it copies the victim from the inside. Then it bursts outward as an exact replica. Well\u2026 without the cloths and other things. The victim is reborn, but with out old injuries. Unless they were born deformed. Then the thing comes out deformed.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He spoke calm words to sooth her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms got up with more holes in his suite than before. \u201cAnodite! I am sorry. I had not realized I was in the presence of such a species.

Can it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms sighed \u201cIt some how copies the victims skin pigmentation, so tattoos are copied as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cDid you get a blood sample from it and the victim? We could try to find some differences from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms ignored her. Ben saw this and almost went berserk on fourarms, however, Amy stopped him. She threw a ball of white fire at fourarms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms flew into the same wall as before causing it to cave in.

No one has ever treated their commander in such a fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen fourarms got up again, and he glared at Ben. But stopped when he saw something. Out of the dust and debris, and arm reached out and started to strangle fourarms. He reacted by grabbing and wresting with all four of his arms. They went back and forth fight each other until fourarms delivered a two fisted punch to his assaulter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth were next to react. They saw that there were more shadowy figures inside the settling dust. The charged forward but stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms yelled \u201cWait! Don\u2019t come closer. There\u2019s to many! Run. Protect the anod-\u201d his voice was cut off with a gurgling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth started to back up. Suddenly, fourarms jumped up and out of the gloomy dust.

Its going to grow to match his size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike they said. The small fourarms began to ripple as its bones stretched and grew. Its small muscles exploded in growth expanding beyond norms. It let out a screech that got lower and lower as its vocal cords morphed. It soon became a dark an ominous sound. Quickly, it grew to match the original. With giant muscles and all the sorts. Surprisingly, a fourarms actually had four dicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the minions on the side barfed up his lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, it began to contort again.

The glassware in the room clattered and moved around. Some fell and broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing turned its attention to the group and studied them. Its gotten smarter. After taking over the bodies of countless scientists, and copying their memories, it learnt more of its capabilities. The fourarms was just a test subject, and the results worked out better than it had thought. Now it wanted to get a better body. An invincible one that it could enhance beyond imagination. However, it would like some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing turned to fourarm\u2019s minions and fired something at them. What ever it was, it enter their bodies and repeated everything that happened to fourarms. A miniature them popped out and began to grew to huge sizes. While they were growing, the thing turned back to the rubble and shot out a dozen more at its old victims causing them to expand beyond their previous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was creating an army. Once again, the thing let out a deep roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was in Ben\u2019s arms whimpering. She couldn\u2019t take it. She loved life to much to see or hear what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at that thing in rage. No one hurt his to be girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing looked around and scanned for more victims. It saw an anodite, and two above average male humans. There was a strange white bubble in the middle of the floor though, it couldn\u2019t see what was inside. Suddenly, something came out of it. It was another human, but its reading were off the charts. The thing bellowed and charged this human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thing already knew that humans were one of the lower species when it came to physical prowess, and that fourarms were one of the higher ups. Then it saw the human remove something around its neck and then it vanished. Everything goes dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen appeared back beside Amy holding her. Trying to comfort her. The minions had just finished growing, but they were knocked out by Ben. The eight arms was down with a huge hole in its gut. Ben was spot clean because he did it so fast that the blood and guts had zero time to adhere to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIts ok. Its gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Amy looked up from Ben\u2019s body and saw that everything was unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the thing got up again. The hole in its stomach was closing. It let out a roar of rage and started to grow again. Its gotten to far to fail. Its got larger and larger, but stopped. It needed more fuel to grow. It walked over to its unconscious minions and ate them. It swallowed them whole and started to grow some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gasped and started to cry again. Ben was furious again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was on the side shocked. Ben had killed it\u2026 but its still alive\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had enough. He unsealed himself and got ready for the kill. He grew to match its expanding size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing felt a larger presence in the room and turned to see a giant Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It decided to take it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing grew and grew until it matched the human\u2019s size and they wrestle. Its eight arms against his two. The thing may have all the extra limbs, but it was still losing. How it wondered. Suddenly it sensed it. It could feel itself mutating again, and now it could sense the strength of living things. This human in front of him was a power house, but there was another one. One that was near by. It was inside that white bubble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing let out a roar and pushed Nick aside. It charged at the white bubble and tried to dig out what was inside. Just before he got to it, Seth grabbed its foot and swung it against a wall. The thing bellowed in rage and pain. It got up and tackled Seth and did something unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off, it didn\u2019t want to give up eight arms for two. Two, it kind of like have eight arms. And three, it didn\u2019t like two arms. However, it was going to lose, so it mutated again. There was no way it could win unless it matched the human\u2019s strength. That would take to much energy, and it sense that it would have to grow larger than the planet. So instead, it decided to drain his muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing\u2019s eight cocks began to writhe and move as it mutated. They developed tiny spear heads and they attacked. The jabbed into Seth\u2019s own monster cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth yell I pain \u201cAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster bellowed in joy and lust as it felt the strength enter itself. Its large body began to grow larger and larger and denser and denser wither every passing moment. If it had balls, it would have cummed by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s mighty shaft convulsed as pound after pound of muscle transferred through his giant cock and into the things 8 equally giant cocks. \u201cMy muscles!\u201d Slowly, Seth shrank down as he tried to rip the needle cocks out of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Nick were shocked. Ben was still focusing on Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNick! Do something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick snapped out of his trance and unsealed himself. He charged at the thing and tore its cocks out of Seth. Seth was at half his original size now and he was unconscious from the massive drop in strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing roared in rage at who ever just interrupted its meal. then it saw something even larger that it was. It wanted all its size and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was prepared. When the thing\u2019s cocks started to move, Nick grabbed them and tried to rip them off the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing bellowed in pain and tried to retract its draining tool. It pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick held on and pulled even harder. After a prolonged stalemate, the thing lost 4 of its 8 cocks. Nick tossed the other four to the side and prepared for another attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen on the side lines used mana to eradicate the four dislodged cocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing grabbed its groin and looked for its missing cocks, but they were gone. It roared at Nick. It kneeled down and started massaging its groin. Then suddenly, there were eight of them again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s face contorted in disgust. \u201cEw\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith renewed energy and anger, the thing flailed its eight arms at Nick. This distracted Nick long enough for the thing to begin draining Nick\u2019s muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s arms flailed as he tried to push the Thing away, but the eight arms held just as hard. Then things began to repeat. Nick\u2019s dick convulsed is tons upon tons of dense muscle transferred through his cock and into the Thing. Slowly, Nick shrank down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing, at this time, was experiencing a backwards orgasm. The muscles  coming exploded all over the inside of its body causing it to grow larger and larger. However, it also got so much denser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen, on the side, was freaking out. She was blasting waves of mana at the Thing\u2019s cocks trying to eradicate them. Instead, the cocks absorbed the mana and made the Thing grow even more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stopped the assault \u201cBen! Wake up and help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time, Ben was soothing Amy and had zoned out of reality. Amy heard Gwen yelling at Ben and this got Amy out of her mental ditch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat out with a bolt and turned to see the scene. It made her almost cry, but she knew she had to deal with it. \u201cBen! Oh my god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned as saw what she saw. There was a giant eight armed thing sucking stuff out of Nick. Nick was shrinking, and Seth was smaller than before. \u201cOh my god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Ben unsealed himself and attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was roaring with pleasure. Suddenly all it felt was pain. It looked down and saw that all of its cocks were gone. Then it felt a sharp pain in every part of its body. Finally, it went unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen would have ended the thing right there and then if not for the fact that Seth and Nick needed immediate treatment. He carried the two of them to another part of the build along with Amy and Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen were now frantic. They knew they were to crazed to do any good right now, so they froze the giant Nick and Seth in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh God! What on earth just happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIts all my fault. If I had been able, then Ben would have been able to finished it before things got worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was quiet. She was furious as Ben for being so late at helping, but all he did was try to comfort Amy. And Amy had a hard time dealing with death. Then she had an idea \u201cBen, we should take them into your universe. They can heal faster there, and you can control reality to remove any impure substances in there body. Namely, any residual \u201cThing\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Ben looked at each other and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThat\u2019s a brilliant idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tapped his medallion and the gang vanished inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they get there, something happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as they enter, they felt a backlash of energy. It whipped through their bodies energizing them. For Nick and Seth, it closed the wounds on their punctured organs and re-grew their drained muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSomething\u2019s off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around. There were the usual green planets and stars, and the occasional rogue meteor. However, everything was warped. Even more so than usual. Suddenly, a flair of energy stabbed at them again. Ben looked and saw the source. A little while off, the orb was attracting stray planets and stars and absorbing them, and as soon as they touch, the orb releases a spray of untamed energy. Its gotten so dense that the rules of the universe were being warped. Everything was slowly being devoured by the orb. However, the paradox recreated the absorbed stars and planets at the boundaries of the universe. First it was the liquid. Now it was everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIs your orb attracting everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah. It looks like it. I think we need to encase it in gravitum or something, or else this universe will eventually succumb to the intense gravity of the orb. When that happens\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll even be able to come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cDon\u2019t you have that ball thingy that you made back on Gravitron?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt a light bulb go off in his head \u201cYour right. Lets see if that works.\u201d Ben pulled the Nexus out of his pocket and through it at his orb. The nexus rocketed across space until it made contact with the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was like two galaxies colliding. Energy was sprayed everywhere as the nexus tried to tame it and put a leash on it. The nexus expanded until the orb could fit between its strands. Once the orb was in, the nexus shrank down encasing the orb. Suddenly, the nexus began to glow grey, but that quickly turned to green as the orb\u2019s energy morphed the nexus. Slowly, the nexus\u2019s atomic geometry changed to better handle the awesome power of growthium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around and saw that the planets and stars had begun to follow their original orbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo that\u2019s why I grew so much this past summer. I thought something was off inside the orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled \u201cIts alright. I\u2019m cool with it. Your crazy hormones must have made the orb a little crazy too. Together, you get a monster growth spurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cMaybe it should happen next summer too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen chimed in \u201cNuh uh. Do you know how much I had to hear from Nick about your body\u2019s growing addiction? He complains that he\u2019s too short! Ha! He\u2019s taller than \u00be of the school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on queue, Nick woke up \u201cOh my god! Get off me!\u201d He was attacking something invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen saw this and floated up to Nick \u201cHey sleepy head. How are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked down at his exposed penis and saw that it had completely healed, and that he was still at his partial max size. He shrank down and sealed himself \u201cI\u2019m fine now\u2026 I think. Did it really happen? You know what I mean right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cSadly, yes. Its got to be stronger than both you and Seth by now, so only Ben could stop it. However, on the bright side, Ben\u2019s universe restored your maxes. The moment you came in here, it grew you back to your previous size.\u201d Gwen was trying to cheer Nick up. He probably felt bummed out that he wasn\u2019t strong enough to defend Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed \u201cYah, I guess that is good. Its not good enough though. If I\u2019m going to save someone, I have to be able to save them. Its not right to try to save them and then get caught.\u201d Then he looked at Ben. \u201cHey Ben. Can I have a word with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sense the seriousness in his tone. \u201cSure. What about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick made a gesture saying that he\u2019d like some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen understood, so he made a pocket dimension for them to talk in, and they both pop up inside of it. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI want to get stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked by the demand, but he understood why. \u201cYou want to protect her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded \u201cYes. I\u2019d give up my life if I had to. Back then, when I was duking it out with that thing, I was scared. Scared enough to piss myself. I didn\u2019t because I couldn\u2019t. If I lost, then there was no way Gwen could handle that thing. If I lost\u2026 she would have done the only thing she could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded because he knew who Gwen was. She was brilliant, but totally devoted to her companions. She\u2019d only interfere if it was totally life threatening. However, if someone died\u2026 especially Nick\u2026 she would have gone toward the brink of insanity. She\u2019d have thrown her life into a spell so disastrous that it could eradicate all life within that hemisphere of the universe. To make it worse, if she needed to, she\u2019d have tapped into Ben\u2019s mana to add fuel to the spell. That would have killed all life! \u201cI understand, and I\u2019m willing. However, do you understand what you\u2019re asking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed \u201cEnough to know that it can help protect Gwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cDon\u2019t let the growth get to your head, ok? I can understand if you pretend around Seth to give him motivation to work out, but don\u2019t go crazy on me. I don\u2019t want to hurt my friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled as he recalled a time when he first fought Ben \u201cYou didn\u2019t feel so bad about knocking me out back them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cI was younger and more impulsive back then. If I didn\u2019t stop, then I doubt I\u2019d be able to make any friends.\u201d Then Ben got serious \u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick got serious as well \u201cYes. Its for Gwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded. \u201cAlright. You\u2019re about to match the size of a galaxy. This might hurt a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded and his world turned into euphoric torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen removed the pocket dimension and they both appeared next to their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhere\u2019d you guys go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cJust checking to see if there was any of the Thing left inside of him. He\u2019s clean, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick coughed \u201cHey\u2026 can I get some cloths? I feel\u2026 indecent.\u201d At that, a set of cloths that Nick usually wore materialized. \u201cThanks\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen did the same for Seth who was slowly waking up. Ben check his body for the Thing, and he was clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cOh\u2026 tell me that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed \u201cYou and I both.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDon\u2019t worry to much. Your spot free, and the universe restored your lost muscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked at his partially unsealed self \u201cAwesome. Wait\u2026 are we in your universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYup. We\u2019re leaving soon. That Thing has to be dealt with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth panicked \u201cHold on a day or two. Let me get some workout time in here. How about a competition or two? It\u2019ll only be a second out there remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen face palmed \u201cBoys\u2026\u201d Like a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick in defense \u201cHey! don\u2019t group me with him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked at everyone and felt as though he was being singled out \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silent pause, and then they broke out in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cDid you see his face? It was all confused!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen snickered for a bit, but then stopped. He felt the orb changing again. \u201cBe right back. Something is off with the orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen left the group and checked out the orb. What he saw was an organized set up of chaos. The nexus had fused with the orb and had created new order inside the chaos. The random rules that flew around were categorized and stabilized. Things worked a certain because of certain reasons now. Things had explanations. However, Ben was still the ruler of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reached out and grabbed the orb. He didn\u2019t feel a shock or anything. The nexus had contained the random burst of energy (in its bonds. Also, some of the energy went back into the paradox, and some of it went into Ben\u2018s medallion to strengthen it. And of course, 99% of it went into Ben constantly to make him gain more mass and get stronger).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb was still green, but the planets and starts orbited in staged shapes. There were new octagonal orbits, and triangular orbits. Mind numbing numbers of dimensions existed together at the same time and perfect harmony. Things did things because of certain factors and circumstances. On the surface of the orb, you could feel the nexus, but you could not see it. Ben held the orb in his hand, and when he let go, the orb began to float like the nexus used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep at the core, was the ever shrinking image of a super tall adolescent that was constantly ejaculating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed. He went into the back of his mind and saw a window into Ben Jr\u2019s mind. You could feel the pleasure emitting through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBetter be careful to stay away from this.\u201d He need to be careful, or else he might get sucked into a world of pleasurable torment. Quickly, he imagined barricades on the window to prevent himself from accidentally crossing over into Ben Jr\u2019s body. Quickly, steal bars stood erect around the floating window in his mind. He tried to pry them open, but he couldn\u2019t. He looked at his handy work satisfied that it would keep him safer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he returned back to his friends and they discussed how to deal with the Thing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they plan?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s going to wish me never messed with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another thud, followed by another, and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing was in agony. Its exoskeleton was shattered by something. It didn\u2019t know what. It got up and summoned a few of its smaller minions. The thing made them grow a dozen times larger, then it ate them. Slowly, the Thing healed. It could sense that there were thousands of uninfected scientists on the lowest levels of this science planet. During its one week freedom, it had infects about 20,000 scientists and paid military soldiers. Slowly, each soldier and scientist grew to abnormal sizes, and quickly, each one was eaten. With each one it ate, it grew some more and got denser.<br>\r\nThe Thing would not lose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIt\u2019s mana\u2026 its so dark and evil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah\u2026 and its getting bigger. You can see it right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThe mana of hundreds of things vanishing. Its so\u2026 I can\u2019t even describe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick popped a few more knuckles. \u201cWell that ends now. Seth, are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was leaning against a wall nonchalantly \u201cDuh! What do you think I\u2019ve been waiting for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cAlright. Lets go.\u201d The gang started moving. Nick and Seth bolted forward at their minimums. They were two 17 year olds that had giant hulking bodies that could dwarf any junior bodybuilder and fill any pro bodybuilder with envy. Following them were three other 17 year olds. Two magically intoned girls and a towering giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the main entrance, the Thing has gotten so large that it needs to go outside. Standing at about 3 miles tall, its learnt that it could grow to the size of 20times the planet it stood on. However, if it did that, it\u2019d suffocate to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing waited for its earthly victims to come so it could drain them for all they were worth. It knew it was getting smarter. It was slowly absorbing the intelligence of thousands of scientist. Its senses were sharper than before, and its armored skin was next to unbreakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it felt the earthlings come out the main entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing spoke \u201cHello earthlings. I\u2019m overjoyed that I didn\u2019t have to hunt for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Breaking Fourth Wall*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk Author! Since when could he talk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor \u201cJust now actually. He\u2019s been fully capable of think words, but his brain couldn\u2019t get the words out. Duh\u2026 I thought you were the smart one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen fumed \u201cI am!\u201d In here hand was a glowing ball of purple energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor freaks out \u201cOh god! Must repair fourth wall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen yells \u201cNot before I\u2019m done with you.\u201d She hurls a hailstorm of mana onto the author, but just before they hit the author, the fourth wall is repaired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Repaired Fourth Wall*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was in the back of the group mumbling hatefully \u201cStupid author and his superior attitude and his fourth wall. Wait till I get my hands on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a giant voice in the sky declared \u201cWatch it Gwen. Ben may be strong, but this is my realm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen yells a string of curses at the sky and fires a giant ball of mana at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp front, the Thing was very much confused. He turned to the few remaining minions he had \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Even his multitude of scientific brains couldn\u2019t decipher what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was now restraining Gwen again while trying to calm her down. \u201cI know\u2026 I know. The author can get a little cocky, but you aren\u2019t so calm yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice in the sky \u201cI though I repaired the fourth wall. How can you still be talking like this! Maybe I calibrated it incorrectly. Oh! Here\u2019s the problem.\u201d You here a lot of stuff falling and crashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Gwen and Nick look at each other totally confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat was I ranting about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick scratched his head \u201cI sincerely do not know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing had enough of the distractions. He roared a roar that shook the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Nick and Seth\u2019s attention. They released their seals and grew to match the monster in size. If they grew any larger, they wouldn\u2019t be able to breath I the thin atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing charged at them with its eight cocks standing to attention. Nick and Seth split up and attacked from opposite sides hoping to disorientate the Thing. However, it used its eight arms and grabbed both giants. Quickly, its cocks went for a strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth reacted quickly. Nick easily shoved the arms away with his galactic muscles. Seth had a little more difficulty, but he managed. The cock was only inches away from puncturing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing bellowed in rage as Nick and Seth began to run circles around the Thing. \u201cStand still! I will not stand for this treatment!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThen don\u2019t!\u201d Seth kick the Thing\u2019s legs, and nick punched his front. The Thing did a back flip landing on top of his cock crushing five of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing roared in pain \u201cYou will pay for that dearly.\u201d It got up and grew them back again and attacked with renewed energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth looked at each other and nodded. They had practiced this move a thousand times in their free period at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cReady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cReady!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick jumped and Seth grabbed his feet. Slowly Seth began to swing Nick around in a circle and they built up the speed. Soon they looked like a giant top. WHOOSH! Seth Let go of Nick and Nick went fly at the Thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing saw this and braced itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made contact\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seth stood up trying to see through the cloud of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the dust began t settle\u2026 to slow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was to impatient. Was Nick alright? She cast a spell and blew the dust away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was gone, you saw that the thing was down and unconscious. Nick was miles off to the side, also unconscious. The Thing\u2019s armored torso was shattered. It was cracked and splintered. Nick\u2019s forehead was bleeding lakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen saw this \u201cNick!\u201d She teleported to him and began to do her best to mend his wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth saw that Nick was out for the count in this match. It was up to him to finish this. Seth ran up to the thing and began to spin it like he had for Nick. However, now he aimed for the heavens. When he got enough momentum, he released the Thing and it flew up racing towards the sun of this planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the thing out of the way, all he had to deal with were the remaining minions. There were very few of them, and they were so small that he had little to worry about. His skin was to thick for them to pierce it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went about collecting them in his hand and he lodged them into the sky so fast that the air friction burned them into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, off to the side, Nick coughed \u201cIs it over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled \u201cYou betcha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had already shrunken down, so not he was resting in Gwen\u2019s lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was crying over his face. Then she slapped him \u201cDon\u2019t you dear ever get involved in something like this ever again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled and then sighed \u201cyou know that if it does happen, that only the three of us could deal with them. Well\u2026 Ben could probably finish it before it starts. But you get my point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen let out a short laugh \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t understand. I wish I could force you to stay with me all the time so you didn\u2019t go running off into these crazy situations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cbut\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBut I guess that I\u2019m going to have too. it\u2019s the Tennyson\u2019s curse. We always get dragged of into space.\u201d She turned to Ben \u201cRight Ben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and gave her a thumbs up. \u201cYup, but its not so bad. It makes life interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy chimed in \u201cTo interesting if you ask me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Seth yelled \u201cA few people is coming out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang turn around to see a pair of twins, Azmuth, and a strange Diamond Head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey twin \u201cOh dear.

It killed so many people, and I couldn\u2019t stop it. I tried, but then the cell caved in on me. I barely got out, and when I did, that when I found you guys. I thought you guys might be able to stop it. You know\u2026 Everyone knows that when you three are together, that you three can manipulate space and time with your mind. Now the thing is gone.\u201d She pointed to the group of teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth looked shocked \u201cIs that? Yes it is.\u201d He yells \u201cWell hello Ben Tennyson and friends.

That\u2019s nice. Was it fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard groans from two largely bulky boys off to the sides \u201cSounds like a yes! Well come in. Come in. We were just about to go free the other scientist when we ran into Ms. Rika here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWho are the other two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. G and D Matter \u201cWe are the Matter Twins, and all three of us are the Science Triplets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice in the sky \u201cWhat the. I didn\u2019t write that! What is the meaning of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika \u201cI think that their reality manipulation powers influenced the story a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cHa! What ever. You guys write the story for a bit. Ima go take a nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. G and D spoke simultaneously \u201cWhere were we? Oh yes. We are the matter twins and we created this laboratory facility here in the name of science.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cand you didn\u2019t take any precautions against crazy, psychotic, invasive, parasites?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cWell, we can\u2019t think of every situation. We did however protect against giant muffin invasions. Though we did have a giant rat problem afterwards, but that\u2019s besides the point. We would like to thank you for your service not only for this facility, but the universe. You have diverted a terrible disaster.\u201d The twins walked up and the group. They looked at Ben \u201cYou have something strange in your pocket. Something that hasn\u2019t been in this universe for eons. How did you come across Gravitum soil, Gravilotus, and Gravitlilies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pulled the plants and soil out of his pocket. \u201cThese?\u201d The twins nodded \u201cWell\u2026 I found a portal to Gravitum\u2019s universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins looked flabbergasted. \u201cWhat? It was supposed to be impossible.\u201d Then they came to the conclusion. They knew Ben was probably the only one capable or surviving such conditions. \u201cWe see\u2026 your growthium orb\u2026 and wait. We sense a Nexus Gravitatus Corax in that medallion of yours. The only one of its kind. You are an interesting one. You hold two immensely unique and powerful objects. Ben, you see\u2026 we created Gravitron. At its birth, we knew it was special. The life on its was extraordinary, and capable of amazing things. We knew it would we stripped of all life in the hunt for fortune by other species. First, we made it difficult to get to by making it so that it would repel any other form of matter. This worked for only a millennia. Then the Anodites came into being. Born from the only purple star, and nothing less. Beautify creatures. Except one was corrupted into aiding fortune hunters. With spells, he, the anodite, helped battalions of fortune hunters mine at the planet\u2019s surface for its plants. The plants were special. They, for one part, lower cholesterol by up to 90%, but they also increase your life span. However, if someone were dying, then these plants could heal any injury, but they grew so slowly, and only in one place on earth, Gravitron. To protect our most beautiful creation, we sealed the planet in itself. Turned it inside out so to speak. The universe, the original, was actually shoved into Gravitron, and what we live in now is a dimension of Gravitron. We asked the Anodites to help us construct a spell so strong that it copied the universe to replace the old one. Now, the old one is inside Gravitron. We sealed it off until recently. We went to check a few hours ago because we felt someone had accessed it, and we were right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at Amy. \u201cAnd you have something equally as amazing as Ben\u2019s Growthium and his Nexus. Your hearthstone is the heart of this universe. During its creation, Ben fused the pieces together into that, and his mana help link it to this universe. For a brief moment, darkness was eradicated. Protect that stone with your life, and it will protect you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they turned to Nick and Gwen \u201cHmm\u2026 interesting. I don\u2019t recall there ever being an Anodite/Human hybrid. Powerful combination of Human imagination and anodite will/pride. We wonder what you will do when you hit your ten anodite growth spurt. Wait! And she has a brain! We can\u2019t wait for you to come join our ranks here at OOPS.\u201d Then they focused on Nick \u201cHuman, you seek power to protect. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick nodded \u201cYes. Anything to protect what ever I hold close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins \u201cVery well\u2026 we will help you more by adding another gift on top of what Ben has given you. This is something we long waited to give to someone worth giving to. It is the only one of its kind.\u201d They put something out of thin air. A red orb. \u201cIt is a twin of Growthium, though it will always be weak since Ben has been interacting with his Green orb for more than half a decade. His bonds with his orb are only rivaled by his bond with his mate. And you, the bond you form with blue orb will only be rivals by Ben, and your bond with your mate. Oh! And remember this date. The Dragon\u2019s Inferno Rudy star will super nova in a 30 earth days.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they turned back to Gwen \u201cSeeing that we\u2019re giving these stones away for some reason, you can have the Amethyst purple stone. It will give you mana that is only rivaled by Ben\u2019s mana field.\u201d They tossed a purple stone at her. \u201cFor you, the Purple Mana star supernovas at the same time as Nick\u2019s star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they turn to Seth \u201cYou sir are most peculiar. Strong believer in bachelorhood we see. Well good for you. So are we.\u201d They wink. \u201cWe see you wish to grow. Why is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth  shrugged \u201cIts just fun I guess. it\u2019s a healthy hobby I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins chuckle \u201cKnow what? We like you, so you can have to the most prized Blue stone. Its something we created. It is similar to the green and red orb, but its doesn\u2019t grow with out a little help. It takes a lot of hard work, but it will make you grow, and the feeling will be so much sweeter. Though you will always be smaller than the other two, you will feel that you have accomplished so much more. This should help you with your hobby.\u201d they tossed a blue orb as Seth. \u201cQuick note. The star we made for this orb is located at the mid point between where the Red, Purple, and original Green star were. It was formed with help from all three stars giving a little start up energy to get it to form. Now that the green star is gone, and the other two are going soon, the blue start will end at the same time. It isn\u2019t like other blue stars. This one a deep brilliant blue. Almost untamable, except with the blue orb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins said to all three. \u201cI would spend the next month hunting down the pearls to put into the orb after you absorb the core of your stars. They will be harder to find since no one has been looking for them. Vilgax\u2019s family did Ben\u2019s work for him, though, he still has about 2000 pearl left to look for. He\u2019s amassed about 99.9999999999999999% of the originals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen fakes fainted \u201cOnly 2000!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the twins remembered something else \u201cAmy, you may want to get down to the whitest star near at the center of he universe. If you don\u2019t this universe will begin to unravel. The hearthstone is needed to hold everything together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone \u201cWarning to all, you will experience something like none other when you absorb your stars. As time wears on, you will experience changes to your body. The boys will have more effect than the girls, but just putting it out there that you will change.\u201d Then they turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cNow I think we should go free the scientists, or what\u2019s left of them at least. They\u2019ve spent the last week down at the core of the planet, and that should be long enough. We\u2019ll have to fix their discrimination problem though. If that never existed, then Rika could have told them everything they need to do to stop the Thing before it got out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cTrue\u2026 True\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

I do think that it will work our marvelously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pulled it out and did what they said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing gagged as it went down it\u2019s throat. \u201cWhat was that.\u201d then it stated to shake \u201cWhat\u2019s going on!\u201d Slowly, it started to throw up chunks of sacs that popped open on the ground. It said between barfs \u201cWhat is this. What\u2019s going on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground were hundreds of scientist and soldiers. And thousands of more were coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every surge, the Thing shrank down considerably, however, its jar and throat were still huge in order to throw up the others. Its muscles deflated rapidly. Its eight giant cocks shriveled down. Four fell off leaving the remaining four. Soon, all the people it ate were  released, and it was a relatively large fourarms again. Then it convulsed once again, and a small green pearl was released. With that, all the muscle it drained from Nick and Seth vanished, and it shrank down to a normal sized fourarms. Then one final convulsion and a pale green substance was released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt moved \u201cWhat is this. What just happened!\u201d It gurgled and bubbled in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cThat\u2019s what we fought?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cThat\u2019s what I was fighting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins walked closer and watched it \u201cFascinating. Its some time of liquid solid organism.\u201d They took out some surgical knives and other things and started to poke and prod the Thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing \u201cStop! I command you! This Is humiliating. Stop! That tickles! Please. You\u2019re forcing my hand. You will feel my wrath! HaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!! STOPP!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked down dejectedly \u201cI was fighting that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cI guess this shows that you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled a little \u201cIs that the mural of this story?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI guess so. It only took thousands of near death to accomplish it though. Nothing to big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a surge of scientist charged out of the facility. \u201cFREEDOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika walked up to the group. \u201cI got tired of wait. Azmuth and I went and freed the scientist ahead of you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDid you find Ken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika pouted \u201cNo\u2026\u201d Then she stared to cry. \u201cThat thing ate him already probably.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen some tapped her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cNow why on earth are you crying now? We have to present this thing eventually. Are you going to help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika looked up and saw Ken smiling. \u201cAre you nuts! You want to present that!\u201d She pointed to a slimy thing that was being assaulted by the Twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cWhy not? No one got hurt. Actually, everyone\u2019s not even hurt. I\u2019ve never felt better. That old scar of mine is gone and so is that strange click in my ankle. The experiment was even more of success, though I will need to find that last ingredient. It really put it over the top.\u201d Then Ken saw his old friends. \u201cWhy hello! I didn\u2019t see you guys. How have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang stared at him in awkward silence. How can he be so perky after being swallowed by a monster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. At least he was happy. \u201cWe\u2019re good. Thanks. OH! And the last ingredient was Gravilily. It only grows in a certain place. I think I have another one in my pocket some where.\u201d Ben reached into his pocket. After a little rummaging (So many pockets!), he found another gravlily and a few other things from Gravitron. \u201cHere you go. You\u2019ll have to ask the Twins if I can tell you where they are found. Its classified.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stared the at the gravitum based material and was astounded. \u201cThanks you. MY research will go much further now.\u201d Then he paused and grabbed Rika \u201cI mean our research.\u201d (So very sorry for this very corny moment).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika \u201cAww\u2026 Ken! Stop it. You\u2019re making me blush\u201d, and it actually looked like a blush. Her emerald face was turning as red as a ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen \u201cOne more question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika \u201cWhat might that be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen paused and pulled something out of his pocket. \u201cI know that your planet did not practice this earth custom, but on earth, this question is answered Yes or No. Yes would mean life long commitment, and devotion while No may lead to broken hearts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika felt the air leave her diamond lungs. If the rumors she heard were true then she would have to respond\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen kneeled down and opened his palm to reveal an ocean blue diamond (of the highest quality). \u201cYou have been with me for the last 3 years, and I haven\u2019t found a time when I was happier, so this leads me to this question. Will you Rika, Queen of my heart, Marry me, Ken your devoted knight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang stared at Rika expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rika burst with joy. \u201cYes!\u201d As if by will, the darkness of her ghost half was converted into the purity and joy of an angel. Her darkish emerald coloring flared white with new joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen stared at his white angel. His eyes brimming with tears of joy (and not because the light was hurting his eyes).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Ben stared at each other and smiled. They felt they passion for each other grow stronger simply bathing in this white light. Then they accepted that they could not longer be friends, so they gave each other a kiss signifying their renewed relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Gwen looked at the light and felt a sudden calmness to their lives. They looked at each other and embraced each other. They knew that no one else would love them as much as their chosen partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Seth\u2026 he was covering his eyes as he tried to maintain his status a strong believer in bachelorhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the rest of the day, the gang decided to take it easy. The Twins had created a new floor plan for OOPS, and Ben happened to get a glance at it. Then some how, the entire planet of OOPS was remodeled in less than a second. *cough cough*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe THING slowly became less evil, so to speak. Once it finished absorbing all the memories, it actually found a way to relate to the scientists and it told some pretty funny jokes. So, they decided not to kill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith in the next hour, a wedding plan was made for Ken and Rika. And within the next second, the wedding plan was brought into reality some how *cough cough*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe the end of the day, it was like the THING had not even gone berserk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they left, the Twins had to tell them something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins said to Amy \u201cDo you want us to awaken your hearthstone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was curious \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cIt mean that you can communicate with the hearthstone using emotions and feelings. Ben can already do that with his deep connection to his orb, and his strong mana connection to yours. That the reason why the hearthstone has a strong will to protect. Its copied Ben\u2019s strong desire using his mana connection. Now you can communicate with the orb as well, if you wish. However, Ben\u2019s will always be stronger since he was the creator. It will follow your will on any thing you choose, but Ben\u2019s first command is priority. Even now, we can see that the command is to protect you at all cost. Up until now, you\u2019ve controlled the orb with spells, but now you can do it with feelings and desires. Is this something you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought about it and then asked Ben \u201cBen, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shrugged \u201cI don\u2019t talk to the orbs very much. I just let them be, but when I need something really badly, then I might approach them with the thought. My orb prefers the solitude. Totally loves my clone\u2019s cum though. Your hearthstone is a little different. It is always listening to you. I can feel it. Its always listening to your heart beat. Listening for irregularities, but it also desires something. I don\u2019t know what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paused and considered what Ben said. She looked to the Twins \u201cOk. Please awaken my hearthstone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins nodded and blinked in unison \u201cDone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth were expecting something more extravagant \u201cIs that all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins nodded \u201cYup. All we did was vibrate the strands of their connection waking the orb up a bit.\u201d They turn to Amy \u201cYou should be feeling something now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy listened for a moment, and heart the crying of a child. This activated Amy\u2019s defensive and loving instincts. She asked it what was wrong, and the child was thirsty for her milk. This got Amy to wake up a bit. She looked at Ben and sighed \u201cI know why my boobs are so huge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised an eyebrow \u201cIs the answer genetics?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cNo\u2026 the hearthstone craves my milk. It listens to my heart, but also the churning of me lactating. And I can\u2019t call it a pervert either. Its only a small toddler. Its growing them just to meet its need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at the hearthstone partially horrified and partially scared. What was her stone going to do to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth stared at the stone in amazement. It gave Amy the body of a goddess because it was a thirsty toddler?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cWell, a toddler wants what a toddler wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIts not done though. Its wants me to grow a few more cup sizes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s mouth dropped \u201cWhat! Let me talk to it. No one messes with my girlfriends body! Not even a semiconscious toddler contained in one of the most powerful objects in the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note that the toddler symbolizes purity. Children are pure because they don\u2019t know what they do it wrong, so they are easily forgiven. Or they are scolded lightly. That\u2019s why the stone is one of the purest things in the universe.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled at Ben\u2019s defensiveness, and was glad that he didn\u2019t like her for just her body. The same way she felt about him. The bodies were a plus, but the personalities are what matter. \u201cBen\u2026 its ok. There\u2019s no dissuading the kid. He\u2019s to uninformed. Maybe in a few years, he\u2019ll learn what he did was a big uncalled for, but now, he\u2019s only 4 or 6 years old at most. That\u2019s about how long the stone\u2019s lived since you made it. Your stone must been lonely all those eons, so its just old and wants some pleasure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned red \u201cNope. Its about 13 years old, and is totally defiant in everything I tell it. Its just a phase that has currently lasted as long as I have had it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy face palmed, and turned to the Twins \u201cAre all the orbs like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins smiled \u201cUp until they reach 20-25 years. However, that because Ben\u2019s orb was dislodged about a 17 years ago (On the same say and moment Ben was born), and yours was formed about 4-6 tears ago. The purple, red, and blue ones have been around for eons, so they are well past their phases. Actually, you might even turn to them for advice as soon as you connection grow strong enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen let out a sigh of relief. The purple orb in her palm flashed purple in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins \u201cAlso, just letting you know, we gave you those orb not just because of what you want, but also because they match your personalities the best. Gwen, your purple orb matches you tomboyish character, the red matches Nick\u2019s loyalty and desire to get stronger, and the blue matches Seth\u2019s easy going personality and \u201ccommitted to a cause\u201d type of character. Eventually, and hopefully, the white and green orbs mature enough to not demand such things. Though, the green orb does have a steady supply of cum, so it should be satisfied. It will eventually mature, but the cum desire will probably stay. It\u2019s a powerhouse in simplicity. Amy\u2019s orb will hopefully grow into something that stands tall and proud. Ready to defend Amy at any moment. A child can only be expected to do so much at any given time.\u201d They turn to Amy \u201cMaybe now that you can communicate, you can begin to teach it the rights and wrongs of society. You can help increase it maturity by doing so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and stared at the hearthstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and rolled his eyes at the thought of his green orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen, Nick, and Seth were anxious to see their orbs personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins turned to the three \u201cJust letting you guys know, you can start communicating to your orbs once you absorb the star of their origin.\u201d To Amy \u201cAmy, once you absorb your star, be ready to see a sudden growth spurt occur in your hearthstone\u2019s character. May anywhere from 5 to 10 years of growth. So you might not even have to worry to much about getting it to mature. It will do most of it naturally upon absorbing the whitest star. However, I can\u2019t say that it will not have already expanded your assets before then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed and wondered how big they would get. \u201cNothing I can do about it now. A child does what it wants because it can\u2019t tell right from wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was thinking \u201cWait a minute. If absorbing the star ages the mind or spirit, or what ever, of the orb, then isn\u2019t my orb really only a little older than Amy\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins laughed \u201cNope, in your case, it got younger. It matured past the desire for cum, but regressed back and realized what it missed, so now its trying to get as much as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen face palmed again and let out a breath of resignation \u201cWhat ever! can\u2019t doing anything about it now.\u201d Ben felt faintly disappointed. He felt like a father that failed to teach his son correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy on the other hand felt like a mother who was distraught. How does she raise a child like this? Breast feeding was normal for a 4 year old right? She hoped. Maybe it would grow out of the desire come time of the super nova. At the same time, she felt a change in her hormone levels. She knew what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear\u2026 our teens have to learn to be parents soon, or face the wrath of erotic spirits/minds of their orbs. Is this a foe they can face? Ben certainly can\u2019t muscle out of this one. What will they do? Tune in for the next chapter to find out!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they turned to leave, a thought came to Gwen\u2019s mind. She turned around to ask the twins, but they were already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed, and Nick asked \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to out orbs after they absorb their stars? Do they age or get younger? Cause if mine gets younger, it might start demanding things like Amy\u2019s\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s face blushed, and he really wanted to say he wasn\u2019t complaining, nut he knew Gwen needed support \u201cI think you\u2019ll be fine, and besides, if it pisses you off, I know that you could beat it down to submission with a heavily worded verbal assault.\u201d Suddenly, the purple orb flashed defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cI think you made it angry.\u201d It flashed in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy stood quietly waiting for the other two to finish their chat. Once it was finished, the group decided that they wanted to go pearl hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cHey guys! it\u2019s a long weekend, so we could probably find our pearls. Right? We have billions of them to find, and Ben had it easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen thought about and looked into the heavens. As if by force, she looked in one certain direction and saw that all her pearls were still in the same general location. \u201cI think I know where mine are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cEither the anodites have held them secret, or they are beneath the surface of the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cReally? How about mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI don\u2019t know. Try looking for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick decided to play along as well, so both Nick and Seth looked up and felt their eyes pulled in a certain direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy went last and looked up. She felt like her vision was covered in white light, and then it shrank down to a certain spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a small robot came rushing up to them with a message from the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the screen, a message played. The twin were talking. \u201cHey! Sorry about the mix up, but we remembered that you guys actually have it easier than Ben. He has to go hunting for the last 2000 or so pearl, which one is actually on this planet. The others are scattered all over. For the rest of you, the corresponding Planet was not bathed in the intense energy of a green star. The other stars are powerful, but they emitted average amounts of energy, so the planets did not eject pearls, how ever it did eject an orb which you all are holding. Amy, you have the Milk Pearl planet. Nick, you have the Dragon\u2019s eye. Gwen, you have the home planet of the anodites, below the planet actually. And Seth, you Poseidon\u2019s Heart. Each planet is about 100 times larger than the green planet, and all but the purple one is devoid of life. However, the only reason the green planet was so small is because it contained to much power. Anyhow, have fun! Fourarms wanted to say sorry for the trouble and he awaits the return of the anodites.\u201d With that, the transmission ended. Then as they turned to leave, it turned back on \u201cAnd yes Gwen, it will regress the age of your orbs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance, you hear Gwen groan, and then you saw a flash of purple and falling metal debris. The robot never returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group was backing away from Gwen in fear of her next outburst. A mana infused slap hurt like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen tried to break the ice \u201cSo who want to help me look for the rest of the green pearls for the rest of this long weekend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy said yes since she felt obligated, plus it gave her more time with Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth like to explore space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen felt like she\u2019d destroy the earth if she returned now, though everyone knew she wouldn\u2019t\u2026 they hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhy can\u2019t we just summon them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBecause they repel mana. The only reason Ben\u2019s mana is so huge is because of his strength. The orb indirectly increases mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked up into the sky and tried to sense to pearls. Suddenly, individual green dots appeared in his vision. Instinctively, he got into jumping position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang saw this and wonder what he was doing. Suddenly, unclipped his medallion, and pushed off the planet and jumped into space. The planet shook from the force of his jump. Ben rocket through space is thousands of times the speed of light. The only reason he can do this is because he is an anomaly of this universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen appeared on 2000 planets all with in 10seconds, and each one on the planets found that they lost a green pearl. Then suddenly, Ben appeared back on OOPS with about 2000 pearls in his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Breaking Fourth Wall*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cJust wondering, how big are Ben\u2019s pockets? He keeps putting things in them, but they never bulge out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor \u201cIts because they contain thing strands of Gravitum. This creates a partial universe. Basically, there is more space inside the pockets than it appears to have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThat makes sense. Thanks!\u201d Amy leaves smile, and the author is trying to hide his raging hard-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor mumbles \u201cWhy did I have to develop her like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Repairing Fourth Wall*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYou idiot! You could have destroyed this planet with a jump like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised an eyebrow \u201cNone of the other 1999 planets reacted like that. Anyway, there is still one more that I have to get, and its here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed and resigned. Even she loses to Ben sometimes. \u201cWhatever, lets get it and go. I have piano lessons as 6 o clock.\u201d Gwen wanted to pick up the speed, so she teleported them back to OOPS main entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedding was still going on, and everyone was gathered in a large circle. In the center was the Thing, who is now officially OOPS\u2019s official mascot, named Goop (you can guess why). The scientists were chanting as Goop was in a heated fight with a small robot that went rogue. \u201cGOOP GOOP GOOP GOOP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen snuck around the mass of people and looked for the pearl. He found it in the center of a large crater. Ben placed it in his pocket, and snuck back to his group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen saw Ben \u201cDid you find it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYah. We can go home now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith out another word, the vanished in a flash of purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twin \u201cAzmuth, can those kids really save the universe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth chuckled \u201cThey\u2019ve done it before. The Guardian Anodites in the Original can only do so much. Once they start getting through, not even Ben, with all his strength, can defeat the might of billions of stones. Thanks to the enemy, the Original has now lost all its colored stars. Ben will need help. We can only hope that the kids can tame their orbs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cBrother, not even we could control them. What makes these kids so special?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth chuckled \u201cRemember when I used to be self-centered and less open? Who do you think is the one to get me out of my shell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins stood wide eyed \u201cWe thought you found love!\u201d They were astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth chuckled \u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, all three of them looked up into the skies and searched for the tiny blue marble known as Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben was at home think about what to do after high school. He felt like the 2-ish years he had left of high school were are ready burning away. Time was moving to fast, and there was no denying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t want to become a full time plumber. Maybe he might copy his Gramps. Make a ton of alliances with billions of intergalactic species and live off a massive amount of interest from the banks. What kind of college? There were hundred of places to go to, but none of them would understand if he had to go off suddenly on a mission. So maybe a Plumber school? They would understand, plus he gets to have a degree in every known earth subject, and or space subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt possible he might get  apart time job as a manual labor worker. He has the body for it. This is what Ben did for the next month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth both knew they\u2019d head into body building. They were already starting competitions and gaining more than decent amount of cash. Seth actually planned on dropping out to go full time. He had the body. Nick wanted to stay in high school. \u201cA safety net\u2026 just in case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was still going full on medical. Her goal was to become a doctor that always had a trick up her sleeve, so that even when things seemed doomed, she would be able to come up with a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was studying the brain, and is going to look at some in a state funded internship for the highly educated.  Plus, if she wanted to go abroad for college, she might decided to go to one that Gramps made. It was for people like her who were Human/Alien hybrids. MIT was an amazing place full of new ideas because its students were from totally different backgrounds and opinions. (Plus alien technology helped them stay ahead of the game quite a bit).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir high school devoted hundreds of man hours I getting their students working on their college plans, and it worked for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the month drew to a close, the group planned a small excursion into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the Red star could grow people just like the green star, but it was not as appealing as the green star. Mainly because if anyone got with in a light year of it, it would sent out raging solar flares. However, once it started nearing its death, aliens prepared, once again, to take its energy for their own purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Red energy was the same as the Green energy, but it was more unstable. It needed the Red orb to not run amuck and eradicate everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Whitest star was left to be because anyone who tried to get to it found that it hurt them emotionally to attack it. Its purity expanded their guilt if they tried anything with evil intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue energy is sought after, but no one can get to it because, like gravitum, the Twins had made it so that the Star repels everything, except the planet, Poseidon\u2019s Heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Purple star, the spawning point of the first Anodites. It is guarded by ancient spells, that will destroy anyone who even though about taking it. They would have to face the wrath of the entire Anodite race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlumbers  across the universe began to gather at the Red star in preparation to stop any alien armies. The had scout posted near the Red, White, and Blue stars. The purple one is being defended by the anodites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a large, continent sized space ship\u2026 (Max\u2018s brother Xam is preparing for battle.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cWhere is my coffee!\u201d He\u2019s been awake for the past 72 hours getting the plumbers ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were just 1 light year away from the star, and would have to go hyper speed to reach the star before the enemies. To soon, and they\u2019d be fried by a super solar flair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small alien came in with a Dunkin Donuts coffee. \u201cMessage Commander!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam took the coffer and sighed \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien \u201cFive earthlings come saying they can keep the enemies from getting the energy of the 4 remaining colored stars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam was intrigued. \u201cHow did they get up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlien \u201cThey appeared in a blinding flash of purple and white.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam was curious now. Purple, was mana, but white\u2026 what could it be. \u201cThank you. Send them in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little alien left and in walked Ben, Amy, Nick, Gwen, and Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked up at Xam \u201cSo this is my Great Uncle. I was wondering if I even had one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam was bewildered. They were just teens! \u201cWho are you people? How did you get up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cA little rude if you ask me. No hello? Can I offer you a drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam frowned \u201cGreetings are a waste of time. They waste precious Oxygen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group realized this guy was more high strung than they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cMax was our Grandpa, to all of us, figuratively and literally in some cases.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cI see. That is how you know he is my brother\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHe mentioned you once or twice in his stories of your more chaotic childhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam sighed \u201cHe was older than me by 10 years, and that makes him the boss\u2026 He can tell all the secrets he want right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNo\u2026 not really. He only saw that his brother was a little impulsive, but got more control over it as time went on. Well, that\u2019s what he hinted at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam nodded \u201cOk then. Now why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded to the others. For the past month, they were a bit anxious to get things over with. Amy had grown another cup size bringing her to HH cups. The others found little to no change. Ben grew another inch making him 7ft 9in. Both muscle heads gained 5 lbs of muscle. Gwen began to feel stronger and more flexible, but her shape was pretty much the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached into their pockets and pulled out their orbs. Even Ben brought his out for the heck of it. Ever since infusing it with the Nexus Gravitatus Corax, the orb has been completely stable. The green orb floated in his palm while the others held on to theirs. Amy\u2019s was dangling around her chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cWhat are they?\u201d The he saw Ben\u2019s orb, and was almost lost in its complexity. \u201cBen, what is the orb you are hold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThis is growthium. The last, and only bit of it. It absorbed the Green Star. Which is what the other orbs are going to do to their respective star.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cWhat?!?!?\u201d He was flabbergasted. \u201cWait\u2026 those things are supposed to contain a super nova? I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t believe that. I didn\u2019t believe it when Azmuth told me that you absorbed the Green star\u2019s super nova.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cI\u2019m full of surprises. Aren\u2019t I? Anyway, we just wanted to let you know so that you didn\u2019t attack us. Ok? We\u2019ll be going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam was fuming. These kids were leaving without being dismissed \u201cInsolence! Know you place. You come on my ship to tell me that I have to surrender the colored stars to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned around and smiled \u201cYup!\u201d Then he turned to leave, but stopped \u201cIf you want, I can knock out the enemies forces for you, and you can collect prisoners or what ever. I have the ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam was silent. He wanted nothing more than for this to be over. The past 72 hrs have been hell for him. However, he just couldn\u2019t give up all that preparation to an adolescent. \u201cBen\u2026 you have no idea how much I want to say yes. However, I can\u2019t put the life of the universe in your hands. I don\u2019t know how capable they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cOk.\u201d Though he knew he\u2019d be doing it whether or not Xam said yes. \u201cBye.\u201d The group walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Lets go.\u201d Ben whispered to Nick and Seth \u201cYou guys may want to remove your pants when you go into your stars, or they may be destroyed.\u201d Then he said to everyone \u201c I\u2019ll go to gravitron and try to make all of us a set of cloths like mine. Since mine is more durable. Bye.\u201d With that, Ben removed his medallion, and he vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cGwen, could you flash Seth and I to our stars? I can feel the red star nearing the end of its life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded \u201cSure.\u201d There was a flash, and Nick and Seth vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cReady Gwen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cNope, but I\u2019m going to have to do it any way. I just hope that the anodites won\u2019t kill me for being a hybrid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paused \u201cI think you\u2019ll be fine. But good luck. My star is going soon. Bye.\u201d she vanished in a flash of white<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stood in the hallway alone. Then she vanished in a purple flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the red star, Nick found himself floating in deep space. Each star was surrounded by 100% oxygen, so Nick found that he could breath. As soon as he appeared there, he felt the star pull him in. As its gravitational pull sucked him in, he saw ships off in the distance. Below him, the Red star was shrinking slightly, as its core began to use up all its fuel. In his palm, he felt red orb pulse in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the star went super nova. Off in the distance, gigantic fleets of ships went hyper speed trying to harness the power of the explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick on the other hand was beginning to fall in towards the star. As he phased into the star\u2019s massive fiery energy he felt hot fire run through his veins. It felt amazing\u2026 the energy quickly seeped into his muscles causing them to expand beyond normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his palm, the red orb was pulsing and absorbing every particle of light and energy. Its grew redder and brighter until it flared. Every inch of Darkness in a light year was devoured by the fiery might of a dragon\u2019s power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all the energy was consumed. The red orb was floating inches away from a massive ball of muscle. Nick\u2019s muscles had grown until they consumed his arms, torso, legs. The only thing sticking out was his head so that he could breath. A small distance away, a tiny red crystal, in the shape of iridescent flames, began to float toward the red orb. Then it went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoom! Nick\u2019s muscles instantly doubled in size and strength. The orb loved huge muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was floating around peacefully. He was swimming in an atmosphere of pure oxygen. The twins really had made it so that the star repelled every thing. Then suddenly, he felt gravity take hold. The star began to contort as stability dropped. He let himself fall towards the star.  It called to him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passed through the outer shell, and saw that underneath, it was pure chaos. The core was consuming itself. He held out the blue orb and the energy began to flow in like a torrent of water. It created a type of vortex as the energy entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt his a strong sense of euphoric pleasure. A large tent formed, but something else happened. Every move he made with his body created a sense of euphoric pleasure. He began to rub himself and flex and spasm with flailing limbs. The orb made it so that what ever he did would cause a little bit of muscle growth. He had to do a little work though. Nick just had to stand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue orb sucked the rest of the energy in while leaving Seth in a semi conscious state. There was a blue crystal in the shape of crashing waves. It entered the orb, and Seth opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply breathing caused a wave of pleasure crashing all over his body. He was drowning in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, she felt the necklace yank her towards the star. The child inside was extra excited. As though it was about to get a present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy phased into the star and half lost her self. She started rubbing her self trying to leave the pressure building inside. She started to lactate like crazy as jets of precious milk shot out of her. He breasts expanded to produce even more of her motherly juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, her hearthstone was being extra greedy. Its absorbed the star\u2019s energy, but fed some of it into Amy\u2019s body causing her to lactate even more. As soon as the orb was done with the star, it started absorbing the oceans of milk that Amy had made. Amy was knocked out from the sudden surges in hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was dodging waves of mana. Her people had not taken to the sudden appearance of an anodite hybrid. The society there was very strict, and did not take a liking to any outsiders. Even if it was one of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon at the purple star started consuming itself, Gwen flashed inside the star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kind of entered a dream state. She was awake, but not awake. She saw the purple orb sucking in the supernova, but she also say her mana field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the star, the other anodites were preparing to contain the explosion and harness the power of the star, but suddenly, they saw a giant mana field emerge from the star. It grew and swept through the anodite ranks causing mass panic. Some of the weaker anodites fainted from the intensity of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen, on the inside was trying to communicate with the orb, using what ever mental control she had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cHello\u2026 any one out here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a mysterious female voice \u201cHello Gwen. How are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAre you the purple orb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice giggled, but returned to a stealthy tone \u201cYes. Do not worry. I have sense your fear. I will not unbalance your body like my siblings have to your friends. Though, I will make minor alterations. Do not fear. I to prefer balance over the extremes. Control over one\u2019s mind starts with control over one\u2019s body. You seek this. Do you not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed in relief \u201cI\u2019m glad I got the most sensibly of the orbs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice had a happier tone \u201cI am glad. I am here to serve and to aid, however, I hope this can blossom from a master/servant relations ship into an equal partnership.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI already consider you a colleague. Just as long as you don\u2019t make me all bulbous in certain areas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice replied \u201cUnderstood. Now\u2026 go to sleep. You will name me once you awaken\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen fell asleep upon here the soothing words\u2026 Name her? What she mean\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the purple orb has just absorbed a crystal made of the essence of mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was on gravitron spinning gravitum into strings, and then into cloths. He felt his orb flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice of the orb \u201cBen\u2026 it appears that your friends have  finished. Some of them are in trouble quite frankly. Do you want to help them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was kind of shocked by the orb\u2019s willingness to talk. He Hasn\u2019t heard from it since\u2026 ever. \u201cI think they\u2019ll be fine. Why the sudden urge to communicate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrb \u201cNo reason really. Just an urge. You have satisfied my desires. Very smart idea with the clones, and also, your hormones have begun to stabilize. However, there will be another surge later this year. At that time, I\u2019ll probably return to solitude. I might go back to talking, but I also might not. Anyhow, I was just curious. I know you\u2026 every atoms in your body, and your history. I\u2019ve been with you for  along time now. The longest out of all the orbs. Since the others are going to communicate with their master, I thought I\u2019d give it a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it \u201cI see. So what are they like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrb \u201cThe other orbs?\u201d Ben nodded, and the orb replied \u201cEccentric is the only word. More so now than ever since they just got younger. Their minds, all of them, are about my age now. However, since I\u2019ve learnt from you certain manners and such. I won\u2019t lie. I really love cum. So sweet. Especially yours. Nick\u2019s was kind of sour, and Seth was to thin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face was turning red. Was the orb really talking about this? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but can we change the topic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrb paused \u201cOk, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought of a topic \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrb was silent \u201cThat\u2019s your job. You are supposed to name me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh\u2026 ok\u2026 umm\u2026..\u201d Ben began to brain storm. Ben thought about the orb. It strengthened him, it made energy more potent, it was fond of solitude, but its could potentially have an outward and robust character, even a type of vigor. It was the most effective of the orbs, and the most forceful\u2026 \u201cRobus is the Latin noun that describes you. That\u2019ll be your name, but I think I\u2019ll nickname you Rob or Robert. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrb \u201cI like it, and also notice that Rob uses the same letters as orb. Ha! Strange how mixing two letters changes the meaning of a word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. He was liking Rob more and more. \u201cSincerely, I think you should have started talking ages ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was defensive \u201cI wasn\u2019t in the mood! I was to busy enjoying your clone\u2019s juices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat ever\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Ben finished making the string of Gravitum, and began working on the weaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben had given up on making the cloths manually, so he went into his universe and caused the gravitum string he had made to weave itself into a set of cloths for his friends. They were all grey, but they should change colors after the other out them on. While he was inside, he decided to visit Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe floated up to Rob and saw that he looked the same as usual. Ben felt a pulse in his pockets. He reached in and found that he still hasn\u2019t given Rob the pearls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob \u201cOooooh\u2026.. Gimme gimme gimme\u2026\u201d Rob sounded lost in a world of desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the orb and was kind of shocked, but he complied. He opened up his pocket and let the pearl fly out into Rob. They went slowy since they had to phase through the nexus first. With each one, Ben heard Rob moan as though he was having a mental orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of Ben\u2019s mind, he heard Ben Jr. explode in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they all enter, Ben heard Rob slowly regain composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey\u2026 are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob spoke, but his voice was deeper now. \u201cI am fine Ben. You have just cured me of my insolence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was confused \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob \u201cAs soon as I was complete, I would return to my proper mental age, which is the exact same age as you. it\u2019s the same down to the very micro second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWait, so we came into reality at the same time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob \u201cPretty much. Kind of cool right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scratched the back of his head \u201cI guess. Sure.\u201d He was wondering if Rob was still a cum addict. However, he heard a slurping sound, and new that the answer was yes. At least Rob as satisfied, and he spoke normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob \u201cYou should go help your friends. All of them are unconscious right now. They were exposed to too much of my siblings power at one moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh. I see. What\u2019s the situation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob \u201cWell\u2026 Nick is immobile because his muscles are far to huge for his body. Seth is kind of like your clone. Any movement or touch sends a wave of pleasure through him. Amy is lactating like crazy and is being sucked dry by her orb. Gwen is in a mana induced come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Ben heard that Amy was being sucked dry, he left immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was out, he unclipped his medallion and jumped off the planet towards Amy. In a flash of speed, Ben appeared next to Amy. He nipples were leaking milk nonstop and it was quickly being sucked up by her hearthstone. Then suddenly it stopped. Amy let out a moan, and then fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hearthstone began to glow and then it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard a voice in his head. It was a relatively deep voice that was calm and soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cBen. I am sorry if this offends you, but it was necessary for me to mature properly. I hope that there is nothing to complain about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared at the hearthstone. It lay between a set of KK cup orbs. \u201cAre you done messing with her body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cYes. I am now. Though, I will require periodic feeding or else I will regress in age again, and I can\u2019t assure you that I won\u2019t mess with her if that happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cI see. Then we\u2019ll just have to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. Thanks for the heads up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cI am only hear to help fulfill your first command and to please Ms. Amy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAs long as you do that, then I will not have any hard feelings for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob \u201cBen\u2026 you may want to hurry. The others are in what you might call a large pickle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled at his orbs sense of humor. Then he sighed \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to jump off of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice \u201cI can teleport you if you want. Amy used the spell enough times for me to memorize it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYes, do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hearthstone glowed white and all four entities vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was lost in euphoria. His strength was beyond imagination, but he had yet to realize that he couldn\u2019t move. He simply lived in a state of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside his mind, his giant body was being bombarded with attacks from millions of aliens, yet none of them left a scratch. If anything, they made him stronger. The red orb was zipping around absorbing attacks and enlarging Nick and making him denser. The orb wanted him huge! He was about the size of a medium planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red orb built a connection to Nick simply by will power. The stronger Nick\u2019s feelings for a anything, the stronger the orb\u2019s bond grew with Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the orb and Nick vanished in a flash of white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was to busy pleasuring himself in anyway possible. By now, he was about the size of a continent. Every lump of muscle could dwarf a mountain. A torrent of cum was erupting out of his body as the blue orb did its thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe to vanished is a flash of white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was knocked out. The purple orb was the most level head of the orbs, and the most understanding. It knew Gwen didn\u2019t want to be huge or anything, so it compromised. It strengthen Gwen so that her punches and kicks were more effective, also it made Gwen nearly twice as flexible, and her mana was still growing. The orb devoted a tiny finite amount of energy to her body, and now the rest was growing her mana. Her muscles were magically enforce and her breasts were FF cups now. As time goes on, her mana field will continue to grow since no more energy would be devoted to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the anodites were scouting for the cause of all the disruption. When they saw the hybrid, they nearly flipped. They tried to use spells on her to punish her, but Gwen\u2019s mana field extinguished their spells into oblivion. Any spell meant to hurt her would be eradicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the anodites were fleeing the hybrid out of fear. They could never respect a hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash of white, and Gwen vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are they now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did someone saw something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought, He can\u2019t here me because he\u2019s so huge. Ben floated up next to Nick and yelled \u201cNick! Its me, Ben! You\u2019re going to be alright. We just need to shrink you down a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick heard Ben\u2019s tiny voice. Shrink me down? What happened? \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThe orb grew to a huge size. I\u2019m trying to convince it to compress you a bit, buts it says that you want to be stronger, so it made you beyond strong. Your muscles are so big that you can\u2019t move. You\u2019re basically a planet of muscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick exclaimed \u201cWhat! How am I supposed to move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cThat\u2019s what we are trying to fix.\u201d Ben turned to Rob. \u201cHey Rob, any luck getting your sister to listen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob sighed \u201cShe\u2019s waiting to Nick to wake up and ask himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen brightened up a bit \u201cOh. Nick just got up. Send your sister over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly, a red orb began to float over. It asked Nick \u201cHello? Master, are you awake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was confused \u201cMaster? What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen explained \u201cThe orbs are bonded to an organism that they call master. It\u2019s the person that they will listen to and obey. However, they hope to be equals. Any way, each orb has a personality and desire. Such as yours. Your orb is female, and it wants you to be huge! Not like normal huge, but like immobile huge. If you want, she\u2019s willing to compromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick tried to nodded yes, but couldn\u2019t \u201cAnything to be able to move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red orb \u201cAnything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick paused \u201cWell\u2026 maybe not anything, but I\u2018ll compromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red orb thought \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cYou shrink me down to manageable size, and I\u2019ll let you grow me so that it appears that I have pituitary gigantism, but make it believable. But you also have to make it so that I can move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red orb \u201cAww\u2026 but I don\u2019t want to make you taller though. I just want you  to have giant muscles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick groaned. He was hoping to get taller, but he\u2019d have to deal with muscle anyway \u201cOk. Fine. You do that, but remember! I have to be mobile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red orb \u201cYay! I\u2019ll get right on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rumbling sound as bones became compressed, and muscle tissue merged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick let out a moan as the stiffness and tightness of his muscles were relieved. It stopped when he got to a size just a smidge larger than before. \u201cThank you. I can see again.\u201d Well\u2026 he could see anything above his pecs. He had long lost the ability to see his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red orb was able to zip around freely in Ben\u2019s universe. It kind of wanted one for itself now, but it could wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the commotion, Seth began to stir, but immediately regretted it. He felt a world of pleasure once again. Ben would have to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked up to Seth, and used the energy in his universe to block the signals coming from Seth\u2019s nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Seth began to think clearly. Sort of\u2026 he had a huge migraine from the sudden lack of pleasure. \u201cOh\u2026. My head. What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was careful not to touch Seth. He was just barely blocking the intense pleasure signals. \u201cSeth! Do not move. Wait for a second.\u201d Ben asked Rob to go get his other sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a blue orb floated up to Seth. \u201cHello Seth. How can I please you now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen explained \u201cNick, your orb is obsessed over you . It will do anything to please you and to give you pleasure. Right now, any move you make will send a wave of pleasure to your brain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth groaned \u201cFine! Start by getting rid of this head ache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrb said in a cheerful voice \u201cOk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Seth felt the throbbing in his head die down. He let out a sigh of relief \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou should ask her to tone down the pleasure factor. The moment you start flexing a single muscle, you\u2019ll get lost in pleasure. All I can do is make it so that your breathing and heart beat don\u2019t cause you to enter an episode.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked at the orb. \u201cCan you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb flashed blue \u201cOk. Done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth started to move his arms a bit to see if anything was triggered. \u201cOk. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue orb \u201cYou are soooooo welcome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned to the girls now. \u201cRob. How\u2019s Gwen doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob \u201cGwens currently in a private chat room with my other sister. They\u2019ll be finished shortly I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThanks. How\u2019s Amy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob \u201cI think she\u2019s waking up soon actually. Her hearthstone isn\u2019t doing anything to her. She\u2019s just sleeping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen exhaled the remains of his stress \u201cOk\u2026 so now we wait\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Watch it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cI am the great Azmuth. Creator of the Omnitrix. Though, I doubt you earthlings have heard of it. Other than Ben and Gwen over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked up \u201cSo this is the Azmuth that Ben talked about. I\u2019m glad I got to meet you. Ben\u2019s said a lot of good things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth did something unexpected. He actually blushed. \u201cH-he did, did he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded \u201cThe Omnitrix is supposed to hold every known alien DNA inside its matrix right? And you can turn into any one of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth nodded frivolously \u201cY-yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD and G \u201cAzmuth, brother, are you alright? You\u2019re face is turning red?\u201d Then they realized something \u201cOoooohhh! Azmuth! I think you are what the earthlings call a play-er. Whatever that is. Have you finally chosen a mate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth basically exploded \u201cShut it you two! I have found one before, and I will never again! Now stop it.\u201d After that, there was an awkward moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth decided to break it \u201cSo who are you two brain heads?\u201d He said to the two strange metallic android twins with a strange glass dome covering an abnormally large brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD and G \u201cWe, excuse us, are the Matter Twins. We created this planet here, but we also created a few other things. Such as everyone\u2019s favorite metal, Gravitum, and a variety of colored stars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWait\u2026 you said you made gravitum and some stars? How\u2019s that possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cWell, it was easy after we made gravitum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was wondering \u201cThen why is it lifeless right now? I found these\u2026\u201d He pulled out some plants and a jar of soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins gasped and grabbed the plants and other things from Ben \u201cHow did you get these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was a little nervous now \u201cI went into the center of Gravitron and found a portal. I think you\u2019ll know the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins thought about this. \u201cAhh yes\u2026 it would seem that only you could have done that. Do you know what you have done?\u201d They said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen could tell that something was off. \u201cWhat? I just went through and grabbed a few plants, or else I would have been shoved off the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins said hopefully \u201cDid you happen to create a ball of some sort? And did you bring it to the other side?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was careful \u201cYes\u2026 and yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins slightly more nervous \u201cDid it create a connect between you, itself and the planet? As in did you hold it out, and it pulled you towards the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was nervous now \u201cYes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins sighed \u201cI guess there\u2019s no more reason to keep it a secret. Azmuth. Should we tell them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth nodded. \u201cYes. Now that the cycle has been initiated. It is crucial we try to stop the merge or else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins nodded and began to reach into their multiple pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s going to happen?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We find that it would be most beneficial.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen grabbed the Gravitum plant \u201cGravilily inside that thing\u2019s mouth? Gotcha.\u201d He unsealed himself and the lily disappeared from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cMy! You are fast.\u201d In shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing coughed \u201cWhat was that? What am I feeling?\u201d Suddenly the Thing fell to his knees bending over in convulsion. He began chucking up strange sacs, and he had shrunk a bit. \u201cWhat is this? What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening to my body.\u201d He sent another surge of sacs/pouches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole group walked over to the edge of the crater and saw that some of the sacs ripped open to reveal an alien at normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cHe\u2019s throwing up everyone he ate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was glad it was happening, but she as also slightly disturbed. She turned and hid her face in Ben\u2019s shirt \u201cI can\u2019t look anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when its over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more convulsions, the Thing had finally shrank down to a giant four arms. Then it hacked up something like it had a hair ball. A green sphere rocketed out of its mouth. Then the Thing began to shrink down again until it was the size of a normal fourarms. Something was dripping out of its mouth. A light green substance began to pull itself together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing \u201cWhat is that! What has happened to my body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth fell over in embarrassment \u201cI was fighting that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI guess that\u2019s the mural of this. Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked around \u201cHey. Where is Ben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reappeared \u201cHere I am.\u201d He was holding a green pearl in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins were amazed \u201cIts some type of solid/liquid organism. It can talk!\u201d They looked at each other and began running at it with surgical knives and pocket probes. \u201cWe must examine it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing saw the two brainy scientists running at it with knives and probes, and it freaked out. It started to ooze away from them. \u201cLeave me alone! You will feel my wrath. I will return to glory once again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cIts alright. We only want to cut you open and see what\u2019s inside.\u201d they finally caught up and did a final jump stabbing at it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing let out a high pitched scream \u201cAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Then suddenly there came an explosion of gurgled noises \u201cAH!! Stop it! That tickles. You will feel my wrath! No!!! Stop!!!!!! PLEASE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at the Thing squirming around and looked at Ben \u201cYou know? Its kind of cute now that it isn\u2019t out to destroy us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen walked up to Amy \u201cYou know what? I kind of agree.\u201d Then suddenly the two girls turned around smiling and batting their eyelashes \u201cCan you get us one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick recoiled from the sudden change in tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth strolled on over and put her arms around the two boys \u201cYou two have yourself a couple of keepers, right?\u201d Then he let out a laugh and started walking towards the pile of sacs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick were still frozen in their shocked posture and the started to run next Seth as though he was their only living shield against their girlfriends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen let out a laugh and they high-fived each other. \u201cGood one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, the sound of scientist cheering was heard \u201cFREEEEEEEEDOM!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika walked up to the group sniffing and wiping away a tear. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find Ken!\u201d Then she fell to the ground crying. Suddenly, someone covered in slime walked up to her \u201cNow why on earth are you crying now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika looked up and came face to face with a younger looking Ken. \u201cKen!!!!!\u201d and she jumped up and hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled and returned the hug. \u201cOk. So where\u2019s out pad, I have a bunch of notes and observations to write down. Experiment success, plus more actually.\u201d Rika handed him a note pad. \u201cNow only if I could get that last ingredient. What ever it was, it completed the process.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chimed in \u201cI think you\u2019re talking about gravililies.\u201d He handed Kent the remaining plants he had. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask the Twins about these. The most I can do it give them to you. I don\u2019t know much about them.\u201d Then he paused \u201cOh! And this is you present as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(How big can Ben\u2018s pockets be? We may never know\u2026)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen took them and was about to burst with scientific aura \u201cI\u2019ve go to study these.\u201d Then he paused as though an opportunity had just arisen. \u201cWith my lab partner of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika looked at Ken and smiled, but then he did something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen began to kneel down on one knee and he pulled out and object \u201cI\u2019ve held onto this for a long time, and its about time I used it.\u201d He paused a moment \u201cRika, there is a custom on earth, that you\u2019re people to not practice. However, this ritual I\u2019m about to initiate is answered Yes or No.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika\u2019s crystalline heart began to pulse and glow. Is he doing what I think he\u2019s doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen coughed \u201cRika, the queen of my heart, will you marry me, your humble servant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika paused unable to answer \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know. That was pretty corny. Servant\u2026 really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen\u2019s face shattered into a billion pieces. \u201cIs said yes or no! Not a tirade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rika smiled \u201cThen yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen\u2019s brain was still trying to catch up. When it did, he burst into a smile and place the ring on her crystalline finger. The purest blue diamond ever created in the universe now belonged to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rika flared a brilliant white. The darkess of her ghostly half was purified and turned into the light of hope and love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a clap from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thing gurgled \u201cYou player!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen even further behind, a bunch of aliens had woken up to a romance scene, and they couldn\u2019t help but applaud the ending. Most of them, prior to today, had seen Rika facing off the Thing trying to defend them. Now they were willing to give her a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy bathed in the light feeling the strength of the emotions. The light began to dig up an old feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI don\u2019t want to be friends anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed in relief \u201cOk. Good, I don\u2019t know how longer I could have called you friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smile and stared at each other, and then they kissed starting off their reborn relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Gwen saw this and they smiled. Nick held Gwen close and they simply bathed in the light, and the presence of their partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was turned away from the light chanting to keep the thought out of his head. How long can he remain a believer of bachelorhood when he hangs around a group like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow\u2026 that all got built within 5seconds of when it was planned. *cough cough*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! And Big news. The THING is now OOPS\u2019s mascot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cAlright, where were we? Oh right! You and that orb.\u201d They turn to Ben \u201cThe thing you created was a Nexus. Its is created by increasing the bond strengths of gravitum to Infinity. The only way to do that is to feed it a source of ever increasing gravity. Thereby forcing it to absorb more energy to neutralize the source of gravity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cOk, so what does it do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cFor the most part, nothing. However it is the key to the Original. You see, we live in a copy universe, though it is as real as the old one.\u201d They paused \u201cLong ago, eons before intelligent life was common, we created Gravitron. It was our most prized jewel. However, it didn\u2019t have any special properties itself. It was the life on it. The plants there were special. They could extend life itself, and if you weren\u2019t dying, it could restore you to your prime, and heal any fatal wound. We called these plants Vitas, or life in Latin, and then we broke them down into their sub groups. For example, Gravililies are more adept at expelling dangerous poisons and curing infections. That\u2019s the reason we had you feed the Thing it. Now back on topic. We prized these plants, and we knew they\u2019d be hunted down into extinction, so we took precautions. We changed the planet. We gave it the properties of repulsion. Enough to match the universe\u2019s attraction. However, it was not enough. A millennia later, the first Anodites were born. They were beautiful creatures. Born from the purple star, and nothing less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe befriended them, and they became our companions. However, centuries later, a group of them turned dark. They had heard of the power of the Vitas and wanted it for themselves. They snuck out in the dead of night and harvest acres of our beautiful Vitas, and they devoured them. This gave them\u2026 immortality. Gods among mortals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this life, came a surge in the magical powers. They grew greedier, but we had to silence them. We told them enough. We banished them to the farthest corner of the universe. We could never destroy such life, even if it sought to destroy us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came back, and they had raised their own children\u2026 mortal anodites. When the first of their young died, they knew they could not live like this, so they must make their whole race immortal. They rose an arm so great, powered by mana, we feared them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had only one choice. With the remaining anodites, we pleaded for their help, and in return we would give them eternal life. For that was the only way to match the army. They were not greedy like their counter parts, but they knew of the power it brought. They agreed, and together, we banished the Dark Anodites again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would not work every time. They would return, and return again. There would be a time when we are off out guard, and they would succeed. There was only one choice. We had to seal away our greatest achievement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur anodite allies constructed a spell so strong that it changed the planet and the universe. The metal, Gravitum now had mana related properties. It became more susceptible to change, via mana, and it could bend space and time to create a new reality. With this new ability, they seal the entire universe inside of it, and replaced it with a new one. The one that we live in now. To this day, both universe have been separate. The anodites that were banished have stayed banished in another universe. But now they will start to merge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis universe is in the middle of the other two, and the creation of the nexus as created a connection between all three universe. His universe will be caught in the cross fire of the collision of the Anodite Prison and the Original!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang was silent. Ben\u2019s hand was shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw than and hugged his arm. Hoping to calm him. Ben stopped shaking, but his frustration and guild turned into heat. His body was giving off a lot of steam. Amy held on anyway. Her hearthstone kept her safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen choked out some words \u201cIs there\u2026 a way to stop it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cMaybe. The nexus simply created a hole that punched a two holes in this universe connecting the other two. You will have to find them and close them somehow. However, there will be strange things happening. First off, the core of Gravitron will burst into bloom as the spores and pollen from the Original Gravitron phase through the portal. This will awake the Immortal Dark Anodites from their dark sleep and who knows how they will react, or how they will look. Untold eons have pasted since they were locked away. They will probably cross over and try to get to the Vitas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was still shaking, but there was hope \u201cSo I need to find these holes and close them some how. Any idea how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins sighed \u201cNo idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen tried to come up with an idea \u201cWhy not encase the hole in gravitum and lock the hole away in a pocket dimension?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cThe Anodites, or what ever they are will try to break through, and eventually, they will succeed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth chimed in \u201cOh well, I guess we\u2019ll have to wing it then. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Seth incredulously. How can he be so optimistic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThere\u2019s Seth for you.\u201d Everyone smirked. The future didn\u2019t look as bad as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Ben smiled at Seth\u2019s optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cWe can not do anything for our powers have gravely weaken past our primes. However, it doesn\u2019t mean we are out of hope. Ben, alone, you will fail, but with your friends, you may yet succeed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his friends, and they looked determined, all but Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick frowned \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be negative, but none of ass are at Ben\u2019s standards. He\u2019s the STRONGEST living thing in basically any universe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cBut he can not use mana. That is where he will fail. And! After all this time, the Anodites\u2019s bodies have only gotten stronger. The Vitas are never done influence the body, and they consumed a lot of them. We presume that they may be on par with Ben, if not more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen ever one\u2019s mood drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cThat is why you guys will have to grow stronger than them magically and physically. The growtium orb is only called that because it is the only accessible one. However, there are others. The green one is just simply a famous ORB. There are two other orbs with the same capabilities. The Blue and Red Orb, and there is a mana orb which is Purple. We had to lock those away when this universe was made, or else it would be unstable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth were a little anxious as to what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins paused and looked at Amy and Ben \u201cBen\u2026 you also created an orb. However, you have it to your mate, Amy. Is that correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face flared red \u201cUh\u2026 I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins approached Amy and picked up he necklace \u201cYes\u2026 this orb is fueled by the green, and it is almost on par with the purple. However, it is now above the purple because you have infused it with Magnus Gravitus. The only piece of its kind. It can amplify the effects of anything. You even shaped it into leaves and a necklace to hold the purest of the stones. It is exceptional craftsmanship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked by what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins turned back to Gwen, Nick and Seth. \u201cYou three will need your own orbs. Take note though that each one is inanimate, but they have a will and goal to achieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ben, it seems like it wants Ben to have a tall and balance body. However, it wants it to be the size of infinity. Ben however, subconsciously compromised and compacted it down. In return, it gets the sweetest substance Ben can make, or his clone rather. The orb will continue to grow Ben a little at a time by using his periodic surges in hormones. It may or may not end when you finish puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Amy, the hearthstone wants her to be happy, but it also follows it first command from its creation. It must protect Amy with its life, but it wants you to have the body that no one can resist. It feels that when some one is desired, they will be harmed less, and be guarded more from danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stared at the orb between her giant globes, and saw the reason she was so huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned red as he realized that Amy\u2019s body was a result of him giving her the orb in the first place. He sagged as he realized that he made it harder for himself to maintain abstinence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cNow you three\u2026 We don\u2019t know the desires of these three orbs. They could do a bunch of things to your bodies, and we do not know what. Do you wish to accept them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and nick stared at the orbs cautiously, and then Seth burst out \u201cYES! Can I have the blue one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins were surprised by the willingness. \u201cUm.. Ok?\u201d They give him the blue orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Gwen sighed and then nodded. Gwen got the purple orb, and Nick got the Blue orb. They all felt a tingle as they help the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cNow some other things you should know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are they?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(You already know the compromise). What does it want in their bodies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen asked the Twins \u201cAre you guys going to wait here for the next 24hrs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins nodded \u201cSince we can\u2019t fight any longer, we\u2019ll help where we can. We might be old, but not helpless. Such as keep an eye on their development, and make sure they get to their fullest potential. We\u2019re going to need it\u2026 to face off them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Thanks. One question. What happens when I put these last few pearls into the green orb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins thought about it \u201cFirst off, it will be complete. Second of all, you may feel a surge in testosterone and other growth hormones as the orb tries to have its way with you. I wouldn\u2019t worry to much. You\u2019ll probably just get taller and stronger over the next year or two. Also, did you happen to merge the Nexus with the Orb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYah. I kind of had to or else my universe would have eventually collapsed from the surges of gravity from the orb. Now the orb is totally stable. Forever I hope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins nodded. \u201cGood, but also, the Nexus acts like the Magnus Gravitus. It will make your maximum that much larger. And fair warning. We take back what we said about 1 or 2 years o growing. It might be 5 to 10... Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen fell sideways in shock. How tall would he be in 5 or 10 years. The tallest person on earth was about 9 feet all. He was already nearing 8ft tall. Currently 7ft 9in. If he kept growing at this rate (about 4-6in a year), he would be the tallest person in the world! It would just matter how much taller! If he grew at four inches a year for the next 5 years, he\u2019d be 9ft 5in, or if he grew at 6 in a year for 10 years, he\u2019d be 12 ft 9in. He didn\u2019t want to be twice the average height! He was already almost 2ft over it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy came rushing over to help Ben wake up from his shock. As she leaned in to put his head on her lap, her orb made contact with Ben\u2019s medallion. There was a small spark and Amy felt bust grow another cup size. \u201cOh my god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard this and sat up causing the orb to touch again, and Amy to grow another cup size. Ben saw this and passed out again. His face was fiery red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins walked over and clonked Ben on the forehead \u201cYou may want to put those pearls into the orb because you\u2019ll need to the extra strength to face off the Dark Anodites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen got up, extra careful not to let the medallions touch. He mumbled about being far to tall and how this gave him unnecessary attention. The twins were insistent though, so Ben said \u201cFine! I\u2019ll do it.\u201d He went in to his medallion and gave his orb the last of the pearls. As soon as the last one entered, it burst into a brilliant green and than the light faded into a life filled pulse. Ben sighed as he knew he was done getting and putting stuff in the orb. However, he felt his balls stir a bit as they began to produce copious amounts of growth hormones. He groaned \u201cI\u2019m going to be huge.\u201d One part of him hated it, but another was kind of excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe them, outside, Ben was only gone for a fraction of a second. He went in and out basically at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the Twins \u201cThere. Happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins smiled \u201cThis isn\u2019t for us. Its for the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI know\u2026\u201d Ben look and Amy looked at each other. He saw how tight her bra was getting\u2026 again. Then he got an idea. \u201cBe right back Amy. I\u2019m going to make life a little easier for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scrunched her face trying to think of what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen vanished as he jumped off the planet and landed on Gravitron. He began spinning Gravitum strings like crazy and then he made a set of cloths for all his friends. They would act like his did, and they\u2019d be able to change shape\u2026 to a point, and match a style his friends like to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen appeared back in front of Amy with and arm full of cloths. He gave Amy a pair. \u201cI hope this helps. They should act like mine and be pretty stretchy. I\u2019m depending on the graviton\u2019s strange ability to change so that it matches something you like, so umm\u2026 yah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at the grey clothing and smiled. Ben knew how to make cloths? Then again, since he works at such a fast speed, he does have a lot of free time. I guess he could have learnt how to do it then. Amy pulled up some walls of mana to change behind and when she was done. She stepped out in a set of cloths that fit her perfectly and were very comfy. She imagined a designed that would keep her hearthstone from coming in contact with Ben\u2019s orb, and that would be able to support her large bust. \u201cBen, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cIts very functional and I think its stylish. I\u2019m not much of a fashion expert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cTrust me. Its fashion. So it can change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYah. It can, but not to much. It can\u2019t like cover a planet or something, but it should be able to imitate cloths back on earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy yipped. He just saved her thousands of dollars on wardrobe. She ran up and gave him a hug. \u201cThanks a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something happened\u2026 What?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She used a spell to see inside. \u201cThey\u2019re growing faster than you had described.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned \u201cMaybe because of all the orbs being so close together. Even I can feel my maximum growing several times faster. How\u2019s Gwen holding up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s smiled \u201cShe\u2019s doing actually pretty good. Her muscles are a little stronger and her boobs grew a bit, but that\u2019s it. Now her mana field is exploding in growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow about Nick and Seth. I assume their muscles are huge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded \u201cDefinitely. Nick\u2019s are bigger though. So big that he can\u2019t move. Nearly a dozen times larger than Seth\u2019s size, but Seth is still pretty big. Though\u2026\u201d Amy\u2019s face turned red. \u201cHis\u2026 umm\u2026 penis is huge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen raised an eyebrow \u201cI wonder\u2026 Maybe Nick\u2019s orb wants him to be hugely muscled, and Seth\u2019s orb is trying to get him out of bachelorhood by making it difficult for him. Can you tell me if he\u2019s\u2026 umm\u2026 extra sensitive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s face burned \u201cHe\u2019s exploding in it right now. Its blasting out.\u201d Then Amy ended the spell \u201cI can\u2019t look anymore. Its not right for me to see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen held onto Amy \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cGwen has a purple glow in her ovaries, Nick has a Red glow in his pituitary gland, and Seth had a Blue glow in his testes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins over heard \u201cThat makes sense. The orbs are influencing their hormones to accomplish its desires. They are going to need some motivation to strike a compromise with their orbs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cGwen\u2019s fine. I know that. I think the orb sense he desire to be ninja like. She looks like a goddess, but strikes like a cobra. Its probably molding her body to make people underestimate her, so she can take advantage of that. Gwen probably won\u2019t complain to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wanted to grow stronger to protect Gwen, so it made his stronger\u2026 to strong actually. His only problem is moving around. I wonder what the compromise might be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2026 his orb is being defiant. He\u2019s totally against relationships, but the orb his giving him the mother of all cocks. Excuse me for my language, but there is no other way to describe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by Ben \u201cEven bigger than my clone\u2019s was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gave him a grim look \u201cI\u2019m talking about his sealed state. What will he look like in his unsealed state?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen froze and tried to picture it, but stopped. He was going to lose his sanity if he thought about it to much. He turned to the Twins \u201cHow much longer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins laughed \u201cIts only been thirty minutes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n23hrs and 30mins later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Ben were asleep on the ground. Amy was sleeping on top of Ben, and his arms were wrapped around her gently. His body heat was keeping her warm. Once or twice while they slept, Amy\u2019s boobs almost suffocated Ben, but they got in a different position that prevented that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Ben got up and rubbed the sleep out of their eyes. What the woke up to was\u2026 different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was fully clothed, though her FF cups were stretching her shirt. Which looked kind of off proportions on her 5ft5in tall body. However, she didn\u2019t have to worry about falling over since her tome muscles kept her balance in check. Not to much of a physical change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was a bulky monster still, and his muscles were just a little larger. Though he need cloths badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was also naked, and his muscles were just a smidge larger. Though, his endowment was hanging past his knees at 16in long. 4in longer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked worn out as though they had spent the last 24 hours working out and arguing. In their hands were full sized orbs the size of baseballs. Bens was an inch larger in circumference due to the Nexus core inside and the nexus surrounding it. Amy\u2019s hearthstone was the size of a small-ish chicken egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the orbs in their hand sent out a shock and they were energized again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cCongratulations you survived the changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThey weren\u2019t going to die\u2026 were they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins shook there head \u201cOf course they weren\u2019t. We were using what you earthlings call sarcasm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo how do you guys feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cLike I could kick some real *** right now. I couldn\u2019t move when the orb exited my body. It wasn\u2019t to hard a compromise. It just wants to make me huge. I asked it to keep my minimum the same, but I have a feeling it\u2019ll try to sneak a growth in every now and then. I won\u2019t complain. Right Ben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cYup\u2026 no complaining here at all\u2026\u201d Oh he\u2019s was going to be to tall. At least he\u2019d be balanced. Super fast, strong and relatively flexible limbs all contained in a more or less than 10ft body\u2026 He sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThe purple orb was highly reasonable. I felt like it simply wanted to help me where I wanted help, though\u2026 I can\u2019t tell why it wanted me to have this size bust. I simply don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to complain. It said it was done messing with her body, and was increasing the maximum of her mana field. It would never match Amy\u2019s since Amy\u2019s field is growing as fast as Ben, and its amplified by the Magnus Gravitus. However, Gwen\u2019s field would get pretty darn close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth groaned \u201cThis thing almost didn\u2019t listen to me. I couldn\u2019t even get my thoughts straight for nearly an hour because of the distraction\u2026 It wants me to feel pleasure like none other. It said it\u2019d shrink my down to a manageable size is if get a girlfriend and do it every night! I flipped out on it. Eventually it gave and said I had to at least get a girlfriend. How am I supposed to get a girlfriend and explain aliens to her! How am I supposed to focus on working out if I get a girlfriend.\u201d he groaned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou could use her as motivation. Like I kind of did in 6th grade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cYah\u2026 what he said. I\u2019ve gotten really competitive lately. I blame this thing right here.\u201d He wraps and arm around Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWho are you calling a thing!\u201d Then she elbowed him with a bit of mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick coughed and wheezed \u201cThat\u2019s right. I also trained because it\u2019s the only way I can get my muscles hard enough so that her punches don\u2019t kill me.\u201d He gave Gwen a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed and thought of the prospect of being motivated by the opposite gender. \u201cI don\u2019t know guys\u2026 I don\u2019t really have any experience with girls, and I don\u2019t talk to many\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cDo you think I had any idea what I was doing? It took me about 4 month to ask Amy out, and I had a crush on her for about 3 years. The orb didn\u2019t say it had to be right away right? Just take it easy. Don\u2019t make who ever she is feel nervous or like you\u2019re rushing her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gasped at Ben \u201cSince when did you become a relationship guru?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cEver since I had practice trying to get you. And a long chat with mom\u2026 They really do help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwin let out a loud cough to get their attention \u201cOk\u2026 so now that that is done. You all want to go and absorb your stars when they super nova. You have a few days before the countdown ends. Warning, once you\u2019re exposed to the light wavelength of your star, you will start growing faster, so you might not compress fast enough. Ben probably knows this from experience. Then, when you absorb you correspond planet, you should be all set.\u201d He turned to Ben \u201cAny advice for them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou guys probably know most of what happens, but just a warning. You will want to stable live your orbs as soon as possible. My is set now because it collected all the pearls, and the Nexus permanently stabilizes it, but it also make my max grow exponentially faster than before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cThat\u2019s a good warning. You all could potentially have to make a Nexus like Ben has, though that may depend on how you interact with your orbs. Ben just happened to make his universe collapse on itself thereby creating a paradox universe that is the same as his orb. Anyhow, if you don\u2019t do that, then you should be all set. However, I\u2019d like you to refer to Ben every now and then to ask him how he dealt with some stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen remembered something \u201cHey Ben, don\u2019t we still have the Book of Memoria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think we should let me check.\u201d Ben flashed into his world and then reappeared \u201cBad news\u2026 The orb sucked that in too.\u201d Ben felt a mountain of mana smash down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThat was one of the greatest relic of Anodite history and all you can say is bad news? Its catastrophic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was restraining Gwen again trying to calm her down. \u201cGwen! A better question is what will it do to Ben\u2019s orb now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all turn to the Twins for their opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cSo you guys had the Book of Memoria, and Ben\u2019s orb absorbed it during one of it mana episodes\u2026\u201d Ben felt a pair of eyes land on him. Then the Twins began to talk again \u201cIt may or may not do anything at all. Personally, we think I may just simply be sealed away forever since someone has to write something for something to be changed, and the orb can\u2019t write anything in it. Unless the orb absorbs the book\u2019s powers in which case it becomes an orb of wished in simplicity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wanted to stop growing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled \u201cThere is a fine line from normal tall and too tall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind some of that.

Even better actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cOk\u2026 so now, we recommend that you all store your orb\u2019s original planet. Once you absorb the colored stars, you will absorb the planet, and then we\u2019ll see what we have to do from there. We might actually have to make a Nexus to contain the explosion of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth, I believe your symptoms should parallel Ben\u2019s when the orb starts making liquid energy. Actually worse so because that is the orbs main objective. To get you off as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, be ready to be immobile.

I don\u2019t know if you need to absorb a star or planet at all, but possibly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is an anomaly we have been wondering about. There is one star in the universe that is brighter than any other, and the is the purest white wavelength we have ever seen. Orbiting it is a milky white planet that is perfectly round. Not a single blemish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSo I might as well let my hearthstone take it. It won\u2019t hurt to do that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cNo, it shouldn\u2019t. However, we can\u2019t say that the hearthstone won\u2019t try to make you more goddess like. You know what we mean right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed and poked her large breast. It was already the size of her head and totally disproportionate to her body. Though, most of the boys at high school don\u2019t care. They just get red faces and wished they were Ben. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine them any larger with out making me look ugly.\u201d Her hearth stone flash in recognition of her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cLooks like the hearthstone understands your concern. It want to make you happy, so it might not make it grow anymore, or maybe a minimal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled and mentally said please. Her stone flashed again. She let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat are we going to do about school or our families? They\u2019ll wonder where we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI we could make mana versions of ourselves. They\u2019ll record everything that happens to us back on earth and then it fills us in later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYes, I think that\u2019d work. Can you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen frowned \u201cI need to know the person\u2019s body though. I could do Nick, and maybe Seth since they have similar builds, but I don\u2019t know yours.\u201d She looked at Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I got it.\u201d She patted Ben\u2019s arm. She spent so much time around Ben that she could probably name all his muscles sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment, exact copies of out friends were made. They copied the minimums, etc. They felt the same and acted the same, except for one thing. They obeyed the command of our friends, and had little free will to go against that word. To anyone else, they\u2019d act normally to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked up to his copy and poked him to make sure he was real. The fake Ben was pushed back a bit by the poke. Ben could tell that the flesh was pretty tangible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk, these copies should last about a week, and then we\u2019ll have to send over another set of clones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cLets get these bad boys back on earth.\u201d She snapped her fingers and the copies vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cDown to business\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They started hyperventilating and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang was shocked, and Amy and Gwen\u2019s protective nature kicked in. They ran up and cast a spell to ease the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the Twins got up covered in blue sweat. They were breathing heavily and their eyes looked unfocused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat happened? Were you attacked somehow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twin spoke between breaths \u201cSort\u2026 of\u2026\u201d They paused as they thought about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Ben felt like they were keeping something hidden, and Seth was still oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWhat are you keeping from us? What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins smirked \u201cWe guess there\u2019s no point in keeping it a secret. Do you want to know why we can\u2019t fight when they enter this universe?\u201d Everyone was silently waiting for a response. The Twin stood up and took off their lab coat revealing pale blue skin with purple and green veins. One area was pumping up and down like there was a heart there, but just above it was an Anodite symbol. It was glowing iridescent purple. \u201cJust after the battle ended, we begged the Anodites to seal away the Dark Ones in a universe in our body. While they were there, we could activate a part of our immune system thereby sending them into deep sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. G. Matter \u201cI am the seal. \u201cHe points to his purple seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. D. Matter \u201cAnd I and the universe.\u201d He points to a black star gazed type seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth \u201cThey will break through the seal and then aim for the universe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWait\u2026 you two? You two are the holes! I have to close you two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins shook their heads \u201cNo. Not you. All of you as one. No one person can stand up to the might of the Dark Ones\u2026 no matter how strong. Brute force will end in failure. The opportunity to seal them once again will arise just a moment before we  merge. Our bodies will be consumed and converted into a rip in space and time. When Prison and Original become one, then things will be to late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was crying  \u201cWait. You two are going to die?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded with monotone expressions \u201cWe knew that this day would come one day, and we have had eons to accept the outcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was fuming \u201cNo! I can\u2019t accept that. There has to be another way! We could enhance the strength of the seals, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded \u201cYes, you could, but it was only prolong the inevitable. The Dark One have awaken, and they will not return to sleep. The seal will eventually be broken. The seal is of mana, and so are they. However, their mana will eventually triumph.\u201d they paused. \u201cUnless\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was tearing up and had hid her face in Ben\u2019s shirt again, and Ben held onto her. Nick had grabbed a hold of Gwen arm. If he let go, Gwen would have let loose. He was keeping her mind and soul grounded. Seth knew the situation was grim, but he was oblivious to how bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWell ok then. You two are going to die. Let\u2019s take the time we have to get ready. Crying and mourning before they even die is a waste of time, and it appears to be that we are short on that too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had let go of Ben\u2019s shirt to hear Seth\u2019s short speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSeth\u2019s right. Lets just do what needs to be done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smile as he saw the sudden turn around in his friends. \u201cLets do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen smirked and they let loose a giant burst of mana to show their resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe universe, for a brief second, was flooded in the light of hope and the warmth of new will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tell them that if they finish before the deadline, they\u2019ll all get a 500g of gold.\u201d Xam was swing money every where ever since they discovered the gold planet. They had a near infinite supply, well, he did at least. No one knew about except him and a few individuals. The planet was now funding the entire Plumber organization, and a few large projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan looked out the window and stared into space. What was going to come? A week after he met his Grand Nephew and his posse, he had a horrid nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------Entering Dreamscape------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarms were wailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessenger \u201cCommander!

Even human bullets do little damage. Any damage they take quickly heals. However, the northern hemisphere to fairing better than any of the others. The anodites are shooting off them off slowly, but they are taking more damage than they are returning.

What should we do!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ship was assaulted by bolts of black mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all Xam could do was watch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------Exit Dreamscape-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam \u201cWhatever they are\u2026 they aren\u2019t getting the universe while I\u2019m here.\u201d He turned to the messenger. \u201cNevermind.

Now hurry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe messenger started to back fast and tripped itself over. It got up and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam smiled and then looked in the mirror. He saw a deranged type of smile on his face. \u201cOy\u2026 I think I\u2019m going crazy\u2026 last year I would never! 1000g indeed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on OOPS, the Twins were having another spasm. Gwen and Amy\u2019s magic helped at a minimal. When they were done, they said \u201cOk\u2026 the stars should super nova soon. You guys should go.\u201d They told each person where it was and they were sent there by mana. \u201cBen, stay here. We need to have a word with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked over. The Twins looked like they aged decades in the past two days. Their once smooth blue skin has gone purple and has wrinkled up. Their eyes were beginning to sink inward a bit. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins wheezed \u201cYou must know this and tell the other when they return.\u201d The have another coughing fit \u201cWhen out seals break, our bodies will disassemble and create two opening. One two the prison universe, and another one that leads straight to the original.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYes, you told us that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cWait. We\u2019re not done. The portals will not appear where we are. The Prison portal will actually appear in four place. They will appear in the northern, southern, western, and eastern points of this universe. Gravitron is at the center of the universe, if you didn\u2019t know that. It\u2019s the reason the universe is expanding.\u201d They paused \u201cBen, remember the portal you went through?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYes, I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cThat portal will expand like a bubble until its boundaries consume this universe, and ultimately touch and merge with the four prison portals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was silent \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us sooner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins sighed \u201cWe didn\u2019t know there they\u2019d form until recently. We could not give you false information, or that alone could doom us all. We discovered the locations in our last attack, and we think that we can only survive another one. Two tops. We are sorry we can not help more, but we are trying to give you all as much time to prepare as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was crying dry tears. He had learned to steel his heart against pain and not cry, but some how\u2026 looking at these two suffer for them\u2026 he let loose a single drop. \u201cIts not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins knew what was going to happen \u201cBen\u2026 you didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt all the steel in his heart give way. The dam holding back the tears surged forward \u201cIts all not fault!\u201d He started punching the ground. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gone and done that stupid experiment at the center of Gravitron, then you two could still live!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins smiled \u201cBut if you hadn\u2019t\u2026 Thousands of lives would have been lost to the Thing, and we wouldn\u2019t have a mascot. And further more, if you hadn\u2019t made the nexus, the green orb would have collapsed your universe and then it would have eventually collapsed this one. You see, that mistake has saved many and all lives. Now it can be used to save them again.\u201d The wheezed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins \u201cNow wipe you eyes and soften your heart. Tears are the essence of emotions. They could save someone someday. Do not be ashamed of them for they do not make you weak. The young can cry for the are weak, and the young can grow stronger, and yet they can still cry. They cry tears of joy\u2026 tears of mourn\u2026 tears of pain\u2026 and tears of longing. The strong can cry because they are strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked. \u201cTh-Thank you.\u201d He felt a sudden lightness on his chest. The world wasn\u2019t pressing on him so much anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins frowned \u201cDon\u2019t say it now! Say it to us after you save the universe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared at them. WHEN he saved it and not IF. Ben nodded and looked up to the heavens. His gaze was filled with new resolve and a willingness to do anything necessary to save his favorite realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben stared into the sky seeing thing with a more opened mind. Suddenly, he saw a flash of Red, Purple, Blue, and the brightest of all was White. Ben then saw his medallion flare green as the orb inside of it flared in unison with the powerful supernovas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese stars were hidden behind rings of asteroids and shrouds of dense gas. No one has ever set eyes on any colored stars except the green one who\u2019s powerful green light extinguished any type of cover that the Twins had tried to surround it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when the universe was being copied, the Twin knew that they would eventually lose and a new guardian of the universe would be needed. So for the next eon, they devoted ever ounce of their energy, and the energy of even the unknown worlds into the creation of these jewels of the sky. To protect them, they hid the stars, and it worked for the most part. The green star was defiant. The green energy wanted everything to grow, so it pushed the dust and rock away and bathed the universe in its light\u2026 and thus creating life in place that were once desolate. The other stars were dormant and less active than the green one, so they stayed hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red star, after waking up was volatile and aggressive. It blasted the dust and debris away with such force that they broke down into atoms and even their subatomic particles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Nick entered its light, he felt his muscle grow and compress at an astounding rate. With every heart beat, he bulked up a tiny bit more. He wasn\u2019t getting compressed fast enough. Suddenly, the Red star started to convulse as Nick neared it. Then it went super nova. Flares of red energy shot outward and bent as they nose dived toward Nick\u2019s red orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, any compression was pointless. In seconds his size grew to that of a planet, and a minute later, he could have passed off as a tan star. Rapidly, his size increased, and on top of this chunk of muscle was a tiny minuscule head that was moaning from lust and pleasure. Nick was learning to enjoy his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth found that the blue star was really energetic, and that its light made him feel\u2026 happy. The light was the essence of joy. The energy matched Seth\u2019s personality pretty well. As soon as Seth neared it, the star did something never before seen. Instead of exploding, it simply popped\u2026 like a bubble. Inside was a gas was drifted to wards Seth. He felt himself fall deep into pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every breath he took, he took in some of the gas, and his cock grew\u2026 and grew\u2026 and grew! Soon, he simply stopped exhaling and breathed in a continuous stream of gas. At the same time, the orb was also absorbing that gas and feeding a stead stream of energy into Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked almost comical, like Nick. A giant cock, almost the length of a galaxy had a tiny muscular body attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had passed out the moment she entered the purple light. The purple star is unique. The Twins did not make it, but their allies the original Anodites did. They had invested every particle of mana and energy they had into this purple star in hope that it would serve to stop their dark counter parts. Half of the immortals sacrificed their bodies the solidify the mana and to amplify its power to almost infinity. All that power overwhelmed Gwen\u2019s mind, and now she just simply floated in space as the giant ball of mana floated towards her and entered the purple orb. There was a tiny stark going between the orb and Gwen, and the amount of energy in it was beyond description. Gwen\u2019s mana field  burst past this universe and stopped just millimeters short of Amy\u2019s intense mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt safe again. The white light surrounded her and gave her warmth. The white hearthstone glowed softly as it soothed Amy\u2019s mind and body. Like a cloud, the entire white star drifted over the Amy and surrounded her, and then fading away. As the hearthstone absorbed the white star, it made a few final changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Amy\u2019s bones infinitely dense like Ben\u2019s so that her internal organ would be protected from physical assault. It made her skin stronger to with stand more, also like Ben. It made her muscles a just a bit stronger than they look without changing their structure, so that she could partially defend her self. They were more so that she could run and climb, etc. However, it didn\u2019t make her so strong that she needed a seal. Just a \u2018bit\u2019 stronger, that\u2019s all (and it used magic so that she could actually lift her super dense bones and skin). Then finally, it made her goddess like assets grow to a pair of KK cups. They were so big that she could suffocate herself if she wasn\u2019t careful, thought the hearthstone will prevent that. It did want to protect her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights began to shrink and then flare once again as the orbs burst with energy. Ben sighed\u2026 they were done. He could actually imagine how they must have felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Long enough for the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins gasp \u201cBen!!! We can\u2019t\u2026 its to much.

We must have one last word.\u201d Ben nodded and pulled out his plumber badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, the creator of the Omnitrix was standing by his brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth came without another word, nor did he cry\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Flashback----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cWhat do you think you are doing? If you seal them inside of you\u2026 you\u2019ll die\u2026\u201d Azmuth screamed. He didn\u2019t want to lose his elder brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins \u201cNow Azmuth\u2026 this is our decision. Don\u2019t be burdened by our choice. It is for the good of the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth was weeping \u201cI don\u2019t care. We can seal them somewhere else. Some place even harder to get out of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins \u201cIt will be only temporary. Nothing can with stand the constant assault of mana for more than a century!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth yelled \u201cI don\u2019t care. We\u2019ll do it again! And again! Until they get bored of breaking free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twins smiled and picked p their little brother. \u201cNow is this a away for the next emperor of the Grey Matters to act? You will continue where we left off. We think we might start raising money for a scientific community, and you can stop by every now and then. We won\u2019t die today, or tomorrow. We think\u2026 But we\u2019re alive right now, so lets enjoy it. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth continued to cry\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----End Flashback-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth walked up to his brothers \u201cYou have called for me? What is it that you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins smiled \u201cJust to see you once more\u2026 that is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth frowned. \u201cI see\u2026 Is there anything else you wish from me. I am busy preparing my forces for the coming battle, and so are the Plumbers\u2026 surprisingly, they had begun preparations before I notified them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins smiled knowingly \u201cOne of them had a bad dream.\u201d They chuckled and then that turned into heavy coughing and wheezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth felt his walls beginning to crumble. For the past eons, he had hardened his heart for this moment. He knew it would come. \u201cStop\u2026 stop laughing. You\u2019ll die quicker if you keep it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwin smiled \u201cLittle brother. What is life to you? Is it just prolonged existence, or do you really want to live it. Do something dangerous. Like it really was the last moment of your life\u2026 you must enjoy it, and have no regrets. Unlike us. Our only regret is not getting to see those blasted Anodites finally get destroyed. By kids, and nothing less!\u201d They wheezed and coughed. \u201cBrother\u2026 make sure they succeed will you? That is the only favor we will ever ask you. It is not your duty as king of our people. No it is a request from your elder siblings. Please\u2026\u201d They reached out there hand to hug him one last time, but they fell limp just micrometers short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth\u2019s wall crumbled. He let out a wailed that was not heard since the first sealing, and tears that had not fallen since. When he stopped he walked over to their bodies and picked our a bit of skin from both. \u201cYou will be remembered in the greats grave of all times\u2026\u201d He opened his pocket and pulled out the Omnitrix. Then he placed the flecks of DNA inside. \u201cAnd brothers\u2026 I will help them. With my life if I must. I won\u2019t let you guys down.\u201d Azmuth wipe his tears and turned around  to see Ben a little while off. Azmuth smiled and thanks him mentally for the privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away, he did not turn around. He knew that what he saw would tarnish his memory of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rushing of air and two bodies vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has begun\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was one of the few living things left that remember the first sealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cBen. My battalion of troops will stall the Dark Anodites. You will go and speed you friends along with what ever needs to be done. The twins have done all they can to give you time, and now its my turn. Waste not a moment Ben Tennyson. It has begun\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded\u2026 unsealed himself\u2026 and then he vanished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in a single moment 5 people, 4 star cores, and 4 planets disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the four corners of the universe, the largest gathering of alien forces congregated. They stood around massive black holes. Then suddenly, they black hole imploded revealing a much smaller black veiled ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commanders screamed to their soldiers telling them to maintain their positions. Order soon returned. The people of the front line were warned of what was to come. Azmuth has gone after delivering a speech and through explanation of what they were facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrute force will not work. You have to fight magic with magic, so they created mana guns. These guns took mana that was in the surrounding space, and compressed then into laser bullets. Kind of like when Gwen throws mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had anticipated thought that they would have to build mana converters to change ordinary light and heat into mana, but it turns out they did not. Something or things were acting as mana generators. Actually, the strength of the mana bullets had nearly tripled just recently. As though some entity had evolved into a mana monster, and created a mana field so larger it covered the universe. There was more than one source\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in Ben\u2019s universe. He had to get as much time as possible, and no time passed inside his universe, so he waited. Quickly, the energy of his universe healed their body and minds until they were ready to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth had shrunk down now that their growth and compression had stabilized. Gwen and Amy\u2019s mana field were still growing. Ben was also experiencing burst of muscle growth that shrank down to his minimum. All the orbs had come together causing huge amount of energy to be created. Even Ben was influenced by it to a significant degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw that they were in Ben\u2019s universe, and it could only mean one thing. With the Twin\u2019s gone, Ben had to move on and speed things up to fight the Dark Ones. However, she did not cry. She couldn\u2019t because she knew she had to stay strong for the coming fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and the others came to a similar conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, wanting to move onto the next step \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen reached into his pocket and held out the cores of each of their stars. \u201cPut these into your orbs. These will increase their power, but mostly their stability. When that is done, go to your planets. I put then behind you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned around to see massive looming pearl like planets floating right behind them. They proceeded to put the core into their orbs. Nick had an iridescent flame shaped core, Seth had and ocean wave crashing on top of each other, Gwen had an iridescent purple star complex/matrix, and Amy had a perfectly white and  smooth sphere. Then they place them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick expanded for a brief moment, and then shrank back down. The core grew him very little since its main purpose was stability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt his muscles pop a bit, but for and instant, his pants were filled 90% with one organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen\u2019s mana field flared as it filled about 9 universe in Ben\u2019s realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s heart stone  pulsed and her mana field went further than ever and filled 9 like Gwen\u2019s, but the mana she emitted was 100 times purer and stronger. It was a type of healing mana. Gwen\u2019s mana was about 75 times stronger than regular mana, and it all went into power and magical force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen floated there watching his friends experience the changes their orbs gave. Ben felt explosions of growth happen with in his muscles. Explosions that he hasn\u2019t felt since he first got the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they proceeded to absorb their planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s flaming red inferno of a planet blazed as it entered Nick\u2019s red orb. Ben had to encase him in a pocket dimension to keep the sudden burst of his growth from blowing his friends away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame with Seth, his cock became unsealed do to the growth it experienced and it stretch the entire length of Ben\u2019s universe. And Ben though his cock was big before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen passed out as the brute strength of her mana grew exponentially. Before it was 75 times the strength. Now it was immeasurable. If you could say the biggest number you knew, it could be assured that she was greater than it. Her mana field spanned the entirety of Ben\u2019s world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s mana field spanned out just beyond Ben\u2019s universe and was greater than Gwen\u2019s in potency, but it was not so much for attack as it was for healing and defense. The mana was going to protect Amy, and as many people as possible. However, if the Mana guns wanted to use her mana, they could turn it into brute force be compressing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s orb flared green as it responded to the growth in power of the other orbs. The energy was sporadic. Not even the nexus could keep track of it all. Then suddenly, it even out and balance itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen knew they were done\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soldiers were fighting for the universe and their lives. Ten Anodites have crossed, and that\u2019s all its taken to create wide spread panic. They were beautiful creatures. Their pale skin was rejuvenated in this universe. They regained lost color and looked less evil. With a sweep of their arm, they released eons of stored mana killing thousands. Yet millions were sill arriving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJets of purple mana came out of strange guns. They were thin streams of concentrated mana. Then suddenly, as if someone hooked them up to a generator, the stream of mana turned into a river and then into a waterfall! Thousands of soldiers found that their weapon had exploded in power. They trained then all onto the Anodites and began to slowly drive them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anodites found themselves have to drift back a bit. It did not matter. They had expected a large fight when they first left. This was to where them out. The first 10 anodites went back to the portal and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were cheers of victory as the Ten were gone. Then suddenly, they felt an ominous presence. A strange black sphere began to appear out of the portal. They fired at it, but it did no damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one gun had tuned into Amy\u2019s mana and fired it. A an of white mana reigned down on the strange black ball and extinguished it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the portal, there were sounds of screaming and yelling. Unintelligent words came streaming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBillions of black mana missiles shot out of the portal in a single instant. It blazed a line through the battalion of soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang had just left his world. Nick was twice as big as before, and his strength was creating a man field that just currently shrouded the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same with Seth. However, their fields will eventually grow beyond it along with their increasing maximums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s mana field was infinitely larger than even his own large universe, so it\u2019s a waste of mana. And since his orb didn\u2019t like to compress things or make things smaller, Ben had made a deal with his orb in order to help out the forces that were at the front line. He asked it to concentrate his ever growing mana field so that it could only fill what ever universe it was in. If he was in his universe, it would only go as far as the boundaries. Then it would just start getting denser and stronger. In return, Ben had to swallow his worries, and let the orb grow him more. He would have grown to 10ft exactly, according to the orb, but now it had a little more freedom. It would grow him until he got out of college which should be around 22 or 23 years old. Which was a shorter time than before, but now the orb could grow him to 15ft tall. With was about 5 ft over what he might have been. Ben let out a small cry. That\u2019d be about a bit over a foot a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen told himself to suck it up and do it for the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Amy did the same thing. Since their mana fields were larger than Ben\u2019s universe, it\u2019d be a waste of mana  if they weren\u2019t in the current universe, so they had their orbs compress it down to fit the universe they were inside of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the already potent manas increase billions of times, and still increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front lines, soldiers were trying to fight off the guerrilla tactics of the Anodites. They appeared in different places send of blasts of mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a major break through for the good guys came. After Ben, Amy, and Gwen\u2019s mana got compressed, the waterfalls of mana each turned into an ocean or planet worth of mana. That\u2019s how concentrated it was. Some of the guns were even running nonstop. The only reason they hadn\u2019t broken yet was because of Amy\u2019s healing and defensive mana. It was guarding the guns and joining in occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessenger \u201cSir! The our forces are withstanding the Anodite forces currently. However, out guns are finite and their\u2019s are not. We have lost about a third of out mana guns. However, it appears that their strength had grown exponentially several times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam hearded what was going on with the guns from a transmission with Azmuth. So Ben\u2019s gang is the reason behind all this. Now isn\u2019t\u2026 \u201cThat is good news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they got a transmission. On the screen can the image of massive black balls of mana surging our of the portal in a continuous stream. There were flairs of white mana that got rid of most of them, but some of them got through in between shots. The ones that did get through shot off into the distance and joined together with other spheres that had gotten through. Rapidly, the sphere had grown huge, and not match the size of a star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam was waiting for something like this to shoot at. \u201cPrepare the Mana Blaster 9000!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessenger nodded and left. Various controllers in the room began to punch in numbers and calculate locations, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the ship was a giant ring. It was the latest design for a mana shooter, but blow up in proportions. The ring floated near by the ship awaiting its command. Then suddenly it began to light up as it powered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome yelled to Xam \u201cSir! Its ready and fully functional.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXam nodded and was given a remote with a large red button. He smile like a child who just found his favorite toy. He pressed the button\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the ring began compressing copious amount of mana. All the mana within a light year was being turned into a giant beam. Them it fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam of Purple, White, Blue, Red, and mostly Green exploded out. It was a terrible beauty. It cut through various dead planets and a couple stars leaving giant gaping hole inside of them. Then it made contact with the giant black sphere. The sphere never stood a change. It fell apart into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, on the other side of the portal was a single screech of anger. All of them were ready to charge out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of your manas are powering our mana guns, and our giant Mana Blaster 9000. We\u2019ve destroyed dozens of black mana stars with the help of your mana.\u201d Then Xam looked to the side and moved out of the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth stepped in \u201cOk. No time for greetings. We are holding them off. The next step is for you guys is to seal the portals. The one one Gravitum is being monitored it has currently grown to match the planet itself, but its speeding up. You all must hurry before it consumes this universe and merges everything together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and ended the transmission. \u201cGuys. You heard that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed \u201cJust how are we supposed to close a portal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ben got another call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth \u201cYou all may need to must as much mana as you have to spare. You have to force the portal to close by creating a pressure differential. Its like a balloon. If the outside pressure increases, the balloon shrinks. If the outside drops, the balloon expands. You guys have already slowed it down once you re-entered this universe. Now you have to bring it up higher. Some how\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBut if we do this, then won\u2019t the mana guns lose their source of power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth sighed \u201cWe\u2019ll have to deal with the loss. Be hasty though. Every second spent talking is a hundred thousand lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they heard voices. \u201cCommander! The anodites have started crossing in massive numbers now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzmuth looked back at the screen \u201cCross that! Millions of lives are going per second. No pressure!\u201d Then the transmission ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group waster no time. In a flash, they vanished and appeared just above Gravitron. Instead of the planter though, there was not a grey bubbly mist surrounding the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cEvery one cover an angler. We\u2019re going to form a square pyramid.\u201d (since that will make the distance from one person to another equal, and they will thereby be applying equal force on each side).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one argued, and they obeyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orbs suddenly flared as they remembered the reason they were created. They threw away their desires for this one act as they pulled in all their owner\u2019s manas and concentrated it on closing the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the battle front\u2026 silence\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir manas had started to surround the portal, and stopped its expansion. Quickly, the mana increased and the bubble shrank. Slowly, but surely, the bubble got smaller and smaller. The gang stood in the place with their arms and legs outstretched like they were making snow angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubble grew smaller and smaller until you began to see the surface of Gravitron again. Was it this easy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a wave of black mana entered the portal increasing the pressure on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang didn\u2019t need to look to see that every Dark Anodite was there to stop them from foiling their plans of immortality. They fed every ounce of mana they had into the bubble to counteract the pressure that was being applied outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was a sumo fight. To giant mana entities were pushing against each other trying to get ahead of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought, so this is why we couldn\u2019t win with just brute force. This was a battle of mana against mana. The stronger you were, the greater your mana. Unless you\u2019re an anodite. Then you were just weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubble stopped shrinking and it began to expand again. The gang was sweating now as they tried to oppose the numerous Anodites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a distance, they could see each other, but they could take with their minds via their stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cGuys! We\u2019re slipping. Keep up the force!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cNick! We know. We can see it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThere is just to many of them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cCome one guys don\u2019t lose hope. We can still do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled mentally \u201cWhat he said!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cReally Ben? Is that the best you can come up with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cUmm\u2026 yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYou\u2019re such a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cGuys! Focus. We lost more ground! Its getting bigger again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubble was growing faster now. The numerous Anodites replenished their mana much faster than 5 teens who were quickly running out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Dark Anodites changed tactics. They blasted a surge of mana so strong that it blew the gang out of position. Their concentration was shattered, and the orb\u2019s glow was suppressed by dark mana.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their bodies were being held down by the sheer force of the manas of hundreds of powerful Dark Anodites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Anodites cheered, and yelled in very human sounding voices now. They had grown back into their old shapes after having forgotten them in that prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang could hear it, but they simply didn\u2019t have the will to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth yelled in their minds \u201cNO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not yet. We\u2019re still breathing. don\u2019t give up yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smirked \u201cLeave it to Seth to be the first to pull himself out of a deep dark ditch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and shook his head in shame \u201cI can\u2019t believe I was giving up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy touched Ben mentally \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it that yet. You simply got lost. There\u2019s still time though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had momentarily lost her aggressive fire, but that returned in greater force \u201cAm I crazy! I can\u2019t believe I thought about giving up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cThat\u2019s it girl. Turn up the heat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smirked \u201cReady guys?\u201d He looked and caught all their gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nodded in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth yelled \u201cYahoo!! Lets do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery smiled \u201cEnergetic as always.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the orbs were reacting to their conversation. Then the orbs let out a piercing light that cut through the dark mana freeing the gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anodites stopped their cheering and looked in surprise as their foes got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith out need for instruction, the gang turned there focus from the portal to the Anodites. They sent oceans of condensed mana onto the Anodites causing their strong senses for mana to get over loaded. Hundreds passed out, but hundreds remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining realized that they were being attacked and began to fight back. The gang shifted from suppressing their enemy to actually attacking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen fired billions of purple mana missiles at the Anodites causing then to go on the defensive. Ben, Nick, and Seth were muscling their way around distracting the Anodites. Though they couldn\u2019t break their enemies skin, they were able to  disorientate them. Amy on the other hand was sending off giant pulses of pure white mana to neutralize what ever the enemies managed to shoot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the tides turn. The gang pushed the Anodites to their limit when suddenly the Anodites nodded at one another. The all turned and stared at one Anodite who crunched over screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, that anodite exploded into pure dark mana. Its atoms were ripped apart into energy and that energy was turned into dark mana. Suddenly, another anodite burst open, and then a dozen more followed. The hundreds of remaining anodites focused on the mana and pulled it together into a giant dark star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang stared at it suddenly losing hope. The ball of mana was oozing despair and hopelessness. Gwen fired a ball of mana at it, and it got absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Amy\u2019s hearthstone felt its first purpose calling. Amy was going to be hurt if it didn\u2019t act. Suddenly, Amy raised her arms and blasted a torrent of pure white mana into the darkness of the mana ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang felt their minds clear as Amy\u2019s mana pushed away the darkness. They to joined in to help Amy. They funneled all their mana into Amy, and the Hearthstone converted it into pure white mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anodites were fuming. They lost 14 immortal brethren, and they do not want waste their lives.. They began to funnel their own mana into the ball to strengthen it. And once it was strong enough, they\u2019d send it hurling toward the mortal nuisance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, it was a sumo fight. The gang were at their limit now, and so were the anodites. The winner was unclear. Then an anodite sacrificed its body and turned into dark mana. Then 3 more joined. The dark ball expanded and began to over power the gang. They were starting to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s white mana beam began to waver and dim. Then suddenly it was gone. The gang had run dry. The anodites had won\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark mana ball began its decent of destruction. It floated toward the gang ready to obliterate them. The distance shank smaller and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could barely move because the mana was so powerful. All they could manage was to drift closer to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy start to whimper, and so Ben grabbed onto her. Ben looked at the ball with hate and anger. He has all the strength in countless universes, and yet he was powerless to a giant ball of mana. He hated that feeling of weakness and hopelessness. That\u2019s the very reason he chose to become strong. He need to guard Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy clung closely to Ben. He presence helped block out a lot of the dark mana. She felt the warmth in his body seep into her and make her feel safe despite the situation. She heard his heart beat strongly and continuously. She felt his hold hew tightly as to protect her. She felt\u2026 safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then suddenly, hundreds of anodites cloaked in purple surged out of the portal to aid the friends. They had been waiting on the other side gathering their strength to make one large fatal strike at their dark counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Anodites have been storing their energy for eons to fight off the Light Anodites. That had not anticipated fight another force as well. Quickly, they began to fail. Even with their larger numbers, their mana has been severely reduced. However, they did not retreat. They could not willingly go back to a dark and desolate would where famine rules a land of immortals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey counter attack and drive at the Light Anodites, but they do little damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur friends sit floating around dumbstruck .What just happened? Were they just saved? After a brief moment, they collected their wits and returned to fighting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Gwen were next to each other sending burst of mana in every direction. Nick and Seth had grown to a massive size and had begun swiping at the Dark anodites like pesky mosquitoes. They were careful to avoid the White anodites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, on the other hand, simply disappeared. Every Dark anodite that wasn\u2019t being attack suddenly fell unconscious. Though they were not bleeding, they had broken several bones and received a severe head injure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith in moment, the Immortal Dark Anodites were defeated, but still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most authoritative Light Anodite floated up to the gang. He spoke to them \u201cThank you all. We are sorry we were unable to join sooner, but we had to gather our forces and our mana. We are fewer in number than they are, so we could not risk a prolonged fight. We needed you five to drain them of their mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang was some what angry, but mostly cheerful. They had won!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI\u2019m cool with it. You did what you had to do. The merge should be stopped right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe LA (light anodite) nodded. \u201cLet out people deal with that. You guys have another thing to do.\u201d The LA reached into a pouch and pulled out a Vita \u201cUse this to heal your wounded friends. If you infuse it with enough healing mana, it could even bring some of them back. Depending on how long they have been gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang finally realized that since the DA (Dark Anodites) were here, then they must have defeated the plumber forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took the bag of vitas \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLA \u201cNo\u2026 thank you. No be swift. The power of the Vita can only call them back if they are not gone to long. You have but a few minutes left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang looked at Amy, and she knew what to do. She grabbed a hand full of vitas and channeled every particle of mana she had into it. Suddenly, the vita glowed and then it vaporized into pure healing energy. The energy traveled faster than the speed of light touching everything that was injured. Cleaning its wound and healing it. Suddenly, Trillions of things woke up fully healed, and only a few million were far to gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe LA was socked by the display of healing he had just witness. \u201cWhat is your name, Goddess of Life and Healing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was shocked and then she blushed a the complement \u201cI\u2019m not a goddess or anything, but my name\u2019s Amy. My source of healing comes from my hearthstone. It was made and forged with the will to protect and defend my life, and this caused it to also have a strong healing affinity.\u201d She raised her hearthstone for the LA to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe LA looked at the lustrous pure white pearl. \u201cIt is beyond description.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the DA\u2019s began to stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lets just close the rest of the portals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, they closed the portal on Gravitron, and the four prison portals.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Its been nearly 6 months since the DA invasion and he kept bumping his head on doorways. The orb was definitely keen to get it end of the bargain. Over that period of time, the orb rushed him along into a super growth spurt making him grow 8inches! He was now 8ft5in tall with strong, fast, and flexible limbs. Every other boy would have slowed down in their growth around this time, but not for Ben. He sped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen watched slowly as the 10ft ceiling at home and at school got closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen spent every other night trying to think of how a relationship at such a size difference would work. Amy would only be as tall as his thigh. She\u2019d be like a child in his hands. And how were they going to do \u2018it\u2019. By then, he assumed that \u2018it\u2019 would be to massive for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he was just wishing it was over. The crazy hunger spikes were driving him nuts. He was eating constantly to fuel his crazed orbs desires. The high level of hormones were urging him to do \u2018it\u2019 once with Amy, and it was hard to ignore. Every time he was near Amy, he\u2019d be able tower above her, so that when he looked down, he saw the two massive globes underneath her shirt. He tried not to think to much about her body, but the surges of hormones were making it difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had noticed Ben\u2019s change in feelings. He still loved her, but he was battling himself out of respect for her on will and decision making. Probably, if she had asked to do it once, he\u2019d jump at it unable to contain the thoughts his hormones gave him. She realized what was going on when they were standing next to each other in the lunch line at school. She was standing a foot away, but she could feel the heat coming of his body as he struggled to keep his urges in check. She\u2019d have to give the orb a little talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen being big was perfectly fine with her. However, once it started playing games with her boyfriends mind, then it crossed the line. Amy, one day stormed up to Ben and demanded to be sent into the orb for some reason, and he obliged after a series of half truth/lie scenarios. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Amy went up to the green orb and started spazzing at it for making his hormones all whack. Was that really necessary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb had actually communicated with Amy\u2026 to an extent, so they made a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen, not if, they had a child or they had children, the orb would be allowed to make them grow. It would continue to grow Ben to up to 12 ft, and leave the remaining 3 feet for later. If it\u2019s a boy, the orb will put the last 3 remaining feet on the boy when he hits puberty. If it was a girl, then she\u2019d become a goddess among mortals. Her assets would make any man\u2019s face go red, and 50% to get nosebleeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed, she guessed her kids wouldn\u2019t hate it so bad. She was afraid they might be more rebellious because of it. However, Ben is who she is currently bargaining for. The last issue is for how long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb said that Ben was currently 8ft5in. Which was 3ft 7in away from the agreed 12ft. It could grow him to that height by the end of senior year just to get it out of the way, and it promised to stop messing with certain emotional hormones. (cause it wanted Ben big as soon as possible, and preferred not to prolong it. However, if it could get at his children, then it\u2018d be more willing.) Or they could stick to the original time which was about the end of college, and it could continue paying with his desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought about it, and the sooner was definitely better. Ben would need to focus in college, and considering the way he is now in high school, it be better if it was done now and not later when it crucially mattered. Plus if she accepted the first agreement, Ben wouldn\u2019t be forced to suppress any urges that don\u2019t exist naturally. And besides, 12 was only a little over twice the average. 15ft was far to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, \u201cBy the end of high school, and we have a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb flash bright green, and outside, Ben just felt all his naughty urges fade away to a minimal. She thought about what Amy could have done inside with the orb to get it to stop playing with his hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy came out, she told him the good news, and Ben was shocked but grateful. He took her out for dinner to say thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he\u2019d still be over twice her height. And the three feet he lost would still leave Amy at either at or below his waist line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat! I\u2019ll be growing like 3ft next year!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled \u201cI thought we\u2019d muddle through some how. Besides it was either during high school and sober or in college and extra horny. Take your pick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen yelled \u201cThen I\u2019ll take it college and be horny for Christ sake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paused in shock but then she heard him laughing and she elbowed him \u201cNow funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen continued laughing \u201cYou had to see your face. It was\u2026\u201d Then he tried to imitate her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSo you\u2019re still going to be about twice my height. don\u2019t you know how hard it to make eye contact with you once we get with in like 5ft? I have to crane my neck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scratched his head \u201cYah, well\u2026 its not 15ft at least. I don\u2019t need to worry so much about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cWhatever. I guess we\u2019ll just have to deal with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey! I\u2019m not the only one with a problem!\u201d He smiled \u201cGuess who\u2019s going to gain 100lbs of muscle within a year. That orb of yours is definitely crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wasn\u2019t smiling. He hoped it make him somewhat taller. The orb was increasing his minimum, so he couldn\u2019t make an bulbous muscles get  more compact. So all he could hope for was for the extra muscle to be added as compact strength and weight, and not to much in size. He wanted to be able to walk and not waddle his way into a bathroom. \u201cWell, I wish I could be the one gaining 3ft next year and not be the one getting so huge that I can\u2019t see anything below these giant pecs. You can see beyond yours right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYah. I can. I have a tight balance build.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick did a face \u201cYah yah. I\u2019ve heard it before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cAHH!!! I can\u2019t take it. I can\u2019t even look at a girl with out wanting to lock just the two of us in a dark closet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWow! Dude\u2026 calm down? Is this what you wanted to talk to me and Ben about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed \u201cWell I certainly couldn\u2019t talk to Gwen and especially Amy. I\u2019d have gone wild.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grumbled, but brushed the unintended insult aside \u201cLook. You made a deal and you have to get a girlfriend. The longer you put it off, the worse the orb is going to mess with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed \u201cI kind of wish I didn\u2019t accept the orb now, but it\u2019s a mixed feeling. I\u2019m glad that its nearly added 20 lbs of muscle, but guess what it also did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cThere\u2019s no need to guess. Anyone who even glimpses at you can see the giant you have in there. You need to have a warning sign or some people might look back to make sure they aren\u2019t hallucinating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth frowned \u201cIts not funny. Even if I got a girlfriend, the thing is going to make me want her until I marry her, and it wants kids! How am I supposed to fit this 20in monster in anyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Ben both fell of their seats \u201cWHAT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth rolled his eyes \u201cYes! I said it. That\u2019s how big its gotten since we beat those Anodites. It said it would be done soon, but it didn\u2019t say when. So I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll stop now or at most 23in. I have to spend like a good minute each morning stuffing it into my pants.\u201d Then he turned to Ben \u201cOH! And thanks. The close you gave to us back on OOPS are the only thing I can wear that can hold this thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cOk. Good. I\u2019m glad they serve a good use, but I wasn\u2019t expecting anything like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth yelled \u201cMe either!\u201d He stomped his giant foot and his bulge bounced a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cLooks like its not working enough. Be careful when you run. The thing bounces.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth frowned \u201cI haven\u2019t ran in 2 months just because of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cJust imagine the cloths stronger so they don\u2019t\u2026 you know\u2026 bounce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cNo, I stopped because I can barely stop my self from pleasuring my self.\u201d Then he turned around \u201cKnow what? I\u2019m just going to stop talking about it. Great big help you two. Just amazing.\u201d He was oozing sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Ben smiled \u201cFine\u2026 we\u2019ll help you get a girl friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth scoffed \u201cWith Amy and Gwen\u2019s help hopefully. Cause I can\u2019t talk to them the way I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for bachelorhood. What\u2019s going to happen next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Might as well get used to being a child around a giant. Ben grabbed hold of her and pulled her in closer \u201cSo what are we going to d about our Seth situation. He purposely didn\u2019t come because he knew that once he saw either of you he\u2019d lose control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cActually, he did when he saw a couple of girls at school today. I had to tie him down with 20 sets of rope. That guy\u2019s insanely strong. Though not as bad as me.\u201d Nick did a double bicep flex trying to get a reaction out of Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled and face palmed just to make Nick feel that it worked, and it kind of did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIts very obvious that he can\u2019t get a girl friend the way he is right now. He might have to let loose for a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYah. He should go into his universe and just release all his pent up energy and just get sober. He\u2019s just high on hormones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Nick, Gwen, Seth and Amy all placed their orbs inside their gravitum universe. Gwen had her purple bracelet that increases mana as well. Nick had his watch. Seth had Gravitum particles in his blood. Amy\u2026 well she just wears it around her neck.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas tied to a metal pole so tightly that he couldn\u2019t move a finger let alone an arm. He waited patiently after Nick made sure he wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard the voices of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock Knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cCan we come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt his cock twitch and begin to fill with blood. \u201cNo! don\u2019t come in. I won\u2019t be able to hold back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll kill you before I let you bang my girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSame here. Besides, they can teleport.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cSeth, we\u2019re coming in. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth knew he lost the argument \u201cYou won\u2019t see me the same ever again though. I can\u2019t lose that respect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cI\u2019ve seen you with a universe sized cock in the middle of a heat. If can still call you friend after that, then either I\u2019m crazy, or you are too good a friend to lose. So we are going to come in and tell you what to do, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed \u201cOk\u2026 you win. But tell me what we are going to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYou are just going into your own universe to let loose ok? Absolutely every thing. Don\u2019t hold back. Ok? Then we can talk about your girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed \u201cOk. Come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stepped in, and then Nick. Amy and Gwen hid behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was starting to sweat. His cock was already a 30in rod of solid molten steel. It was amazing it didn\u2019t burn through his pants. He said slowly\u2026 \u201cOk\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 ready\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick side stepped away from each other, and Seth went mad with lust. The ropes holding him started to snap as he went beyond the norms of above average human strength. He barely had the will power to go into his own universe, but he did it some how. There was a blue flash, and he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen was so shocked by the display that she had to lean on Nick. Amy was equally surprised by Seth\u2019s aggressiveness and intensity. She fell back, but Ben quickly caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth popped back up again. He let out a sigh of relief and turned to face Amy and Gwen. He cock twitched a bit. But other than that, he was fine \u201cOk\u2026 now I\u2019m ready. What did we need to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cOk, so its well known that you wish to remain single around the school, so no girl has ever made an attempt at you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cOr ever will unless they talk to you. The girls that approach you before you say anything probably only want to play with your big toy and that\u2019s it.

Ben and I thought they were insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cBut we aren\u2019t. We learnt something from Ben\u2019s clone. They are capable of though and actions, but it misses an important ingredient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy reached into her bag and pulled out\u2026 \u201cThey need a spark of LIFE! Which the Vita can provide.

He tried to imagine a fusion of Gwen and Amy. What he got was an image of an bipolar girl who switches between aggressiveness to caring and back al over again. His face betrayed his fear, but yet he kind of wanted it. Something about that type of character turned him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed \u201cI know that face. He knows that he\u2019s about to nose dive right into trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen face palmed  \u201cBut he\u2019s going to do it anyway\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled at the two girls \u201cOk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------One Month Later--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was pacing up and down the hall of the plumber facility in Mt. Rushmore. He was anxious. His \u2018girlfriend\u2019 was almost done growing into a full blown goddess. Truly\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wouldn\u2019t let him lay eyes on her until she was finished. They had spells set up and every precaution to keep him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the doors opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed maniacly \u201cMWAHAHAHAHA WE DID IT! WE HAVE CREATED NEW LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang had fallen over and crawled away from Gwen out of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth burst into the room \u201cHow\u2019s she? Is she nice? Did anything break?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incubator chamber had opened, and mist/smoke filled the room. Suddenly, out of the gloom can an orange hair, HH cupped, 5ft 6in tall Amazon. She stepped out slowly as she tried to get used to walking. She knew how. Gwen and Amy partial memory told her how to. Slowly, she began to move her arms and head. Then she saw Seth \u201cHello! My name\u2019s Molly. I\u2019m so glad I finally get to meet you. They said I just had to wait a month, and a I did! You look just like their memories told me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt his limp snake spring into action. His steel rod tried to tent his pants, but they suppressed it and pushed it down his left leg. \u201cOh\u2026 my\u2026 god!\u201d He ran up and gave his new born girlfriend a hug, and she easily complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly, \u201cStrange. My memories tell me you are less aggressive than this. Maybe you aren\u2019t Seth.\u201d Then she took charge and slammed Nick to the ground. \u201cI can be aggressive too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang, who were just standing against the wall had turned away to give them some privacy. However, they laughed at Molly\u2019s comment and actions, and wondered how Seth must feel right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Comet announced to his home room \u201cHome room! I\u2019d like to introduce to you our new student, Molly. Seth here has taken responsibility of show her around. Lets give her a good start at our more prestige high school. Now Molly, would you like to introduce yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly giggled bowed showing her massive cleavage by accident. She was still knew to the do\u2019s and do not\u2019s of real life. \u201cI was raised in Hawaii, but my parent were mostly main state types of people, so we moved here. I\u2019m actually a distant relative to Gwen and Amy who I heard were in this room.\u201d She looked out for them, and spotted them. \u201cOh! There they are. But yeah, I\u2019m extra-super-mondo-excited about getting to know all of you.\u201d She bowed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery boy in the room developed a red race from seeing what she had to reveal except for Ben since he found himself growing more immune to the effects after having endured them while hanging around Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet smiled \u201cWell aren\u2019t we excited about tour first day. That\u2019s good! That\u2019s good. Now I\u2019d like you all to introduce ourselves to Molly here.\u201d Comet turned to Seth \u201cYou too Seth, just to get everyone in.\u201d Then he asked the class who wanted to start. Someone in the back stood up and welcomed her and describe himself hoping to win her over. About 6 more boys tried to flaunt their fairly above average builds at her (since they worked out with the 10 so much). However, no of them stood a chance when Nick stood up to say hello, again. He wasn\u2019t interested in her, but wanted her to feel welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cHello, I\u2019m Nick. I\u2019m into weightlifting and other things that deal with the body. I\u2019m currently taking anatomy and psychology. Anyhow, I hope you have a nice day, and\u201d He turned to Seth \u201cYou are very welcome to join us at our usual table at lunch.\u201d He looked at Gwen \u201cYour turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen stood up and smiled \u201cHey cous\u2019! I do a few activities outside school, but I mostly intern at the neurology facility down town. I hope to get to know more about you. You seem kind of fun.\u201d She looked at Amy \u201cYou want to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and stood up \u201cHey\u2026 umm\u2026 cous\u2019\u2026 I knew I had relatives over in Hawaii, bit I hadn\u2019t expected a distant one to be coming to my school. Super psyched to get to know you better. Though, I can see that the man next to you is even more eager.\u201d She looked at Seth who was shaking with joy from being with his own actual girlfriend\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood up last of all, but was stopped by Molly. Back as the incubator, she hadn\u2019t seen Ben, so this was a first for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly \u201cWow! How tall are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shocked by the outburst but smiled welcomingly \u201c8ft 7in last time I checked. But yah\u2026 umm\u2026 hi. Also, keep an eye on Seth will you? He\u2019s kind of jumpy right now. As a friend, I hope he can control himself. Would keep him in check.\u201d He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly let out a contagious laugh. Everyone felt happier. \u201cOf course! When I met him this morning, he walked into me and showed my how to get her, but before that\u2026 well, don\u2019t think he wants me to say.\u201d Seth was sweating buckets of fear, but that soon stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cAlright then! Intros are done. The bells about to ring. Get ready for class. And Ben, stay behind. You have me first block anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and just sat where he was\u2026 in the back row\u2026 because he was too tall\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Together, it created the occasional mood swing depending on how Molly was feeling at the time. She also got dense skin and bone from Amy (though no one has yet to realize it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her body was modified during her cloning process. She was made to be able to handle anything Seth threw at her. Even a now stabilized 23 in cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer wasn\u2019t that much more interesting. They discovered that the Molly receives a partial effect from the White and Purple orbs since she is both Amy and Gwen combined. And they discovered, after a brief expedition in space that Molly was even capable of molding mana! Nick was about to get hit by and asteroid and Molly blasted it to bits instinctively. She leant quickly what murals were and what to do in certain situations. She was becoming more of an individual now and less of a clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, Seth and Molly were being rather naughty. Also partially due to the blue orb influencing them slightly. Any how, about 3 gallons of Seth\u2019s baby batter filled Molly that night, and she somehow handled it all. Luckily her body wasn\u2019t currently in the cycle at the time, so they will not have to worry about premature children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime during that, instead of Seth being in charge, Molly force Seth do be the obedient one, and he complied with out question\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny \u201cThey did it didn\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYou can smell the Seth coming off of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cThe Seth Lord will rise again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled \u201cNice one. And besides he can\u2019t be blamed. The orb probably pushed Seth and Molly over the edge last night. The didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey groaned. \u201cLets forget it happened and ignore it. Its not out business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, Seth, Gwen, and Amy had started to see a liquid develop in their universe. For Amy, instead of the liquid simply dripping out of her necklace, it appeared inside as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cBen, How did you deal with this again? I found myself growing out of my bed last night because so much of it was forming and leaking out. The seal on my watch isn\u2019t very strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about  \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want to end up with a paradox because it could potentially destroy the universe. But if we do, then we can just make another nexus. It shouldn\u2019t be to hard for any of you. What you guys need, so that you don\u2019t pass out of fall into you subconscious is to send in a clone of yourself. Like mine. He\u2019s having and endless amount of good time inside here\u201d He pointed to his medallion. \u201cAlso, we can\u2019t risk an over flow or anything because I have already connected every unclaimed universe that isn\u2019t made of gravitum. So we have to take precautions.\u201d He looked at Nick \u201cYou can go to Gravitron and take of your necklace. The Nexus will start to form in your hand.\u201d He looked at Seth \u201cYou\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly chimed in \u201cI could use a spell to get the Gravitum bits in his blood to turn into a wristband or something. That way he could to what Nick did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYou do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly and Seth left to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy and Gwen \u201cYou two will have to magically enhance your gravity to infinity for a while until your arms start getting denser. We\u2019ll need to seen in a clone to feed the orb a substance to make it denser. The planets and stars won\u2019t start going into the orb unless that happens first. Then, when its gravity grows to infinity, we can put the Nexus on your orb to stabilize it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cTo the incubator!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne month later, Ben had by now grown several inches. At a rate of about 3 inches a month. He\u2019ll make it to 12 ft by exactly come time for graduation. It was august now and he was exactly 9ft tall. 36in to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4 active incubators contained each and every one of his friends. They had to move Seth and Nick into a larger incubator since they were growing so large. Like Ben, they aged and developed like they would have grown to a certain size naturally. No sudden explosions in growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, the red light turned green telling them that the clones had matched their age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 they placed them inside their universe\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick Jr. and Seth Jr. were like Ben. They lived in a world of pleasure pulled torture. However, Nick Jr. didn\u2019t short semen. He shot concentrated testosterone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy Jr. and Gwen Jr. were did something half expected. Their orbs were guzzling billions of gallons of milk ever second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few weeks of stimulation, the got the orbs density to increase fast enough so its gravity grew to infinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had them each go to Gravitron and produce their own Nexus. Which they all did. However, theirs, when they formed were colors that matched their orbs. It seems like Ben\u2019s orb had told the other orbs to change the structure of the string a bit to better stabilize the orbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had finished making their orbs.

The battle had created a lot of it, and much was still not purified by Amy\u2019s white magic. All together a giant black star that emitted pure darkness was born. The souls of the sacrificed DA\u2019s ad not been purified and wanted to strike vengeance up those cursed teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey star was born next to a perfect sphere of the darkest obsidian over formed. The twins were unable to see it before for it\u2019s dark nature repelled the eyes of everything and it went unnoticed since the creation of this copy universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ship floated by. It was in shambles and disrepair. It had one passenger, and it was its commander. The commander had felt the star\u2019s calling when it was formed, and The commander could not ignore it. Slowly, the poor ship reached its destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obsidian planet had a tiny moon. The size of a baseball, and it was thrown at the ship. It traveled through the walls and into the commander\u2019s tactically hands. Its dark power slowly consuming his mind and pushing him further into madness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was jumping and was on Ben\u2019s back. He was giving her a piggy back ride. \u201cAh! My god! Ben! First day as a senior! Are you excited?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cI\u2019ll drop you if you ask me again. My answer is the same as before. Yes! We get senior privileges, so what\u2019s not to like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick patted Ben on the arm \u201cGo easy on her. She\u2019s just excited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen frowned \u201cNo excuse. We are the examples, so we have to be composed. Now Amy! Get off his back and be a good example for the freshmen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cYes mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth and Molly burst into laughter \u201cGood one Amy. Last one to homeroom is a rotten egg.\u201d and they sprinted toward the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, they left leaving Gwen standing there trying to act mature. \u201cHey! Wait for me! No fair\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComet \u201cWelcome Seniors I hope you guys are ready. Its gone in a single moment. Looks like every one is here. Guess what? This entire class of seniors was volunteered by the school to help get freshmen and sophomores to feel more at home here at this high school. Ben and Gwen, they want you guys to act as tour guides. You can work together if you want. Nick and Seth, you\u2019ll be running the gym and teaching them how to work out, etc, and give them advice. Gwen, you\u2019re in charge of keeping this class room of students organized and on task, but don\u2019t be to bossy. If they joke off a bit, make sure its to get the new kids comfortable with the school. Finally, Molly, you\u2019ll be heading the cheer squad around the school to help boost school spirit\u2026\u201d Comet murmured on other jobs and positions after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, \u201cTour guide\u2026 must be because I\u2019m so tall. The freshmen can\u2019t possible get lost if they look for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cAnd the boys won\u2019t be able to keep their eyes off of Amy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushed and then slapped him. \u201cSorry Gwen. I really had to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cI\u2019ll let it go this time. Just ask next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was looking at them \u201cWhat am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day of school, and Ben forgot that he was 9ft 3in. The ceiling was 10ft. And the doorway was 8ft 6in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Slam/Crash*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen groaned \u201cYah\u2026 I\u2019m fine. I forgot that I grew some more over the summer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freshmen that were following them were murmuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cGuys\u2026 listen.\u201d They faced him \u201cThere is tall\u2026and then there\u2019s too tall. You guys can put me in either category.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freshmen laughed a bit and they continued the tour. It was almost comical. Basically Ben\u2019s entire torso loomed over the relatively short freshmen heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome yelled \u201cBen! The door way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was walking backwards and turned around to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Slam/Crash*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freshmen were snickering again. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind taking a couple inches off your height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind giving you some of it either!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cNow everyone we\u2019re about to pass the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cThere you go. Good form. Keep up the pace. Perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cNext!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fitness jock type of freshmen lined up waiting to get their turn getting advice from the two largest kids in school, muscle wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls over at the yoga and aerobics sections gasped as one of them pointed out the pipe that showed through Seth\u2019s pants. \u201cThat thing\u2019s huge! How on earth\u2026 That un-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen strolled around school with a clip board trying to make sure people were ding their jobs. They did for the most part. Though, she caught a couple of girls trying to flirt with Nick. He was trying to lose them as best as he could, but they were like wolves. The surrounded him and cornered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen tapped one of the shoulders \u201cExcuse me. Need I remind you of the school sexual harassment policy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls froze and left. One of them did a \u201ccall me\u201d sign and ran off with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed \u201cThanks Gwen. I didn\u2019t know they could be like that. I though a simple leave me a lone. I\u2019m taken would have worked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cAs long as you know that.\u201d Then she switched moods \u201cNow back to your station!\u201d Then she switched moods again. \u201cSee ya at lunch! Bye.\u201d Gwen walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick stood their scratching his head trying to decipher the most complicated code in the world\u2026 the inter workings of the female mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, Ben bought 2 large boxes of mushroom pizza, and a small vegetarian pizza for Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the Freshmen came over saying hi, and Ben asked them to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshman 1 \u201cHey. Who else did you invite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshman 2 \u201cWell, you have two boxes of pizza\u2026 we though you were going to share with some other seniors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scoffed and chocked on her small pizza \u201cThat\u2019s funny guys. Ben here had another growth spurt, and preparing for another one. He needs to eat a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshman 1 was shocked \u201cWait. He\u2019s still growing?!!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cYah\u2026 I am. My chart hasn\u2019t show my growth leveling off yet. Its still sloping upwards, so I\u2019m not done yet. Though, it appears my might be done at the end of this year. Maybe\u2026\u201d Hopefully, the orb would stop growing him, but the average boys continues a super slow rate up until they are around 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freshmen stared at Ben trying to imagine him as an even greater looming giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two muscle heads, a cheerleader, and a composed looking lady come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cGetting to know the freshmen. Not bad. I have myself a small group of followers waiting in the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen  sighed \u201cMuscle heads\u2026\u201d she cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWell, at least they\u2019re all boys. I have a fan base now! I saw a sign with \u201cI <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Seth written over it a dozen times!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly laughed \u201cI don\u2019t mind sharing. As long as you come back to me that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth frowned \u201cI kind of need you to back me up on this. Ok? Please\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly smiled \u201cFine\u2026 I\u2019ll help get those girls off your back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was to busy eating two large pizzas to really participate in the conversation, and Amy just wanted to listen and site next to her giant guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all sat at their table out in the field in the middle of their school laughing and eating when a giant shadow passed over the whole school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group chatted. Ben was eating and Amy was sitting there thinking about the future a bit. Then a came across her mind that she really would be a child to Ben. With 10 months of school left, Ben would reach 12 ft by graduation if the trend continued. If that happened, then in about two months, Ben\u2019s head would be touching the 10 ft ceiling. Ben\u2019 probably already thought about it. She\u2019d barely reach his waist in standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her hearthstone began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freshman \u201cAmy! That\u2019s so cool. What\u2019s your necklace doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked up and Ben he met her eye and nodded. Ben immediately unsealed himself and got ready. Just in time as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove them, a dark ship, shrouded in dark clouds and black lightning loomed ominously. The lighting began to gather in one spot and then suddenly, it fired downward towards the middle field of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen vanished from sight and caught the lighting bold by concentrating mana into his hands. That\u2019s one of the tricks he learnt after the fight with the Anodites. He couldn\u2019t mold mana in spells or anything, but he could concentrate it in certain areas. Such as his hands. This kind of creates a shield from mana in simplicity. His mana repels the other mana and contains it. He practiced with Amy a few times until he had a good handle with it. (They even played catch with a ball of mana a few times during the summer).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bold of black lighting sparked and crackled in Ben\u2019s hand. It tried to push him down and smash into the ground. If it did that, it would create a large enough explosion to do some serious damage. Ben was having a little trouble holding it away from him. He could feel the malice in the bolt, and its sense of destruction. Ben looked over at Amy for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw this and fired bolts of white mana at the lighting bolt. They collided and the lightning bolt weakened enough for Ben to throw it back at the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood up sweating not from exertion, but from fear. He remembered this black aura from when they were almost killed by the black star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student as and other staff had just seen what happened. Some of them were video taping it. They whispered \u201cDid Ben just\u2026 How on earth\u2026 Was that lightning bolt black\u2026 what just happened\u2026 is Ben human\u2026. Did Amy just shoot white light?\u201d There were hundreds of questions coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around \u201cGuys\u2026 don\u2019t put that on the internet please. I have a hard time not getting noticed already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student body felt the plea in his voice and obliged. He\u2019s respected them for a long enough time, so its time they return the favor. They deleted the images and video. Though, they\u2019ll always remember it in their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cThanks guys.\u201d He looked over at the table he sat at. His friends were staring at the sky. The dark cloud had left along with the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang had gotten up and unsealed themselves just for precautionary purposes. Nick had a silver gravitum ring with a tine blue stone as the centerpiece. He just had to twist the ring in his hand and it would release him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cThat couldn\u2019t have been\u2026 could it?\u201d He said as he carried Gwen who was casting spells of defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was carrying Amy who was building up a magic purifier around the school to neutralize and dark magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was carrying Molly who helped where she could. She was still relatively new to mana, so all she could muster where the basic calming charms to prevent mass panic. They worked pretty well at convincing the students to delete the pictures of Ben\u2019s heroic act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWe\u2019ll have to assume that it is here, and we have to begin to fortify earth. I\u2019d hate to have to construct a whole planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth laughed \u201cFixing up OOPS wasn\u2019t so hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cYah, but OOPS didn\u2019t have a molten core.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cOh\u2026 good point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith in an hour, the gang had concentrated all their mana around earth creating an area of highly dense mana. People found themselves less tired, and plants were growing like crazy in the mana rich environment. However, it did throw off an experiment or two that were worth a few billion dollars. Nothing big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cIs it safe to have this much mana in one place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cIt should be. All mana is, is life and energy combined into very reactive particles. They change and mold readily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIf anything, it should be beneficial for anything that\u2019s alive. They find that they heal faster, have more stamina, think clearer, etc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo we should do it more often. Earth has gotten pretty lazy lately. With the obesity problem and such.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWe could potentially end up doing just that if we stopped using dangerous type of spells.. However, if anyone of us does a spell, we\u2019ll need to have increasable control because the pressure of the mana is great it will try to escape through any exit. So a small flame could become a raging inferno, and a small light could light this half of the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cSo maybe we should just let it spread back through out the universe again to prevent that from happening, but keep a large chunk here lay dormant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Amy \u201cYou know? That\u2019s now a bad idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo what now? We\u2019ve gather every particle of mana we have onto earth. If any anodites decide to flash over here, they\u2019ll get knocked out as the mana tries to escape through them. I assume. All our mana is tied up into defensive spells and a few powerful offensive spells. If that things returns, it might just end up getting obliterated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBut its going to do everything it can to not get that result. Who knows what it will plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away, the cloud felt stupid. It should have waited and come up with a better plan. First off, it has done everything the kids have done. So its orb is at peak performance. It even created a Dark Nexus. That\u2019s the only reason Ben had difficulty stopping the bolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now it was going to get stronger, so Ben couldn\u2019t do it again. It was paying a visit to the planet of the Anodites\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could possible go wrong now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked like he weighs less, but his build keeps it all tight and compact. When you see his strength, you\u2019ll believe his weight. (spell keeps things from breaking under his weight.)<br>\r\nDescription: Ben looms over absolutely everyone. He is the tallest kid in his school\u2026 the tallest person in the world now actually. News reports try to get an interview, but he vanished mysteriously somehow. How do you lose someone like him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4ft1in taller than Amy thus giving him a perfect view of her perfect globes. Generally this awakens his near 19in python. Its grown ahead of his body to match its future size, but its not quite done yet. Oh\u2026 and Seth was the big one. Wait till the orb\u2019s done with Ben. His muscles bulge of his body and every move he makes looks like he\u2019s flexing. His muscles ripple underneath his padded skin. His skin has gotten a little thicker at Ben\u2019s request so that when he held Amy, or when he leaned on him, his hard muscles didn\u2019t make her sore. However, they did nothing to diminished the look of strength and power in his muscles. He simply oozed respect and an aura of command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Quick note: Despite the fact that the Red and Blue orbs are main for growing muscle and a certain organ, Ben will forever be ahead of the game even though his growth is meant to be a fusion of both the Red and Blue. He\u2018s had the Green orb for so long that it does not matter. Therefore, his maximum is forever the strongest and largest.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy - Senior<br>\r\nStatus: In a relationship with Ben<br>\r\nAge: 18 years old (a month older than Ben actually)<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft 5in<br>\r\nWeight: 125lbs<br>\r\nDescription: A good 25 of those pounds are on her KK cup chest. She still has her mom\u2019s long black hair and a type of grace. He skin was the tanned color of a person who was from the Philippines. She had hazel colored eyes and loved life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick - Senior<br>\r\nStatus: In a relationship with Gwen<br>\r\nAge: 18 years old<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 7in since the orb grew him a smidge to fit more muscle<br>\r\nWeight: 400lbs (a spell keeps things from breaking under his weight.)<br>\r\nDescription: Muscle muscle muscle! That what he really is now. He could bench press nearly 1000lbs for ten reps. Ever since the Anodites, he\u2019d been growing nonstop. Even when he stopped working out for a month, he still grew. Now at about 100lbs heavier than before and 3in taller, he would dwarf even the king of body builders. He walked with a slight waddle, but he could still run if the need came. Gwen could sit on his shoulders with little fear of falling of since they were so broad. Though, his skin was to thing, and it hurt Gwen to sit for to long. She spoke to him about it and he considered asking the orb for thicker skin like Ben\u2019s. Though, recently he\u2019s been having strange dreams of them being in bed and him banding her. Though, sometimes she takes control of the situation and plays with his 16in glory rod. Sadly, its just a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen - Senior<br>\r\nStatus: In a relationship with Nick<br>\r\nAge: 18 years old<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft 6in<br>\r\nWeight: 125lbs<br>\r\nDescription: Actually, Gwen\u2019s weight is from slightly higher muscle density. Not much denser, but still dense. They keep her on balance countering the weight of her EE cup breasts. She\u2019s memorized a few dozen spell books and has given them to Amy, who gives them to Molly. Gwen is looking to secret combine mana and the mind to help heal concussions and improve memory permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth - Senior<br>\r\nStatus: In a relationship with Molly<br>\r\nAge: 18 years old<br>\r\nHeight: 6ft 9in<br>\r\nWeight: 350lbs of slightly less dense muscle. (When sealed.)<br>\r\nDescription: He\u2019s like Nick when it comes to size. He has a slight waddle to his walk, but as he walks there\u2019s a mass in his groin that swings with his waddle. It was composed of a 23in tube with softball balls. He could spew buckets and recover with in the hour ready for more, mainly because of the orb\u2019s meddling. Seth and Molly\u2019s relationship is still going strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly - Senior<br>\r\nStatus: In a relationship with Seth<br>\r\nTime Age: Almost 1 year.<br>\r\nPhysical Age: 18 years old<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft 6 inches<br>\r\nWeight: 120lbs<br>\r\nDescription: The 20lbs above a hundred are devoted just for her HH cup chest. She has little muscle mass, but don\u2019t let it fool you. Her body is strengthened by mana, so she could punch a tree to splinters.

There bodies consumed by black magic and turned into even darker magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp, at the highest tower, their ruler sat watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nServant \u201cSire, we must evacuate. We have lost this one, but we can make a new one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Rex Imperius nodded slowly. \u201cIs the chamber ready. Is my son on it yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nServant nodded \u201cNo sire. We are retrieving him now. We must make haste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex stood his ground \u201cNo. I will wait for my son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another servant came \u201cSire! Your son. He\u2019s being approached by that thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex exploded with mana. The royal family has always had an exceptional amount of it, but Rex was different. He had the largest amount in centuries. No other pure anodite matched him. Except his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew older, his power only grew with him. Now at the age of 18 (Anodite years, but for all intensive purposes, he looks like any other 18 year old), his power surrounds the entire planet. If only he could tap into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis son, when born was encased in golden mana. The first of its kind. That monster must seek its power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex blasted the roof off his observatory and saw the strange dark cloud in more detail than before. It was large, massive actually. It had sent down millions of black bolts transforming his people into dark mana. He would stand it no longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, a thickly built teen lay sleeping under Anodites famous albino tree. He rest peacefully indifferent of anyone else\u2019s affair. He spent his days working the living lights out of himself to gain strength to make up for his weakness. He was told he had the greatest power of any anodite, but he has yet to see any of it. But somehow, his physical strength increases easily with little work. So his mana must be strong. (The males grow larger muscle to match their original mana levels, and the females gain assets to match the original mana lever. i.e. Mana level with out the aid of any magical items. )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder shook the earth, and he began to wake up. What he saw was the greatest and more fearsome thing ever to behold. His father was fighting like never before, and it was against this\u2026 this thing. This teen yearned to join the fray, but he was with out mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex was shooting hailstorms and tsunamis at the strange dark cloud. He created gaping holes that would have killed anything else, but they healed them selves immediately. The monster began to lose interest in him, and decided to go for a much larger meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned in the direction of the teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex Domino (King of the Masters) was the boys birth name, but he is called Rick since that\u2019s how he pronounced his name as a child. He watched as that dark cloud closed in on him, ad he could do nothing about it. He ran\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Rex would not allow it. He flew with the speed of a thousand anodites and breezed past the cloud. \u201cYou will halt. Continue no further. You shall not claim my son!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud paused and thunder reigned down like laughter. Suddenly, the cloud morphed into the image of a Vilgax. \u201cPuny Anodite. You do not interest me. Move and you will live that much longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex stood his ground \u201cBegone I say. I will not be swayed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud laughed \u201cVery well. You have been warned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex pulled all his mana together and released it in one gushing wave of power. The cloud was halted for a moment, but then it proceeded. Slowly, it surrounded Kind Rex and shrouded him in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick saw what was happening. The king of the anodites was beaten? His father was gone? He screamed \u201cFather!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the a torrent of purple light exploded out of the cloud. It seemed like hope had returned, but then slowly, the purple began to fade and its color turned to black. All that remained was a single beam of pure royal purple. It separated from the cloud before it was to late and charged at Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt surrounded him, and he was gone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy were spending the afternoon in the woods. They were going to have a picnic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was snoring on a lounge chair. His arms and legs resting on the ground since the chair was not large enough for Ben\u2019s height. Amy was sitting by a small stream/creak. It was strange. Like the cloud had never been there. Life seemed to move on. She looked in the water and saw something strange in the reflection of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a purple dot in the sky smashing into all of their defenses. The sky rippled with mana as their powerful shield repelled the intruder. Then suddenly, the purple dot flared gold for a microsecond and then back to purple. It began its rapid decent to earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Something is heading to earth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, with out much think, turn onto autopilot. He unsealed himself and picked Amy up. She told him where to go. She looked for traces of mana and followed a straight line to a near by pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Splash\u2026 sizzle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben and Amy arrived, they saw the pond covered in cool steam a glowing entity floating in the middle. What they saw a thickly build 18 year old wearing golden robes and a small crown and amethyst encrusted armband. He was floating and glowing gold, but he appeared to be asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stepped forward to see who or what he was, but Amy stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cHe\u2019s an anodite\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen assumed she meant dark anodite and was about to assault the teen, but Amy held his arm still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cAs in an anodite from this universe. Not the prison one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh. How can you tell? isn\u2019t he supposed to have purple mana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIt\u2019s the signature on the mana he is releasing. It matches that of an anodite, but is unusually strong. Everyone\u2019s signature is different, but a family may have a similar Base signature. Like you have a similar base signature to you parent. However, the strength is just hugely different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cSo he is an anodite. Why is he here and why is he unconscious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI don\u2019t know. Wait look! He\u2019s waking up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rick\u2019s eyes open and the golden glow around his body vanished. \u201cWo-ooe-oo\u201d He yelled as he began falling back. Suddenly, he found himself standing on soil. He closed his eyes and tried sensing for the mana of anything nearby. His mind was rammed with so much mana he had to grab onto a nearby tree to stop himself from falling. \u201cWhat the! How can anyone have mana that strong?\u201d He opened his eyes and looked with normal vision. He saw a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick recoiled at the sight of Ben \u201cBy the love of Andonia! Why are you so\u2026 huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed. First impression has not started off well. Then he raised his hand and did the star trek thing with his hands. Suddenly, the Anodite broke into a smile. Did this sign actually work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick stood up \u201cOk. Now I know where I am. Earth! Only they can come up with shows like that.\u201d Then he composed himself. \u201cPlease pardon me for my rudeness, but my home planet was just attacked by a strange cloud. I know it sounds weird, but I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWe believe you. It attacked us too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was astounded \u201cWhat! How did you beat\u2026 wait. Did you say we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stepped out from behind Ben \u201cYes\u2026 we.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Rick had to grab onto a tree again. He\u2019s see some big girls as prince of his people, but never before has he laid eyes on someone like Amy. \u201cYour mana must be huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked stunned \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick paused \u201cOh\u2026 sorry again. Considering this is earth, and not mana people use mana, I can understand that you are confussss----\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy snapped her fingers and a blinding ball of light appeared (It covered the their half of the galaxy).</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rick stumbled back. She was a power house of mana. \u201cS-ss-sor-sorry miss, but I guess I have assumed wrong. What I meant earlier was that on my planet. If you have a large mana, you have large physical attributes. They are a symbol of power. For a male, you grow stronger physically, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be bigger. It could be strength. For the female, it is generally in their milk production, but that generally implies larger boobs. Sorry if I have offended you, but this is common language on my planet. They are rarely covered since they are a symbol of our strength and pride. It seems that you partially practice that custom here on earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy looked at each other and saw why he would say that. Ben was wearing his usually T-shirt and cargo shorts, but they hugged his body so that you could see most, if not all his muscles, and they hinted at the size of his penis. Amy on the other hand simply couldn\u2019t get the cloths Ben gave her to morph and cover all her assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled \u201cNo, some of us do. Today, you caught us at a bad time. Amy here is unable to find cloths to cover her fully, and no cloths are large enough for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick \u201cOh\u2026 so you two are larger than average on this planet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cA lot actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick then slammed his forehead with his hand \u201cI for got my manners. My name is Rex Primus, but my people call me Rick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cBen\u201d He raised he hand to shake hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked at it and thought, what a peculiar custom. Wait\u2026 \u201cOh. Right Earth custom I didn\u2019t know what you were doing. Good thing I saw this on Nick as Night\u201d He returned the hand shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy \u201cSee? TV does help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cWell, I\u2019m Amy.\u201d And she did a tiny curtsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick bowed in return \u201cThank you for you kindness so far, but I really must find a way back home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIts gone by now\u2026 probably. That is unless you had any Immortal Anodites living there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked quizzical \u201cWhat? No. My people need my help. I must save them.\u201d He smiled, but felt less confident than he appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Ben \u201cShould we help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWe\u2019re going to face it eventually. Might as well do it away from earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Rick, and saw that he was trying to jump off the face of the earth, and failed miserably. \u201cAre you alright? Why aren\u2019t you teleporting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick frowned. He was frustrated the he could not get home \u201cOh? And you can? Only the most elite spell casters can teleport.\u201d Suddenly Amy disappeared in a flash and appeared next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cLike this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick swallowed his words. He croaked \u201cLike that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stormed back to Ben \u201cLets go. Looks like he doesn\u2019t need out help.\u201d Ben and Amy were laughing together mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought \u201cYou are so mean! Forcing him into a corner like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cWell he deserved it. Talking to me like I\u2019m lower than him. I demand equality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cHe should be ready in 3...2...1...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick \u201cWait! Come back. Please. I don\u2018t have any control over my mana.\u201d He looked down in shame and embarrassment. When he looked up, he came face to face with Amy smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI\u2019ll get the others. You two chat for a bit.\u201d Ben turned and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSo what\u2019s this about no control over your mana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick \u201cThey say I was born covered in gold mana, and that it was the strongest thing they ever saw. But I can\u2019t even use it. I have no control over it. Though, I know there\u2019s a lot of it. I gain muscle without much effort, so that proves that its real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked quizzical \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t use it? When Ben and I first saw you, you were floating in the middle of the lake, and glowing gold. It disappeared when you woke up though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked shocked \u201cI was? How did it feel? Was it like they said?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded \u201cIt was pretty strong. Especially for an anodite. Though, did you see Ben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick nodded. \u201cWait\u2026 I tried to sense for the mana of others, but there was this one mana that shrouded everything. It was super dense and made it flooded my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded \u201cMost of that is Ben. There are some others like me, Gwen, Seth, and Nick. We pulled our mana fields together and forced it to cover earth. Right now, the earth is covered in a shroud of the densest mana ever made. Though, most of it is still Ben.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick gasped \u201cYou guys had that ability? Is it difficult to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cNot really. You just have to imagine your mana field coming together in the shape you want it to be. Ben has decent control, but he can\u2019t mold mana into spells. He can, however, encase his hand in dense mana and catch a spell or block things mana related. He gave me this hearthstone and it lets me use spells like an Anodite.\u201d She lifted her white hearthstone our of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked at the stone \u201cIts so pure. I have never felt such a strong healing affinity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushed \u201cYah. When Ben made it, he had only on intension. It was to protect me, so that\u2019s what it does. It wants to protect my life, and I want to protect all life, so the stone does that for me. It creates its own mana and I can channel its mana. Plus, if it runs low on mana, it can tap into Ben\u2019s massive reserves and use that instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick gasped \u201cThen it has to be one of the most powerful mana relics in the universe. And you say he made it himself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cTrust me. If he were to release his true strength, he could tear the universe apart with a snap of his fingers. However, he always has himself on a leash. Occasionally, when something bad comes out way, he unlocks a smidge of his strength to take what ever it is down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was open eyed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYup, and I\u2019m proud to be his girlfriend. Not because he\u2019s strong, but because I love his personality. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m telling you this, but I feel that you don\u2019t mean any harm, and neither does my stone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked at the stone with amazement \u201cHow did he make it? I heard that hearthstones are beyond rare and that there were only around 5 inexistence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cThis one stone has nearly a Billion billion hearthstones combined together. Each hearthstone merged together and focus in one spell type which was defense. Defense of the body, soul, and life. It protects basically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was still shocked. How did one fuse hearthstones? \u201cI think I need one\u2026 I can\u2019t even touch my mana field, but I can touch others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWrong! You can touch yours. You just need to find out how. Up there, in the sky, are hundreds of defensive spells. Each tuned into our mana. You got through it somehow. For a brief second, you exploded in golden mana, and you got through our shields. Its just hidden very deeply.\u201d She raised her hand and placed it on his left pectoral, but she was trying to get him to think of his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cAh-hem. Done yet?\u201d Ben saw Amy touching Rick\u2019s pec, and he was kind of flustered. it\u2019s a good thing he heard her last few statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paniced \u201cBen, wait! Its not like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned around \u201cLike what? You trying to help him find his strengths. Amy\u2026 I trust you ok? Do what you need to do.\u201d Ben smiled \u201cEveryone is around the bend on the path. Come when you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled and gave Ben a big hug \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cWhat for? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled anyway \u201cWell thanks any way. I\u2019ll get be there soon.\u201d She waved Ben off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked back over the Rick \u201cYou understand this if you try to hit on me that I\u2019m going to have kill you right? That\u2019d be merciful. If Ben though you had other intentions, you\u2019d wish you\u2019d never been born. He\u2019s very protective of me which is what give the stone its power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick paled a bit at her words \u201cUnderstood Ms. Amy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cNo Miss please. Just Amy. Now lets go. We might just be able to save your planet and its people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick scoffed \u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled evilly \u201cI can revive the dead if they aren\u2019t gone to long. Now lets go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked at Amy like she was a spirit. Oh my god! I\u2019m in the presence of a Goddess! What were her friends like? Other gods and goddesses. What is Ben? What have I gotten myself into!?!?!?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How are you liking earth so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick paused \u201cIts people are very\u2026 interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick chuckled \u201cYou know what? That definition works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen walked up to Rick and looked him in the face. She had to tilt her head because he was 7ft tall. He also had a tight build similar to Bens. Strange. \u201cYour magic is perfectly fine if you  want to know. Your mind is just out of sync with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was curious \u201cHow do you know this? I have never heard of this before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI used a spell to test for the vibrations in your mind, body and mana. You body and mana are in sync, but your mind if not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI did a few tests. Everything living, and some dead things have mana. That is well known. However, the ones who can control it match the mana. The mana of anodites are generally very broad, so its easy for their mind, body and mana to match up. They have a large area of error. Others have it harder. They need to be more closely tuned into their mana in order use it. Even Ben could use it if his mind matched his mana. He\u2019s gotten closer, but no where near close enough. However, he\u2019s able to control the density of his mana field, and that should be enough for him. I don\u2019t think he wants that much power. It could corrupt him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick \u201cSo how do I change my mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cWhen I say mind, I mean personality. Your golden mana must demand more from you. Some crucial requirement they you have not met, so they can not vibrate in sync.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick scoffed \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with my personality. Everyone calls me perfect. Except at spell casting. I can do everything else like build a house, but spells are just out of my reach. Other than that, I\u2019m perfect, so I let myself relax under the albino tree most of my day since I can do most anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen scoffed now \u201cNope. Not yet. What you need is something that is difficult to learn. You are to cocky and apparently lazy. Maybe once you fix those, you can use this hidden power we\u2019ve hear do much about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick laughed \u201cI and the most humble man in the world. I know not of what you speak of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked up, and Rick paused his rant. \u201cOnly the least humble person says they are the most humble. Rick\u2026 Gwen is right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked at Amy\u2019s eyes for any sign of deceit, but all he found was the naked truth. He slapped her face away. \u201cNo. I cannot acce-\u201d Rick flew through the air and landed 10yds away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched as Ben walked up to Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed \u201cNow he\u2019s done it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cTen bucks says that he learns humility from this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looked at Seth \u201cHe\u2019s to cocky. You\u2019re on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled \u201cI hope you have those ten bucks to give to me when this is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed and then sighed \u201cI hope so too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s face grew serious. Gwen was hoping to lose the bet. She want the guy to learn humility. They focus on Ben again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWho do you think you are? Slapping my Amy like that! Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Amy thought \u201cMY Amy?\u201d Then she blushed. He was just in a protective mood.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked at Ben, and he rubbed his cheek. He could feel the swelling fade away. He\u2019s always been a super faster healer. Like really fast. \u201cWho do you think you are punching the prince of all Anodites in the face!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI think I\u2019m a guy who can beat your sorry little *** back to your home planet for you. You won\u2019t need any mana to get there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was fuming. He knew Ben was powerful, but was he crazy enough to potential face the wrath of all Anodites? He got up in time for Ben to land another punch, and another. Rick\u2019s think muscles blocked most of the damage, but it still hurt like crazy. \u201cOhf\u2026 Are you crazy? You could face the wrath of every Anodite in the universe! They\u2019d turn you into dust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned \u201cI doubt it. They\u2019re nothing by the decaying powers of the Original Anodites. Worthless scum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick, Oh now\u2019s he\u2019s done it. \u201cDo you challenge the power of Anodite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scoffed \u201cPossibly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick spat at Ben and started to ran to punch. As soon as he was bout to make contact, Ben vanished and punched him from the side. Rick flew another 10ft to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen began to repeated beat Rick into submission. \u201cAdmit it. You are weak, and you know. Say it so everyone can hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was unable to move. All he could do was survive each punch. How can someone be this strong? I didn\u2019t believe Amy when she told me This guy made the hearthstone, or he could rip the universe apart if he wanted to. How did he get this power? Could he possible help me? Suddenly, the punches stopped. Rick was pounded badly. Even his fast healing was taking a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen loomed over Rick\u2019s limp body \u201cAdmit it\u2026 you are weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looked at the giant before him. He felt all the power of the universe in has gave, and it was all directed at him in spite and hate. \u201cFine. I\u2019m weak.\u201d he mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen asked \u201cWhat did you say? Let us all hear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick \u201cI\u2019m weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat?\u201d He bent over to hears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick yelled \u201cFor the love of Andonia! I am WEAK! W - E - A - K! Are you happy?\u201d He lay there. A steady steam of tears rolled down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cNope, but that can wait for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy yelled \u201cYou learnt humility! How do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick heard her words. Humility\u2026 I am weak, but I can get strong. No\u2026 I WILL get strong. If it was for anything. It would be to show Ben humility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick \u201cBen. I won\u2019t thank you. Partly because I can\u2019t feel my face, and two. I consider you a rival now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cNext time we fight, I\u2019ll beat you until you say sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick coughed \u201cNo\u2026 Next tim-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the skies  were darkened. The cloud was already here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Look out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked up and saw bolts of black lighting reign down towards him. He pulled his mana together to catch it, but as soon as they came near his hand, they split apart and surrounded him. He could feel the mana pulling him into another universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the gang was out of hearing range, and there was only Rick next to him. \u201cRick. Protect Amy. Understand? If you don\u2019t then I\u2019ll hunt you. You got that. But if she\u2019s safe I\u2019l-\u201d He was cut of as he suddenly vanished into another universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the clouds were gone. That one spell took nearly all of its mana. Ben was a hard person to contain. Luckily, that old king had quite a large reserve. For now, it would leave to let its mana replenish itself, and it would let its commander have a world with their captive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started to float away when suddenly a beam or white mana cut through the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d And she fired wave upon wave of mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe there was a scream inside the cloud and they cloud sped off away from earth. Now it really needed to heal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Its more of an elephant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and the rest looked. \u201cAre you sure? I see a giant raspberry smoothie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIt\u2019s a brain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this continued for the rest of lunch, with occasional breaks as  Ben scarfed down another slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Gwen felt something ominous appear. Gwen\u2019s mana field covered the universe. She was aware of an huge changes. The only reason the others didn\u2019t feel it was because they were having to much fun. Last year, Ben was doing a lot better in Astronomy because his mana field detected every star in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cExcuse use seniors. I forgot to tell them something important.\u201d Gwen dragged the gang away leaving the two freshmen with a quarter of a box of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cGwen! I was almost done with the box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth snickered \u201cWatch it Ben. That 8 pack of yours might tern into a 1 pack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cTo bad its all going into my bones. In ten months, I\u2019ll grow 2.5 ft. I don\u2019t want to have to crawl through the hallways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cGuys. Focus! Something evil is in the universe again. Its like the Dark Anodites, but worse. Its like us. I can feel another orb. Ben, can\u2019t you sense it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen closed his eyes and tried to get in touch with his mana. He remembered Gwen\u2019s explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----Flashback-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cGuys, I did a few small test, and I found something out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cAnyone can use mana. Even some people from earth use it, but on the smallest scale. You know fortune tellers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick scowled \u201cYah. One of them ripped me off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cThen that was a fake. I\u2019m talking about the real deal. People from earth usually have small manas, but that doesn\u2019t matter much. What does matter is how in touch they are to it. The more they relate with their mana, the more they resonate with each other, the more they can do with mana. Fortune tellers resonate with their mana through crystal balls, magic cards, golden compasses (good book in my opinion), and just about anything else that can help them focus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cThen those witch doctors, are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen scowled \u201cI wish they weren\u2019t, but yes. They use bits of dark magic that I\u2019d prefer not to touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wondered \u201cThen could we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cThat\u2019s what I was heading towards. I want to get us practicing on resonating with out manas. Then you can do things with it despite the fact you can\u2019t fully use it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------End Flashback------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen focused. He grabbed his medallion and tried to see what was going on with the universe. Suddenly, he notices a gaping hole that was devoid of life or mana. It was utter darkness. \u201cIs that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded \u201cI think that is a Dark Mana Star. However, its going to super nova soon, and I felt another life form there that went dark. I couldn\u2019t find out who before they changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cShould I just blast it with healing magic to purify the darkness before it become a larger problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cBe our guest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy snapped her fingers and the all the healing mana in the universe flashed in response. The dark ball was eradicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen opened his eyes \u201cIts gone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded \u201cYah. It seemed like all the left over dark mana collected together in a final attempt to destroy us. It\u2019s a good thing we got to it before it got worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I felt like I was digging into a plot I didn\u2018t want to bother with, so I had to end it quick before I got sucked in and wrote long dull chapters).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSo its gone?\u201d She checked it out herself, and it really was. Yay! Quick victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cOk! Back to your stations! The school day isn\u2019t over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sighed. Ben\u2019s stomach growled, and they all looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I need to eat three pizzas. The number just increased last week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled and elbowed his stomach \u201cKeep it down in there. Auntie Amy is going to get you another box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy like she was his savior.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now crouching in the halls at 10ft 9in, Ben was, and forever will be, the tallest person on earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA freshman was passing Ben in the hall \u201cHey Ben! You have Dr. Comet right? Can you quiz me sometime before mid-terms? I think I have most of the names down, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cSure. Tadpole galaxies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshman sighed \u201cYup\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll muddle through. Meet me in the library after school. I\u2019ll help you then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshmen \u201cAwesome. Thanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid knew his stuff pretty well\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! We have to focus if we want to ace AP STATS, AP CALC, AP PHYSICS, AP WORLD, AP ENGLISH.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen groaned. His brain was pounding from the consistent flow of information. How did scientists do it\u2026 \u201cOk.. Know what? Its time for a break. I\u2019ve stared at these book for 5 hours. That\u2019s good enough for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed and closed her textbook \u201cI guess short break won\u2019t hurt. Midterms are next week. We have to push on threw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cTo bad I can\u2019t muscle my way out of this like I did for all my other problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cIf life was that easy, then it\u2019d be no fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed and opened the fridge. He began to construct the mother of all mother sandwiches. When he was done, he had used the whole loaf of bread and several bags of deli meat. He didn\u2019t feel guilty eating all this since he was paying for it all with his summer cash. He made a separate smaller sandwich for Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought them back out into the living room so they could continue studying and eating at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked up and saw her sandwich \u201cThanks. No mustard right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cYup. Light mayo and a thin slice of tomato.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYum. My favorite.\u201d She picked up her sandwich and then she saw Ben\u2019s sandwich. \u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen held in his hand a 3 ft tall tower of bread and meat. \u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cI know you\u2019re hungry, and its probably because you growing, which is the orbs fault. But does could you break it down a little? Have a bunch of smaller sandwiches instead of one skyscraper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cSorry. I would generally listen to advice like that outside, but I\u2019m at home, and I like my sandwiches big and scary looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed and looked down. \u201cIt was worth a shot. How are you going to eat that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard the sound of licked fingers, and she looked up. The sandwich was gone. She stared and was confounded \u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask. I would ruin my understanding of the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cGood. I don\u2019t think I could explain.\u201d He stomach was pushed out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at his abs and saw the bulge. \u201cYup\u2026 its in there.\u201d Then suddenly, you could see his stomach visibly shrink and return to its tight 8 pack as it digest the sandwich at an extreme rate. \u201cStill not going to ask\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cPlease don\u2019t. Even I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidterms\u2026 They endured\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrades were out. The school printed out all their exam grades on a single paper so they didn\u2019t need to hunt each of their teachers down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gang gathered at their usual table after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey counted off \u201c3...2...1!\u201d They unfolded their paper to see their grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cAwesome! I got B\u2019s on all of them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Nick studied a little harder than Seth \u201cYes!\u201d They got a mix of A\u2019s and B\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen refolded hers and held a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cThis is awful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw Amy and went over to ask what\u2019s wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI got an A- on one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cHey. Why so glum? You did better than me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scrunched her face. And Ben picked her up and put her on his shoulder. \u201cYou got all A\u2019s and an A-. Do you realize how mush teens would pay to have those grades in an AP class? Well, it\u2019s a lot, so stop feeling glum. Lets all go out got ice cream. My treat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone went out with a single scoop cone except\u2026 you guessed it. Ben felt extra hungry and got a triple stacker. Amy was sitting on Ben\u2019s shoulders like an adult would do to a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIs this how you feel all the time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI can see the tops of everyone\u2019s head! And they all have to crane their necks to see me. That\u2019s what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shrugged with Amy on his shoulders \u201cThe feeling\u2019s neutral. I don\u2019t think much about it. Well I do think about the fact that I have to almost kneel down to go through doorways. That about it, and the fact that I have 1ft3in to go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all at the park. Amy was babysitting for extra cash, and Ben decided to tag along. He was pretty much known by every person in town since he walked everywhere. He couldn\u2019t even fit in a care comfortably anymore. (much to his parents unease).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids Amy were baby sitting were Mike Spim (5) and Clare Spim (5). (fraternal twins.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike \u201cAgain! Again!\u201d Ben was them into tossing them lightly into the air and catching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClare \u201cIs it my turn yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Mike, I think its your sister\u2019s turn ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sighed, but he smiled anyway. \u201cOk. Can we play something else afterwards?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cSure\u2026 Why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he began to toss Clare around. Amy was sitting on a bench keeping an eye on them, though she was really watching Ben. He was so gentle, but he was so strong. I guess that combo works. A gentle giant\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike \u201cI want to grow and be big just like you. So I can toss my sister up and down like that too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cWow there! One step at a time. Wait until you\u2019re done playing small. Because once you\u2019re big, no one can toss you like this.\u201d And Ben proceeded to toss him up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled. What would our kids look like? Then she caught herself. Slow down Amy-san. You aren\u2019t even out of high school yet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, except for Ben who had to crouch lower and lower throughout his growing ordeal in order to get through a doorway. He simply suffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProm!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one of the greatest and most feared high school rituals. Boys and girls alike went above and beyond this one night and strut their stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was 11ft 9in now. Over twice Amy\u2019s height. She was at his waist line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face was red, and he was sweating. He\u2019s been with Amy for near 7 years, and still he could not ask her as easily as he had hoped. He crouched down to get to Amy\u2019s height \u201cUmm\u2026 Amy? Would you\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind\u2026 and you have some time that night\u2026 be willing too\u2026 umm\u2026 join\u2026 me and be\u2026umm\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was nodding her head egging him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood up and picked any up now. \u201cAmy, will you be might date to prom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask!\u201d And they hugged each other. Amy was only about 6 of 7ft off the ground right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick had called Gwen over to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was sitting in a bench, and Gwen came over to sit by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cYou called? What\u2019s the situation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was trying to hide his tension, but failed utterly. His shirt was already starting to cover in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had a feeling she knew what was going on, but she ignore the cold sweat her boyfriend was breaking into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cWell\u2026 I heard that Prom was next week, so I didn\u2019t ask anyone out as a date yet, and I was wondering if there was someone out there who wouldn\u2019t mind going with a sweating oaf like me. Someone who was at the this park. Someone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen waited \u201cGo on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cSomeone who had orange hair, and could kick my *** to Timbuktu and back again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cContinue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick groaned \u201cWill this someone say yes already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen pulled Nick in closer \u201cFine\u2026 yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was flipping out. \u201cWhy am I being so high maintenance right now? What\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom \u201cSeth! Is everything alright in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was shocked and he spilt the cologne all over his shirt. He groaned \u201cI\u2019m fine mom\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly walked casually over to the town pond. She saw a massive bulky shadow that she recognized. \u201cHello there stranger.\u201d She ran a finger down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth shuddered from the feeling \u201cHey Molly. I have a question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly sniffed \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell? Cologne?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth chuckled nervously \u201cUmm. Molly I have a question\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly \u201cWhy are you all wet? Did you jog in your suite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth pulled down his tie. Oh why did he dress up. \u201cUmm\u2026 Molly I ha-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly \u201cIs that gel in you-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth grabbed Molly and yelled \u201cMolly! Will you be my date to prom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly laughed \u201cFinally! The assertive Seth that we all love so much. Yes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProm night\u2026 the pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth, no matter where they went, could not get a suit the didn\u2019t show off all their muscles. They eventually turned to Ben who told then to use the gravitum cloths he gave them. They faced palmed themselves for idiocy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen did not have such luck. He spent the remainder of his summer funds on his suite. It was twice as big, and twice as expensive. Ben cried handing over the wad of cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, at 11ft10in, and massively strong. Stronger than either Seth or Nick thanks to his orb. But most of that strength was compacted into his tight build. He weight at about half a ton, or more. Though, they used a spell to make his minimum lighter, or he\u2019d never be able to enter houses ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suite had to be streamlined to match his body. Since he was proportionally thinner than both Nick and Seth, he didn\u2019t need to worry about looking like a wide rectangle. When all was said and done, Ben had himself a sharp, cut, clean look. He even took the time to wax (like gel but looks more natural) his hair the way Amy liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys went into the limo to get their gals. Seth was first and they discovered Molly had taken a liking to black. Nick and Ben looked unsure, but Seth was all for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was next and he brought back the purple queen. Gwen was garbed in royal purple. From dress to nails to jewelry, and charm bracelet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled \u201cIts so you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally was Ben\u2019s turn. They pulled up to the house that he helped fix up. The yellow cream colored home of his trials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stepped up and rang the door Bell. Zia opened it and welcomed Ben in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cShe\u2019ll be right done. You know girls and their make-up.\u201d Zia craned her neck to meet Ben\u2019s brilliant green eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how much you have grown. 7 years ago, I could look straight and see your eyes. I could say thank you for fixing that place up. Now I have to lean back to look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen blushed at the complement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they were a voice. Amy \u201cMom! Leave Ben alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia smiled \u201cI\u2019m just messing with him. Can\u2019t an old lady joke around once in awhile. Right Ben?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cRight. Keeping life fun as always.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia sighed \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much that means to an old lady like me. Thank you.\u201d Then she shifted moods \u201cNow hurry out. This night happens only once. Not out! Out is say.\u201d Zia grabbed her daughter\u2019s hand and dragged her down the stairs towards Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Ben looked at each other for a moment and they smiled. Ben ducked out of the doorway, and gave Amy his hand \u201cFollow me to the carriage Swan Princess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was dressed in white everything. Her mom even gave her a dress she had been saving just for this day, and a diamond wristband. These were things her husband had given to her from his parents, and now she gave them to Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s presence seemed to brighten the night. \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do tall black knight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was dressed in all black and he had a tiny red rose in his pocket. He reached into his pocket. And pulled out a pouch. Then he opened the pouch and pulled out a bouquet. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind a rose/vita hybrid, but I didn\u2019t want them dying to soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cAww\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Zia opened the door again, \u201cHere let me hold onto that for you. I\u2019ll get it in some water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scrunched her face the way Ben liked \u201cMom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cIts ok. Its better for the flowers. Besides now your hands have room for another present. Now open your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy complied and suddenly felt a strange ball on her hand. She looked down and saw a pure white Nexus. It glowed with a warm energy, and it you could see it was made of interconnected Doves. \u201cBen! Its beautiful! When did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLast week while I was waiting for my suit to be tailored. I had a lot of down time waiting for a large suite to be made. This nexus, when you place it on your other one will merge with it. Next time you enter your world, you\u2019ll see doves flying around freely. And, you see the branches on your hearthstone? There will be doves perched their too. I kind of made it more animated basically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cI love it! Thanks so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen kept quiet about the other purpose. He wanted no one to know about it unless it was an emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HONK HONK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cHurry up! We don\u2019t have all night! Its Prom. I want to get their before the limo line for the Red carpet gets to long!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy looked at each other and smiled. They walked hand in hand to the limo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest night of their life\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They did a lot of fundraising while they were freshmen, sophomore, and juniors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was laughing as Ben ran down the street. She was on his back barely hanging on \u201cBen!\u201d She was screaming with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was waiting for this day for nearly a year. That blasted orb was done! HAZZAH!!!! But was his natural body??? Oh well he didn\u2019t really care \u201cSorry Amy, but I\u2019m just so happy that deal is finished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laugher the way she normally did as she was just barely holding on. Ben got her on his neck again. Being 12ft wasn\u2019t as bad as he though, but he didn\u2019t want to get any tall. He had to bend over to get through doorways now, and some times he had to sit to move around a house. That\u2019s why he barely ever visits anyone anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed as her heart stopped pounding \u201cThat was exciting. Its kind of nice being up here. If you know what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cNope. Its been so long since I was short that I can\u2019t quite recall the feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scrunched her face \u201cI see. Anyway, we should get to the ceremony. They have our cap and gowns already there this year!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cGood. I\u2019m broke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school was amazed. They lied about the fundraising saying that just to get questions off their back, but it\u2019s a good thing students didn\u2019t really pay attention to what other students do outside of school. Some person stopped by and dropped off a check for half a million dollars for this years senior class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seniors had to line up outside the cafeteria to get their gown. They already told them their sizes before hand. However, they knew of Ben\u2019s issue with the ceiling and had his brought outside. They even set up a decent booth for him to change in. Apparently, there was a not with the check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben left the booth, a few teachers and student had brought a gift that was dropped of. \u201cSomeone left this for you. Do you know who because they are funding this graduation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was stunned \u201cI really don\u2019t. Do you mean the whole entire graduation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen opened his rather large package and found two things. A letter and an envelope. He opened them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Ben Tennyson,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the name of knowledge, we give you a copy of our will. You and your Friends may want to go collect their things before a few sneak hands try to grab at them Anyhow, we learnt just prior to our death, we assume, that Earth has a strange way of educating their young. They must pay?!?! What way is that to stimulate learning in a society. Its outrageous, so we have enclosed the largest sum of money we dare send with out compromising OOPS to pay for the education of whom ever you choose to share it with. Learning is out greatest desire, and now that we are gone, then we want others to bath in the light of knowledge. Please accept this gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Matter Twins<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S- If you\u2019re reading this, then the universe survived! Jolly good my friend. (We have always wanted to use that word. Jolly indeed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s heart pounded as he read the letter. They had prepared something before they sacrificed them selves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen opened the envelope and pulled out a check to his meager bank account for <br>\r\n$3,141,592,653,589,793,238,462.00.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen\u2026 Ben\u2026 Wake up. They\u2019re about to call an ambulance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen groaned. \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faculty and students \u201cHey! He\u2019s up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked around \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA student \u201cYou looked at what ever was in the envelope and passed out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy raised an eyebrow questioningly. Did her really? \u201cBen, can I see what it was?\u201d She gestured toward his giant hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked in his hand and started shaking again. He handed it to Amy and got ready to catch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at it for a moment, and slow began to fall back. Ben had caught her by now. \u201cHa\u2026ha\u2026 its pi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaculty \u201cPie? Have we all gone nuts? :et us see what\u2019s wrong.\u201d One of them marches up and had to grab onto Ben when he saw the number. The others join and then some of the students. By the end of the day, its was known around the school that Ben was the richest guy on earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stepped out onto the podium. As valedictorian, she had to give a speech\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne speech later, the students got their diplomas, etc. Throwing of hats, etc. Screaming, etc. Yelling, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stands up to his fullest height and yelled \u201cWho here is going to college!\u201d He got a lot of me\u2019s and woots. \u201cWell its free, is that ok with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was silent. \u201cSeriously?\u201d They were trying to see if the high school giant was telling the truth or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cI\u2019m rich now. May as well invest it in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone screamed again, and some students who did want to drop out now decided to stay and go to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked up behind Ben and yanked his silk robe \u201cThat was nice of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cIt was the Twin\u2019s request. They asked me to do it in the letter. Now that I have so much, I might even start my own school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cYou\u2019re still going to college right? You aren\u2019t going to drop now that you\u2019re rich, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cOf course I\u2019m not, and besides. The Twins said this was learning money. Not spending money. I can use it for anything in the search of knowledge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a group of student told everyone to gather around Ben. Suddenly, the cheer team burst out and circled Ben. The Big Ten came up to him and began to toss him in the air. The rest of the school circled around their hero!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ben was going up and down, he picked Amy up and tossed her lightly into the crowded \u201cHey guys! Catch.\u201d Every one was shocked, but they let it go and started tossing Amy into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen, Nick, and Seth stood off to the side. Molly was running the cheer squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cKnuckle head. First thing he does when he gets money is he throws it away to everyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cI\u2019m cool with it. I might go to college now that its free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen froze \u201cYou mean you will go to college. Its definite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed \u201cI was only joking\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gwen went onto a tirade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was glad he had someone like Molly. She didn\u2019t really flip out when he said he as going into body building. He was already making some money from competing. They had to up him up to the pros. He simply outshone everyone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the ceremony went to a Ben funded party\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead of 5in, its now a 1ft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen yelled \u201cWhat! I can believe it. How long will it take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scrunched her face. \u201cAbout until you\u2019re 21year old, so this really is just a somewhat natural growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cIf that orb had a body, I\u2019d pummel it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cIf you did that to anyone that made you angry, earth\u2019s population would be seriously reduced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it \u201cReally? I don\u2019t get mad that often. Do I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed again \u201cJust joking with you. Now what were we going to do today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh right! Colleges. We can either go to the ones that exist today, or I could make us one. Then we\u2019d know we\u2019d get in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cHow good is the on you are going to make?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it \u201cWell, I\u2019m hoping that since it\u2019s another intergalactic school, that it\u2019d be greater than any IV Leagues. That way, I can meet some tall aliens. And get Earth accustom to aliens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIsn\u2019t that what the plumbers are preventing? To keep aliens of earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled \u201cNope. They just keep the peace. Remember MIT? They are school of aliens. That\u2019s why they are the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cOh. Right. I forgot about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo what do you think? Tennyson University?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought about it. It had nice ring, and besides, maybe after attending Tennyson university she might actually become a Tennyson. \u201cKnow what? I like that. Lets do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the summer, a school magically appeared right next to Yellowstone national park. It was connected to a large cave system and it had its own river of lava, courtesy of the volcano. There hung a sign \u201cWelcome to Tennyson University.\u201d Then it showed the world in the palm of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school was a massive single structure with 5 main sections. It was a giant FRACTAL pentagon. Each new pentagon added was a whole new room. Eventually the pentagons got to small, but the smaller ones were just outside for decorations. The main ones were where the class rooms were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main pentagon, in the center was the area for school events and sports. It had the massive area of 50 football fields. Coming off of it were 5 smaller pentagons on its 5 sides. Each one fore something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusiness and Communication, The Sciences, The Maths, The Arts and Literature, and the last was the office section. Each sub-pentagon had their own five sub pentagons, and those had their own, and it continued the pattern for a few more hundreds times until they got down to atoms. For some reason, the small pentagons can not be shift or broken. As though it were magically enhanced *cough cough*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth hadn\u2019t reacted to pleasantly to an alien school. They were to different\u2026 However, there were the curious humans who had to meet one in person, and others who were the children of plumbers and had want to learn to be one as well, since the school taught the earth curriculum and the plumber curriculum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s school got over 5million applications from around the galaxy. Earth had sent in about 250 students. To keep things equal, they had to take a little of each species of planet. They ended up have to create a system to weight out the species on the each planet to the number of planets in order to the fair number of students from each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeptember\u2026 there was a platform floating in the sky waiting for space cruisers and other space ships to come and drop of their kids. Quickly, the school filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the gang joined. Molly went off to model. Seth went off to body building. They were going off well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hung closer to Ben \u201cThere\u2019s only 6 students from each planet or species allowed right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cFor the most part. To bad I don\u2019t have a planet. That would have worked better. I might build that next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed, and sighed \u201cBut is it ok for the 6 students from earth be us 4? Some other kids wanted to get in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick patted Amy on the back \u201cIts perfectly fine. We know people. That\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cThey\u2019ll have a chance next your. This year is the opening year. Anyone who goes to this has bragging rights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cIs that the only reason you are going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen laughed \u201cNo! I came to force the science build to submit to my superior intellect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at her, and she smiled \u201cJust joking. Guys! Take it easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder how much different this will feel going to a school of aliens\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a planet that was directly in the middle of space between the Red, Blue, and Green stars. Its became known as the large planet. It if the home of the WayBigs. But it was also home to some others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith in the last century, a whole space shuttle of human plumbers crash landed on the planet, and saw it beautiful abundance of large life. They stayed there and had children. What they did not know was that there was a reason that things on the planet were huge beyond proportion. With each passing generation, something from the planet changes the DNA of its inhabitants so that they are bigger and stronger than the last. Since the Waybigs were there for eons\u2026 that\u2019s why they were so um\u2026 big. Now the plumbers have never done this before, so what came was a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir kids were born normally. Nothing could look wrong had all. They grew normally until they hit puberty, and then their world flipped. Some of the kids experience a 1-2ft growth spurt with in their first year. One kid even got 3 ft. However, each year, they had another surge, but it would shrink down each time. By 18 or 19, they were practically done at about a range of 9 to 10 ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one kid who was bigger than all the rest. He was absolutely huge in every way possible. His parent, the Jones, kept a secret\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jones lived by a small waterfall that tasted purer and rich than any of the other pools. They claimed it as their own. During Mrs. Jones pregnancy, that is all she drank, and it nutrient fed her body and their son\u2019s. The day came for him to be born and he was delivered. However, something was off. His body was normal, but he had an abnormally large set of testis, pituitary gland, and large penis. He came out having a 6in erection. They kept it a secret all these years by covering him in bag cloths, etc. because of how he was born, they called him Tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent strolled down the dirt street almost completely exposed. The society there gave up on trying to cloth their giant young ones since they grew so fast. Once they start to settle, they might put something one them. He stood at his proud 11ft stature. The young here have developed a hierarchy based off of your height. The taller, you were, the higher up you got. Also, their height directly corresponded to their strength, so Tent was the strongest. Even the cloth he wore around his groin barely held back the strength of his two 20in long 3in think monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simple exhumed cockiness and arrogance. He had the kids at their small school worship his and if they wanted to talk to him, they had to praise his god like muscles. This society was mostly farming, so the kids there had to develop strong, but non bulky builds. Tent wound ever since puberty, they farming wasn\u2019t to hard since he actually did have a bulky build unlike the others. His muscles were twice as large as there for some reason, and he did the same amount of work. Though, most of it was compacted together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent walked up to a group of kids \u201cGuess what? I get to go to college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids \u201cWhat? How? We don\u2019t have any here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent laughed mockingly \u201cWell maybe one of you guys can follow me and be one of the 5 kids I can bring back to earth. I hear that we are like twice the average adult height. I\u2019ve got to be over that by now. No one is teller than me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids were excited. Who would he take?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, their elected chair person of their small colony walked up \u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about you, Tent, picking who gets to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent paused and glared \u201cWell I\u2019m the biggest, so I should get to be in charge of who goes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChair person sighed. He mumbled the arrogance in this kid \u201cI was planning on letting you go, but considering your attitude, I might just pick someone else to go to that college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent froze and picked the man up \u201cYou will let me go!\u201d He yelled. He was used to forcing people to his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChair person glared at him stone cold. He would not be told how to run this colony \u201cWe are looking for respectful people to go as representation of the maturity of this colony. The founder of the school has enough money to buy a trillion school and that\u2019d be only a fraction of 1% of his riches. We are hoping to impress him and gain a donation of some sorts to help fund out own school and further our lives. He might even boost the economy to something beyond farming! But with you up there, we might as well give us his money for us to throw back at him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent had never been talked back to like that, except by him mom, but he respected her. He knew how hard it was raising a giant like him, so he was good at home. \u201cBut you will let me go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChair person paused and thought. The founder was also the tallest person on earth, so he heard. He was currently 12ft1in, and growing steadily. \u201cTell me Tent. Has your growth level out yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent was surprised by the question, but he smiled cockily \u201cNot yet. Unlike the others. I think I still have another foot and a half to grow. I might end up being 12ft 6in when I come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChair person smirked inwardly. Lets see how he reacts to a normal earthling who\u2019s DNA was not affected by this planet, and was still teller than Tent. \u201cFine\u2026 You can go, but you can not pick anyone else to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smirked. He put the chair person down. \u201cDeal. Peace out losers. I\u2019m going to college.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair person sighed and felt a sudden disturbance in the force \u201cWhat have I done\u2026\u201d Then he looked back at the other giant teens. He craned his neck and they looked down respect fully. \u201cWhere is your school teacher?\u201d They pointed to a lady down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chairman went over \u201cHello Ms. Sully. I have an important request for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSully smiled \u201cYes, Chairman. What can I do for the person who keeps this place running?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chairman nodded in recognition of the compliment \u201cThank you Ms. Sully. It has come to my attention that a University on earth was made, and it is accepting student across the universe. Each planet gets 6 students. I would like you to pick 5 students who you know are studious, hardworking, and have decent manners.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSully scrunched her face \u201cWhy not 6?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChairman \u201cBecause I have promised Tent a seat. The reason is that I\u2019m hoping this will teach him some humility. There is someone on earth who is 12ft tall! He\u2019s not from this planet, so he\u2019s just another person from Earth! And he\u2019s taller then Tent already. Maybe that will show Tent that he doesn\u2019t have the right to be arrogant and self-centered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSully pondered the idea \u201cYou know what? I kind of agree.\u201d And they laugh the way adults do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, Mrs. Jones \u201cHey, I heard you were going away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent looked up from his packing. \u201cHey mom. Yah. You heard right.\u201d He saw his mom was about to burst into tears. Tent was shocked. He\u2019s never seen his mom like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom knew he\u2019d be back, and that he\u2019d be smarter when he returned, and a whole bunch of other good things. But she couldn\u2019t let go so easily. She fell to her knees, and Tent went over and picked her up. Mr. Jones just got back from the fields and had heard some of what they said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about going away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent stood up and looked at his father \u201cI\u2019m going to college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad froze \u201cI see. Have you packed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent nodded \u201cJust about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cSoon. Tomorrow or the day after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded slowly. His eyes looked far away. \u201cIs see\u2026 Ok\u2026\u201d He patted his large son and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had gone silent and slowly followed Dad to where ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent finished packing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is now tomorrow. Tent was dressed fully now because the colony had the motive to actually make a full set of cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent was saying by to his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had stopped crying and accepted that it was for the better. \u201cNow be good ok? I don\u2019t want you ruining the family name by embracing the colony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smiled, but he grimaced inside \u201cFine mom. I\u2019ll make them bow down to me by the time I graduate.\u201d He was really cocky right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed \u201cSon. I want you to take this. Its given us a lot of luck over the years, and I\u2019ve added a few things to it, buts it been in the family for centuries. When you need something, just hold it and hope.\u201d He hands his son a jade tablet. At the bottom was a tiny carving of this planet and a large man. \u201cMaybe you can continue the tradition. I finished the last two last night to have it in the record. Maybe you could add something when it come to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent held it in his hand. He help something old and meaningful in his hands. And it was his now. His ego swelled. Wait till I show everyone else. \u201cThanks dad. I will.\u201d He gave them a hug and started to walk toward the Plumber Space Cruiser 300.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just him, one other, and 4 other humans from earth. He couldn\u2019t wait to dominate them\u2026 to bad for him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tent got off the ship on onto the platform. They directed him towards a hole. He followed the others and jumped in. It levitated him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued into the school to gather for an assembly to celebrate the school\u2019s grand opening. He heard that the founder of the school was also a student. \u201cKid must be some snooty rich kid. Small and weak. I could get him to submit to me.\u201d Tent smiled. The chairman won\u2019t have to worry about not getting a donation. He\u2019d make sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe university was trying to prevent a massive bubble from forming, so they only let 1500 students in. In total, they could house about 6500, but the extra was just in case they end up with a larger class on year somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent walked In confident. Most of the aliens were smaller than him, and based of his logic, he was their superior. He found himself a seat and decided to be nice to his follower. He shoved some other alien out of a seat so his follower could sit \u201cThere you go. Right next to me. You should be honored.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other 10ft6in tall teen rolled his eyes, but took the seat. He apologized for his colleague\u2019s rudeness. Lucky for him, the alien was from a planet of very nice inhabitant, and they accepted the apology. This guy\u2019s name was Nowen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You may be wondering why there are no girl giants or anything. Mainly because, by total chance, the people of that colony only had sons, partly because boys had balls, and the planet itself encourages the male race. I\u2019m sure there is some planet in space the encourages the female race as well. One of you just need to write about it in another interactive\u2026 unless you already did. Then congratz! =D*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent grumbled \u201cWould they start the dang ceremony already? The long I sit here, the less time I have today to make people bow down to my godly body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen sighed. People have tried to talk sense with this kid, and they have all failed because he was always bigger than them. And he won\u2019t care if an alien is bigger than him. His excuse is \u201cThey aren\u2019t human, so it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d Nowen looked at Tent smirking cockily. At this point, he promised to associate as little as possible with Tent since it could impact any friends that he does happen to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeakers \u201cTesting testing 1 2 3. Thank you all for coming here on time. We were waiting for the last couple of late comer to arrive. But now ever person who enrolled is here. Starting the University off strong I see. Jolly good. Now\u2026\u201d The person speaking was a representative of the Plumbers who was sent to over see the schools effectiveness and co-operations. \u201cNow with out further delay. I bring you Ben Tennyson. The founder and student of this soon to be fine establishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an applause and Ben stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the audience paused and looked at the giant human. They had not heard about his size. All humans they have met were small and puny. Tent was especially threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent turned to Nowen \u201cHow tall is he do you think? Are my muscles bigger than his? I\u2019m sure there are. Never mind, I\u2019m just talking nonsense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen stared at Tent in surprise. He was being extra defensive. Did he feel threatened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and was about to talked when someone yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone 1 \u201cWait. Did the guy say Ben Tennyson? The guy who blasted Vilgax back into space?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were murmurs. They all started remembering the name, and they saw someone great standing before them. There were those who were jealous of Ben\u2019s reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone 2 \u201cWhere\u2019s the Omnitrix? I don\u2019t see it on your wrist.\u201d there were yells of agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was feeling nervous and didn\u2019t stop it. Amy was sitting there. He patience was growing thin. No one did this to her Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked up from her front seat and stood up next to Ben. \u201cQUIET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d She amplified her voice 1000 times with mana.\u201d This shut the room up. Their ears stilling ringing \u201cThank you.\u201d She said normally, and then she sat back in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Amy as he waited for the ringing to stop. \u201cThank you Amy.\u201d She smiled happily and innocently. The aliens that were sitting near her shook with a silent fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cRight. The Omnitrix. I have it back to Azmuth because I had to much power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent scoffed in his seat and stood up \u201cSo now you have none right? You gave up one of the most powerful weapons, so now you\u2019re powerless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned\u2026 is that another human he saw. \u201cNow necessarily. Though I\u2019d rather not say what I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent laughed \u201cBecause you can\u2019t do anything that a relatively large human can do. You\u2019re nothing special. The only reason you beat Vilgax was because of barrowed power. Now that\u2019s gone, so you\u2019re weaker than me. I am a god to all humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed inside his mind \u201cWho are you? Can you please come up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smiled. Nore attention for him. He got to show these people their size difference. As he stood up and walked up to the center of the large Pentagon, he noticed something. Ben was bigger than him, but his muscles were a little smaller! \u201cName\u2019s Tent. You should be honored.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned \u201cWe\u2019ll see. Give me a punch. The hardest you got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent recoiled slightly from the request \u201cExcuse me? You want this muscles\u201d He pointed to his giant over inflated basketball bicep \u201cTo punch you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and smiled \u201cConsidered it a handicap. We\u2019ll duke it out if you want. I don\u2019t take kindly to insults from ignoramuses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent scowled. No one insulted him and got away with it. There were oohs from the crowd \u201cFine. Its your hospital bill.\u201d Tent swung the hardest punch he ever gave at Ben\u2019s chest since this was the first time he actually received and insult. There was the sound of crushed cartilage. Tent fell to the ground grasping his shattered hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cAmy, I know you\u2019re angry, but would you mind healing his hand please? I don\u2019t want the infirmary to deal with this right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy got out of her seat and cast a quick spell. His hand healed immediately, but the pain was still fresh in his mind. He felt as though it were still broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent stood up \u201cWhat do did you place under your shirt? No one had a chest that hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt like he\u2019d heard that somewhere before, and smirked. \u201cI can assure you there isn\u2019t. Now go back to your seat. You\u2019re lucky you aren\u2019t expelled yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent fumed \u201cNo one tells me what to do.\u201d He ran for another punch, and when it was close to hitting, Ben vanished, and Tent found himself flying through the air towards his seat. The aliens near it fled to the sides. Good thing too because the seat he landed in collapsed along with some other chairs from the crash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen wiped his hands against each other and resealed himself. \u201cNow where was I\u2026 right. This school exists because of two very special twins. You may know them\u2026\u201d Ben told them a short story of how the twins had saved their universe eons ago, and what they wanted no. \u201cSo lets finish what they started and embrace knowledge. Now go. You\u2019re dorms have been given the basic essential. Pick any you like, but make sure that when you claim a room, that you mark it as yours. There will be a small touch screen panel. Type in your name. If you can\u2019t spell it, say it into the microphone. If you don\u2019t have one, pick a symbol in our grand selection of pictures to call yourself, or just take a picture and put it in. Now go. Today is exploration. Learn and understand the school as best as you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone left excited to get their own room. However, some did linger around. That human was still knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked over along with Gwen, Nick and Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another one there sill face palming from the humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen walked up to meet Ben \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for my colleagues actions. I don\u2019t know what the chairman was thinking when he sent Tent over here. He has thing where he thinks that he\u2019s in charge, and he\u2019s a god among men. I really am sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Nowen shocked. These two people were opposite each other. However, they were both huge. Almost Ben\u2019s height, but not quite. Ben was still at least a foot taller. \u201cWhat\u2019s you name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen \u201cMy names Nowen. It really nice to meet you. I\u2019ve heard quite a bit, but to actually meet the Ben Tennyson. I was shocked. How did you move so fast, and how did you get so strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. He had a fan. Lolz. \u201cKnow what? I like you\u2019ll, so I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d He turned to the other \u201cDo you guys mind?\u201d The didn\u2019t mind. \u201cCan tell you why, but not how. The reason is that my body is super dense. When I through him, I used about 1/infinty of my strength. If I weren\u2019t compressed, the universe would cease to exist. That\u2019s why I gave up the power of the Omnitrix. Now you know you can\u2019t tell anyone else. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen looked at Ben disbelieving \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I know you\u2019re strong and famous, but really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to lie. Besides, I\u2019m almost positive that this school will be attacked someday. You may or may not see me in action then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen saw Ben\u2019s confident smiled, and decided to play the innocent believer \u201cFine then. I will wait patiently for that day.\u201d He reached out his hand to shake hands. Ben returned it. \u201cNow where\u2019s the infirmary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stepped up and cast a spell \u201cJust saving the nurses there hours of annoying arrogance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen let out a chuckle \u201cSorry, you don\u2019t know how right you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like Nowen has made a group of friends\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tent groaned at he picked himself off the pile of crushed seats. He was sore, but perfectly fine. Nothing was broken. \u201cThat kid has to be a face. Its not possible!\u201d Tent was trying to pull the bits and pieces of his shattered ego into something that was whole. Ben will pay for humiliating me like that. When he was insulting Ben, he was stating fact. Ben was just to weak to accept it, so he resorted to some trick to shut him up. \u201cIt won\u2019t work you hear? It won\u2019t work\u2026\u201d Tent promised to beat Ben down and making Ben pay. He was the strongest of all humans, and that\u2019s final.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was debating: However, if he approached Ben now, he\u2019d only use that cheap trick again. I\u2019ll have to get that much stronger to stop him and reveal him for the fraud he really was. So he plotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at his planet, he had taken classes in a bit of everything, but they were incomplete. He also didn\u2019t want to waste time taking things that weren\u2019t worth it. He planned on taking all the sciences such as Chemistry, Biology, Anatomy, and other things that will help him reach his ultimate goal. He wanted to make something to boost his growth spurt this coming Christmas. Something to make him taller, bigger, and stronger than Ben. (The teens of that planet have had periodic growth spurts near the day they were born, but the strength of the spurt diminishes each time. He sought to replenish it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent was more studious than ever before. The thought of beating Ben drove him to learn everything he could about the body, its chemical, and all its other stuff. He aced the first quarter exams and was starting to get the school to buy a chemical synthesizer. He would need it for his plans. He felt like he was getting closer and closer to his ultimate goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Ben were playing catch in the center pentagon with a ball of white and green mana. Amy started it off with a ball of white, but as it was exposed to more and more dense green mana, it started taking on both colors. This helping Ben practice manipulating the density of his mana around his body and other areas. So far, he could only control the mana around his body, but he hoped to manipulate it from a further distance some day. His resonance with his mana was steadily increasing. Slowly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege was everything they hoped for and more. Gwen was still going full blast neurosciences. Nick was starting to delve into deeper aspects of anatomy and organic compounds of the human body. Amy was marching off and getting all the things a universal doctor would need. She spent all but 9 hours of her day studying. 8 were for sleeping, and 1 hour was for hanging out with Ben, and then they might go study advance Chemistry together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen had joined the group more and more often. He hasn\u2019t really spoken to Tent in ages, nor did he mind. Nowen was looking into being a magician at mechanics. He found he had a natural skill at it. When he saw a broken car just outside the school, he started to tinker until a student came screaming at him. He said sorry and they left with their car. They came back and gave him 20bucks and said \u201cThank you! You got rid of that awful clanking sound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was going good, and they were all studying hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cReally! You\u2019re letting me buy one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI looked at your grades and asked your teachers. They think it will make you strive harder and find something that was never seen before. You have a skill at the sciences they said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smiled \u201cReally? Cause I didn\u2019t know much when I started, so I kind of freaked.\u201d Though he was yelling with joy. The person he was trying to beat was helping him! Take that you loser!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cWell, keep up the work. It should arrive come midterms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, our studious learner practically aced all their midterms. Amy and Gwen neck in neck for the highest grades. Ben and Nick had decent grades. And Nowen being declared a prodigy at machines of all sorts. Tent was offered a place in the student hall of fame for sciences, as was Amy and Gwen for other places. Nowen simply built himself a moving room/hall of fame, and he was really appreciative of the support of Ben, Nick, Any, and Gwen, so he instilled their names in his masterpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent was shaking. He studies above and beyond the norms pace guide of all his classes. He could even out due some of the professors (some were GreyMatters\u2026 super smart tiny people). He was running dozen of calculations on his computer and a dozen 3D models. Suddenly he put down a sketch he had draw with a dozen explanations\u2026 \u201cIts done. This is it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had draw a molecule of Testosterone but different. It was about 100 times more effective, and that was because it used an element known as gravitum instead of carbon. If he could get some, he could inject himself with a serum of that stuff and it would last as long as his growth spurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found created a formula to see how much growth he\u2019d go though this Christmas, and he was pretty much done. Maybe a foot at most, but with the serum, he might gain double or triple that easily! That should be with one dose only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew of a source of gravitum. It was in the science storage lab locked up. They had a rather large supply of it. \u201cThey won\u2019t miss a little of it.\u201d Tent went to a professor and asked for the key to the storage, and the Professor practically begged him to take the key. He was that good a student. He grabbed a chunk of gravitum and now he waited\u2026 The synthesizer should be in soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts been another week, and finally it arrived. Ben came by to help Tent transfer it to the science lab for public use. Tent would get to use it first of coarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw the box at the drop off point, and he signed the paperwork. He turned at saw Tent ready to burst with joy \u201cHey Tent. We need to get this up to the main lab. You can use it first if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smiled \u201cAwesome! Lets move this bad boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent and Ben used their huge height, long arms and strong body to pick the half ton box. (FYI - Being at 12ft tall gives Ben more room for compressed muscle, at minimum size).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey let the box down gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pat the box \u201cOk. There you go. The thing you\u2019ve been dying to have. Right on time for Christmas too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smirked. His growth spurt was coming soon them. On the day and time of his birthday, he will (like all the teens of his planet) experience irritation in his pituitary gland thus causing more growth hormones to be made. With the serum, he\u2019ll easily get to 14ft tall with in a month. That\u2019s 3ft of growth compared to the 1ft he would have gotten. \u201cHey, did you know my birthday was on Christmas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at him \u201cNo\u2026 I didn\u2019t. Interesting. Less presents for you at that time of year right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent laughed \u201cYah. Even though we aren\u2019t earth, we trying to match its holidays. My present was either one big one, or two small ones. Oh well. At least they sent me to college. I\u2019m cool with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Tent \u201cYou know\u2026 you aren\u2019t the cocky, arrogant person I punch senseless. Not anymore at least. I thought you\u2019d amount to nothing, but you really proved me wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent looked at Ben with shock. He smirked inwardly. Loser. He can\u2019t see a lie like this because I\u2019m just that awesome. HA! \u201cBen. Thanks. That means a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone came running into the room. \u201cBen! There\u2019s a fight outside. None of the students can get near them with out getting hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stomped his foot down \u201cWhat! I\u2018ll be right down.\u201d Ben ran out and saw two Anodites fighting each other. No wonder know one can get close. Ben walked up to the two of then. Waves of mana lashing out and bouncing off his hardened muscle. Lets see if his exercises with Amy worked. He focused on his mana that covered the universe and pulled it together. He made it condense around him in a giant ball. He stepped forward and covered the two battling Anodites with his mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly their purple glowing skin flared like it was on fire and they fell to the ground screaming from the over flow of mana. They returned back to their flesh and blood bodies, and got rid of the purple glowing skin. They passed out but were still shaking as their bodies tries to expel the excess mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who was there saw a giant green fog settle over the area. Mana is usually clear when it isn\u2019t being used since they were tiny particles with huge amounts of space in between particles. Ben however made it so compact that the particles combined into large enough particles to give off a certain amount of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone breathing the mana rich air felt rejuvenated and powerful. Quickly, the fog faded as the mana condensed mana rushed out to the boundaries of the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen picked to the two limp anodites up and carried them to the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent had seen the whole thing. He saw Ben\u2019s power, and saw size. He\u2019s heard about mana, and he\u2019s read a little bit about it in some anodite text books. Ben must be massively strong\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTents only hope of domination was the serum now. He must complete the serum.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two anodites struck a truce. They would ruin Ben\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey discovered the chemical synthesizer and had gone in. They had learnt about different hormones in the body of humans and how they mess with their mind and body. They would love to play around with Ben. They want to force him to do something he\u2019d never do in public\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned on the synthesizer and got it to start making the essence of euphoric pleasure. What they did not know was that something else was being made prior to this moment. As soon as they turned to leave, they heard a ding and the machine was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnodite 1 \u201cThat was fast.\u201d (He a masculine looking boy with decent mana)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnodite 2 \u201cWho cares. Lets get it and go!\u201d (She had the body and the curves, and above average mana. The boy can physically outmatch her, but her mana beats im most times.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine popped out a vial filled with a transparent light grey liquid. They grabbed it and left. They failed to notice the machine flashing \u201cBeginning 2nd Task Now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little after they were gone, another person came in. Tent walked in casually and check on the machine. \u201cNot done yet\u2026 It said about an hour and a half. Its been two. Maybe first time use needs to be broken in.\u201d Tent waited patiently. He\u2019s waited this long already. He could wait a little more. He picked up a vial of pick liquid as soon as it popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his Christmas present and gave the vial a kiss. He had to wait until his growth spurt starts before drinking it if he want to have the ultimate effect. His calculation said that multiple doses at one time was catastrophic since it could possible sever the spine with over growth in muscle, so he chose to play it safe and take a single dose. Then next year, he\u2019d go for another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anodites had a little special Christmas surprise for Ben. They knew of that other Anodite hybrid and that healer human Amy. Now even their mana can detect a substance not made of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnodite 1 (dubbed A1 now) looked at Anodite 2 (dubbed A2). They had planned this for nearly a week now. On Christmas day, all classes were given the same lunch so that students could go give gifts to other aliens and spread the human holiday spirit. They all gathered in the central pentagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA2 \u201cReady? Its his lunch hour now and he always has a kiwi crush smoothie. Lets give him a little extra now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA1 snickered \u201cHe\u2019ll ruin his pants and his reputations right in the middle of the entire student body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey order a smoothie ahead of time and pour in the light grey liquid. The color of the kiwi crush is unchanged, and the grey liquid was flavorless. Then they approached Ben as he walked into the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA1 \u201cHey Ben, we\u2019re really sorry that we dragged you into our fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA2 \u201cIt was really stupid, and you could have been doing something important at the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA1 \u201cSo tried to get you something you liked a lot, and its kind of hard not to see you with a smoothie, so we got you a kiwi crush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA2 looked all innocent, but really happy and out going. Nothing suspicious there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Amy\u2019s defensive instincts were flashing. Her white stone was neutral and uncreative to the drink, so no poison. Yet Amy felt compelled to stop Ben. However, she couldn\u2019t bare to insult the Anodites. What if she was wrong? She did a quick spell check (pun intended) on the drink and saw nothing suspicious. Amy relaxed a bit. Ok then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cThanks. Its wasn\u2019t a burden at all really. What was the fight about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA1 mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA2 sighed \u201cHe was to masculine to admit my mana was greater than his.

I hadn\u2019t realized the tension has been building since we arrive here at the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA1 \u201cThen you came and you mana knocked both of us out. My body is still recovering from the surge of mana.\u201d He rubbed his sore arms and shoulder. \u201cBut some good came from it.

Maybe it works more than once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA1 \u201cHey\u2026 why isn\u2019t he jacking off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA2 paused \u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled as he saw the two of them stop arguing \u201cYou guys done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA1 chuckled nervously \u201cUmm\u2026 how do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA2 jumped in before Ben suspected something \u201cAbout expanding our mana again? It hurts, but I\u2019ll deal with it if it helps me get stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it \u201cMaybe, but not this soon. You two look like you need to recover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA1 nodded thankfully . He started to rub his arms again. They had gotten stronger to match the size of his mana, but it hurt to move them to much right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA2 sighed. She grew what earthlings call another cup size, but on her planet, the larger you were, the greater you mana, the more proud you should be. They would be willing to show off their stuff here on earth if their weren\u2019t those things called murals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded and thanked Ben and left. They were going to take a rest and hopefully recover soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cDid they act a little strange at the end, like something had gone wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick laughed \u201cBen was standing next to them. Its natural that they feel intimidated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were talking, Ben was going through slow changes. He was supposed to (according to Amy) stop growing at age 21 at about 13 feet total, but now, it would be much much more\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the moment of triumph! He\u2019d been waiting for this day ever since he enrolled in all those course. In 5 minutes, the minute he was born, his body would signal a growth spurt would last a month. The serum should last as long as he was growing. The larger his normal growth, the greater the effect of the serum. When he was in a period of small growth, that too would be boosted to a slightly larger degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seconds ticked by and then it was time. Tent could feel his balls stir into action. He drank the serum. He threw the container in a disposal unit and began to make his way out of his bathroom. Suddenly, he felt his temperature rise. He felt his 20in python grow into a 30in monster pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent was panting and sweating underneath his cloths. He tore it all of trying to cool down. It was never this intense before. Mainly because he was inexperience. This was his first time, and only time doing it under chemical influences. He grabbed his monster pole and he felt himself explode with heat. It was searing hot. The veins on his muscle body rose to the surface growing to huge sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to jack off on the floor of his bathroom. He tried squeezing out the pressure, pumping it. He even tried to crush it with his thighs, but the pressure wouldn\u2019t stop growing. And it was only getting hotter. You could see steam coming off his body from the level of horniness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He exploded into the mother of all human orgasms. It fired and splattered across the ceiling. His oversized balls vibrated from the amount of semen they were making. Tent grabbed his burning cock and stroked it even more trying to keep it going. One hand grabbed his balls and he squeezed causing it to make even more cum. He was moaning in lust as the gush of cum kept coming and coming. For 10 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his bathroom floor was covered with a 3in tick layer of steaming Tent soup. Slowly, the effects of the substance ended. His pole slowly deflated to 23in. The amount of pressure had force his cock to elongate to manage it all. Tent panted. He tried to ignore the orgasm and musk dense air. His got off the floor drenched in cum and he was fuming. Who ever did this was going to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to clean up his mess but found it impossible. He called for a new room. The school could deal with this. What were they going to do? Expel him for having to much fun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was sitting in a couch with Amy laying on him. They gang was spending Christmas together at Ben\u2019s suite dorm. He paid a bit extra his friends and his own boarding. They simply sat in front of the fire rested from the day\u2019s festive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had fallen asleep on him, and Gwen had fallen asleep on Nick. Nowen was about to sleep. He was tinkering with a piece of hand held machinery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen lay there twirling Amy\u2019s long hair in his fingers. Then he felt his heart skip a beat and return to normal. Ben brushed it aside thinking it was how he reacts to Amy being to close to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he could almost feel it, but it alluded him. The thing Ben drank slowly made its way to his pituitary gland and deposited bits of gravitum. Slowly, it made super hormones that would make Ben grow even more. His balls stirred slightly as production began\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ben\u2019s growth was supposed to level off at around 21. Currently 19 and 12ft 2in, he had another 17-18 months until he got to 21. Lots of time for the liquid to do its stuff. It feels like its set off another growth spurt\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked down the halls. The floors littered with post Christmas material, i.e. wrapping paper and broken ornaments. This went better then he had though. He had assumed a few fight may break out since it was not an alien tradition. However, it appears that the students that chose to go to a multi-species University had expected there to be unusual customs. Christmas was one they quite like, and might bring back to their planet (maybe under a different name, but still Christmas).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Ben saw Amy down the hall. She saw Ben and smiled. Ben smiled back, but then he felt his penis stir as it filled with blood. He mentally forced it to stop with a well thought out distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw what Ben just did and began to think\u2026 hormonal surge? She couldn\u2019t be more right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen calmed down and walked over to Amy. He was partially fine now. He kept his python in check. \u201cHey Amy. I woke up and you vanished. I was going to wrap you in a giant bear hug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cYou still can!\u201d She ran and he gave a massive hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his penis solidify into a rod instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt his rock hard cock beneath his cloths\u2026 yup\u2026 hormonal surge\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Ben \u201cFeeling a little naughty I see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s face turned bright red \u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cI don\u2019t mind. As long as its because of me and not someone else.\u201d Then her face grew dark \u201cBecause you\u2019re mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen opened his eyes wide in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cOk. You can put me down.\u201d He set her down. She looked up at him, and saw how high the ceiling was. He Didn\u2019t need to bend over. \u201cYou know, now that I look at it, at this University, the ceilings and doors are so high, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you were 12ft tall or 15ft tall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled \u201cI don\u2019t mind it much here, but still! I\u2019d have walk on my knees hunched over in any other place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cTrue\u2026 true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigh\u2026 poor Ben. He\u2019s going to have to crawl in those other places soon, and that\u2019s if he can fit through the door. He was 3ft wide due to his broad shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent had gotten his new room. His old one was going to be burned, and remade since the hot cum soaked in so deeply. He came to the conclusion that the event was a direct result of the super hormones entering his system, so he accepted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts been about a week, and he expected more to come from the serum. He\u2019s grown about 3in, but he expected a good 9 inches thanks to the serum. What was going on? Flustered, he went back to the main lab and check the history on the Synthesizer. He was holding a pencil and it snapped in his anger. Someone had taken his serum after they punched in a command to produce concentrated pleasure hormones. The dolt must have taken his serum think the machine was a fast worker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe punched in the diagram for his serum again and increased the dosage to make up for lost time. He knew the risk, but he was gong to take it. He had to beat Ben. This time, while the machine worked, he waited with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to think. Who ever drinks the first dose would grow at a faster rate in their period of growth. Who ever took it would be getting larger faster, so he\u2019d keep his eye out for the dolt. Then he smirked. They guy must have been so disappointed when they couldn\u2019t wank off like he had that Christmas day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, the machine dinged and Tent grabbed two vials. One vial was full and the other was half fill. That\u2019s how much he increased the dosage by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe uncapped the vials \u201cI hope this works.\u201d Then he drank both. They tasted rather bland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next week, Tent was getting the results he wanted. Bursting from 11ft3in to 12ft2in, some people were wondering how he grew so much. He smirked \u201cIts in my genes.\u201d Well, some of it was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Ben was flipping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen! Calm down! It\u2019s ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was pacing back and forth so fast, Amy was surprised there wasn\u2019t a gaping hole in the floor yet. \u201cYou call this ok?\u201d He pointed to a dash mark on the side of his door. It was 5in above the last mark. \u201cI\u2019m 12ft 7in now! What on earth is going on?!?!? I thought the orb was done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSo did I. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d She did another check on Ben and saw his new height was greater than before. \u201cIts not from the orb. I can see that much. Maybe your body is reacting to something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen punched him wall. It just barely didn\u2019t break open. \u201cThen what!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned \u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can. Try to stay calm!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed, and took a deep breath \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy put a hand on him \u201cI know. You don\u2019t want to be a giant, but we don\u2019t have any options. Now you\u2019re even more scared because we don\u2019t know the cause. Before, we knew it was the orb, but now it\u2019s a mystery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cLet me do another check. I\u2019ll broaden it a bit. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen calmed down a little \u201cOk\u201d. He sat down and waited for Amy to tell him when she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy began to chant slowly as she took care to pay extra attention to anything suspicious. She began to say small facts that popped into her head \u201cEnd Time is Still 21. The growth speeds up and then decreases till the end time. Suspected growth\u2026 unobtainable. Source of growth\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy tried to word it somehow \u201cA structure of molecules of some sort that is irritating your pituitary gland.\u201d Her eyes slowly stopped glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThe pituitary gland is the one that controls growing hormones right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded \u201cYah. Something is stimulating it, and its creating some type of hormone. Its like the original, but more effecting at its purpose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cCan we get rid of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy check with a spell \u201cIts infused itself into your pituitary gland. Removing it could potentially kill you. And the molecules it makes\u2026 its absorbs my mana and makes energy from it when I tried to move it away somewhere else. They have atoms of gravitum in them. Its strange. Though, thing on your pituitary gland is also made of gravitum. Eventually, the gravitum on the gland will all be consumed as its used to make those hormones. That\u2019s why you still stop growing at 21.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen groaned \u201cSo I\u2019m going to become more of a giant\u2026 Any idea how huge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy checked again \u201cIts not clear. Its like between 15ft and 25ft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen moaned \u201cPlease let it be 15 ft them. If I was 25ft, you\u2019d be just below my knee. I can\u2019t deal with that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw the pain this was giving Ben and she wished she could help. There had to be some type of spell or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts been another week and he\u2019s fired up. He check his height and saw it had shot up another foot making him a 13ft 2in. He was enjoying every moment. He loved the feel if his growing muscles.. He did even work out and they were bulking out on there own. It seemed like back at home that the manual labor forced his muscles to be more compact than they like, but here, all he need to ear, read, and study! So his muscles could expand as much as they wanted to. Tent was rubbing the great round bulk of bicep. It was like touching a perfect sphere that was 7in in radius. He gave it a kiss\u2026 \u201cIove my body.\u201d His bicep were bigger than his head, and his muscle still wanted to be larger now that there was nothing holding the back. Not mention his pride had caught on with the growth making it 25in long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s hand shook as he started making another mark on the wall. It jumped 10in now. Ben dropped the pencil\u2026 13ft5in. It was speeding up before it slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was basically growing proportionally now. That way his build is balance. He may or may not grow thicker, we\u2019ll see. Well, except for his python. It was 25in long, now it stretched to 27in 4in wide. The only reason he hides it so well is because of a gravitum pocket in his pants. Oh poor Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last week of Tent\u2019s growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent looked at Ben. \u201cHow is he still ahead of me!\u201d Then it hit him. He was the guy who took it. But still! Tent had taken another half does than Ben. That should have put him over the top by now. Being 14ft6in was pretty impressive, but it was still shorter than Ben!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to do something soon if he wanted to be able to look down on Ben. He only had a week of growing left before he had to wait till next year.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had made the school so that he\u2019d never have to worry about the ceiling ever again, but it was happening AGAIN! The third week since he drank the tainted smoothie, he was now 14ft10in. A 17in jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave up hope on being 15ft tall, and hoped to stop at 17ft. Amy would only reach mid thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent looked Ben at with frustration. He\u2019s going to have to take the risk if he wanted to top Ben. He walked into the main lab once again, and made another vial of the serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back to his room with the serum in his pocket. He looked at the solution. \u201cEither you solve all my problems, or you make me a quadriplegic. Please be the first choice.\u201d He popped the cap and drank the solution. A moment later, he fell to the ground having a seizure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Ben got out of bed. He could tell that something was off. He felt tight and stiff. The ceiling looked closer. Ben groaned. He didn\u2019t know why he bothered to check any more. He trudged up to his ever shrinking wall and drew the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16ft10in\u2026 a 24in increase\u2026 in one night. Ben punched the floor of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was he growing this much?!?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes he began to live his day as normally as possible because soon he wouldn\u2019t even be able to do that. He put his books and binders into his backpack. Then he changed his cloths. He put on a new pair of underwear, and stuffed his giant 29in cock inside a gravitum pocket he had sewed inside. Then he put on the rest of his cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent woke up slowly. Every part of his body ached. He was groaning as he got up slowly. His head pounded. His back creaked. He made his way to the bathroom to check himself out. When he got there, he looked in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent screams \u201cYES!!!!!!\u201d He goes against his wall and measures the change. \u201c16ft. There is no way Ben grew this much in a single night. I have to be taller than him today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent saw Ben and felt all his rage flare. \u201cBen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen turned around and saw Tent for the first time in a long time \u201cYou grew! So its not just me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent was fuming \u201cYou took it didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked quizzical \u201cWhat? What did I take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent yelled \u201cYou know **** well what you took. Its what\u2019s making you grow and beat me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen frowned \u201cLook. I didn\u2019t want this to happen. I woke up one day an I grew 5ins, then more the next, and now it the increase keeps growing! I can\u2019t stop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was going to vent his frustration now. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you lived. If it was a roofless society with giant everything that encouraged people to be huge, or what ever. Here, on earth, I can\u2019t visit a friend\u2019s house with out bending over and or kneeling to get around, I can\u2019t use the elevator, drive a car, or even go on a god **** roller coaster. Not because I\u2019m to short. No! I\u2019m to tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent looked at Ben angrily, but then he calmed down. Ben sincerely didn\u2019t like being that huge. He had no idea what some of those were or their importance for the matter. The colony he lived in was agricultural, and  small, so he could walked practically anywhere he wanted. There was no time to fool around have fun on those what-cha-ma-call-its\u2026 roller-toasters or something. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI don\u2019t, and I fish I did. Maybe I can neutralize it before I touch the roof of this school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smirked \u201cReally? I\u2019ve been looking forward to that actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen couldn\u2019t help a smile \u201cDo how did get so huge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cOh. Its how puberty works on my planet. He have huge spurts right after our birthday. We don\u2019t know why that is either, but it only happens to those who were born there, and not those who immigrated there. They also have to be their in the womb the whole time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI see. So its kind of encouraged?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smiled \u201cYah. Our social hierarchy is based on height. And over there, height is directly related to strength. As you can see through my cloths.\u201d Tent flex his giant bulbous arms. Nearly 2.5ft thick biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at it and gave it a punch. \u201cNot bad. Its pretty hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent frowned \u201cPretty hard? How are yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smirked. So this was turning into a dominance fight. Fine than\u2026 I accept your challenge. Maybe it\u2019s the hormones talking. Ben flexed his arms. They were half as thick as Tent, but about 5 times stronger. \u201cGive it your best go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent pulled back and gave it his hardest punch. Ben wasn\u2019t phased. He reached forward and tried to squeeze it until Ben submitted, but Ben stayed un-phased. \u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen released his flex \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cHow\u2019s yours harder than my bicep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOh, because yours is mostly size. These bad boys are so much denser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent thought about it. So he was losing in to categories. He looked at Ben defiantly once and walked away. Ben had won that challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stared as Tent walked away. Then Ben remembered him ranting about something \u201cTent! Wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent stood still \u201cWhat!\u201d He hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cWhat was it you were talking about. What did you think I took?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent looked at Ben \u201cYou were being serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cI can\u2019t live on earth like this. You get to go back to where ever and live perfectly fine. Over here, its harder to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent saw an opportunity to gain dominance. Though it was a weak victory if your opponent wanted to lose. Tent grunted \u201cFine. Follow me.\u201d Tent took him to the main lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cI made a compound that is similar to Testosterone and other growth hormones, but it used Gravitum instead of Carbon. That\u2019s why is so effective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at it \u201cSo is there a way to neutralize it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent shook his head \u201cNo, but we can speed it up so the growth time is shorter. If you want that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cSo say you were growing until you were 21. You could speed it up so its done in like, say a week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent nodded \u201cSomewhere along those lines.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about. It gave him less time to mope about when he would stop being huge. \u201cI think I\u2019d prefer that over the long term option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent nodded \u201cSo I\u2019ll get working on a compound that does that. You\u2019ll have to wait till I finish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThanks.\u201d Then he got curious \u201cWhat\u2019s this all about? It seems more than the fact that you like growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent scoffed \u201cIt\u2019s a competition to be the biggest, buffest, most dominant human alive. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m only speeding you along so that I know my final goal. I don\u2019t want to wait another year or two for you to finally end you slow earth growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cWell sorry! Not all life forms grow in month long spurts that happen yearly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cWhatever. I\u2019ll call you when its ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded. I can\u2019t stand watching myself grow for another year or two either. Lets make it a week, or a month.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is now the end of Tent\u2019s growth spurt for the year. He reached a peak of 17ft. And every time, when his growth spurt ends, he woke up with a tent. This time, it stuck up to a monstrous 35in and the pole was 5in thick. After he calmed down, it had gone to 28in long, 4in thick, with a pair of bowling balls. He was the second biggest human in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to Ben that his growth was starting to descend. Its peak was 2ft in a single night, but it dropped down to 1 foot by the end of the week. Now 17ft 10in tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cBen, how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cSincerely, I hate this height. My only hope now is that I can still walk under these 20ft ceiling when he gives my that solution of his. I can\u2019t deal with this any longer. I want it over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen lay on his couch right now. His feet hanging over the edge touching the floor. His right arm also touching the floor. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I have these cloths. Or would have been naked ages ago. I wonder how tent is getting his cloths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cHe actually makes his own. Nowen explained how that if any teens wanted cloths, they had to make them since the older people didn\u2019t have the time or resources to do it. So most of their teens had the skill to weave or sew makeshift cloths that are fairly durable. If they had time, they\u2019d make something nicer, but they usually wait till they are done growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought that was kind of interesting \u201cMaybe I should show them how to weave Gravitum. One size fits all, and it has any design with in reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea. But they\u2019ll need a got of gravitum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Suddenly the Ben Ten Theme Song began to play*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen pick up his phone, and tried to press the answer button, but his finger was to big. \u201cGrr..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw this and helped out \u201cHere. Let me see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen handed her his phone. She answered \u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cHello, is Ben there? The solution is made, and ready. He can stop by when ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThanks. Bye.\u201d She turned to Ben \u201cHe says its ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cWant to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and followed behind Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cSo this is basically a catalyst. It speeds up the production of the growth hormones until all the gravitum is used up. At that point, your body should be done growing naturally. Also, if you are wondering, the gravitum is timed and synced with the end time of your natural growth. Once the gravitum is gone, your growth spurt ends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cOk then. Lets give this a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Tent cautiously \u201cHow much are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smiled \u201c99%. The only possible thing that could go wrong is that the Synthesizer messed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Ben \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t wait?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cNot if I want to keep my grades up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy secretly cast a spell check for poison and other dangerous things. The solution was safe from that. \u201cOk. Fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at the pale blue solution and downed it. He looked at Tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cAlright. You should start to feel the speed up in an hour. It should be done by the end of the week. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see how far you grow. Considering you are already sloping down on your growth, I suspect it to be around 19 or 20 ft tall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded and left with Amy in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later, what Tent said was true. He felt his body start to ache and grow hungry like mad. He ran to his overstocked fridge and started to eat anything he could get his hands on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was sitting in a chair keeping an eye on Ben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he ate, Ben fell straight to sleep. Amy stayed up that Friday night to see how Ben went. She called Gwen over to help her stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen \u201cI was wondering when you would get call me over. Ben\u2019s been growing a lot. Nick is complaining again. Though he did seem happy about the 20lbs of muscle he put on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cAt least he\u2019s happy about it. Ben is a different story. He\u2019s speeding it up just to make it end faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard Ben moan and watched him. He began to rub himself. As he did that, his large muscles bulked up some more and he gained 5 inches in height. If his engorged penis were out of the pocket, it would be a fiery rod about 40inches long with over grown cantaloupe for balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis happened a few more times that night, but with smaller numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, he was 18ft 7in. He looked around, he saw Amy sleeping on his torso. She barely covered half of his upper body, but he didn\u2019t care and neither did she. Suddenly, the room vibrated as Ben\u2019s stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s head shot up from the sound coming beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen felt a pang of pain in his stomach. He was starving! He picked Amy up and put her down, and then ran to his fridge. He was pretty sure he emptied it out last night, but it was full now. Someone tipped off the principal that their number 1 benefactor was going through a hunger phase, and needed to be restocked every 12hrs. Ben reached in and grabbed plates full of prepared spaghetti. He ate about 15 of those, and then moved onto the 12 plates of sandwiches, and finally he inhaled all 20 bowls of dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw the horror of how the food entered Ben\u2019s gullet and landed in his stomach. His stomach would bulge out from the food, and when you think he was done, his inhuman metabolism burned it all away to fuel his up coming growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the fridge was empty, Ben licked one last bowl clean and crawled back to his couch lazily, and fell back asleep. Immediately, he moaned and rubbed himself as grew 3 inches taller and bulkier</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tent decided to check on Ben since it was partly his fault that Ben was at a size he never wanted to be at. When he got to Ben\u2019s dorm, all he heard was the sound of dozens of plates clattering as one magically fell on top of another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he knocked, someone came to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stuck her head out \u201cOh. Hey Tent. Why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent sighed \u201cI heard the school had started to take food from the kitchen to feed him. Its day 5 I believe. 2 more to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cYah. He\u2019s barely conscious enough to talk to me. He just eats, sleeps, and grows, and eats and grows more. I just can\u2019t wait for it to be over. Oh, and you estimate seems right. Its slowed down significantly. He\u2019s about 19ft 8in now. I think he\u2019ll reach 20ft by the end of all this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent frowned and sighed \u201cAh well, so much for being the dominant one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cI ran some calculations and my next growth spurt will be 4in. If I use the serum, I\u2019ll get to 19ft. Then the next year, its 1in, and 4in with the serum. Then eventually its insignificant. I\u2019ll always be smaller than him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned \u201cYou know that there are other ways of earning respect, right? Like using that brain of yours. Do you know how many lives you can help if you put that noggin to some public use? You\u2019d be famous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent froze. Back on his planet, everything was size. Knowledge was a side though, but it was worth bragging about on very rare occasions. Now that he actually had a more than decent brain, he felt less needy of his height and strength to gain dominance. Wait\u2026 its not dominance he wanted. He wanted to feel important. \u201cAmy\u2026 you know what? I think you are very right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cOf course I am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent laughed \u201caren\u2019t you getting a little cocky now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy scrunched her face \u201cNope. I\u2019m stating facts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent \u201cUmm can I come in? I need to check on Ben\u2019s status. It sounds like he\u2019s just inhaling food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cThat\u2019s all the observation you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent paused \u201cOk then. I\u2019ll just go and come back when he\u2019s feeling himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cLucky.\u201d Then she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later, and about $15,000 dollars worth of food, Ben was back to his usual self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed. \u201cLooks like the people I told to build this place added a couple of inches to the ceiling.\u201d Ben was now exactly 20ft tall. His hair was just barely touching the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled to see the old Ben return, personality wise. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cI\u2019ve never felt better. The sudden drop in hunger probably means I\u2019m done growing, and that\u2019s more than I could ask for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy craned her neck to look at Ben. She only reached his knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was the orb going to get them to have kids?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock and Amy went to get the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent was standing there. \u201cWow! Twenty feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded sadly \u201cYah. Though they mess up my room, and it\u2019s a little taller than 20ft, so I can stand up straight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smiled \u201cThat\u2019s good! Now you may want to pay for your food. The kitchen is panicking about the loss of \u00be of their inventory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nodded \u201cThanks. How much did I eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gagged \u201cImagine this. Stuffing two plates of pasta down at the same time every 5 seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen imagined it and them a flood of memories hit him. He fell back causing the whole dormitory to shake \u201cEh\u2026 sorry Amy. It was kind of excessive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cJust a bit, but them again, when your stomach growled loud enough for \u00be of the student body to hear, then you know that someone\u2019s hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at Tent \u201cSo I\u2019m done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent nodded \u201cAs done as you can be.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A fraction of his calf muscle was bigger than Amy herself. He simply radiated power. If you stood next to him, the heat his body gave off was enough to eventually melt an iceberg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was bout 5ft wide. His arms, legs, chest were a few feet thick, and each of his 8 packs were big enough for Amy to curl up and sleep on one, though she usually ended up on the ridges between the abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Amy left, Ben went to change into his usual t-shirt and cargo shorts. When he changed his briefs, what he pulled out made him shake with fear and excitement. The thing about the accelerated growth was that it lengthened his python to a length twice of what it should have been. Now hanging below his knees, it swung with a deadly power. Ben stared at his flaccid 6ft long cock. How was he ever going to have kids! Then he saw his jewel sack and it held two giant inflatable exercise balls. Ben was astounded by it size. And they thought Seth was big for his size. Well check this out. Ben began to stuff his larger cock into the pocket of his next pair of briefs. He had to stretch the gravitum around so it could get around his 2ft thick flaccid shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked into the halls and began making his way to class. The students were shocked. No human grew that much in 7 days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne alien, a four arms walked up to Ben \u201cHey. What are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourarms \u201cNo human grows like you. You\u2019re like 14ft above their standards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen scratched his head as he though, then he said in a deep bass tone \u201cHehe\u201d He chuckled \u201cI really don\u2019t know. It kind of just happened. Sorry, but I have to get to class.\u201d Ben said bye and left. As he got to the arch, he ducked and passed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cIt seems like they made the whole school a bit over 20ft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked up at Ben and suddenly fell backwards from how much he had to crane his neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on! I leave for 5-6 months and you go and grow twice your height!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was defensive \u201cHey! I didn\u2019t ask for this. And besides. It was only 8ft. That 4ft short of twice my height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth roared \u201cSO!?!?! You just grew more than I have my enter life!\u201d (minimum size)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly giggle and whispered into Seth\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat? How on earth do you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly smiled mischievously \u201cCall it a women\u2019s intuition, but you can tell by his posture and how deep his voice is compared to his size that he\u2019s way bigger than he should be for that size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was sitting on Ben\u2019s right shoulder because it was enough for her to sit on now. She was messing with Ben\u2019s giant head of hair, though it was proportional to his last hair cut. Ben\u2019s head was a few feet thick and tall, etc (I can\u2018t really describe a head. Just say that it\u2018s grown proportional to his body, ok?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what Molly said, even she started to wonder where Ben\u2019s giant bulge was. It wasn\u2019t showing up in his pants anymore. When he ran, it used to shake, but now it was flat. She decided to asked it quietly, but Seth beat her to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cBen, where\u2019s your dick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen recoiled from the question causing Amy to lose her balance. She grabbed onto Ben\u2019s ear and hair to straighten herself. \u201cUmm\u2026 I sewed a gravitum pocket into my briefs, and I put it in there. It kept getting in the way when I walked or ran. And it rubbed against my cloths like crazy, so it kind of got stimulated while I ran. I couldn\u2019t take it, so I did what I needed to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cOh\u2026 I see. So\u2026 how big is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to answer that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a Purple/white flash, and Molly gasped \u201cOh God! Its huger than I thought! Its got to be longer than I am tall!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth yelled \u201cWhat! You used a spell to find out?!?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly smiled \u201cWell we all wanted to know. I just happened to be the first to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ben\u2019s doors open as Nick and Gwen join them. Nick and Seth started doing their high school hand shake, and their other friendship quirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cYou gained more muscle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smirked and flexed his 45in bicep \u201cYup. It\u2019s a beauty right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled and then sighed \u201cYah\u2026 I grew to. Luckily, Molly can still take me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grimaced \u201cHow so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201c25in long 6in wide. Bowling balls.\u201d He points to the massive bulk between his legs. \u201cI might just start doing what Ben does and put a gravitum pocket into my briefs. I\u2019ll probably have to ware regular ones during competitions since most of the judges are gay, and this helps me win big time. Well that, and my large muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen sighed \u201cThe first thing we do when we all come back together is have a sausage talk? Really guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen decided this was enough time indoors and he started pushing his friends out the door and into the central pentagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you heard was \u201cBen! Stop shoving. Stop it! Giant on the move! Get out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cI feel like we should take a trip to\u2026 *loud earth shaking rumble* \u2026 a trip to the cafeteria. Lets go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the field pick up the things they had dropped from the minor earthquake, and watched at Ben ran into the kitchen. The kitchen was still recovering from Ben\u2019s last emergency entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cGwen\u2026 could you cast that spell you put on Zeke, so that Ben can eat a little less? He\u2019s the biggest source of world hunger right now, so can you make it so his body converts every atom he eats into energy. That way he fills up faster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded and Ben quickly covered in a purple haze that vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stormed into the kitchen and all the cooks were in a frenzy. They had just begun cooking and barely had enough food to feed the school and Ben right now. They managed to get him about 20 plates of food (1/20 of what he ate last time), and then he said \u201cThanks. I\u2019m full now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cooks and chefs all stared as Ben let out a deep earth shaking belch, and then leave. They all cheered. \u201cHe won\u2019t obliterate our inventory today. Awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nowen\u2019s body was reacting weirdly to earth\u2019s sun light, and he found himself in another growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen walked up to Tent \u201cCan I have one of your growth serums?  Kind of want to get the most out of this last growth spurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent smiled and said \u201cSure\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLets say that by the end of the month, instead of being 11ft tall, he got to 18ft tall. (He snuck in once to make another dose without anyone knowing, so he got bigger than he should have).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following two years were relatively uneven full, though the science building did catch fire a couple times in a metal burning experiment. It was quite exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe summer prior to senior year, all the students at the university went home and caught up on old times, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ben got home, he had warned his parents about his new size. They had yet to see him since he left, so they weren\u2019t quite ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood staring at his house\u2019s roof. They were the same height\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHey mom\u2026 dad. I kind of grew. I told you about it right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom and dad just looked up trying to see their son. They were standing in his massive shadow as he blocked the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cWow! You got big\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned and started to cry onto dad\u2019s shoulder. Dad started to calm her down. \u201cHow are we supposed to keep him in the house? When he left, he could just barely fit in his room, but now he can\u2019t even get into the house! How am I supposed to give him a roof and cook him a meal if it won\u2019t fill him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cMom, it doesn\u2019t take much to satisfy me now. (Gwen used the spell about a dozen more times. The moment something enters his stomach, it is literally torn apart into energy). Maybe a large bowl or two, and I\u2019ll be set. The larger you are, the better you body uses the energy it takes in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom perked up \u201cThen I\u2019ll make a feast anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. Even though it doesn\u2019t take much to satisfy him, a feast might possibly fill him for a brief second. \u201cAwesome. Now\u2026 lets see what I can do about housing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad snapped his fingers \u201cOh right! So you know the plumbers right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was surprised \u201cYou know the plumbers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled \u201cKnow about them? I was one of them! Still am actually, but in temporary retirement.\u201d He pulled a badge out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cThis is awesome! My dad was a plumber and I never knew it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed \u201cHey! don\u2019t forget me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was astonished \u201cHow did you guys keep yourself out of space?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad \u201cWe had a son, and we let him take care of it. And you wonder why we didn\u2019t flip out when you started to grow like crazy in high school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about it \u201cThat\u2019s a\u2026 good point actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled \u201cWell, I guess we could hide you in our hidden bunker. I mean let you stay there. That way you have a place to come home to.\u201d Then she got serious \u201cYOu are done right? With your growing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cI hope so. If I grow anymore, I might as well live on the planet of the Waybigs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled and laughed it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back, they had their senior year, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTent was not a published undergrad who was on his way toward a Nobel Peace Prize for his studies into super hormones, and other stimulating hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowen got voted mechanic of the year for 3 straight years. He constructed a car out of old parts in about and hour and a half, and he saved a large jet from crashing by fixing its engine mid flight. That got his a lot of publicity. He\u2019s not advertising for mechanic school and repair companies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraduation was intense. There were transport points set up all over the universe. Anyone who wanted to come could come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen rented out OOPS, for free actually, to hold the ceremony. The planet was completely packed. Billions of giant holograms were set up every where to make sure everyone could see the graduating class. The students who left were more independent, smarter, and highly resourceful. If they ever needed anything, they could get the school, and or the entire student body involved. It was like a giant plumber training organization that gave you all the skills you will ever need. (One year of intensive hand to hand combat was required so that you were fit when you left, and knew how to defend yourself).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was wearing robe of odd shapes and sizes. Some with 8 arm holes, some with two neck holes, some that were made of ghost matter because the alien would phase through solid matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen went up and gave his speech as founder. Amy, Gwen and Tent went up as valedictorians because by the end of the year, they were doing everything to get ahead of the other, and they ended up tying! When it was time to throw their hats in the air, some giant mechanical machine shot millions of tons of fireworks into the air and set them off. OOPS was officially a star for 20 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia screamed \u201cBen!!!! Stop growing! How am I supposed to have grandkids now!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s face flared red \u201cMOM!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s was unable to respond \u201cUh\u2026 Will it help to say I\u2019m done growing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia flipped and went into crazy \u201cCrazy lady who really want to meat her grandkids\u2019 mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked down and Amy, and she looked up. They spoke with heir minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cShe seems a little more high strung than before. Did something happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think she\u2019s afraid that you will hurt or squish me if we tried to have kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cBut we aren\u2019t even married yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled \u201cYet? What makes you think I\u2019ll say yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gang, at age 22 now, were all at the world\u2019s only 6 star restaurant, and yes. They were that good. Gwen had luckily book a date 15 years ago back in elementary school (and had asked to book the whole restaurant and they said ok for some reason. It was her check book. Not theirs.). They had brought family and friends, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked up in his three piece suit carrying Amy on his shoulder. Her new shoes have not touched the ground yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cIts nice that Gwen book this so long ago. I can\u2019t believe that wait time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laughed \u201cWell it is 6 stars out of 5. They must be doing something right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked lightly on the ground hoping not to make a disturbance. Luckily, he was only 250lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were shocked by the structure of the restaurant. The doors were 50ft high and the eating are was just enormous. The had an entire skyscraper devoted to just chefs, and a whole building for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was empty since Gwen rent the whole thing be accident. Behind Ben were hundreds dozens of cars. Maybe 500 guest total. They had a lot of friends. The workers at the place saw Ben and almost fainted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cars beeped at their alarms went off. Dogs barked in alarm. Ben\u2019s face was red as he held a hand over his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the workers fainted. The owner came out to see the problem and then he too almost fainted. However, he was to hardcore for that he told himself. \u201cHello! Wealthy diners. Welcome to the promised land.\u201d Then he pulled a rope and the giant 50ft doors opened outward. (He wasn\u2018t freaking out about consumption because he was given a 3million dollar check before hand, and if they went over the number, they\u2018d pay that too.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was sitting at a table made of mana, and on his table was another table for his friends to sit at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick scoffed \u201cThis is ridiculous! Ben, your table is so big we can walk, dance, or anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cHey! You guys take up more than half the table any way. Its fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted up there while their parents talked about their kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen\u2019s parents (I\u2018ll call BM for mom and BD for dad)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen\u2019s parents (GM and GD)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cThey grow up so fast! I just hope that I can get grandkids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBM \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Have you heard of the Plumbers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia sighed \u201cIntergalactic space cops? My husband was one.\u201d She raised his badge. \u201cI never told Amy that he was sucked into a black hole diverting a meteor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBD choked a bit \u201cYou were his wife! He was my college buddy! He never told me he got married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cWe didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBM \u201cWell, if they can\u2019t have kids the normal way, then they could just implant it a different way. Its not to hard, and if you want, they could splice their genes together, and incubate it inside an egg cell. That\u2019s another way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept chatting nonchalantly about other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGM \u201cHey BM, is it more or do out kids have the same appearance as when they were 18. Minus Ben\u2019s giant growth, it seems like they are all the same as when they were 18. Though, some of them need to shave more often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia \u201cI noticed that. Either I\u2019m getting near sighted, or they haven\u2019t aged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dads were trying to get their wives on another topic \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood up from his table, and pushed his mother of all rice cakes away a bit. He coughed to et everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cExcuse me everyone, but I\u2019 have to do something I\u2019ve been planning to do for the past 9-10 years. The moment I saw this person, I knew she\u2019d be the one for me. We hung around for a while and then we got a little closer. I\u2019ll spare the details. But in high school, we were declared friends. It was the longest and more torturous time of my life, but I waited. Then hallelujah! We were back together again, and life was beautiful. We\u2019ve been together ever since, and I\u2019ve never been happier.\u201d He gave a glance at Amy who was staring wide eyed, but praying expectantly. \u201cI want to make it permanent. I want to be with her forever and a day. And to symbolize this with a question.\u201d He turned to Amy and pulled out a small box. He opened it with a finger because he\u2019d be practicing to do it with his giant hands \u201cAmy Wong, Queen of Kindness and Ruler of my heart, will you marry me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was crying tears of joy. Luckily she had put on water proof mascara because she expect a lot of steam to come off her soups and etc. \u201cYES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that exact moment, everything I the universe felt happier and more peaceful. Her white healing mana was vibrating and giving off joy and peace where ever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and place a platinum ring with the most geometrically perfect diamond as its center peace on Amy\u2018s finger. In the diamond were flecks of dense green diamond which gave it a star like appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at it under the light and it felt like what ever light was going in, was also coming out twice a radiant. The white light entered the small stone and came out flashing white with small beams of green brilliance. She ran and jumped off the table landing on Ben\u2019s chest. She gave him the biggest bear hug she could as she cried with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia and BM were crying tears of joy and pride. BD was smiling the widest he ever had since Ben was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other guest were awestruck by the display on the diamond, but that made them cheer even harder. Some of them were aliens disguised as humans currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Seth were shocked, but happy for him. Then they turned to their gals and they worried. How were they going to top this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner was being affect by Amy\u2019s happy mana so much that the owner called in every wedding designer he knew and a priest. He order and planned a whole wedding to be held her in 2hrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, the large gates opened, and teams of people were sent charging in with bouquets, flowers, streamers. There was a 20 layer cake being made. One layer for each foot Ben was tall. Tables were cleared and a gorgeous platform was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at Ben wondering \u201cDid you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shook his head but smiled \u201cIt was supposed to be next week, but now is just a good a time as any. I\u2018ll pay the owner back later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the teams and workers were so focused that they had totally disregarded Ben\u2019s presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was changed into a pure white dress with the tail cloth thingy trailing 50ft behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriest looked at his book because he was to tired of craning his neck \u201cDo you, Ben Tennyson, take Amy Wong, in sickness and in\u2026, to be your loftily  beloved wife?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen simply beamed with joy \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriest \u201cDo you Amy Wong\u2026 Take Ben Tennyson to be your loftily beloved husband?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s mana was still giving off her happy energy \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPriest \u201cBy the power invested in me. I declare you man and wife! You may now kiss the bride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen picked Amy up to his fullest height and Amy gave him a kiss. Sadly\u2026 Ben\u2019s lips were huge like his body, so he settled and tried to avoid her eyes when he pecked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and knew that it wasn\u2019t the best kiss in the world, but Amy wouldn\u2019t care.

Doesn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy growled at Ben \u201cJust give me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen gave her the plate and backed far away. He was afraid\u2026 very\u2026 truly\u2026 afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cAH!!! That\u2019s so adorable! She\u2019s going to look so cute in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled \u201cReally? I hoped you\u2019d like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly \u201cWell, Gwen picked it out for her. I picked this out for him!\u201d She showed Amy a small I piece footy pajama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy tried to imagine the baby in it. \u201cHe\u2019ll looks adorable!\u201d Then the boy woke up again. \u201cBen!!!!!!!!!!!! He\u2019s awake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a thundering of footsteps as Ben ran up the stairs with another plate of meat. He gave it to Amy, and dragged all the women out of the room besides Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia glared at Ben \u201cBen! Why did you do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was shaking from fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia looked at Ben quizzically \u201cBen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cDon\u2019t ask. Please\u2026\u201d He sounded desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen and Molly watched Ben carefully. The 20ft giant really was afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was yelling \u201cPush! Push!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was screaming as she tried to bring new life into the world. The necklace around her neck was flaring as it tried to ease the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor \u201cIts almost\u2026 ok. She\u2019s out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s arms fell limp and as she panted and breathed. Ben had paid a team of doctors and nurses to be at the house for the whole last month. He wanted to be able to go into the room and see his children after they came into being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was sitting on a chair twiddling his thumbs, biting his lets. He had already whittled a dozen wooden toys while he was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse came out smiling \u201cBen. Come please. She wants to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen stood up and followed the nurse. He could have ran ahead, but the nurse gave him a cold glare as soon as the thought entered his mind. She opened the giant doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was holding a baby in both arms. She whispered her expectations and hopes to them as they lay there. She looked up when Ben came and asked him to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walked over gently, which seemed impossible, and he kneeled by his wife, and two children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cLook at her. Her eyes are so focus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and saw that his daughter was looking at him with her rich, earthy brown eyes. Then he saw how pudgy his son is \u201cHow big is our son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cHe was born first, and he broke the record for the heaviest baby ever born. The doctor looked it up. Must have been all the meat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard that and felt a shiver run up his spine. \u201cYah\u2026 must have been the meat. Oh look! She\u2019s falling asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cShh\u2026 they\u2019re sleeping now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cumm\u2026\u201d He was hesitant with this request. \u201cCould I, um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled. She knew Ben was gentle enough. His size was just intimidating. Besides, his skin was soft when he wanted it to be, and hard like diamond when he was fighting. Right now, he\u2019s probably have skin as soft as a pillow just to keep the kids safe. \u201cHere, let me help. Give me your hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen nervously put his hand in front of her. She place The boy in his right and the girl I his left. They were so tiny. Not bigger than the last digit on his pinky finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse came up with two clip boards \u201cWhat do you want to name them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy looked at each other. They had already come up with some names \u201cThe boy is Kevin Praeses Tennyson, and the girl is Jenny Aequus Tennyson\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note: Praeses is Latin for guardian, chief, etc*<br>\r\n*Note: Aequus is Latin for patient, fair, equal, just, etc*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard a massive amount of footsteps coming up the stairs. They were stopped by a nurse of something, and the footsteps quieted down. The door opened slowly. Not a single squeak since Ben oiled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZia stepped in first and saw Ben kneeling over smiling at his two babies. Gwen. Nick, Molly, and Seth followed quickly behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cShh\u2026 they\u2019re sleeping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir late comers tip-toed over. And looked into Ben\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smirked \u201cOf course the boy is going to be the largest baby ever born. Am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen made a face, but he didn\u2019t care. All he wanted to do was protect these two tiny humans as much as he wanted to protect Amy. At that moment, the white orb around Amy\u2019s neck flashed as it changed its first command to match Ben\u2019s new desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly smiled \u201cThe girl\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cJenny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick \u201cAnd the boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen saw in a quite, but deep voice \u201cKevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kevin opened his eyes and focused on Ben. Kevin\u2019s eyes were the most brilliant and most emerald like green he had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cAren\u2019t they getting cold being out like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled. Even from a distance, she could feel the warmth coming from Ben\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t need to worry about that for the kids, but she still wanted to hold them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen panicked a little and asked Amy to hold them again. He would mess up some how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen now leaned over. His giant necklace looming over them (it had grown with him thanks to the orb).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Ben and Amy\u2019s orbs glowed lightly as they recognized the babies as the children of their owners. Then Kevin glowed green slightly, and Jenny glowed white as a connection was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Ben could tell that the orbs meant no harm and just smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How long have you been planning it? Where did you get this diamond? Wh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen put a finger on her mouth \u201cI started planning as soon as we were out of college, but I had ideas since 6th grade. I got the diamond a couple hundred miles below the earth. I squeezed coal and bits of iron together while I was unsealed. I ran it under some tests, and its is perfectly flat on the surfaces that I cut. Not a single blemish. Are you happy with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took his giant finger away \u201cYes.\u201d She leaned in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had rented a tricked out barn that was made into one giant room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Ben were on a giant\u2019s Bed, at Ben\u2019s request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy twirled her fingers on Ben\u2019s chest making him shiver slightly from his arousal. Amy slowly got undressed, and Ben followed suite. He had never seen this much of Amy before, and his 6ft pipe hardened into a 10ft long 3ft wide pole. Amy looked at it with defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen laid where he was moaning and wait. Amy pounced, and Ben moaned louder. His cock swayed as Amy tried to get Ben off. She heard his balls churning with all the cum he was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to stoke and tease Ben\u2019s hyper sensitive organ, and he whine and whimpered. Then she decided to let him have it. She rubbed her massive breasts against his hardened  staff and he nearly cummed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy began to climb. The higher she got, the more sensitive Ben got. She grabbed his tight skin and pulled herself up top onto the head of his rod. Her feet sending waves of pleasure down his shaft telling his balls its was time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt herself get pushed into the air as his pressure along lifted her. It worked its way into her pliable cave. His baby batter began to mix with her yeast, and this will give rise to Kevin and Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell slowly. Her necklace slowing her decent. When she landed, she was soaked in cum, but lost in pleasure. She never felt this way before\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen had almost lost it some time ago. If he did, the barn would have been destroyed. Instead, he grabbed at the giant mattress and tore at it as pleasure ate away at his mind. Now he was slumped against a wall. His balls were deflated, and his rod was flaccid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHaving fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cThis is the best honeymoon spot in the world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled. He knew how people said they kissed under the moonlight, but he chose to eat and kiss under the earth light. They were on the moon. He smiled watching Amy, when he saw acting a little different. She was craving meat like never before! She ate more than he did. \u201cAre you ok? I didn\u2019t know you liked meat that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled between bites \u201cNeither did I until I tasted it. I don\u2019t know. I just developed a craving for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled and handed her another plate\u2026 and another plate\u2026 another plate. Ben started to worry. He was running out of plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cNext please.\u201d She wait for the next plate, but it didn\u2019t come. \u201cBen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at her slightly worried. \u201cY-y-yes Amy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cWhere\u2019s the next plate???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cWe\u2019re out.\u201d He wish he\u2019d never said that. If sound could travel without air, then everyone on earth would have woken up to the screaming of a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was this house on the outskirt of a suburban town. It had 4 bedroom: one master, two kids, and a guest. It had a kitchen, a living room, a stair case leading up stairs and one leading down to the basement, and 2 bathrooms. It had hard wood flooring, a chimney, and a grand piano that had rather intricate carvings on it. It was like any other house, except for minor things. First off, it was about 5 times larger than a normal house. The ceilings of each room was 30ft high. Each room was big enough to be a school gym, and had a HUGE Chair in each room. There was a giant who lived here, and his name was Ben Tennyson. With him was his wife, Amy, and their two kids, Kevin and Jenny (both 11 and turning 12 by the time they get to school).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tennyson were known around town for their kindness and willingness to help the community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was summer now, and the family was getting ready for vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cDid you two go to the bathroom yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen and Kev chimed \u201cYes mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled, it was a smile of a youthful eighteen year old, but she\u2019s actually 32 (don\u2019t tell her I told you). \u201cOk. Ok. Lets get ready. Dad will be home soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, also 32 looked like he was an 18 year old body builder blown into a 20ft tall figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev \u201cHey! Its dad!\u201d He pointed down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen \u201cWhere! Oh! I see him.\u201d She waved frantically trying to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled through the beard he grew to look a little old, and it worked some what. He saw his daughter and waved back as he was walking through the woods. \u201cHey, sorry I took so long, but I was getting the place ready. You guys wanna get going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev and Jen were jumping and pulling on their dad\u2019s cargo shorts. Ben picked them up, one in each hand and put then on his head, and then he got his wife and put her on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat on his shoulder peacefully. She was used to looking at things from this height now. Ken and Jen were laughing as they played in Ben\u2019s giant hairs. He let them since he knew they\u2019d eventually grow to big to play in them at all, plus he didn\u2019t mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cOk. Hang on ok? I\u2019m about to start walking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all clung to Ben\u2019s body now, and he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev chimed as his dad walked. \u201cOne day, I want to be big like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cReally now? Did you know that being this big isn\u2019t all that great?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen chimed in \u201cWhy dad? Don\u2019t you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cIts good to play with you, but I can\u2019t go on roller coasters or going to anyone\u2019s homes to say hi anymore. I\u2019m to big. You understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev thought about it with his 10yo logic. \u201cBut being bigger means your in charge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen \u201cAnd you make less poll-ooh-shun\u201d She tries saying the word so it came out right. \u201cPollution.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cShe\u2019s putting that vocabulary calendar to good use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYah\u2026 I just need to walk everywhere. Cars are mean little things that cause global warming right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen jumped \u201cYah! They are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev \u201cSee? Being big helps the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cIt sure does, but its not to fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev \u201cI don\u2019t need fun! I want to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen paused \u201cDid I here that right? You don\u2019t need fun. Ok then Lets go back home. No more fun vacations.\u201d Ben started to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev freaked \u201cWait! I lied. I don\u2019t need a lot of fun, but I need my vacation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cOk then. Make up your mind already.\u201d So they continued to their little vacation spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, they all slept around a campfire. Ben and Amy were talking since their kids were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cRemember the deal I made with the orb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cYah, I do. Its almost that time isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sniffed \u201cThey\u2019re growing up so fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cKev is a lot stronger than the other kids, and he eats like a buffet everyday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cThe first month or so, I was so glad the hearthstone made it so I could breast feed for hours. Kevin could stop! When I pulled away, he started crying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHe loves his milk. Though Jen was a little easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cShe started on the solid food a little earlier than Kev, but not to much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy stared at their kids. \u201cYou think they will ever take their seals off accidentally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cIts bound to happen someday. When they do, we\u2019ll know. My spell will tell us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cKev is as strong as an adult without his seal, and Jen\u2019s mana is huge, but its not stable. What happens when they hit puberty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI don\u2019t know. We know Kev is going to get those 3 ft. that you didn\u2019t want, and Jen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cMight turn out to be a goddess like you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cMaybe. The boys in her class are going to go crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cHow bout Kev? He\u2019s bound to get the attention of a few girl with the muscles he got from my genes, and his you know what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed \u201cI hope they stay innocent through all that. None of that gang stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cOr drugs. And if I see a boy with Jen and he\u2019s\u2026 oh he\u2019ll wish\u2026\u201d Ben saw the smirk Amy had. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYou\u2019re turning into one of those fathers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen paused \u201cSo?!?!? I love my little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cEnough that it\u2019ll drive her away from you if you don\u2019t lighten up a bit. Be protective, but not overly possessive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen defended himself \u201cBut that\u2019s who I am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned \u201cSo if I left you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cI\u2019d rip the other guy a part probably.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy recoiled \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smirked \u201cNo\u2026 I would\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I would do. I can\u2019t think of it ever happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kev and Jen shuddered. The fire had gone out and they were getting cold. Ben laid down and set them on his chest. Amy laid on his chest holding onto her two little angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, while they slept, Kev and Jen\u2019s necklaces (The seals their parent put on them) glowed signaling the start of something.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is anyone hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Jen and Kev woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev rubbed the sleep from his eyes, but he paused. \u201cHey mom\u2026 am I dreaming, or is my arm bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded \u201cYah\u2026 your arms are bigger alright. Maybe twice as big as yesterday.\u201d (which was basically like all other kids. No definition). Today was different. Kev actually had a decent bicep. He pecs pushed half an inch off his body. He had a faint 6 pack. His legs were a little thicker and it looked like he could swim 20 laps in a pool relatively easy. He\u2019d grow a foot taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was listening to the conversation. So, Kev grew. Ben sighed\u2026 his kid just entered puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen asked \u201cMom? What are these called again?\u201d She pointed to her more inflated chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned around and saw her daughter had grown boobs! \u201cJenny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen heard that and instantly knew both kids had entered puberty. Curse the orbs\u2026 Ben picked his family off his chest and brought placed them on the ground. He saw what Amy yelled about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis son was kind of like him. Its august\u2026 just about the same time Ben had found the orb, and it had grown him. Kev and his body matched pretty well at that age, though Kev was a year older than Ben was when the orb entered Ben\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was busy explaining the purpose and use of her daughter\u2019s new above average assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his son and saw that he sported an actual bulge in his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen and Amy looked at each other. \u201cTime for a chat with out kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cYou take Kevin. I\u2019ll take Jenny. Meet back here when you\u2019re done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev \u201cDad? What on earth is going on? How did I grow like this?\u201d He said sitting on Ben\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. I\u2019m trying to find a nice place to tell it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev \u201cOh. Why aren\u2019t you sharing it with Jenny too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYour mom is going to tell her. What I need to tell you applies only to you like what you mom tells Jen. Now tell me if you see an open areas I can sit in. This is going to take a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev stood up and climbed on top of Ben\u2019s head. He squinted his eyes in the day light as he looked. \u201cOver there. On top of the hill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen spotted it and went thundering over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen leaned back against the small hill, and let his son lay on his thigh. \u201cOk. Are you comfy yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev nodded \u201cUh-huh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed as he got into the mood \u201cIt began at this mineral facility during august just before 6th grade\u2026 (read storyline from before for details)\u2026 Your mom did the only thing that was reasonable. She bargained with the orb, and the orb agreed to keep 3ft off my height and give it to my son later on when he hits puberty. Sadly, when I went to college, some nasty Anodites played a dirty prank that went terribly wrong, and it caused me to grow to this height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark now. The stars were rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev was staring wide eyed at his dad \u201cSo you\u2019re a Plumber? And you have this orb thing that makes you grow to infinity? Can I see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cWhat\u2019s the magic word?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev smiled a big toothy grin \u201cPlease!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled \u201cOk, fine.\u201d Ben tapped his now 9in diameter medallion. There was a flash of green, and a strange green orb popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev looked at it curiously \u201cIts like I\u2019m looking at the universe, but from the outside instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought about that. \u201cYah. That\u2019s kind of true, but what you see isn\u2019t this universe. It\u2019s mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev \u201cWhat! You have your own universe? Can I see it\u2026 Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen chuckled deeply \u201cOk. Fine, but only because your mom is letting Jen see hers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev \u201cWhat! Mom has one to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cYup. Now lets get in mine before I change my mind.\u201d In a flash, they both disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev stared into deep green space. The air made his muscles tingle. \u201cWhy do my muscles feel weird. Its like they are growing, but they aren\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his son, and tried to think of a reason. Maybe because Kev\u2019s related to Ben, that the orb is making Kev grow in a similar pattern as Ben. \u201cI think your muscles are getting denser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev tilted his head questioningly \u201cDenser?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cThink about your muscles growing, but someone squishes it so its smaller. Someone is making you grow, but they squish it back into your body so you don\u2019t get to big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev looked wide eyed and he looked at his muscles. He gave one a squeeze, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cAm I going to be stronger than you? How come no one squished you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cI am getting squished right now. Its just that they don\u2019t want to squish me any smaller, so I have to stay this big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev \u201cSo if they didn\u2019t squish you, how big would you be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t think to much about this, but bigger than our universe. A whole lot bigger.\u201d Ben spread his arms for emphasis. Then he remembered his son was growing in this universe. \u201cLets get out of here before you get to strong and hurt someone by accident. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev stared at his muscles \u201cHow strong am I right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled \u201cAs strong as you look, but if you take off the marble on your necklace, you\u2019ll get a lot stronger, but never do that. Ok? Never. Promise me that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev looked at his dad determined, and he saluted like the soldier he saw on TV \u201cYes sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled, and thought maybe you\u2019ll be a great commander some day, or be someone in charge. That\u2019s what your middle name is for\u2026 \u201cAlright. Lets get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, there was a green flash. A giant and large 12 year old appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen \u201cLets go check on your mom and sister.\u201d Ben lay and arm down for Kev to climb up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKev \u201cAlright.\u201d A he ran up Ben\u2019s arm. Usually, he got tired after doing that, but to day it was a breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cGive it a shot. Try to imagine a ball of light in your hand. Then we can see what color your mana is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen focus on a ball of light in her hand, and she felt something. It was like a small window in the back of her mind has opened in let something inside her. She took whatever it was and put it in her hand. Soon, she held a ball of pink light. \u201cOh\u2026 Pink! Just like my marble!\u201d She held out her necklace. There was a transparent and glassy type of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cGood girl\u201d Amy beamed on the inside. Jen was going to be an amazing mana wielder. \u201cCan you guess what color mine is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen smiled knowingly \u201cIts white. Just like your necklace and all your dresses, and jewelry. Well\u2026 except your ring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cGuess what color\u2019s daddy\u2019s mana is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen thought about it \u201cYou got that ring from daddy right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded \u201cYup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen smiled \u201cIts green. Like the little stars in your ring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cYup. Daddy\u2019s mana is green, but he can\u2019t control it like we can. Though, he can make it clump together and throw it like a spell. That takes more practice, and it isn\u2019t as strong as ours. But since daddy is so big and strong, what does that do to his mana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen \u201cIts makes it bigger and stronger too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cThat\u2019s right. However, daddy doesn\u2019t practice it that much anyway, so it isn\u2019t to much stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen paused \u201cCan I practice everyday so my mana can get super super strong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cSure. We\u2019ll practice when ever you finish your home work, or when we both have some free time.\u201d Amy laughed inside. Most of her time was free since she used her mana to heal everyone. Though, its more effective because she is pretty much a doctor. She spent all her free time reading medical book and understanding disease and other ailments. Understanding it helps her mana heal it faster and more effectively. \u201cNow lets get back to papa and Kevin. Lets see if we can guess Kevin\u2019s mana color.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Its eyes pitch black, its skin sickly pale, and its claws stained red from blood. It was about to swallow the soul of its impaled victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind this girl was a cool, laid back kid with white eyes and razor sharp teeth. He waited for his meister\u2019s command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl \u201cSoul. Now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired kid flashed red and morphed into a scythe. He flew into the air and landed in the girl\u2019s hand. She twirled the red scythe and attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster saw this and grabbed the soul of its latest victim, and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl easily followed the monster and quickly caught up. Before the monster could see her, there was a streak of red that cut through the monster. It feel to the ground dissolving away into black bits leaving a floating ball that looked like it was made of molten lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scythe in her hand glowed and turned back into Soul. \u201cGood job Maka. This is our 99th ifrit egg. Now we just need a witch\u2019s soul and I can become the greatest Death Scythe ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cYah, and I\u2019ll be the one to get you that soul. Now we better report the mission to Lord Death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul yawn and sighed \u201cYou got that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled at her roomy and partner. She turned to the nearest glass window and wrote a series of numbers in the glass. There were blue ripples that formed and the sound of bells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange black tree thing appeared with giant white foam fingers \u201cMaka-chan! Its nice to see you. How was the mission?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake smiled at lord death \u201cIt was a success like usual. We just got our 99th soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord D \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic! I assume you are going to go witch hunting soon. If you succeed, then you\u2019ll be the youngest meister to ever make a death scythe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there came a sound of running steps, and a Red haired man appeared leaving a trail of dust and smoke \u201cI heard Maka\u2019s name. Is she alright?\u201d Then he saw Death\u2019s mirror and saw his daughter in his. \u201cOH! Maka-chan! My daughter are you hurt! I love you so much. Did that lazy scythe mess up while you were doing something?\u201d With each question, his face got closer and closer to the transmitting mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul tried to suppress his growing frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cYou\u2019re not my papa! Now go away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired man\u2019s face started to tear up. \u201cOh Maka! Why does it have to be so. You are my daughter and I love you sooo-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul had enough and punched the image of the red haired man. \u201cShut it!\u201d the red haired man flew back away from Death\u2019s mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath shook his head \u201cOh Spirit. What are we going to do with you.\u201d Then Death turned back to Maka \u201cMaka, once you get the witch\u2019s soul, Soul will become a death scythe, but if you mess up and he does not eat a witch\u2019s soul for his 100th soul, you will have to start over again. Do you understand? Then if you become a Death Scythe, you may consider stopping yourself from eating souls to give other weapons a chance to gain those souls. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cWe do Lord Death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cGood. Most meisters and weapons give away the souls that they get that are not a witch\u2019s soul once they get to 99, so there has never been a person who has needed to start over. Just letting you know so you don\u2019t think about being the first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked down flustered \u201cYes Lord Death. Can you give us a mission with a witch in it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, she gets one \u201cThank you Lord Death. We\u2019ll get right on it.\u201d Just as the transmission ended, Spirit jumped into the image and screamed \u201cMAKA!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cAre you sure this is the place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked around and saw all the candles and cobwebs of the dead trees \u201cIt looks like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked \u201cAlright then! Lets get that soul.\u201d He was about to go charging, but Maka caught him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cChange into a scythe please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grumbled \u201cFine\u201d and he changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake smiled and began walking down the path until she saw a pumpkin house. \u201cLooks like a witch house to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul eyed the place greedily \u201cCome on. Walk faster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake glared at her blade silencing him. She walked up to the house and rang the door bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feline like lady opened the door and smiled \u201cOh. Hello? I wasn\u2019t expecting anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cSorry, but is that Pumpkin Pumpkin Pumpkin Ave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady smiled \u201cYes. It is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake smiled \u201cDoes anyone else live around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady smiled \u201cNope. I like my privacy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake sighed \u201cOh. Ok.\u201d Before the lady could react, Maka jabbed the scythe between the lady\u2019s two giant breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady looked at her and had a look of surprise, but she smiled in the end as she vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at her scythe and saw an image of soul having a nose bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cDid you have to cut the witch there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka frowned \u201cStop complaining and eat her soul already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul transformed back into a human and grabbed the floating purple soul \u201cThis is it. The moment we have been working for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cIt is. Now quickly. I feel like something bad is going to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cWatch me as I eat is real cool like.\u201d He lifted the soul and simply put it in his mouth, and swallowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, his body was covered with a strange tingle. \u201cMaka! I can feel it. I\u2019m turning into a Death Scythe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I ate a Cat\u2019s soul as my 100th soul!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cNow we have to start all over again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was very angry. Partly because the lady was a cat, and partly because he really thought he was turning into a Death Weapon/Scythe. He had felt something, but what was it? He kicked the ground lightly once releasing all his anger \u201cLets go. What a bummer.\u201d He started to turn and walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka turned to the cat lady \u201cSo sorry. We needed a witch\u2019s soul and we thought you were one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat lady smiled \u201cIts alright. It was an obvious mistake. A lone woman in the middle of a dead forest living in a pumpkin house. I really should fix that. Shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cYah. You should. I got to go. My partner\u2019s already leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat lady \u201cBye! Good luck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul and Maka made it to their apartment. They skipped dinner. They weren\u2019t in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul went to his room and started to change into his nightly attire when he thought he saw something in the mirror. He was wearing a sleeveless-T, and he thought his arm looked bigger. \u201cI must be more tired and pissed than I thought\u2026\u201d He shrugged it off as a thought his mind came up with to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka called from the kitchen. \u201cSoul! Get up! We have to train if we want to be ready to get those souls\u2026 again.\u201d She was moping inside. The first pair of weapon and meister to mess up their 100th soul. Previous one\u2019s either never got past 99, or they waited till they met a real witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul groaned. He wanted to stay in bed. He felt tired, sore like he just lifted weights and ran a dozen miles, and his ego was still pulling itself together from last night. He Didn\u2019t answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake \u201cSOUL! We Have to train!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grumbled into his pillow \u201cFine!\u201d He finally said. It was not forth fighting her. She always got her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled in the kitchen. That was easier than usual. Maybe I\u2019ll make him something nice for breakfast to cheer him up. She hummed a tune her mother use to hum when they were cooking in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed and dragged himself out of bed. As son as he stood up, he felt top heavy and lost his balance. He fell over and he put his arms out to catch himself. When he landed, he noticed something. His arms, they were bigger! Not a huge difference from his usual muscular physique. Before, he was skinny, so it made his muscles show easily. Now, he actually had some size. His sleeveless-t was hugging his chest, and his shorts felt tighter. Even his briefs felt like they were containing more meat. \u201cWhat the. When did\u2026\u201d Then he remembered how he messed up on the 100th soul, and he felt a tingle all over his body. The tingle was focused mostly on his muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked in the mirror and did a bicep flex. Yup! It was definitely bigger, and so was the rest of his body. He couldn\u2019t help but smile despite the fact that he had to start over. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll surprise Maka while we train with this. This muscle makes me look cooler.\u201d Soul changed into his usual attire which hid his growth pretty well considering it wasn\u2019t that much of large growth anyway. Soul felt his cloths hug him more closely, but it was still indistinguishable from his previous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, it would feel like he emitted a bit more power than yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stepped out into the kitchen \u201cHey Maka.\u201d Then he smelt his favorite. Scrambled egg with powdered souls (Fake souls. The real ones are to expensive). He ran into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled as she was placing his meal onto his favorite plate. She could see that his mood had visibly improved. She smiled \u201cHey. I knew you were bummed out, so I may this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at it. Saliva was slipping through his sharp teeth. \u201cMaybe we should mess up on our next set of 100.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka laughed \u201cNot a chance. One time is more than enough. We\u2019re the first to ever get a non-witch soul for our 100th soul.\u201d Her spirit sagged a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul saw that and he really want to boost it back up. He ate his break fast with gusto and said \u201cLets go. We have to train you said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked up shocked that Soul was being so willing today. Maybe the shock from finding out he wasn\u2019t a death scythe had hit him a lot harder than she had thought. But anyway, Maka smiled happy that Soul was going along with her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka held out her hand and Soul turned into a scythe. Something felt off\u2026 his soul felt stronger than usual. Like it had double or maybe even tripled. She ignored it. Maybe he was turning a new leaf. Possibly, because he was willing to train this time, he soul was more open to hers, so they should resonate more strongly. Which could make it appear like his soul had gotten stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cLets practice soul resonance today. I feel like we\u2019re closer today than ever, and I want to build off of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cYah.\u201d Then he felt something odd. Like his body hadn\u2019t finished completely changing. \u201cWait! I feel something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was about to get into her resonance stance, but stopped \u201cWhat Soul. Is something wrong?\u201d Suddenly, the scythe in her hand began to glow. It flashed once and another scythe blade had appeared on the other side of the handle. \u201cSoul!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was moaning inside his dark little world. The last soul he ate was finally getting into his system and finishing off his growth. Soul felt his chest puff out some more, his biceps pop, his butt harden a bit, his 6 pack abs grow deeper, his legs grow thicker with muscle, and his 5in penis stretch another inch. \u201cOh\u2026 this feels sooooo good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka didn\u2019t notice Soul\u2019s activities as she was to busy looking at the changes in the scythe she held. \u201cThis is\u2026 how the\u2026 when did\u2026 why\u2026 huh?\u201d Then it hit her! It had to be the 100th soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Soul was done changing and was panting from the pleasure he felt from his growth. Then he began to stand again. He felt power in his limbs. More power than he ever had before. He saw Maka staring at his scythe form\u2019s changes and he prided himself on how cool he looked now. \u201cHey Maka! I look cooler now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stared amazed at the scythe. It felt even more balance now. The blades seemed sharper too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cAre you just going to sit their mute or are we going to train!?!?!\u201d He was super pumped now. He really wanted to see how strong he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked into the blade and saw Soul\u2019s face. She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey say at the same time \u201cSoul Resonance!\u201d Suddenly, Maka\u2019s soul flared into existence. It was now giant Red and Blue sphere as it merged Maka and Soul\u2019s souls together. Suddenly, the soul surrounding Maka grew a pair of scythes that rotated around them cutting at the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was using Maka\u2019s eyes to see their soul. \u201cWe look so cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cReady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed in his current muscle pump \u201cLets raise our resonance even higher!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake and Soul screamed to bring up their soul resonance. Suddenly, the two blades of Maka\u2019s scythe grew huge! They were an iridescent rainbow thaw was mostly blue. The two blades were so huge that they practically made a full circle. Maka raised the handle high over her head and began to twirl it. Quickly it sped up until all you saw was the pure force of soul power emitted from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soul image surrounding Maka doubled in size. The blades that were spinning started to speed up even more. The air began to rotated with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka saw the huge amounts of soul energy they were giving off. Maka tried to stop now before it got to high and hurt someone else training near by, but she couldn\u2019t. Their soul resonance was sky rocketing out of control. \u201cSoul! I can\u2019t stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was inside his dark space and saw Maka was having trouble. Suddenly, he felt a pang as his scythe form changed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stared in awe as the blades grew even larger. The were a deep royal blue now with white veins, and the occasional glowing red spot. \u201cSoul! I can\u2019t stop spinning it! Help!\u201d. There were sparks coming off the blade now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Soul\u2019s world, he felt sparks running around his body. He felt pain like none other. He looked up and saw Maka was getting hurt too. They couldn\u2019t control this yet. He screamed to anyone who could here \u201cSome one help us!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was yelling. Lighting was dancing around her body. A tornado of power was surging around them. The soul image around Maka had been stretched vertical to match the tornado, and it had grow hundreds of more scythes. It seemed like they might kill themselves by accident. Then suddenly, a lighting bolt from the tornado made its way to strike at Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cMaka! Look out!\u201d He tried to do something, but he couldn\u2019t get out of scythe form. He yelled \u201cSomeone\u2026 anyone\u2026 help\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it all stopped. The dual bladed scythe flew out of Maka\u2019s hand and was sent spinning through the forest cutting down dozens of trees. Some one\u2019s hand was holding Maka\u2019s wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Someone had stopped her twirling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pale skinned, white haired man was standing before her. \u201cWhat was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake was still in shock from the display of power that she just performed, and she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little off to the side, Soul had just changed back, and he partially regretted it. His favorite hoodie was at the bursting point. It clung to his muscled torso almost like a second skin. It showed every single one of his bulky muscles. He started running towards Maka to check on her \u201cMaka! Are you ok!? Answer me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back to the clearing, he saw that every tree that was within 100ft of them had been cut down. They all had perfectly smooth stumps. We did this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale man \u201cWeapon. What is you name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at the man now. He saw her holding Maka\u2019s wrist. She hung limp In his grasp. \u201cMaka\u2026\u201d He charged and grabbed Maka from the man. He heard a rip as the seems along his shoulder had ripped from his arm pumping motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale man sighed \u201cThat\u2019s now a nice thing to do. Grabbing something from your hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul glared at the man with his razor teeth. Then he calmed down. He had Maka in his hands, and she was safe for now. Who ever this man was, he was insanely strong. He got through the tornado shaped soul along with its razor blades, and he stopped a the giant dual bladed scythe. However, he saved Maka, so he swallowed his pride \u201cTh-Th-Thank yoooooo\u2026 Thank yooooo. Th-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale man \u201cYou\u2019re Welcome.\u201d He replied nonchalantly. He took out a cigarette and lit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul glared, but sighed in relief. The words were harder to say than he thought. He picked up Maka in his larger arms now. And began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kind of looked like this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th04.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2010/169/d/4/MuscleUp_Soul_Eater_by_lingdingyi.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://th04.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ash white man \u201cI asked you your name.\u201d He let he let out a breath of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul paused his walking \u201cSoul Eater. You saved a girl name Maka.\u201d Soul felt somewhat at peace right now. He held Maka who was sleeping basically, and he felt kind of odd. He wanted to keep her safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he continued walking. His shirt and pants were incredibly tight. They constricted every movement. However, Maka was priority right now. He brought her to an infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was standing there and he started to walk into Death City. Lord death had summoned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Stein!\u201d Death said in his cartoon-ish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cLord Death. You have a pair: Weapon and Meister\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath nodded \u201cI felt it. Thank you for helping them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cI wanted to dissect them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath started to make gestures with his giant foam finger like hands. \u201cNo. Do not please. You can save that for Spirit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his name, Spirit charged out into Death\u2019s room and found him self crashing into a wall of a human. He looked up and saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cHello Spirit. How have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit yelled the way he usually did when he was freaked out. He used the be dissected secretly at night by this man, but his divorced wife had saved him long ago. \u201cGet away! Death! Why is he here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cI called him here. Its about your daughter and her weapon Soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe topic brought Spirit to full attention. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath exhaled \u201cThey had gone to get a witch\u2019s soul, but they did not. Soul had eaten a cat\u2019s soul as his 100th soul making them the first pair to ever have a non-witch soul as their 100th.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein sighed \u201cSo this is why you called me. You called him Soul? Is he Soul Eater and his partner, Maka?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was worried. This guy knew his daughter! It made her that much closer to being dissected by this man. \u201cYou know Maka!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled creepily \u201cSo she\u2019s you daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit recoiled and backed far away. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201d Slowly, he was dreading the possible future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cStein! I want you to keep an eye on please. You will take Sid\u2019s place as teacher at the DWMA for a while as you observe them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cBut Death. What will be Sid\u2019s cover story?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cSid will have an accident\u201d then Death did this thing with his hands \u201cOOPSIES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was in class today, alone. He was debating: Why and I here again? Oh yah\u2026 Maka was in the infirmary recovering, and the brief 5 seconds she was awake, she begged him to take notes of the classes she was going to miss. So why was he here again? And why was he early? What was the world coming to!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was chatter in the class room, but that soon ended. They heard an annoying squeaking sound coming down the hall. Suddenly, a pale-ish man in a lab coat appeared on a rolling chair. It got caught in the bump in the door and tipped over sending the man flying into the classroom. He got up immediately, acquired his chair, and sat backwards in it. \u201cHello class. From this day forth you will refer to me as Stein, and I am you current teacher since Sid has had an accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were murmurs of worry and questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cQuite down. We will begin class now. Today\u2026\u201d He looked up at the class with a mad look \u201c\u2026 we are going to do dissections.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOY!

I guess that would do something magical.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cYo Death! Are you still there? Death? I guess he\u2019s gone.\u201d Soul turned back to focusing on Maka. He held her hand in his now thinker and stronger hands. He felt stronger than he looked. Ever since yesterday\u2019s event, he\u2019s never felt better! He needed to go let off some of the power he built in his muscles earlier today. He ran and did a whole bunch of exercises because he kept getting the urge to. He had no idea why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cSo you are feeling different after eating a non-witch soul, but a highly magical cat\u2019s soul as your 100th.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul fell out of his chair \u201cWhat the! I thought you were gone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath sent him am image of him going \u201cOOPSIES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul walked into Death\u2019s room. He saw another kid there as well. He wore a tailored suite, and had a set of bangs. The right one had three parallel horizontal stripes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cYou called me Death?\u201d His hands were in his pockets as he looked off in the distance. There were fake clouds everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath turned around \u201cSoul! You\u2019re here. Have you met my son? Death the Kid? Just call him Kid, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid turned and faced his father \u201cFather! I decided my nicknames. And besides, only you call my Kid.\u201d Suddenly, the two guns in his hands changed into two cowboy style dressed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short, younger on smiled \u201cWe call you Kid too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid turned and faced her \u201cYou aren\u2019t helping!\u201d He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other taller one yelled \u201cKid! Its you name. Be proud of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid sighed \u201cI guess I have no choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller girl smiled. At least he wasn\u2019t crying about symmetry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul coughed \u201cCan we speed this up. I have to go check on someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid looked up and saw Soul for the first time. Soul had gotten rid of his hoodie and just wore a sleeveless-t now since he didn\u2019t have the funded to buy a whole new wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid gasped \u201cLiz\u2026 Patty! Look at that symmetry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul put his hand on his hips and tilted his head \u201cWhat?!?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid screamed \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d He ran up to Soul\u2019s body and fixed his tilted head. Kid repositioned soul\u2019s arms. \u201cIts amazing! A sculpted body of symmetry!\u201d Kid\u2019s eyes started to sparkle. \u201cI must know your name!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul recoiled and moved out of position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid panicked \u201cFreeze!\u201d Soul froze in place. Kid ran up and put everything back where it was before. \u201cThere we go. Perfectly symmetrical again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz and Patty stood where they were sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz \u201cKid\u2026 he needs to move eventually. He needs to go places.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty was clapping her hands \u201cFreeze Freeze! He froze!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath spoke up \u201cKid. Liz is right. I need to speak with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid cried \u201cBut father! The symmetry! Its perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul getting very pissed of at Death\u2019s son. Hurry up and unfreeze me so I can chop you to pieces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath wagged a giant finger at Kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid \u201cFine\u2026 Unfreeze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was release immediately. He turned his arms into scythes and was just about ready to chop him up when Death called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cSoul. Turn into a whole scythe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul shocked \u201cFull?\u201d Death nodded, and Soul transformed into his dual bladed scythe form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath reach out a hand and caught him. Death twirled the scythe and sent his soul into it. It came back hundreds of times stronger. \u201cMy my\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid was watching the scythe with interest. He saw it swirl and look the same as before only after a 180degree spin. \u201cFather! Do that again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cWaa!!!!\u201d He made a face and hand gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid \u201cSpin him 180degrees.\u201d he waited anxiously. \u201cPlease!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath was surprised, but he obliged. He spun the scythe 180degrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid fell to his knees. This weapon\u2026 it has this symmetry. \u201cWhat is this! Its not reflective, but its still the same image! He spun it and it looks the same. What symmetry is this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at Kid like he was mad. He changed part of himself so his head stuck out. \u201cDumb***! That\u2019s called rotational symmetry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid\u2019s eyes opened as a whole new world of symmetry opened up to him. Then he saw Soul was partially untransformed \u201cAh!!!!! Change back! Change Back! Go back to your weapon form!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt like being disobedient, and did the opposite. Suddenly, he found himself frozen as Kid tried to put him an a symmetrical position. \u201cWhat the!\u201d At least he could still talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid stood in front of Soul and started to bow down to him. \u201cSo much symmetry\u2026 so may ways! How! Are there others?!?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul paused \u201cIf you let me go, I\u2019ll tell you one more.\u201d The moment the words came out of his mouth, he was unfrozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid screamed \u201cTell me!\u201d He ran up and grabbed Soul by his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul recoiled a way a bit. \u201cIts called translation symmetry. You move thing up and down and if they are still the same, they are symmetrical.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid looked at soul. His left eye twitching \u201cI refuse!!!!! That\u2019s not symmetry. So many flaws! So many imperfections.\u201d He started to curl up in the fetal position an rock back and forth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz \u201cNow you\u2019ve done it!\u201d She ran up to him and tried to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty was giggling \u201cHe go baby!\u201d She started doing the loony sign with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath stood to the side of all this. Soul wasn\u2019t a death scythe, but his power exceed it. What was going on? Could it have been the magic cat soul, or the just the non-witch 100th soul? Cats have always been a mystery. He\u2019d have to tell Stein. \u201cSoul. Thank you. You may go back now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed in relief. He could get away from this loon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid was still rocking back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stein looked at soul\u2019s soul. It was a red sphere about 6ft in diameter. Its had a pair of blades spinning slowly around the out part of the sphere. \u201cSoul appears to have stabilized. The body\u2026\u201d He looked to see any change in muscle mass and any new growth \u201cStabilized.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein kept staring \u201cWhat did they hide? Why was he so strong? What gives him his huge soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs student walked up to his and heard Stein chanting \u201cDissect\u2026 dissect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student \u201cExcuse me. Dr. Stein\u2026 Should we begin class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein looked down as he snapped out of his thoughts \u201cYah. Go back to your seat.\u201d He turned to everyone \u201cToday, we\u2019ll be dissecting the Iridescent Pink Peacock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome students murmur and some gasped \u201cThere are only 5 left in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cAnd its very fortunate we can dissect one before they are all gone. Very fortunate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was looking at this man. Was he mad!!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was leaning back in his chair. People had asked questions about how he grew so huge! He shrugged them off and said \u201cGood genetics.\u201d After a week or so, people stopped asking. Though, he did get a postcard from Kid asking him to stop by so he could pose for a painting. He tore the card in half and burned it. Now, in class, there was this other kid that kept eyeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kid had blue hair, ninja stealth cloths, and he was a meister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to him was a tall lady who appears to be from northern Asia. She had really long hair and a tolerance for anything stupid his meister did. Its said that her weapon forms (plural) was immensely powerful, but she has yet to eat any souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul saw the kid looking at him from across the room, and he was beginning to feel more and amore uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a loud ringing ended the tension. Dr. Stein went and picked up the phone. \u201cOh! Is he really? Interesting. Thanks you for the warning.\u201d Dr. Stein turned to the class. \u201cClass, it appears that a new student is coming today. His name is Death the Kid, and he\u2019s Death\u2019s son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue haired kid heard this and charged out the door to meet Kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady charge out after him \u201cBlack Star! Wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could head an echo reach the door \u201cI will transcend god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was sitting in his chair smiling. The guy was gone now. Then he grimaced \u201cWhy did Kid, a god, want to go to school at the DWMA?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone stepped in \u201cExcuse me Professor. The student hand book says that if a fight were to break out, a teacher must be present.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked and saw a girl had been out all week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul whispered \u201cMaka\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka glared at Stein for replacing Sid, but she new there was no point. Sid was gone, and this lunatic had taken his place. Too much dissecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein stared at the girl he saved. She had forgotten him. Oh well.<br>\r\nHis hand was holding a medical knife and it was about to cut into the flesh of the rare bird. He sighed \u201cVery well. Lets go.\u201d He set down his knife, and the bird stopped spazzing. Then he gave it a greedy look, and the pink peacock paled. Stein left. \u201cMaka. Come with me. Soul, you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the class, someone stated \u201cI think the peacock just went albino.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was standing on one of the thin cones sticking out of Death City. His first test of surpassing god is by beating Death\u2019s son in a match. \u201cTsubaki, are you ready?\u201d He got a nodding image on the blade. He began to say The Three Rules to assassination\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Blend into the shadows...Hold your breath...And wait for your target to let down his guard!! <br>\r\n- Tune into your target; know his thoughts and actions!! <br>\r\n- Strike your target down before he is aware of your existence!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up the steps to death city, Kid was making his way to his first day. Liz and Patty stood beside his walking in almost perfect symmetry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid started to get irritated \u201cLiz! Lift your leg higher! Its to low. Patty! Keep up with the pace! Ah!!!! This isn\u2019t working.\u201d Then he heard the voice of some obnoxiously loud and out going kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw some blue haired kid jumping on a spire. Kid froze \u201cDeath city has so much symmetry. Its just like my dad to do something like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz whispered to Patty \u201cProbably to make sure his son doesn\u2019t flip if he decided to come here.\u201d Patty heard the word flip and started to do back flips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid stared at its beauty when he heard a crack. That kid\u2019s jumping broke the tip of the spire he stood on. \u201cAH!!!!!! You will pay for destroying the symmetry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack star smiled. The god was angry, so he\u2019ll fight harder! \u201cFight me! I will surpass you.\u201d He got into a fighting stance with two mini scythe blades connected by a metal chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid got ready for an attack \u201cLiz\u2026 Patty! Now.\u201d His two weapons transform and fell into his hand in perfect symmetry, and he went through his onslaught of poses. He held the gun upside down with his pinky on the trigger instead of the preferred index finger. \u201cCome. I will punish you for ruining the symmetry of my father\u2019s city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star runs at Kid and they duke it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid \u201cYour weapon has such unstable symmetry. It disgusts me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star kept mumbling \u201cI will\u2026 transcend\u2026 god.\u201d However, this made him get distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid took this opportunity to strike. Black Star was knocked out. \u201cOne who destroy symmetry can not hope to pass a god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki changed back into a human and held BlackStar in her arms. She turned to Kid \u201cThanks for going easy on him. He can\u2019t see people\u2019s souls like I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid nodded \u201cHmm\u2026 you are getting closer to perfect symmetry in your human form. If you stop by my room, I can fix that crooked eyebrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki stared dumbstruck. \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid turned around to continue into the school when he saw the reason for his coming. He charged forward \u201cFreeze!\u201d He said exerting his god soul and power over Soul in order to  keep him from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was watching the fight from them main entrance, and when it was done, he saw Kid charging right at him with Kid\u2019s eyes were dazzling with awe. Then he couldn\u2019t move. Now he was angry. He felt pressure build up in his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid got up to Soul\u2019s body and began to reposition his arms and legs, etc. \u201cPerfectly sculpted body in perfect symmetry.\u201d His eyes were glazed over in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka just stared then suddenly, he heard Soul start screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was pushing his soul as far is it would go to throw off Kid\u2019s FREEZE. Suddenly, he broke through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid stared wide eyed. How did he break a God\u2019s freeze?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul walked up and grabbed him by the shirt \u201cThat was not cool. Got it?\u201d He pulled Kid back and threw him away from the main entrance on top of Black Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was shocked by Soul\u2019s strength, but while the fight was going on, Soul explained how the changes happened. He didn\u2019t really know how, but he explained the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Stein turned and faced them. \u201cSoul\u2026 how\u2019s your body. Anything new? Eaten any new souls? Have you done anything different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul recoiled from the loony man\u2019s sudden outburst of questions. \u201cNo\u2026 I  haven\u2019t eaten any souls recently. I\u2019ve been waiting for Maka so we could start on out 100 again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled \u201cOh! Right. You have to start over. Let me help you out.\u201d He reached into his pocket and pulled out a molten lava looking soul, but it was green instead of the usual pink/red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWhy is it green?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled creepily \u201cNo reason. It\u2019s the soul of a Magic Maker. The creatures, in life give off a huge amount of Magic Soul energy. When they die, their soul enhances the magic of who ever eats it. Though, the amount of increase varies from person to person. Death wanted me to give it to you to see if you really did have magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul paused and sighed. He reached a hand out for Green soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake stood there to keep an eye on his partner. She gave him a nod signaling that he could take it. \u201cIts from Death, so its probably safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded and tossed the soul into his mouth. \u201cStrange. Its mint flavored. Kid of tingles as it goes down.\u201d He sighed and waited. Suddenly her felt a pang of pain in his gut as his body began to absorb the strange soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Make \u201cSoul! Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was keeling over in pain. Suddenly, his body turned into a scythe involuntarily, and he was inside his dark world again. (This isn\u2019t the room with the piano. That\u2018s when a deep resonance is reached). He was moaning as pound upon pound of muscle grew on him. His already think body got thick. His pecs blocked more of his vision, hits biceps grew more making it hard to touch his face (just a bit harder, but not impossible), his 6-pack abs grew more defined as the indent between then got deeper, his thighs bulked up to support his increasing weight. Not to mention his raging 15in hard-on. He started to jack off in his private little world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, his dual bladed scythe form started to glow. Suddenly, the blades doubled in length, and another smaller blade sprang out of the blades curving the opposite direction. The  other smaller blade popped out on that one, and another, etc. It was a strange fractal pattern.<br>\r\nBoth ends were sparking as tiny red lighting arched over the blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein sighed \u201cTest observed\u2026 Magic is present in the subject.\u201d He lit a cigarette and inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looking at the blades in wonder. She reached out and grabbed the handle. Suddenly, the smaller blades retract and its back to it two giant blades. \u201cWhat the.\u201d She focused on the smaller blades again, and they sprang out again. She a large amount of pleasure coming from the handle off the dual bladed scythe and looked into its blade to see Soul even larger than before, but he was also doing something un-Soul like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s face burned red, and she looked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cIt appears that the magic cat\u2019s soul has implanted magic inside of Soul. The Magic Maker expanded it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath thought about it \u201cThe reason Death Weapons are called that is because\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThey have been giving the magic of a witch\u2019s soul, but Soul isn\u2019t a death scythe. A cat has weaker magic and has probably began to change Soul because of it. In order for him to be a death scythe, he really will have to collect the souls again and a witch\u2018s soul. However, thanks to the Magic Maker\u2026 each soul he eats will increase his magic again. Death, this could get pretty ugly. Why didn\u2019t you just test for magic the usual way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath covered his face with his giant hands \u201cOOPSIES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein shook his head. Death\u2026 what has happened to you all these centuries. Then he focused on Soul again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find out why their soul power went out of control before, but no I have an idea. Does the girl, Maka, have an anti magic wavelength?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath froze. \u201cThat could explain the intense spiraling power. Magic and anti-magic are polar opposites. No wonder Maka and Soul are such a great pair. They fill in what the other lacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSoul, how are you feeling?\u201d She was letting Soul rest on her lap. Her hand was on his very beefy chest making sure his heart was beating still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cYah\u2026 I\u2019m fine.\u201d Then a though occurred to him. One, why was he laying on Maka\u2019s lap, and two, why was Maka\u2019s hand on his chest? Not that he was complaining. He just assumed he looked super cool. He got up and began to rip off the remains of his shirt. When he changed back into his human form, his tight sleeveless-t was tearing in the back. His pants were about to burst, and his briefs were uncomfortably tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his shirt was off, he let out a sigh of relief. He simply glowed with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stared at his muscles almost drooling, but she caught herself. She was his meister, and she had to maintain composure around him. \u201cOk, lets go home. I\u2019ll see if I can find any change of cloths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed and tossed her his wallet. \u201cThere\u2019s 20 death dollars in there. If you could get something large for me to grow into, I\u2019d really like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly,  they heard some students heading out to go home. However, on voice stood out. He just got out of the infirmary with minor injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid was mumbling \u201cAh ***** his symmetry. There are other people who are better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded encouragingly \u201cYes. That\u2019s right. Who needs him? Lets just more on and forget him.\u201d She was trying to do Kid a favor by not getting him involved that that jacked white haired guy. The guy looked like he could tear a tree apart. And what was with his teeth! Why were they pointed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty was skipping totally ignorant of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kid looked up and saw Soul without his shirt on, and with larger, more symmetrical muscle. \u201cAH!!!!! The symmetry is too perfect!\u201d He ran up to Soul and yelled \u201cFreeze!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul saw this coming and forced the freeze to break again. Then he punched Kid while he was running at him. Kid fell to the ground looking up at Soul. His arms were on his waist and he looked down. He turned and walked away leaving Kid in his daze. \u201cMaka, forget the shirt. Lets just go home.\u201d Maka followed beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid\u2019s eyes had glazed over again. He was mumbling about perfect symmetry. Just wait till he see\u2019s Soul\u2019s scythe form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cFinally! We can get started!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cTechnically, we already did. 1 soul down, 98 ifrit eggs and a witch to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cThat\u2019s why we picked this mission. There are about 500 ifrits marching off towards a town right now to collect souls for the year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cYou think we can handle them all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cIt\u2019ll be a cinch.\u201d He was still feeling the pump from his latest growth. He can\u2019t quite explain it. He loved the feeling. He didn\u2019t know what it was though. He left home before being told to taught anything on the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed. Over confident as usual. Then again, there last soul resonance was immensely powerful. \u201cFine\u2026 lets go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito, a short, long nosed, snooty rich guy with a monocle. \u201cNow go! Collect a years supply of souls and them return so we can go to the next town.\u201d He has lived for centuries like this and no one has ever beaten all his minions. They have tried, and they failed. Though, he did come back with 10 fewer. Oh well. More souls for everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis minions, dressed in suits and wearing strange white masks, charged toward the chosen city. Its population was about 50,000. Suddenly, they lost 10 of the 500. There was a red slash that cut through there ranks, and a hand that pulled all the souls into a dark world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cKeep at it Maka! I have about 70 right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded and continued spinning and cutting the ifrits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito, however, had returned to the inside of his car, waiting for his minions to returned with a bounty of souls. Suddenly, some of them had returned banging on his windshield. He glared at them and lowered the window. Five of them jumped in and another one took the drivers seat and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laugh \u201cThey were weaker than normal ifrits!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cMaybe because there were so many. Did they ration their souls? Because they all felt about the same strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cWho cares! We have so many souls now.\u201d Soul looked at his mountain of 494 souls and grinned greedily. \u201cMaka, this is going to take a while to digest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka laughed \u201cFine, stay in your scythe form, I\u2019ll carry you home today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled evilly \u201cThanks\u2026\u201d He turned to the souls and started to much away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed and leaned her scythe against the wall \u201cWe\u2019re home. Are you done eating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was in heaven. His tight stomach had swollen like a beer gut. He poked it and sighed with content. He had eaten 98 souls saving the other 396  souls incase they messed up again. Which was totally plausible. \u201cNow where can I put these so I don\u2019t lose them.\u201d Suddenly, a door appeared that said Soul\u2019s Room. He opened it and he found a quite little room playing an old jazz record. \u201cPerfect. He put the souls inside of there.\u201d He though, I hope I can get back to that place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scythe glowed and turned back into Soul. His gut was still swollen, his he still didn\u2019t have a shirt. He rubbed his stomach. \u201cThanks Maka, I think I\u2019m going to had a soul coma (like a food coma).\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled and nodded \u201cYah, I\u2019m going to turn it in for to night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul went to his room and laid in bed. He quickly fell asleep. During that, the Magic Maker soul was turning the other souls into magic weak magic souls. Soul\u2019s body was slowly absorbing its bounty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to him now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who ever they were, they could cut through the diamond hard skin of his minions. They probably didn\u2019t even realize what they were doing was hard in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito looked at the 6 remaining footmen. His nose extended and drained the blood from all 6 before they could even protest. He was pissed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSoul!!! Read to go witch hunting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul groaned and then paused. His voice\u2026 it was even deeper than before. \u201cWhat the.\u201d He covered his mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was curious \u201cSoul? Is everything alright? You sound coarse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul tried to raise his voice \u201cYah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d It totally failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was worried \u201cI\u2019m coming in. Are you decent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cI guess\u2026 but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka came in to see a massive Soul who was covering himself in his blankets. \u201cI thought you said you were decent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cThis is as decent as I could get! I don\u2019t have anything that fits!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka yelled \u201cYou don\u2019t have to yell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul said in his deep masculine voice \u201cI\u2019m not! My voice is super deep. Pretty cool right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed\u2026 her partner was about a foot taller than yesterday, and his muscles appeared to me three times larger. His biceps were like bowling balls now, and his pecs covered most of his vision to his lower half. He was developing an 8-pack and such. His neck was super thick and so were his shoulders. His legs looked as though they rubbed slightly when he walked. And the thing that dangled in between,  she couldn\u2019t see, but the imprint in the blanket made it seem pretty big. \u201cI guess its time to spend your 20 Death Dollars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul frowned \u201cI don\u2019t know if that will caver all of the expenses. Lets see if we can sneak anything out from DWMA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cThat\u2019s stealing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed \u201cIts for a good cause. Do you want everyone to see me naked??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed and tried to think of an alternative, but she couldn\u2019t come up with one. \u201cFine! We\u2019ll BARROW some clothes from the school. As soon as we get some new one, we\u2019re giving it back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked \u201cAs long as I don\u2019t grow out of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka thought \u201cHow did you grow anyway? You did only eat 98 yesterday, plus the 1 Stein gave you. So that 99. We didn\u2019t get 100 a second time yet. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul shook his head \u201cI was careful when I was stuffing my self yesterday. I only ate 98. Even though they taste like heaven, I really want to be a Death Scythe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cWe should ask Death, or Dr. Stein. It seems like they know more about what\u2019s going on. Now change into a scythe. We\u2019re going now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul protested \u201cBut I haven\u2019t eaten breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cAren\u2019t you still full from your binge last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul thought about it, and sighed \u201cI guess I\u2019m not hungry right now, but I will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll eat out later or go to DWMA\u2019s cafeteria.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cFine.\u201d He turned into a scythe, but looked even more different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka caught the scythe in her hand and stared at the blades. They were glowing red, and black lighting was streaking across the surface of the blade. The grey handle had morphed a tiny bit and had started to form red and black veins beneath the metal. It looked like something was moving along the veins. Maka wanted to test something out. She pushed some of her soul into her weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: A weapon amplifies the meister\u2018s soul. The meister shoves their soul into the weapon, and the weapon amplifies it and send it back. Its like a large circle.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka suddenly felt her soul come back so strong that she almost passed out. She dropped her scythe and leaned on the wall. She was panting as her body tried to correct itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was shocked \u201cMaka! Are you ok?\u201d Did he do that? He wasn\u2019t even trying to send that much power back with her soul. It just came into him like a trickle and left him like a waterfall. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t try to send that much power back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka got up and smiled \u201cIts fine. I\u2019m not hurt anymore. It was an accident. Besides, it just mean I need to grow stronger to handle the power you send back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled the way he did. A little ambitious, but he could deal with that. At least she\u2019s ok. \u201cAlright. Lets go asked that stein guy and Lord Death what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and Soul \u201cWhat!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein and Death leaned back as the force of their yelling pushed them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein turned the screw in his head a few times \u201cYes. The Magic Maker soul inside of Soul turns all future souls he eats into magic souls. If its already a strong magic soul, it become even stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at the red and black scythe she held \u201cI can\u2019t even send some of my soul into him without it coming back at me like a waterfall! And he\u2019s only going to get stronger with each soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein pointed to Death \u201cHe asked me to give Soul a super rare Magic Maker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath held his hands up in a defensive gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Death with big beady, and sad eyes. \u201cHow am I going to use him\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath felt his godly heart shatter and melt away. Then Death did the only thing he could\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOPSIES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was pissed, but also happy, but mostly pissed. He transformed back into a human and totally disregarded the fact he was naked standing a 6ft1in with a giant 12in one eyed snake swaying between his legs. \u201cOOPSIES! How am I going to be a Death Scythe if I can\u2019t send a trickle of soul energy back at Maka without her being disabled!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath face got serious. His mouth turned into a circle of angry power. \u201cThen help her get stronger! Or maybe practice limiting your power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s face was red, but she chimed in \u201cDeath\u2026 could you try using Soul? I heard you did it before. Can you do it again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath\u2019s face grew soft as Maka\u2019s request \u201cOk\u2026\u201d He looked at Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded and turned his giant hulking body into a scythe. He prepared himself for Death\u2019s soul<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath caught Soul and forced a chunk of his soul in. Death felt like a wall was about to hit him. In order to save himself from a year long doctor\u2019s appointment, he forced his soul into an attack to strong it tore the sky apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath spun the dual bladed scythe and direct the soul energy into the blades to send off as an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the Red blades grew redder and the black lighting became more sporadic. There was a flash, and all of the sky for miles on was covered by a super thin, neon red disk with black lighting shooting around it forming images of Death Skulls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the red faded, and the blue sky returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake was on the ground covering her head. Stein was standing still smoking his cigarette, and Death was paralyzed from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath wondered what is going on with Soul? He looked at the blades and black lightning was still running across its surface. He turned back to Maka \u201cI\u2019m sorry Maka\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sniffed. \u201cCould you handle what he sent back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath sighed \u201cI almost didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThere was magic in that attack. It reinforced his soul to a macroscopic level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all go \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThe magic mage his soul grow, but it grew so much that it need to put the energy somewhere else. So it made his body grow. Also, the scythe is discharging soul energy since it so much. The black lighting is only black because Soul things it looks cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all look the scythe. \u201cIt looks cool\u2026 doesn\u2019t it? Red blades, black lighting? It looked epic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake face palmed and Lord Death was still thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cIf you are wondering Lord Death, about how Maka managed to survive the surge of that much soul power and magic, it could very well be that Maka has and anti-magic wavelength that counter acts Soul\u2019s now magic wavelength.\u201d He finished his cigarette and crushed it. \u201cThere is a very simple test to see if Maka has an anti-magic wavelength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two naturally oppose each other and try to neutralize each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSo you\u2019re going to blast magic at me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein lit another cigarette \u201cNo\u2026 that would do more damage than help. We want to draw it out. Not hurt you. So we\u2019re going to put you in a box, but since we don\u2019t have any source of magic, we\u2019ll have to lock you in there with your partner, and seal it so no soul energy escapes, or magic escapes. Once that\u2019s done, we\u2019ll have to wait till the levels get high enough for us to see the anti-magic come out of you. There will be a spark when it come because the magic and anti-magic are basically destroying each other and turning into pure soul energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stood there, naked as of now \u201cIs it safe? What is the magic level is too high?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein sighed \u201cThen nothing. It\u2019s just the free magic that in the air. It doesn\u2019t enter someone\u2019s body unless its told to. Though, it appears that you have no training in being able to control magic, so we should be safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka thought \u201cSo if I do have an anti-magic wavelength, what are we going to do then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThat\u2019s up to you and Lord Death. It is not my area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka turned to Death \u201cSo what will we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cWe will reinforce it and strengthen it so it can help you handle Soul\u2019s magic wavelength. However, it will be hard. Soul\u2019s magic is already greater than a death scythe\u2019s, and it will get stronger once he eats his witch\u2019s soul. A lot stronger. Do you think you are capable enough to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka didn\u2019t hesitate \u201cI need to be.\u201d He eyes filled with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was a black cube essentially. It was black so they could see the sparks when they arrive. There was a single vent filtering only the air. It was made to separate soul and other particles from the air to keep the magic in. It was about 10ft by 10ft room. Plenty of room for them to lay down or what ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was in his corner, and Maka was in hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s eyes were closed as she was thinking. I need to have that wavelength. I have to be able to use Soul as a weapon. I can\u2019t lose him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was staring at Maka as she though. She was so quite\u2026 peaceful. Soul remembered how intense his feeling were when their soul resonance had spiraled out of control into a giant twister. She was knocked out and hanging by her wrist. He wanted to do everything to protect her. Maybe it was his muscle talking, but he felt like he could smash anyone\u2019s face in if they even implied an insult. She looked as peaceful as back then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalm, poise, emotional, bossy, fair, fun, and a kick ass meister to boot. He was falling for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still a little under developed bodily, but her mind and skills was a sharp as his blades. He wanted her to have that anti-whatever it was. So they could be together as long as possible. Though, he\u2019d never tell her that. It wasn\u2019t cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there and as he thought, he felt an odd sensation pass over him. It was like the times he was growing, but he wasn\u2019t growing. (Not his muscles at least). He stopped staring at Maka and looked down at his groin. His 12in pissing tool was growing. What the? What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the feeling grew stronger and stronger until he couldn\u2019t resist it anymore. Was this normal? He looked at Maka and saw that she was still thinking. He wanted her bad no. He didn\u2019t even know why. It was like some instinct that told him that his giant tool and here were supposed to come together. He moaned \u201cOh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s eyes snapped open to see Soul\u2019s giant erect penis was throbbing from desire. \u201cSoul! What are you doing?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stared at her. His eyes were partly glazed over \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 know\u2026. I feel like I really want you. Like really want you. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad thing that I feel, but its getting harder to resist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka knew what was going on. They were alone, locked up in a box. Just the two of them. His natural boy instincts were starting to take over, and they both could potentially lose their virginity. \u201cSoul! Scythe, now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul didn\u2019t understand why. He wanted to stay human. The feeling was so good. However, he changed anyway because it was a command from his meister, and it was hard to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul flipped through the air as a dual bladed scythe and landed in Maka\u2019s hand. She gasped the handle of the scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was in his dark world. He looked at his hard on. It felt like someone was holding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at the scythe and sighed. This should help prevent any accidents. She wasn\u2019t ready to give up her virginity. She sat down as started to tap the handle as she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul moaned even louder. The feeling in his cock was growing more intense. Pangs of pleasure shot up his spine every time Maka tapped his handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka heard the moaning. How was he still able to stay in that state of mind if he was in his dark world? \u201cSoul, what\u2019s going on with you?\u201d She repositioned her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul screamed in pleasure. Then it hit him. His handle was his cock, essentially. \u201cMAKA! MY HANDLE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at the handle and was shocked to see it was thicker than usual. The veins were pulsing now for some reason. Then it hit her\u2026 She threw the scythe down. \u201cOh my god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt like his own shaft was being pounded. He moaned even louder now. He was nearing something. He could feeling. \u201cMaka! Stop messing around! This is agonizing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at the scythe. When he was in a heat, the handle became the his shaft. Well, its nerves at least. He sounds like it really hurts.<br>\r\nShe got up and tapped the handle with her finger. She heard Soul yell in pleasure. Yup, its confirmed. And he didn\u2019t know how to help himself! He calls himself cool. He probably didn\u2019t know what it was even for! She sighed and picked up the handle to hear more moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked. She realized she gain revenge for all those times he made fun of her. She fingered the handles slowly. She heard Soul screaming to go hard or something. She tapped it with her fingers and poked at it. Soul was yelling at her, calling her cruel and evil. She smirked \u201cFine then!\u201d She raised took the shaft in two hands and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul had finally found respite. He simply exploded inside his dark world. Something was coming out of him. He could feel it. His balls were tensing and he was trying to help it along. He felt a fluid move up his shaft and fire out continuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the scythe was burning up. Make dropped it and moved away. The veins on the shaft bulged out as they pumped their strange fluid into the blades. The blade\u2019s red color got even redder. The black lighting grew huge. It was flying of the blade and dissipated in the air as magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka could see the lightning crackle and vanish. She could feel the magic now. It was increasing dramatically. Suddenly, she felt something seeping out of her young breasts. A hazy white glow floated around her and dissipated into the air as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they could see it, there was a black cloud floating around the scythe and a white cloud around Maka. The clouds were growing larger and larger until they finally touched. There were sparks has soul energy was released into the air. However, the clouds didn\u2019t form a boundary. They started to circle and rotate as they mixed. It sped up and spun faster and faster. Black and white lighting shot out and jabbed at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Soul\u2019s mind, he was having a world of pleasure. Soon, he started to feel drained. His shaft had gone limp and the liquid had stopped. He sat up and saw a pool of white substance surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the black cloud was dying down as the white cloud started to win. Eventually, the level of magic had gone down low enough that the anti-magic stopped seeping out of Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul collected his mind and sighed. He turned back into a human and lay back. His abused cock lay limp on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was still trying to comprehend the power she just saw in the air. It was crazy, but when she saw Soul again, and he was still naked, she covered her eyes and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein walked in \u201cAnti-Magic presence confirmed. You\u2019re Lord Death\u2019s issue now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Maka a moment to realize it, but she had an Anti-Magic Wavelength! Now she just had to train it. Her chest felt sore, but she was fine otherwise. She smiled \u201cSoul! We can still be partners!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was in a daze as he got over the feeling. He realized what was going on and smiled. \u201cYou better start training soon because I\u2019m not going to wait any long than I have to to become a death scythe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka pouted. \u201cNot even for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul recoiled. Maka never tried to use facial expression to convince him before. (Well\u2026 nothing other than a glare.) Her pouty face shocked him into submission. He grumbled about how all women were evil seductive witches, and they if he slayed enough of then he\u2019d get a witches soul and become a Death Scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled because she knew she won the conversation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It nullifies evil simply by being around it.

There is no other reason needed. No mater how hard she pounds him down, he will always love her. Because he could see deep down (like deep deep deep down) that she still loved him. \u201cMaka.

So what do you want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka cried \u201cI don\u2019t want to mess with my body, but I also want to be with Soul!\u201d She jumped and cried into her dad\u2019s shirt for the first time in years. \u201cPapa! I don\u2019t want too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was shocked, but above all else, he was overjoyed. His daughter had confessed in him.

What is the meaning of this!?\u201d Kid stormed in and walked right through Maka and Soul separating them. They stared at him in shock. \u201cFather! How is it that there was an order of 73 boxes of candles! Huh! Why 73? Why not 74 of 76, or any of the other infinite even numbers! There is absolutely no symmetry in seventy-three! Explain this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Death looked at his son in surprise. Then he replied to the best of his abilities \u201cOOPSIES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid groaned \u201cFather! This is serious! From now on I will take carry of all imports and export transactions. Obviously the men you have hired are unsymmetrical  Neanderthals!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was sitting in his spot thank the heavens for answering his pray. However, that stopped as soon as Maka and Soul stepped closer together again. But then he thanks the heavens again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid turned to storm out, but he was stalled. His eyes widened and stars began to appear in his eyes \u201cThe symmetry!\u201d He laughed as he ran at Soul\u2019s naked sculpted body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul turned away from Maka in time to see Kid. He was about to punch Kid when suddenly, Kid ran around him and disappeared down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWhat the?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the running steps came back. Kid had returned with easel and a blank canvas. He held a tray of paint. The he walked up to Soul \u201cPlease!!!!!! I Beg you, oh master of human symmetry, let me record your perfect shape in a painting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka giggled and Soul was leaning away from the crazed son of the death god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cLook at him. Have some pity Soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at Maka in surprise \u201cYou\u2019re supporting him!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cLook at the bags under his eyes. I doubt he\u2019s been able to sleep since meeting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul saw what she meant. \u201cF-f-f-fine\u2026\u201d He said submitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Soul had vanished from where he stood and appeared on a pre-made platform of symmetrical columns. His arms were on his waist, his head straight forward. His legs spread wide. His cock and balls dangling down the middle. \u201cWhat the! When did this get here. Why\u2026 when did I get on this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid\u2019s face was red \u201cSTOP MOVING AND SHUT IT\u2026 please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s face reveal his anger. He was half tempted to get in the least symmetrical position he knew, but he saw Maka smiling happily, and sighed. He stayed quiet and still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3hrs later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul had fallen asleep standing up with his eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid dropped his brush \u201cIts perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got everyone to wake up. Soul was still asleep, but the disturbance the sound made had made him fall back and fall sleep laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid had painted a picture of Soul in all his naked glory. Every muscle was accented so you could see the change from one ripple to the next. His body was giving off its own light, and it brightened the pillars standing next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka walked over to Soul and tried to get him to wake up, but he wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cSoul! Breakfast is ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Soul jumped off the floor \u201cWhere? I\u2019m starving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath floated up and grabbed Soul\u2019s arm \u201cYou can go eat some after we deal with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul remembered what was going in. \u201cRight. So how do we convert more Magic into muscle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cIts now just muscle. It\u2019ll be like a super puberty. You\u2019ll probably grow every night a few inches. And it\u2019ll speed up with time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul \u201cI can\u2019t let you do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed trying to get Maka to stop herself from stopping him. \u201cYou think I\u2019m doing this for you? That\u2019s funny. I want to be so huge that I won\u2019t need a meister to hunt down a witch. I don\u2019t want you! You\u2019re holding me back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was shocked. She knew he was using reverse-psychology, but his words still stung. She screamed \u201cI hate you!\u201d And she ran out of the room crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit saw his daughter hurt and he glared at Soul. However, his anger didn\u2019t last long. He saw Soul sighing and his personality looked more deflated. He was trying to keep Maka from doing something she didn\u2019t want. He decided to not hate on Soul\u2026 for now. He got up and walked to find and comfort his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cSoul\u2026 are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cI don\u2019t mind being a scythe for the rest of my life. I would get to be with Maka for the rest of my life\u2026 if she decides to come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath thought\u2026 young love\u2026 the good times. Then he returned to reality \u201cVery well. STEIN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein walked into the room holding a cigarette. \u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cWe are going with option two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein raised an eyebrow in surprise, but nodded. \u201cThis is going to hurt\u2026 a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cI\u2019m prepared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cOk. We are going to force your magic to use itself up turning into body mass. This is what we are going to do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul screamed in pain. The most pain he\u2019d felt in\u2026 forever! He had just drunk something that would open his body up to his soul allowing a greater flow between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein stood where he was getting read for phase two. He got a couple needles ready. He would have to inject the next dose to open his body even more and expose more of his soul to his body. He would have to keep going until the magic started to seep into Soul\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Soul had taken 17 injections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein thought: It seems that his larger body needs more than most others. The effect of the solution is dispersed over too much of a large body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was unable to move. His body and soul were burning from the connection that was forcibly increased between his soul and his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cI think we\u2019re almost there. This might be the last one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stared at the cursed needle with hate, but he endured. This was for Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein sighed \u201c8 hours 99 doses. Lets make it 100.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked through his pain. He couldn\u2019t talk, but his eyes showed that he was striving to get this done with. His body was swollen with the amount of fluid in his body. He felt like he would explode, but Stein injected it anyway. Everything grew dark.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt beyond bloated. He felt all puffy and it didn\u2019t feel like his body. He looked up at the face crying over him. \u201cI had a dream where you were screaming while trying to insult me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled but was still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in the infirmary covered in a large blanket. \u201cYour insults were mostly complements. Just letting you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled anyway. He was alive. \u201cThey told me what happened to you. I\u2019m so sorry! I was being so selfish! If I had just gone with the first choice, you wouldn\u2019t be in bed like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cYou mean like you? Was I here for a week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cNo. Just two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s eyes bugged out \u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone opened the door and came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cYes. Two weeks. Your body is still absorbing the left over fluid. Maybe one more night, and you\u2019ll be ready to go. You\u2019ll start seeing the effects in about 1 more week as your body adapts to the larger connections to your soul. The holes are now big enough for the magic to come through, but not stable, so the magic come very slowly into your muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul wondered \u201cI thought my muscles made the magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cThey do, well\u2026 the souls in them do. Then the magic immediately goes to the giant ball of soul you have around you. By the ball, I mean the soul that people like Maka and I can see. What we did yesterday what open your body up to the ball even more than it already was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSo what will we see happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cI predict that first off, he\u2019ll bigger. That much is obvious. However, due to his increasing size, his soul will grow exponentially to match it. Along with that, the larger muscles make more Soul Magic Wavelength. Thus making him grow faster. When you two train, Maka, you\u2019ll now be able to send you soul into Soul without the worry of magical backlash, but Soul\u2019s increased strength should make your blade sharper and larger. Not to mention that his larger soul will try to relieve some built up pressure by leaving through the blades. So any attacks you make will be several times stronger. You might even end up shooting waves of super thin soul that can cut through a lot of material.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and soul looked at each other shocked by the strength they were about to acquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cOh, and Soul. You should eat those souls in your room soon. They shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was shocked. How did he know? Soul grunted his acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cFree!!!\u201d Soul felt amazing now that his body had processed the rest of that stuff, and he was more in tune with his soul now. He could even glint the shape of other souls with a lot of effort. Maybe with some practice, he\u2019d be able to see souls like Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled. While Soul was in the infirmary, she had connected with her dad a bit. She discovered that the only reason he was with other women was because he felt like he lost the two that he wanted most. Once she spent some time with him, he began to drift away from the bar he usually spent time at. Her father even, after a long chat about Soul, had paid for a change of cloths for Soul. Though, he\u2019d probably grow out of them soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked down the halls of DWMA just getting Soul acquainted with the school again. He vanished for 2 weeks. People would be asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was running and ran straight into Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki \u201cBlack Star!!!\u201d Then she saw him face plant himself into Soul\u2019s solid 8-pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked down from his 6ft6in vantage point. \u201cBlack Star?\u201d Then he saw the star on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki ran up and apologized for Black Star\u2019s behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded to the nice weapon. \u201cIts alight. I didn\u2019t feel much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woke Black Star up. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie! I\u2019m the biggest person in the world! I\u2019m going to surpass god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was about to retort, but it wouldn\u2019t be cook to crush someone\u2019s dreams \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t lie, but work a little harder. You might leave a scratch on day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star stared and mumbled. \u201cFine. You\u2019re my rival now. When I beat you. You have to say that I\u2019m the biggest of the big and I and the strongest of the strong. Know one can beat me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled. He felt like a grown man in front of this kid. \u201cFine, and if I beat you, you have two bench press a boulder I pick 300 times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star \u201cFine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul held out a hand \u201cShake on it and don\u2019t break you promise when you have to lift a rock the size of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star laughed \u201cYah right. I need to remember to bring a recorder or something to replay you admitting that I owned you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhat did Stein mean to eat the souls in your room. Does he mean the one at out apartment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul shook his head \u201cWhen we took out all those ifrits, I needed a place to put all the extra souls I didn\u2019t eat. Just in case we messed up again. I though of a room, and a door appeared saying it was my room. I opened it and put them in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSo now he wants you to finish them off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cIt seems like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka walked closer and put a hand on his bicep \u201cWon\u2019t that make you bigger? A lot bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cI guess it would. He made it sound like something even worse would happen if I didn\u2019t finish them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cI guess you better do it then.\u201d Her voice was tainted with sadness and bitterness. This was speeding him up to being unable to be with her in human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cI\u2019ll change into a scythe.\u201d He flashed red and changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind, he was in the dark realm again. He looked around. \u201cI need my room again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a door appeared before him. He opened it and went inside. The souls smelt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cI can\u2019t believe 396 souls fit in you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled. His 8-pack had turned into a 1-pack as it held all those tasty ifrit eggs. \u201cI\u2019m glad they did, or I would have exploded. Its like they fermented inside my room! They tasted so much better than usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed and  saw something. His stomach was visibly shrinking. \u201cYour stomach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked down. He felt it rumble as it digested all the souls in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt like his skin was sucking in something from the air. The pressure kept building up inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul fell to his knees clutching his body. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d It was giving him pain, but his endowment was giving him pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSoul!\u201d What it happening this fast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul suddenly felt his muscles expanding. He heard them stretching with every heartbeat and every breath he took. His bones cracked and stretch as they added height only so he could get more muscle. He saw his pecs grow and grow and grow until he couldn\u2019t see below at all. His arms were being pushed away from his body since his bicep was so huge. His abs popped one by one as they grew huge. His each pack was already larger than Maka\u2019s entire hand. He felt his legs sliding across the floor as they grew longer and his muscled thighs pushed them apart. Suddenly, in a burst of growth, his erect penis shot out smashing into the ground \u201cOh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was crying \u201cSoul\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul couldn\u2019t hear her words through the pain and intense pleasure his huge cock was giving him as he kept growing and growing. His shirt was tearing down his back and with a sudden ripping sound, they fell off. His pants began to tear from the bottom up, and there was a popping sound as the button rocked off. Already leaning over, he was still above Maka\u2019s height. His biceps as large as boulders. His pecs were beach balls. His neck thick enough to be a  middle aged tree. His washboard abs looked like they couch crunch a pipe into pulp. Slowly, his growth slowed and he stood up. His XXL briefs ripped down the middle to reveal an erect 40in erect penis. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSoul! Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul slowly felt the pain and pleasure fade away. When It was gone, he never felt better. He looked around and saw that he was eyelevel with the roof of some of the two floored houses. Maybe 15-20ft. \u201cWhat the.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cYou\u2019re huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked down as sat that Maka only reached up to his thigh. His calf muscle alone could fit her entire body if it was hollow. Now he really felt like a grown man, and Maka seemed no larger than a child of 4in his eyes. Then he saw he was naked and the cloths he just got were all scattered across the floor. \u201cMaka\u2026 can you tell your dad that he shouldn\u2019t get me anymore cloths?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed. Her dad was going to have a fit about this set of cloths, but he\u2019s going to be happy that he never has to buy another set again. \u201cHe\u2019s going to like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked \u201cMost people would. Now lets see if we can ask Death for a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was staring at his cloths in total horror. It had hundreds of shapes organized on it so that it was symmetrical. \u201cDeath\u2026 I can\u2019t wear this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another voice chimed in. Kid \u201cWhy not!!! Do you know how much fabric I had to order!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Soul understood what was going on \u201cDeath\u2026 do didn\u2019t leave him in charge of imports\u2026 did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath sighed \u201cOOPSIES!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed in return. This kid was a maniac! \u201cI guess it\u2019s the only thing I have to wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid was jumping \u201cYes!\u201d Liz was rubbing her forehead from the stress of seeing her meister so thoroughly engross in the giant teen. Patty was just staring wide eyed in amazement as Soul\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul slipped them on right there since there was no place he really could change in private. The cloths felt comfortable. The material let his skin breath. Now if only the design could change. \u201cWell I\u2019m off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid didn\u2019t care if he didn\u2019t get a thank you. He was glad the giant had put it on. \u201cWait!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul paused \u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid ran up his body and fixed the collar of his shirt \u201cOk. Now the other thing I needed to say was this stuff can grow a bit, so it\u2019ll maybe be a 2 weeks before you have to get another pair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at the cloths he was wearing. Maybe that was worth a thanks \u201cK. Bye.\u201d He started moving, and Kid fell of his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSoul! Scythe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s giant body glowed red as he turned into a scythe. He handed coolie into Maka\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was in his dark world and he felt like his original size again. There was nothing to gauge his new height at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at the scythe to check for any changes. The blades were sharper and the black lightning was forming distinct shapes, like death skulls, and then dissipating. Other than that, nothing was new. \u201cLets see if we can do this.\u201d Maka took a swing with the scythe and saw something odd happen to the air. It was like there was an empty pocket of space. Suddenly, the air rushed to fill it pulling Maka forward a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWow. That\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smirked. The blades were so sharp that they cut the air apart. What happens if she added a bit of soul. She sent her soul into the scythe and it came back stronger, but not crazy strong. She took a cut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s soul was huge! It almost equaled that of Death\u2019s giant soul that covered Death City. Now all of it was compressed into his scythe form. What\u2019s that going to do again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka swung at the air and saw something amazing. The blade hummed and lighting sparked. A giant wave of condensed black lightning flew of and through the forest. Hundred of ancient sentinels fell with a single swing of the black and red scythe. Another wave went from the other blade behind her and aimed straight at Death City. There was a flash of red as Death\u2019s soul flared to defend the city. Slowly, the black wave dissipated. \u201cI think we should stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cYah.\u201d But he was flipping out. It was so cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tsubaki and Black star appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki \u201cExcuse us, but Death sent us to tell you two to go up to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul and Maka looked at each other via his blade. Oh dear\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was carrying Soul through Death\u2019s door to go meet him. Once they were through, Soul changed back into his human form. Lord Death, Spirit, and Stein were in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cLord Death. You wanted to see us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath waved his giant hand \u201cHello! Yes, I did.\u201d He was cheery, but the other two were more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit turned to her daughter. He wasn\u2019t mad at her, but he was a bit anxious. \u201cThere as a large army being led here by Mosquito. They have numbers in the hundreds of thousands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cMost appear to be weak ifrits, but some will pose a challenge. He has petitioned for the air of the witches, and they have agreed. They\u2019ll overwhelm us with their magic and their numbers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cBut won\u2019t Death\u2019s defenses keep most of them away? It stopped our attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath sighed the way he did \u201cYes\u2026 it did. But at what cost do you think?\u201d He was trying to imply something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka felt the tension \u201cIt weakened you defenses? How much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201c80%. The witches can easily over power the last 20%.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka cried \u201cPapa. Is it true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit nodded sadly. \u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t this way Maka.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they head a loud, deep scoff \u201cWorrying about nothing as usual. Maka and I can handle all of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThe witches can probably defend themselves against your magic dense attacks. They\u2019ll slip through and attack the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath asked  \u201cStein\u2026 the day you met Maka and Soul, what color were their blades?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled \u201cThat\u2019s right. I had forgotten about that. You two can perform witch hunter and genie hunter. Though, I believe that the genies have all been sealed away. I haven\u2019t heard about them in a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhat\u2019s witch hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was simply glowing now. His daughter can perform witch hunter! \u201cYou mother could do that. It was a dazzling sight to behold. It is a special wavelength of soul that is the inverse of the wavelength of a witch\u2019s wavelength. This makes it highly effective against witches. As is Genie Hunter against Genies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and Soul looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cAnd I think they can go to Kishin hunter now. If they tried going farther.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cTh-Th-The Kishin Hunter that only Death could use last time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cBut the attack will be stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was curious \u201cKishin? What\u2019s that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath waved his hands \u201cNo need to worry about them. They are all dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul knew he was hiding something, but what would he do against a Death God? He sighed and put the thought aside \u201cWhatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cHow long do we have before they arrive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThe witches are gathering slowly. They are generally independent of each other, so they may take a week or two. Mosquito is preparing to awaken the mother of all weapons from her slumber, a witch who delved into the fusion of body, soul, and weapon. That\u2019s why they exist today. However, she is insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul scoff and though. You\u2019re one to talk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul then remembered his question \u201cHey, Stein. Why did you tell me to eat the souls in my room? Now I\u2019m huge!\u201d He did a bicep flex to prove his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein sighed \u201cIfrit eggs begin to develop more and drain soul energy from their surroundings. As time goes on, they grow huge. Your room would not have been able to contain them all. A weapon had tried and died as his soul room fell apart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was stunned \u201cOh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein sighed \u201cBut now, the soul room has grown huge to fit you inside of it, so you can let the souls stay in there if you want. However, since your soul is so dense, they will grow that much faster. I wouldn\u2019t leave them there for more than two of three months before the grow to larger for your room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cNow we don\u2019t have to worry about feeding me as much. I just need a stead supply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled \u201cYah\u2026 an exponentially increasing supply. The more you eat, the more you grow, and the hungrier you can get. I\u2019d stay on regular food as long as possible. Oh\u2026 I wish I could cut you up and see what you\u2019re made of. Maybe even a way to better feed those muscles of yours. What do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul freaked \u201cNuh-uh. Keep your medical knives to yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein looked down deflated. Then he sprang up again \u201cBack to Mosquito. He is trying to awaken Arachne, a witch who created the Weapons. Her first was her most powerful, a scythe. She infused her magic blood into a human and melded the human together with a scythe of her own creation. She had made a Death Scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath weapons are stronger than regular weapons because they have obtained the magic wavelength of a witch\u2019s soul. This completes them and makes them similar to the first weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, you are NOT a Death Weapon because you have magic in your soul now. It is not a witch\u2019s magic wavelength. You have a Magic Maker and a strong Sorceress Cat soul. They are not witches, but they are the watered down off spring of them. They are free to do as they will though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cWell, you said that some witches were coming, so I now I don\u2019t need to go hunting for one myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cYes\u2026 but please only eat one if you can. I would like to make them a prize for students who work above and beyond at DWMA. I hope it will create many more amazing Meister and Weapon teams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cI\u2019ll try, but don\u2019t hate me if I eat a dozen. I bet hundreds are coming, so it won\u2019t really matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath\u2019s circles mouth widened \u201cSure. But don\u2019t exterminate them alright? The head witch would be very pissed at me if you killed all her distant offspring. Plus, we need witches for future Death Weapons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cWhatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was thinking about Genies for some reason \u201cWhat happens if a weapon eats a Genie\u2019s soul as their 100th soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cFirst off, it would kill them if they hadn\u2019t become a Death Weapon yet. And if they had, then I don\u2019t know. It has yet to have been done. But I would assume that they would ascend about a witch\u2018s power and become god like\u2026 or more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked as he now had a new goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cThough they are all sealed. Why weren\u2019t they exterminated?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath sighed \u201cThey were sealed before a Weapon was made, so Genie hunter had not existed. And the seals I placed were far to strong to break, so why kill them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s inner smile widened. He would get it to be the greatest weapon ever\u2026 though he kind of already was. \u201cI should get 4 more souls before they come so I can become a death scythe when they arrive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded at Soul \u201cYah. We\u2019ll get that stuff out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath looked at Stein \u201cCan you prepare the students for battle? Show then the layout and get some practice in before they fight for real. Witches are clever and can most likely dupe most of out students. I don\u2019t want to lose any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cI understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cI\u2019ll go call in the other Death Weapons. They have experience with witches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath nodded \u201cSo it begins again\u2026\u201d His eyes look off in the distance as he recalled old memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cSpirit! Focus!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit felt the madness being emitted by the thickly clothed monster \u201cThe Kishin\u2026 he ate his Weapon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cI know\u2026 We have to stop him before he takes any more human souls!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cUnderstood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath at this time, had a scarier mask, unlike his smooth and almost comical mask he will have later on. Suddenly, Kishin sent a cloth off in the distance. It was aimed at a kid. It happened so fast, Death was unable to stop it, and the kid died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was boiling with rage. Death\u2019s eyes flared with angry fire unlike the  half circles of fury he had today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cDeath! Now. End it all now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Death and Spirit shoved all of their soul into his blade turning it into a Kishin Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cClass\u2026 we will begin soul team resonance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cYou will team up. There will be three meisters per team. Maka, Kid, and Black Star. You three will work together.\u201d And then he moved onto the next set of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star looked at the Scythe Maka was holding. So he got that big? Well, I\u2019ll just have to get bigger (Figuratively. As in stronger).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki was good friends with Maka, so she liked this pair up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid\u2019s eyes were sparkling. He looked at the Scythe in Maka\u2019s hands. He mumbled \u201cSymmetry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz sighed and Patty was smiling the cheerful smile she usually smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was thinking\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was a skinny kid, but had the strength of a tank and speed of a jaguar. His weapon, Tsubaki, was the most diverse and unique of all since she had multiple forms. Kids was the Son of the Death God. His weapons, Liz and Patty, were a powerful pair when they were together. Not many weapons worked as duets. And of course she had her anti-magic wavelength and Soul was\u2026 well he was soul. You know the reason. This was an assault team. They\u2019d go out and cause as much destruction in the enemy lines that it gives the other students a shot as survival. Smart\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul had come to a similar conclusion, but he felt like the symmetrical guy and everyone else would hold her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cAlright.

You\u2019re soul is overwhelming us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka yelled \u201cIts not mine! Its Soul\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was pushing his soul as far as it cold go, and Tsubaki helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSoul, bring it down more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep it down, but my soul can\u2019t shrink any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein jumped in \u201cEnough. We will stop now. Come back in an hour and we\u2019ll see if anything changes.\u201d He was implying that they think about how to improve \u201cThink back to your partners\u2026 Do your souls match perfectly in strength and size? How do souls resonate?\u201d He looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cBy understanding the soul\u2026 When you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid \u201cTheir souls grind against each other\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki whispered something into Black Star\u2019s ear \u201cAnd then they end up pushing against the other souls, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz \u201cIf we understand each other\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked \u201cI won\u2019t have to shrink my soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cWe can let the souls vibrate together and merge into a larger entity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled \u201cSo do you really have to exert force on your souls by increasing or suppressing them to much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty jumped \u201cNO!\u201d</span></div></div>",

He was playing battle strategies in his head when he heard the kids again. \u201cYou back. Ready to begin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all gave him a determined look. Soul with his arms crossed. He had a casual look of indifference, but he could feel that they understood him to a reasonable level, and he felt the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Weapons turned into weapons and landed in their Meister\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cBegin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind rushed as their souls expanded. They grew in size as their resonance rate powered up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, their souls touched and there were sparks. They were still off. They didn\u2019t match enough yet, but they were determined to get it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Soul\u2019s dark world, he decided to relax. He went in and found a large chair to sit in. He listened his record player and began to hum along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka, outside heard the tune, and found herself humming along for some reason. He soul pulsed to the rhythm of the tune. Her soul swelled and shrink with the song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein was sitting down against a tree. His hair waving in the wind created by the souls. He looked at the blue soul surrounding her. He looked up and saw the boundary of Soul\u2019s soul\u2026 it was massive and it pulsed with his humming. Interesting. Soul resonance created by song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in Kid and Black Star\u2019s mind they heard a distant humming and found themselves humming along. Their weapons soon joined them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a giant gust of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein looked at the kids and found that their souls were gone. He looked up and saw why. The soul boundary from before had tripled and it was pulsing with their humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled \u201cTeam Resonance Complete. Congratulations.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He saw the Death Weapons stand their ground, but they were all shocked by His size. He smirked. I look so cool! They can\u2019t even talk. Or it could be this shirt. To much symmetry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I don\u2018t want to bother to much with intros and dialogue.

Scythe!\u201d Her face was burning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul had had a growth spurt last night growing another foot taller, and his muscles exploding out even huger. The cloths that Kid had made covered most of his body, but one part grew more than the others. A giant 6ft long 2ft wide snake hung between Soul\u2019s massively muscled legs. He turned into a scythe if only to keep Maka from going crazy with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grunted and sighed. Maka is resistant. Must be her dad\u2019s doing. Seeing him cheat on other women for so long has driven her away from a relationship. He recalled the day he chose to grow this huge\u2026 Oh well. Its still worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath City\u2019s alarms wailed \u201cAll citizens make way to the Center Tower. Make way to the Center Tower.

Her thrones had webs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito bowed \u201cArachne\u2026 we are 3hrs away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled and whispered to someone \u201cI will free you soon my husband\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An army of now nearly 1million ifrits, 300 witches, and something unknown are headed this way. We must ready ourselves. For the past 11 days, you all have undergone training to work as teams. Let it be known, if you can not do this, you can not fight as of now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some gasps and groans from with in the crowd. Someone yelled \u201cWhy not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cThe ifrits were created by Mosquito tainting humans with his ifrit blood. As they Turned, they develop hard skin that can not be broken by any weak soul resonances. Therefore, the only way we could over come that was to have you all work in teams to boost resonance rates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome kids at that moment decided to work on it with in Death City to join the fray outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was in human form and he spoke with Death telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cYo! Soul!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cLord Death, I need you help. I have a plan to bring down their numbers, but we\u2018ll need to resonate souls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath paused \u201cI haven\u2019t done that in ages. Not even with Spirit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. Just go with the flow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito \u201cArachne, we are almost within range. Should we charge forward?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne waved a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito turned to a henchman and the word spread to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrina used her ability to map out large areas \u201cThey\u2019re in range!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit yelled \u201cFire!\u201d And a dozen Death Missiles fired off into the distance (They were the cones that stuck out of Death City and appeared to have no purpose.) \u201cNow go! Quickly while they are disorganized!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of DWMA students yelled as they charge out with their team. Giant team soul resonance flaring ready to meet the opposing side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, Maka, Kid, etc\u2026 stayed for a bit at Death\u2019s request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath was holding Soul as a scythe. \u201cHow much control do you have over the lighting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed \u201cDo you see the Death Skulls on my blade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath nodded \u201cYes. They are rather smooth and not jagged like last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cEver since my body opened up to my soul more, I could manipulate the lighting better, plus I\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cOkey dokey!\u201d He began to spin the blades above his head more and more. Black lighting spread out over the blades. Death shoved his soul in, and Soul sent it back full throttle. Then Death sent it back in, but moved it to the blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opposing army was closing in. Their numbers were overwhelming the meager 300 students. Suddenly, for miles, all of the sky was covered by a giant red disc of soul power. There were Death Skulls made of black lighting. Suddenly, the skulls exploded, each turning into a thousand bolts of black lighting. It rained down on the enemy closely avoiding DWMA students. Red/pink molten souls numbering in the hundreds of thousands floated around when suddenly, another surge of lighting came down and grabbed them all. There was still about 30000 ifrits left. Its only a 100 souls per student if they kill them off equally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in Death\u2019s room dropped to the ground when the attack went off. Well, except for the death weapons and Stein. They stood casually and watched as 97% of the opposing forces got vaporized and 970000 souls flew into the room entering the scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid knew the source of this power \u201cThis was the power of Symmetry! Nothing else could have done that much damage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito was having a fit. He had killed the guards he had around him and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled \u201cMosquito\u2026 please control yourself around me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito froze and regained composure \u201cYes Arachne. Shall I send in the witches?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne waved her hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrina \u201cThe witches are flying in. The students are all preoccupied!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was holding Soul now \u201cReady to become a Death Weapon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked in his dark world \u201cI\u2019ve eaten the 4 souls I need. Now its just a witch\u2019s soul.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir team heads out while Black Star yelled \u201cYOOHOO!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got out, they saw a scene filled with souls floating around. Soul ignored them and focused on the witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey screamed as they resonated their soul to match each other. Soul was humming, and everyone joined him. There was an explosion of wind as Soul\u2019s giant soul merged all of their souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon saw hundred of spells flying at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid removed those by firing hundred of massive souls bullets. They were hundreds of times larger than before because of the team resonance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was speedily dancing around a pair of witches and sliced through them while they were disorientated\u2026 hmm\u2026 weak witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul, and the nodded. The blades of the scythe exploded in size. Their were rainbows of blue hues and white veins running across the surface of both blades. \u201cWitch Hunter!\u201d Then Maka sliced at the air send waves of blue anti-witch waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unsuspecting witches fell 100 in a single moment. They never knew what hit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sent out dozens of lightning bolts to acquire the purple souls before Maka sent off another wave that killed 50.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all the witches screamed in rage. The pooled their magic together and formed a giant circle around the Scythe wielder. The magic in the air was getting denser and denser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka new what was going to happen. Her breast started to ooze anti-magic. \u201cSoul! I\u2019m going to push anti-magic into you. Ok?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded, and a second later. His Red and Black blades began to glow white with anti-magic. A wave of white light sliced through the remaining witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cReady to become a Death Scythe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled in return. He reached for a purple soul in his now glowing world of souls. He found the largest one he could and ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka saw the scythe begin to glow even redder. Sparks of lighting shot out. The other blades (the ones that popped out of the original) popped out and sparked. Black lightning was lashing out from the blades. Maka saw the handle swell and fluid gush through them. She thought\u2026 so this is how he feels when ever he eats a soul\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was moaning loudly in his deep voice. His large body was growing larger with every breath. Already, he was 20ft tall and his muscles were largely disproportionate to his height. His penis was an 8ft hot rod with so much heat coming off it that steam was floating away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka needed Soul awake and conscious if she was going to fight with him. She decided to speed him along and she squeezed the handle like never before, and basically abused it as she tried to get Soul off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul could feel every hit like it was to his real body. In second\u2019s a volcano of white lava shot out of his shaft in an almost endless stream. After a moment, it dies down, and his 35ft body lay still from exhaustion. His now 11ft long 3ft wide flaccid cock lay limp next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got up, he could feel the witch\u2019s soul magic coursing through huge veins \u201cMaka!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared in shock as Maka abused the handle of her scythe. Was she ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she turned to face them \u201cSoul\u2019s a Death Scythe now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul yelled in his even deeper, and in Maka\u2019s opinion, sexier voice \u201cWhat are you guys staring for! Go help everyone out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito was about to have another fit, but he remembered Arachne asked him to stop it. \u201cArachne, the witches have all been killed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne sighed \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to send him in after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito grinned evilly \u201cOnly you can control it? With you magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled \u201cI\u2019ve been saving this to get my husband.\u201d She took out a small lamp and pooled magic into her hands. She rubbed the seals off of the lamp and smoke started to come out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maka would like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had finished off their ifrits and began to walk back to Death City when it alarms wailed \u201cAll Meister and Weapons return!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was shocked, but obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was about to go back to, but Soul stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath spoke to Soul \u201cThey want you to eat 99 more witchs\u2019 souls. There is a genie out there. Genie hunter won\u2019t work at the level you two are at, so you have to do it. You\u2019ll get huge, but once you get the Genie Soul, you can eat it and make three wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul relayed the info to Maka. \u201cSo should we do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was smiling. Soul could wish to be normal sized again, and they could stay together as humans. \u201cDo it! We have to get that soul. And why 99 witch souls? Why not 100?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul shrugged \u201cHe didn\u2019t explain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka heard a rumble as smoke rose into the sky. \u201cSoul. Start eating!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka had dropped the scythe and started stomping on its handle now. The genie was getting closer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was a god basically. He had just finished his 99th witch soul and thanks to the Magic Maker soul, the witch souls\u2019 magic had been amplified. The 1st soul he ate made him shoot up 20ft. The next 40ft, then  80, 160, etc. His size was massive. He would be a planet himself if he was in human form. (calculator said about 1.27 x 10^31 feet tall). His muscles we so huge, that he looked like a giant clumpy ball of slightly tan white skin and flash! Oh, and with a giant mountain that went off into space with two moons attached. Luckily, he had moved all the souls into his room before hand, or they would have been crushed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbiting him would be a giant gushing ring of steaming godhood juices. There would be a sign that said \u201cWelcome to Planet Soul!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was using her famous \u201cMAKA CHOP!\u201d on the handle with all her strength. The blades had stopped sparking with lighting. Instead now, there was a Red and Black aura that circled around the entire Scythe. The blades themselves looked like there was solidified lighting on at with molten magma right under it. The handle was a black with veins that appeared to be carrying red lava through it into the blades. Slowly, the swollen handle deflated along with Soul\u2019s horniness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was just barely able to think straight through all the pleasure he had felt. \u201cMaka\u2026 Now\u2026 Attack now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka picked up the scythe and a ball of red and black aura surrounded her. It was a ball of Soul\u2019s soul energy. Maka looked around trying to see the Genie, but it had vanished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cIt went underground! I can sense it digging beneath Death City.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka groaned. She had let it get away while the was getting Soul off. She took the scythe and sliced at the ground. The wave of soul exited so fast that they hadn\u2019t even seen it. Now there was a giant abyss in front of them that went straight under Death City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a giant ear drum splitting scream. The only reason Maka was unharmed was because of the dense soul aura around her. She charged in. The occasional red aura floated in front of her eyes lighting her way. Then she entered an enormous cave system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie had lost a right hand, right leg and a left foot. Now it was a just a giant Black being that writhed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cMaka! Finish it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka didn\u2019t need to be told twice. She sliced again and everything in front of her was chopped in half. The wave had cut through everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Genie froze. It was commanded by that witch to go get someone down here that was sealed away, but now it simply stopped caring. It looked at its slayers and let out a humored laugh. Children\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it split apart down the middle and dissolved to reveal a Black Genie Soul (There are 8 Genie souls\u2026 Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, white, and black). All genie souls start out as red, but as they grow stronger, they move up the rainbow. Most didn\u2019t survive being hunted down for wishes, so the black was the rarest, but also the most powerful for the genie souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scythe sent out black lightning and took the black genie soul.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The scythe started to glow red and black. The aura around her fired beams of red and black soul. Maka was making her way out of the tunnel. It seems unstable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was exploding in growth again. He is planet sized body expanded. He felt oceans of muscles tear apart and heal repeatedly all in seconds. Quickly, he doubled his size, and then tripled it. But it didn\u2019t stop. The Magic Maker soul amplified the Magic Genie soul so that it was 1000x stronger than it was before. Soul kept growing and growing. Soon he matched the larger planets. Suddenly, in one final explosion of growth, he grew to match a star in size. He was massive beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was griping the handle as she ran up the abyss that was starting to cave in. Her grip was really strong as she feared she might drop her partner, and lose him forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was moaning in lust as he felt his solar system sized cock get squeezed by a monster grip. He felt the pressure in his balls building to unbearable level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at the handle and saw that the fluid it transferred was being halted by her hand. She loosened it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul screamed in agony as his balls screamed for release. Suddenly, it came. A star system worth of cum was ejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka saw the scythe glowing even brighter, and suddenly it soul expanded pushing the dirt above her even higher than before. It kept going and going until it broke to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was panting. His balls were drained. He began to think clearly. \u201cMaka\u2026 what\u2019s going on out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka panted from exhaustion. She avoided dozens of cave ins on the way up, but the scythe had saved her in the end. \u201cNothing. I finally got us out. How did the genie taste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cLike concentrated dopamine (the happy chemical your brain releases.)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka whistled \u201cBig words\u2026 Wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201ctalking about big. Guess how big I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cA mountain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed \u201cA star bigger than our sun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka flipped \u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cBut not for long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled. He was about to make a wish. I hope he thought them through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul took a deep breath and started on his first wish \u201cI wish that I was compressed into a size that I wanted to be at (and survive the compression)\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka remembered that he still had to worry about weight and gravity. She reminded him before he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201c\u2026 and that I weighed and had as much of a gravitational pull that was relative to the size of my body.\u201d (Was that one wish with multiple requirement? Was that allowed?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt like someone was pushing in on him from all directions. His sun sized body shrank down until it was a larger than average sized kid his age. (I\u2018m just going to say 13 because they seem like 13yo). He was now 6ft6in tall, which was about 1ft3in above average. And his body was this picture, but brought up to scale at his taller height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://th04.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2010/169/d/4/MuscleUp_Soul_Eater_by_lingdingyi.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://th04.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, Soul looked himself over and was smiling. At least he was still ripped and cool looking. Something was of though, his arms felt weightless. Then it hit him. \u201cMaka\u2026 I still have my strength from when I was star sized. Any ideas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake thought about it \u201cLets go ask Stein first. He\u2019ll know more about what we need to incorporate into your second wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded and turned back into a human. He decided to see how fast and strong his body was. He pick Maka up like she was nothing, and bolted for Death\u2019s room. In a flash, he vanished and appeared in Death\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cOHHHH! Maka\u2026 Soul\u2026 good job beating the genie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria noticed \u201cAnd you aren\u2019t a giant like before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and Soul smiled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cHow many of the three have you used?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cOnly one. I can still feel that I have two more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cGood. You\u2019ll need those two for what I need to tell you. By now, you can see that you have strength that is greater than a body at that size should have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cSo that has to be limited. Two, you probably have not noticed that your soul has grown tremendously, and not much of it us being used for any purpose. So I propose two wishes. One is to limit you strength to the size of your body, and two is to compress your soul so that it hangs closer to your body. This makes you soul super dense, so it creates even stronger cuts from your blade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhy not have a seal instead? So that he can use his strength if he needs to. And as for his blades, maybe being to strong of a cut is bad. What if it cuts the earth in half?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of that? Let me reword my options. One is to have a seal on your body that can control your physical strength and soul density. And\u2026 now you have a third wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cCool. I wish I had a seal that could control my physical strength and soul density.\u201d Suddenly, a tattoo appeared on the sides of his left and right forearm. The left one was the image of Soul\u2019s soul shape, and the other one was a picture of Soul flexing his muscles. He instinctively put his hands over them and pressed down on the tattoos. They glowed as they were activated. Soul felt his limbs gain some weight and his soul being squished down around his body until it had a 5ft radius (A solar system sized soul was compressed that much!). He punched the floor cracking a tile, but nothing else. \u201cIt seems like It worked, though I didn\u2019t feel anything. My skin feels so dense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka reached out and touched it \u201cBut its so smooth and soft, but when I press down, I can feel your hard muscle. It feels harder than normal muscles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cBecause I compacted it down.\u201d He flexed and they bulged larger than they should have \u201cI can grow to a size that I want to. So my muscles can be larger than they really are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka reached out a hand and tried to squeeze the bicep, but it was un-phased. She sighed as she let go \u201cSo what\u2019s your third wish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed \u201cI wish for cloths that can grow with me and that they are indestructible, and as some bonuses, they have pockets that never run out of room and I can change their design at will, and that they were always clean! After weeks in fear of losing his cloths again, he knew that this was his only chance as getting the prefect set. Suddenly, a pair of cargo pants, shoes, socks, a sleeveless-t, a pair of briefs, and a leather jacket appeared. \u201cSweet. They look so cool.\u201d He put them on his naked body. Now I look cooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else in the room sighed as he put the cloths on. They agreed that it was a wish worth making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Soul remembered a question that had been bugging him \u201cWhy 99 witch souls again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein looked at Lord Death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cBecause you are now the first and only Shinigami Scythe/weapon to ever exist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul paused \u201cI\u2019m a what!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul \u201cDoes that mean he\u2019s like a god now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cI don\u2019t know. He has a soul that is greater than even mine. Does that make him greater than a god?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWill he live forever like you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d he saw Maka get ready for another question \u201cI don\u2019t know much more than anyone else on this subject. He is the first, so we\u2019ll have to figure it out as we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked over his body. It was certainly godlike in his opinion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I assure you of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne sighed. It had taken her a good century for her to find that genie and nurture it into a black one\u2026 and it took all of an hour for it to die\u2026 \u201cNo\u2026 no\u2026 just start looking for lamps.

They tore the earth apart with a single swipe! That\u2019s my Maka\u2026 and that Soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath nodded slowly \u201cThe genie was able to weaken my seal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit\u2019s face grew serious \u201cI thought they killed him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cThey did, but not before he began unraveling the seals I had placed. They have been loosened enough to be broken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cAre we ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cHis body is similar to Soul\u2019s in where it keeps growing. The human souls he consumed turned into Soul Energy and very little went to growing his body. He has spent that last 1000 years growing like that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit shuddered in anger as he recalled the hated memories of what that thing had done to all those innocent children \u201cMy Maka will not face that thing. I refuse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath sighed \u201cI knew you\u2019d feel like that. I want the same thing. To not involve anyone with that demon. But Spirit\u2026 if we don\u2019t, then we will die this time. I guarantee it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit smiled \u201cAnd we\u2019ll bring him down with us. Besides, we have some great successors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath smiled as he imagined Kid wielding Soul as his Death Weapon. Though, he\u2019d be distracted on multiple occasions by Soul\u2019s ever changing symmetry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cYou blades are oozing red and black condensed soul energy. It looks kind of like blood is dripping off of them. Though, the dissipate as soon as they fall off the blade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cI must look like the Nastiest Scythe in the world! I simply ooze coolness now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka it is kind of cool she thought, but equally scary. She would never want to be the person who had to face Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cYour blades are sharper too. I wonder what that does? If they get any sharper, they\u2019ll start splitting atoms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled evilly \u201cWhat happens then? They aren\u2019t going to explode. The neutrons and protons aren\u2019t been ripped apart. They are just getting sliced down the middle.\u201d He really wanted to try out a cut. \u201cLets give it a shot. For science, or whatever you call it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed. \u201cFine\u2026 but if anyone dies, its your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cI can deal with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka shook her head. \u201cOk. Lets give this a shot.\u201d She raised the scythe and cut at the air in front of her. A thin wave of condensed soul shot out so fast that it was invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the air in front of her split apart and light flooded out of the whole in space. It expanded, and suddenly, a giant 50ft diameter ifrit soul come through it. Then suddenly, the portal closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stared at it wide eyed. \u201cHow... What\u2026 ???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was equally amazed. Where did this soul come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThere are things that need to be discussed. Follow me. Soul\u2026 put that soul in your room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cThey did what!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThey brought a soul back from the Underworld.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhat is that place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cAll living things that die natural deaths have their souls brought to the underworld by natural forces. There is no good or bad. It simply is. They float in Underworld space and ferment and grow over time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cHow old what that soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cMaybe 50 years. Maybe 60. The ones that are really old are the size of large planets or small stars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was amazed \u201cHow did this ifrit die a natural death? It was huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cI put it there. What are we supposed to do with all the souls that aren\u2019t eaten by Weapons? Most don\u2019t give it away so that weapons can develop their abilities, so they give it to me. I remember a long time, an asteroid hit the Earth killing everything. The only reason the planet was not destroyed was because a Genie had accidentally gotten in the way of it. There are actually a few genie souls in the underworld despite the fact that they live forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cSo why haven\u2019t you used them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath smiled \u201cIt was a genius system to maintain order. Souls can go in, but souls can\u2019t come out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cUntil today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cIt means that Soul\u2019s blades are sharp enough to temporarily sever the rules of the universe. Nothing short of that could get that soul out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mood was tense and serious. Everyone was anxious. Suddenly, a loud rumble shook Death\u2019s Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s face was red as he held his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cYou should go eat that Ifrit soul. Nothing else can fill you up now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s gut bulged out like it held a baby. He burped and sighed in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath and Spirit was shocked by what they just saw. It just wasn\u2019t possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein had even lifted an eyebrow in his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cCould you have eaten that another way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cNope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito \u201cWe have found a dozen genie sealing sights, but we are not able to approach them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled \u201cI thought so\u2026 Take me to them.

Now, it has grown strong enough to break free. And also because the Genie you two killed had weakened Death\u2019s seals before it was killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul scoffed \u201cI could just cut it to pieces right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit sighed at Soul\u2019s arrogance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein stepped in \u201cHis strength grew slowly because a large percent of it was sealed away. Once the seal is gone, the Kishin\u2019s strength will increase dramatically. It will have surpassed you at by at least 1000x.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was shocked. He had had total confidence in his strength as the strongest weapon ever made, but now, a meister gone mad had surpassed him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cIs there a way to beat it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cOnly one. Soul has to eat the souls of 34 genies. If the Kishin is killed, its soul will grow stronger as it ferments, and it will releases a strong wavelength of madness. 99 wishes will be used up when Soul eats the Kishin soul to contain and absorb it. I\u2019ll tell you what to make for the two of the three wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing that those Genies were awakened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka thought about \u201cBut it can be bad if the Kishin got its hands on those souls first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cYes. So you two will begin to travel and hunt down those genies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath finally had the strength to stand \u201cNo need. They are coming to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was looking off into the distance. She saw giant black souls making their way towards Death City. This made it easy for them, but the bad news is that there are only 30 of them. They needed 4 more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Maka looked again and saw something different. The 30 souls had combined into 1 giant soul. Whatever they were facing, they\u2019d need to go all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito \u201cIt is truly magnificent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMosquito had seen how the rainbow of genies had fast forwarded through their growth because of Arachne. Then he saw her cast a spell that combined their bodies until it was huge. \u201cThere is nothing that can kill it now. Not even that scythe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled. She had used up almost all of her magic creating this one giant genie, but it will be needed to strengthen her husband. He never did like to have to many small packages. One giant one was always what he liked best. My husband will rise soon and he will eat his post nap snack. He will enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cAre you ready soul? They are almost here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cLets go.\u201d He turned into a scythe. The blades were gushing liquid soul energy now. The density had increased dramatically since he had the genie soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sprinted into the woods toward the giant black soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne sat down waiting. Her husband would soon awaken. Very soon, and those children will have no way of stopping him. They can not hope to harm this genie. She had added a surprise to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the kids jumped into the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul said in his deep voice \u201cYou can do this Maka.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cLets go.\u201d She jumped with the aid of Soul\u2019s soul energy. They soured through the air and she send out waves of compressed soul energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(NOTE: I JUST REALIAZED HOW MUCH THESE ATTACKS ARE PARALLELING BLEACH. I DO NOT OWN BLEACH!!!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crescent waved of black soul hit the Genie and shatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and Soul \u201cWhat!\u201d Then they heard a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne was sitting and amplifying her voice with magic \u201cYou two will fail against the might of 30 genies! Don\u2018t fret to much. The genie is not so different from you, weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and Soul heard a sound and their heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie\u2019s arm had turned into a pure black scythe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then it turned its other arm into a scythe and struck from the other side. Make repositioned the opposite blade to block it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSoul! Are you holding up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt his skin burning from the abusive grinding \u201cI\u2019m fine! We have to do something.

They managed to escape the dead lock of the two giant scythes. Quickly, the counter attacked with a barrage of swings from their blade. One by one they flew at the Genie and hit it. Most left it unphased, but it got a nick of two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cThis isn\u2019t enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul them remembered the time Maka was spinning him like crazy above her head. His magic was overwhelming her Anti-magic. \u201cThat\u2019s it! Maka! Pump your anti-magic into only one of my blades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka didn\u2019t need to ask. She suddenly realized the logic and reasoning. \u201cSoul! You\u2019re a genius!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul yelled \u201cTell me that after we kill it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie was looming over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stood her ground and began to channel her anti magic wavelength into on of Soul\u2019s blades. Quickly, its ominous appearance faded into a brilliant white light. Half the handle was black, and the other white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was moving all the magic wavelength he had into the other handle turning it pitched black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scythe in her hand was starting to vibrate as the two conflicting wavelengths tried to eat at each other. She raised the scythe above her head and began to spin it. Quickly, sparks of white and black lashed out at the air. Anti-magic and magic oozed out of the blade turning each other into soul energy. It kept building up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne saw what they were doing. \u201cNo! what are you doing!\u201d The boy had magic? The girl had anti-magic? How did this happen! Why Isn\u2019t that weapon exploding into pure soul energy?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie sensed a threat and stuck at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Black and White blades expanded until the formed a full circle. It looked exactly like a Yin-Yang symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, Kid woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz \u201cSomething wrong Kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid sighed \u201cI felt a disturbance in the symmetry of the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symbol flared above them blocking the Genie\u2019s attack. Suddenly, the scythe was thrown off by a strong surge of soul energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was to focused on her task to notice any changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was trying his hardest not to let his body rip in two. He could feel that his two blades were chasing each other, and his handle was just barely containing both forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka felt the blade get lifted. It was her chance. She jumped and threw her spinning scythe. The symbol spun faster and faster and it spun right through the body of the Genie like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts body dissolved revealing 30 large black souls<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack lighting struck out and all the souls vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne was frozen in shock. Her husband\u2019s welcome back present was gone! She glared at the two \u201cYou will both pay. My husband\u2019s wrath will reign down on you like nothing else. Not even those 30 souls will help you.\u201d With that, she vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cMAKA!!! Good job!\u201d He ran full sprint to his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka expected a full blown hug, but she felt a hand fall on her head patting it. \u201cPapa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit sighed \u201cI know you didn\u2019t appreciate me hugging you out of know where. So I\u2019m going to pat you instead.\u201d He smiled. Then it turned to shock. Maka had latched onto him and hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was waiting on eating the genie souls until he got the last 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein looked at Death \u201cWill you allow it this once?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath sighed \u201cIts not like they are being used for anything else. They just float and grow fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cSoul! Maka! We need to open a gate to the underworld again, and obtain the 4 genie souls that are there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was surprised, but he was fine with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhy not look for four of them here on earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThere are currently no black ones. The wishes of the black genie soul is unbelievable more powerful. However, in the underworld, the four souls there have fermented and have grow into powerful giant black genie souls. They will serve out purposes better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded understandingly \u201cHow will we bring just the genie souls and not the other souls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cSoul will send out black lightning to locate and acquire the souls. Its should be a fairly simple task. Nothing dangerous lives in the underworld besides souls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul turned into a scythe \u201cLets do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a focused slash, a hole in space was made. Lighting surged into it, and suddenly, the lighting was gone. The hole began to shrink and vanish all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cNow, you eat them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s dark world was filled by four giant black souls and 30 small ones. Also, he had snuck a few large ifrit souls through and put them in his room if he got hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started to eat\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at the handle as it swelled in her hand. \u201cLord Death, could you use your famous Shinigami Chop on Soul\u2019s handle? Please don\u2019t ask why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath\u2019s mouth shrank to a curious \u201co\u201d, but he did as she asked. His hand and arm expanded \u201cSHINIGAMI CHOP!\u201d His hand smashed down on the handle of the scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul fainted\u2026 (from pleasure of course).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at the scythe as sparks flew off of it. Maka had to move away. The soul density was to uncontrolled for her to be near it. Suddenly, the scythe was enveloped in a black ball of soul. Then beams of black nothingness shot out in all directs and began to move to the top of the sphere. They combined and focused into a giant black soul beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was barely awake now. He had just finished eating the small souls. Now it was time for a big one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scythe\u2019s handle engorged itself even further as even more fluid was transferred through. The black beam had just exploded in power. A spiral ring of blades appeared from it shooting at the roof of Death\u2019s room. Cracks started to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 giant souls later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt himself almost dying from the pressure in his body. He was grow so dense so fast, and the pleasure was unbearable. His balls were making cum so fast that his cock could barely handle it all. It had grown another foot just to withstand the force of cum coming out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Death Room\u2019s cloud roof had a giant hole in it. The sky outside was turning black as thunder clouds formed. Black lightning was dancing among those clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath had put up a Shinigami Shield to protect everyone from Soul\u2019s strong black soul energy (Souls can have different colors. Soul\u2018s was red and black but became full black after being infused with so much magic).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the beam sucked all the lighting back and retreated back into the black soul sphere. Soon, the black soul sphere began to shrink as it was reabsorbed by the Scythe. The blades lost its red coloring and was pure black now. The scythe was concentrated darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed and rubbed his stomach as he leaned back against his room door. His now limp 22in cock lay on the floor. He belched in satisfaction\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seeped through the ground getting everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in Death\u2019s room felt their hearts get crushed by there deepest fear. Fears so strong that they could go mad with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka fell on the ground gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit had grasped a nearby pillar. He saw his daughter on the ground. Eyes wide in fear. This was his greatest fear. He walked to her stumbling. He picked her up and held her \u201cMaka\u2026 Papa\u2019s here. Papa\u2019s her\u2026\u201d He patted her on the back trying to get her to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath could not believe how strong the madness wavelength had gotten since he sealed Kishin away.

DISSECT!\u201d He pulled out his medical knives and looked at the black scythe on the floor. He ran up to him and shoved an ***ton of his soul in to the scythe forcing him to turn back into a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was semiconscious. His large gut hard returned to his tight 8-pack. He saw a knife flash and break on his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein felt his mind shatter. He looked at the knives\u2026 \u201cDissect?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was staring at Stein in shock. He was just about to get dissected. Had the guy finally gone mad? To the side, he saw Spirit crying with Maka in his arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cThe Kishin is breaking free! My seals can\u2019t hold his madness much more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul turned to Maka. He needed her to wield him. He needed to get rid of this madness, so Maka could think. Suddenly, he felt something happen in the pit of his soul. A flood of soul energy erupted out of him and saturated the air displacing the madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka gasped and stared off into the distance with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cMaka\u2026 its ok.

Stein was sitting in the fetal position rocking back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone walked into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie was smiling\u2026 some how her rather charming personality deflected the madness around her and made her oblivious to it all. She looked in and saw Stein \u201cOh dear. He\u2019s got it bad.\u201d She walked up to him and turned her hand into a giant golden war hammer. It glowed brilliantly as she clonked him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein woke up \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d For the first time in his life, he was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit\u2019s face looked down as he contemplated what its revival meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cPapa\u2026 who\u2026 you don\u2019t mean\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cKishin has escaped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul scoffed \u201cSo? We\u2019ll just knock him down and chop him to bits.\u201d He was still feeling the power from his previous eating binge. He flexed his giant muscles and expanded them further to emphasize his point. They were about 3x the size of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein quickly assessed the situation in his mind. \u201cYou will now. Not yet at least. Arachne will begin to feed Kishin\u2019s more genie souls after she has turned them dark. It will now take to long before he can\u2019t be stopped, so we must act fast. Even now, he will be able to survive your attacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cThen how do we stop him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled \u201cWe have three wishes. Remember?\u201d He turned to Soul. \u201cSoul, your don censed body is mass producing magic right now, but thanks to the large pores between your body and soul, the magic is quickly turned into more body mass and that makes more magic in turn. This is also happening to Kishin, but it is even more exponentially thanks to his long life. Therefore, we have to speed you up before he can speed himself up even more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul thought about. \u201cSo all I have to do is grow stronger faster than Kishin?\u201d Stein nodded. Soul said \u201cOk then, I wish the rate I grew at was exponentially greater than Kishin. That should solve our problem.\u201d He smiled cockily as he felt that he had diverted a large problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein frowned \u201cThat would have been wish two, and a less extreme wish as well. Wish one is so that your body could handle the growth so that you didn\u2019t have to stay in bed for the next month letting your body reach equilibrium. You best make that wish before your first wish takes effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt his insides burst suddenly. He gasped as he fell to the floor. \u201cI\u2026 wish\u2026 I could\u2026 handle\u2026 any growth\u2026\u201d He felt his skin want to rip as a torrent of muscle surged underneath. His heart was racing and his body was arched in pain. Then suddenly, the pain faded away. Though, the feeling was still fresh in his mind. \u201cYou could have warned me this might happen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie (The Hammer Death Weapon) frowned \u201cYou should listen first. I bet Stein anticipated 1 month, well since it was growing exponentially, you would have been on a bed for eternity! ETERNITY!!! YOU HEAR!?!?!\u201d As she spoke, a torrent of air pushed everyone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was gripping his ears to dull the sound, but all that did was let him hear the throbbing in his ears. He was afraid he might have gone deaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein stared at Marie in shock, but smiled \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie frowned \u201cNow, I better get going. I was looking for an old trinket of mine. I think I dropped it in here, but I don\u2019t see it. I hope it turns up soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled and reached into his pocket and pulled out a gold pocket watch. It had leaf like designs and cool hammer design etched in as the center piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gasped and grabbed it. \u201cWhere did you find it! I looked everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cI found it in the pockets of a sneaky pickpocket while he was trying to get my wallet. Its safe to say that he will not return to DWMA.\u201d He smiled kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie blushed \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d she opened the locket to reveal a picture torn in half. It was a picture of her and some other unknown man. \u201cMy dad gave it to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein saw the missing half. There was another man that held his arms around Marie, but it was clear that their relationship has come to a halt. \u201cMs. Marie, would you happen to have anyplace to stay at while you are here at DWMA?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was shocked along with Soul and Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka whispered to Soul \u201cI think he\u2019s hitting on her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cI know! I don\u2019t know how this will work out. He\u2019s insane, and she\u2019s\u2026 well\u2026 she\u2019s also a tiny bit crazy. My ears are still ringing.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ll need a bit of magic to withstand the madness of the Kishin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cBut\u2026\u201d he looked at Maka and saw that she stopped caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cFine then. I guess it needs to be done. My partner endured his changes, and so will I. What kind of partner would I be if I am always being protected and spoiled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit looked at his daughter. He had given up his time with other women, and occupied his time catching up with his daughter. \u201cMaka\u2026 are you sure? There are other people like how I was. They will be tempted by\u2026 you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul yelled \u201cAnd if they do, I\u2019ll slice them down to their atoms, and even further down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. And like soul said. They will wish they never tried it.\u201d She looked at Stein \u201cHow large will they get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein thought about it \u201cInfinity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka almost passed out. Then she realized that Soul was also basically growing to infinity as well, but was being compressed \u201cSoul\u2026 you should word the wish like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul listened \u201cOk. I wish that Maka\u2019s anti-magic production will increase to match mine, but it will not make her\u2026 breasts\u2026 grow to infinity, but instead, it will get compressed into its current size and that he body was able to handle the changes.\u201d (Black Genie souls allow for run one sentences if they apply to the same topic. Others are less free).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Maka felt a tingle pass over her body as the wish was made. Despite the wish Soul made, Maka quickly grew another cup size. \u201cI guess getting compressed can only go so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed. \u201cI guess so, but how about me? I haven\u2019t gotten any bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka laughed \u201cThat\u2019s a lie actually. Your muscles look a bit bigger than last week, and you pants\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at his groin and smiled. \u201cOh\u2026 this happened when I was eating the genie souls. It had to grow a bit\u2026 to\u2026 umm\u2026 handle it better. I didn\u2019t make any wishes in there though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Stein \u201cSo do we got hunt down Kishin now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein shook his head. \u201cCan you hold Soul as a scythe yet, or do wee have to wait more for you to be able to handle him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake held out her hand and Soul turned into a scythe. He landed in her hand as a black scythe. He was releasing a dark light. Suddenly, in response to the sudden increase in magic, Maka\u2019s chest expanded another couple cup sizes making her EE cups. Her bra was cutting into her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark glow around the scythe slowly dimmed down as anti-magic counteracted it. There were sparks running down the scythe as soul energy was created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed as she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was in his world having a gushing nosebleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cI can handle his magic now I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit sighed in relief. He was afraid of relapsing, but he controlled himself \u201cMaka\u2026 they got kind of big, so I\u2018ll...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s eyes burst into fire \u201cPAPA!\u201d She though he was messing with her like he would to another women in his old ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit frowned and finished his sentence \u201c\u2026 and go get you something from you mom to put on so that your bra stops hurting you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stopped feeling angry and began to feel guilty \u201cOh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit nodded \u201cI understand. I thought I would feel tempted too, but you\u2019re my daughter, and I\u2019d never put you through that. Don\u2019t feel bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cYou still have mom\u2019s stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit sighed \u201cYah. I keep it in a box if she ever decides to see the new me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka cringed. \u201cOuch.\u201d She was starting to feel the straps dig into her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was gone in seconds, and back with a full change in 5 seconds flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Maka stepped out in a white cloak and white gloves, boots, hair band, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was crying \u201cYou look just like her!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled with pride \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Soul had to compliment her \u201cYou look pretty cool in that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cOk. Lets go get that Kishin.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think that one genie soul is almost done maturing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius smiled. He loved this mad women, and she was mad for him! \u201cTake your time. I\u2019ve waited for a millennia. I can wait another hour or year if I have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne wagged her finger \u201cThat won\u2019t do at all! I\u2019ll finishes forcing them to mature long before an hour!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius sighed \u201cOk! You win. And anyhow, how many did you get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled \u201cI had them go looking and I went shopping a bit. I hope 15 souls is enough. Those brats stole my other 30.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius made a sad face \u201cDon\u2019t be sad. I\u2019ll kill them just for you. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne sighed \u201cBut your well come back present was taken! And they ate it too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius smiled \u201cDo not worry. They can not hope to beat me. Even with their wishes, I will beat them still. Know what? My first wish is going to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cCan you see their soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cI just need to follow their trail of madness. Its so dense that I could see it from miles away. Finding them is no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cMaka\u2026 what do you think will happen to me after I eat its soul? Will I go beyond a Godly Death Scythe? Or something else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka thought about it as she ran through the forest and smiled \u201cWell, what ever it is, I hope its good. I would rip you open and tear out its soul if the result was bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul chuckled. \u201cTear me open? How would you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cVery Carefully.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughed it out until the black scythe in her hand exploded in power. It blasted Maka off to the side leaving the scythe floating in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka managed to not get hurt by tumble rolling. \u201cSOUL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s body was tingling. He felt the muscle under his skin ripple as streams of magic rushed into his body to feed his muscles. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka ran up to the scythe but was stopped by a force field of black lighting and magic. \u201cSoul!\u201d She started bashing at the invisible wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul tried to turn back into a human, but he couldn\u2019t. It seems like he can\u2019t change back between growth spurts. \u201cMaka! I can\u2019t get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, his body was getting stronger and stronger. The seal on his right arm was burning black light and so was the one on his left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was screaming. Then suddenly, she felt her chest warm up. Anti-magic! Maka held out her ands and pooled the anti-magic in her hands. A white fluid of light collected in her cupped hands. Then she slapped them into the invisible wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall seemed fine for a second, but then it exploded. Black beams of light shot out into the distance. Inside of it was a floating black scythe. Lighting was lashing out of the ground turning it into black obsidian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka ran up to it. A white aura covering her body deflecting the black lighting. Soul energy sparked as the two boundaries touched. Then she grasped the handle. She felt herself grow another cup size, but she didn\u2019t care. She pooled all her anti-magic into her hands and shoved it into the scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul yelled \u201cOuch! What are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s forehead furrowed as she concentrated \u201cI\u2019m trying to control your magic! I could use your help here too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled and focused on his magic. He began shoving it into holes that he opened up (spiritual holes. Not physical ones). His muscle mass increased dramatically. Slowly, the level of magic in his outer soul had dropped while his density grew like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed as the scythe stopped lashing out at her aura. She fell on her bum and dropped the scythe. Then it started to float again, but in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWhat! I can float? That\u2019s so cool!\u201d He was beaming with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled. I think Stein would say his growth has reached equilibrium or whatever. He was stable now, and that\u2019s all that matters. \u201cFine. Now lets get back to our purpose.\u201d She looked away to search for the trail of madness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sensed a sudden hush of quietness \u201cMaka\u2026 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked down disappointed \u201cIts gone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled \u201cWas it good? I spent extra magic making it denser. Just the way you like your souls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius \u201cThank you.\u201d He leaned back in his chair as Arachne\u2019s castle. \u201cNow\u2026 Arachne, please do not judge me, and think that I\u2019m being paranoid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne looked truly hurt \u201cNever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius calmed her down \u201cSorry! Sorry! I\u2019m just saying. You know I fear everything. Especially losing you. I want to be able to be unstoppable. Even by a wish. Those idiots didn\u2019t think a wish could kill some one, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m alive still. Though, not so much for them. I wish my power grew beyond the powers of a genie. That way, a wish will not kill me.\u201d He smiled at his logic. It makes sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt his magic and madness levels shoot up and not stop for\u2026 (lets go with a while).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a beam of black lighting shot into through the wall and out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius was shocked by its power, but he knew it was nothing to him. He took called his magic and redirected it. He managed to shove it up and out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne scowled. She recognized this wavelength. \u201cBlast those kids!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius was shocked. It had taken more than he thought he\u2019d need to bend that lighting. It was almost on par with him. He started to shake with fear. Would they kill somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne stopped fuming and ran to her husband who lay shaking on the floor. She looked out the hole. \u201cWe will be back\u2026 I swear. And when we are, you\u2019ll pay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was trying to calm his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWe let them get away!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cIts alright. We can still stop him. What ever happened was because of their meddling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cHe\u2019s right. He probably sensed Soul\u2019s strength and wished to be stronger than it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cDoes that mean Soul is growing even faster than before now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cYes. He\u2019ll grow faster than before, but it seems that its for the better. His body and scythe form appear to have balanced out. The magic is flowing into him at a stable rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked \u201cYah, and now I can float.\u201d He turned into a scythe and levitated in mid air. \u201cI wonder if I can control myself.\u201d He thought about turned and rotating. The scythe slowly spun in place. Too slow to be of use in battle. \u201cHmm\u2026 maybe I should practice a bit more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka frowned. If he gets really good at that, he wouldn\u2019t need her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked \u201cIf I get good, I can help rip any men that get to close to you apart.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThey\u2019ll think that this scythe is possessed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled now. He wasn\u2019t leaving her. He was just trying to learn about his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cAh! My head. Its pounding.\u201d He moaned as he got in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka scowled, but laughed inside \u201cHey! That\u2019s why you get for trying to concentrate that much for 5hrs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled through his pain \u201cWhatever. You think this is funny, so what ever. Enjoy my suffering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka laughed \u201cI\u2019ll do just that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m huge, I\u2019m strong, and Maka thinks I\u2019m ******* sexy, and my voice too!<br>\r\nSoul felt like the world simply gave him all he ever wanted. Now if it weren\u2019t for that dang Kishin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul thought about Maka\u2026 As soon as his thoughts turned toward her body, his face burned red, but he couldn\u2019t help it. They\u2019ve been together for a few years, and they were roommates, etc. The only difference is that they haven\u2019t been declared yet. They were simply friends who worked closely together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he wanted her. The thought of her filled his abnormally large endowment till it stuck up like a lightning rod. It called for her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSoul! Get up! We have to find Arachne and Kishin again\u2026 and you have a lot of work to do on your own training\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul groaned. He had been up all night with a never ending hard-on. It had just stopped an hour ago, and he\u2019d just fallen asleep. He mumbled into his pillow \u201cHmm..HM..hmmm~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul peeled his face off his pillow \u201cToo Tired! Goodnight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka tried to think of a reason. A lingering migraine from yesterday? \u201cSoul? Are you feeling ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cYes\u2026 Tired\u2026\u201d He was already drifting into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSOUL! ITS BEEN TWO DAYS GET UP!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul jolted awake. Two day? Was he really that tired? Or was\u2026 Did he seem bigger? His pecs were jutting out more now. He looked down and felt that his neck seems thicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul curiously \u201cSoul? What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul reached and rubbed his abs\u2026 they felt harder and deep. \u201cNothing\u2026 its just that I feel like I got bigger. What do you think?\u201d He flexed a bicep trying to gauge it size change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked and reached out to it. It was still as hard as before, but her hands were more spread out now. Not a huge difference, but a difference still. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You feel bigger to me, and you look a bit bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked down over his pecs and saw his calves had bulged out a bit more and his thighs were touching. Not to mention his larger organ seemed to have picked up some mass. \u201cI thought I was supposed to grow less and just get denser.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cMaybe its like me. The compression can\u2019t handle the growth. Though yours is slower than mine. Actually, it appears like I\u2019ve stopped, so that\u2019s good. You seems to go in multiple mini bursts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded slowly \u201cYah\u2026\u201d Then their entire apartment began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stared at Soul\u2019s stomach bug-eyed. \u201cI don\u2019t ever recall it being that loud!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled innocently \u201cMe either, but lets feed it before it eats me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius was pacing rapidly in his panic \u201cHow did they do that. What if\u2026 what would\u2026 when did\u2026 where\u2026 how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne\u2019s heart melted as she saw her beloved in such a frenzy. \u201cPhobius! Enough! I can\u2019t take this anymore. We will kill them tonight\u2026 after dinner. I have sent Mosquito to get more genies. Death, that old fool thought he could keep them hidden with his pathetic excuse for a seal! I\u2019ve seen children guard their toys more effectively.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius paused as looked at his wife. He ran and cried on her randomly. He was really afraid\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne was still fuming. She hated children\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt his heart skip a beat. He fell to the dirt ground clutching his body in agony. He felt himself growing at a tremendous rate again. What ever it was, it wasn\u2019t from his normal growth. This was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka wasn\u2019t there right now. She had gone shopping for some things and had let Soul practice controlling himself while he floated. He had just gotten into human form when this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d Then it hit him. He had wished to grow exponentially faster than Kishin. If the Kishin suddenly accelerated in growth, he would grow even faster and stronger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the feeling died as his growth stabilized with the Kishin. He lay panting on the ground as his heart rate slowed back down to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was walking back into the clearing when she saw Soul laying flat on the ground. \u201cSoul!\u201d She ran over with her bag of groceries. They had gotten a raise in payment since Soul needed to eat more. He could eat the souls in his room, but he want\u2019s to live off of other things as well. Even souls get bland after enough time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul opened his eye when he heart Maka. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I just had a headache\u2026 just needed a break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed in relief. She had thought he had another episode. Well\u2026 she knew he did, but she wanted him to not have to worry about her worrying about him. \u201cLets go home then. I still haven\u2019t found any trace of their madness. It seems like they dropped off the face of the earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius felt the soul slide down his throat. They provided some sense of relief. He felt his power increase tremendously the souls fused with his ever strengthening body. He sighed as his nerves calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled as she saw his shoulders stop tensing \u201cThere we go. How do you feel now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius smiled \u201cMuch better now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled \u201cOk then. What do you wish for? You still haven\u2019t used any of your other wishes except for one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius sighed \u201cThat\u2019s right. I guess I don\u2019t have to worry about being the weakest because I wish I were the strongest\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear\u2026 what will happen now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If all else fails, we\u2019ll have to use 3 more wishes and word them specifically to controlling his growth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cBut if we do that, we\u2019ll have to find another black genie soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cIf it comes to that, then yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka tried to find a loop hole, and then it hit her \u201cWhy not just use another genie soul to get the job done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein raised an eyebrow \u201cThat\u2019s a valid option. Good thinking Maka. Why don\u2019t you two go give that a try. Ask Death where he his a genie, and you can get something from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Red one is 1 weak wish. By weak, I just mean its not as effective as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrange is still 1 wish, but even stronger, though its strength varies from its age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellow give 2 weak wishes or 1 really strong wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen is 2 strong wishes. No weak ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue is 2 strong. 1 weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurple is 3 strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown is 3 strong and a weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite is 3 weak run-on sentence wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack is 3 strong run-on wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka took mental notes as Stein spoke \u201cThank you Stein. I\u2019ll get going then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein remembered \u201cAnd Maka, the white soul has the potential to be the strongest. Instead of 3 weak wishes, you can make them into one wish that is stronger than the black soul. However, there were none when I last went genie hunting to Death. Maybe some have grown in power since then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka bowed \u201cThanks Stein.\u201d She turned and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cSo why are we doing this again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled as she ran with Soul in her hand. The scythe was practically weightless, and it made her feel lighter on her feet. She could sprint for miles if she had to. \u201cBe honest. The pain comes back when ever you grow. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul chuckled \u201cWhat gave it away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka frowned \u201cYou got a bigger. Duh! Only you are dense enough to miss a change from 6ft6in to 6ft 9in. And its looks like you put on 20lbs of muscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked over his body in his dark world. She was right. He had gotten bigger. How did he miss that? \u201cFine. Yah\u2026 they come back once in a while, but I haven\u2019t felt any in a long time, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cThat means that there is more to worry about. The moment we get comfortable, it could strike and then what do we do? Preparing ahead is always better than when it is to late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grumbled \u201cFine. So we\u2019re looking for a white genie soul? Why not a black one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cYou ate them all. Death put seals on all the genies, and he knows what color their soul is. Even after they are released, he has a hidden spell that continues to tell him there strength and soul color. New black have been popping up which makes him worry. The kishin is eating more and more black genie souls to get stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed \u201cYes. I know that, but why are we getting a white one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cA white one can make 3 weak run-on wishes. However, if you combine them, you get one that\u2019s even stronger than a black one. The black soul wishes can not be combined because all attempts have caused undesirable outcomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul tried to think of some things that could go wrong, and chuckled when he got the thought of a tall lanky man combining three black soul wishes and some how getting even thinner. So thin that its negative? He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed \u201cNothing. Its just me thinking. How close are we to the soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked off into the distance \u201cNot close enough. Maybe another week of running should get us there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul exasperated \u201cWhat! Couldn\u2019t we just take a boat or a plane?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cNo\u2026 they are all being kept on standby for a kishin attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul frowned \u201cWe need to find a way to get there faster.\u201d Soul pondered of way to do this, and then he got an idea. \u201cMaka, stop. Go sit on my handle like it was a broom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul (the scythe) \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled deviously \u201cJust do it. Would I ever do anything to hurt you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cNo, but you would try to make fun of me a bit.\u201d She complied and set the scythe between her legs and sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cOk. Hold on. I\u2019m going to give this a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka frowned \u201cGive what a sh-AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul focused on floating off the ground as best he could, and he found that it was kind of easy now. Maybe it was because Maka\u2019s soul is focused and orderly, so it helps me focus\u2026 maybe. The scythe began to rise up in the air and it jolted forward. They were zooming through the air slowly climbing higher. They looked down to see a never ending forest and an ever shrinking Death City. \u201cNice view right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s eyes were shut tight. She hung onto the handle like her life depended on it, whish it kind of did. \u201cI\u2019m can\u2019t look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed, but smiled \u201cMaka, this is nothing. Trust me. Just peek a bit if you want. Not the whole eye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka did what he said. She peeked and saw how high up they were, but its was to amazing to close her eyes again. She sat up slowly, and looked around. She reached out and grabbed at a cloud. Her hand faded through it. \u201cThis is\u2026 I can\u2019t even put it in words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed \u201cLet me help. This is Super Cool! Look at how high we are. If only I had known that making contact with you would make this so easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked quizzical \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWell, your soul is very organized and focused, except for when you are fuming, then it gets all distorted. But right now, its calm and stable, so it helps me focus and helps me to manipulate my magic and soul energy to a better extent. If that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cYup\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cSo where to? I don\u2019t know how to get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked around for the soul signature that Death had shown her. \u201cThat way.\u201d She pointed to the sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey scythe turned and sped toward the setting sun (which was a strange kind of face if you asked me).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a giant Death Mask (the older scarier version) carved into the face of a mountain with a cave entrance at the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cHere it is. Lets go in.\u201d The scythe slowly descended and let Maka hop off. She grabbed the scythe and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they found was a giant dome like room with Death Masks and hands outstretched touching each other. There was a hole in the floor that dropped down deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cSeems kind of gloomy in here. You think we should go into that hole?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cYah, but I can\u2019t see anything. Before, there was this red and black aura around me. Now its just an invisible wall of dense magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul thought of a solution \u201cPump some Anti-magic into my blade. That should create some soul energy to spark the way there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka did that. She felt the scythe grow warmer in her hands, and the blades sent a spark of lighting. Slowly, the blades themselves glow a hazy white as the magic and anti-magic mixed to created soul energy. The blades emanated energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka saw the light coming off of it and used the scythe to light her way. The hole revealed a winding staircase. When they got to the bottom, they saw a giant hallway and went down that. There were symbols of warning and other things meant to turn people away, but they kept at it. Slowly, the symbols turned into written seals and other spells of repulsion and binding. \u201cWow\u2026 a lot goes into these seals. I wonder how Arachne get them all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul replied \u201cWith magic of course. You can sever all of these at once with enough focused magic. These spells are all interconnected. You break one, and the rest soon follow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul \u201cCan you see them? Cause I can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cI can\u2026 I think its because I have magic in me unlike you. But anyway, these spells would have sent us running back to the exit long ago if my dense soul didn\u2019t keep the spells out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded and looked down the hall. They were almost at a pair of giant doors locked by hundreds of Death Hands arranged in odd patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to it, Maka stepped up and tried to push them open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cJust slice through them. This place is getting boring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, pieces of door were falling down in angular shapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing on the other side, in the center of a room full of black death chains, was a single white lamp. It glowed a warm light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLets open it!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was seething with its build up in magic. \u201cSoul!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was jacking off now. Totally oblivious to all things in his pleasure. His compressed muscles were swelling larger and larger. Almost like there was never a seal in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka ran up to the lamp and saw hundreds of time symbols imprinted into the white metal. \u201cGah! How do I open this?\u201d She looked at that words tried to rub the seal of. Nothing happened. She looked back at the scythe. Black magic was firing off in giant waves. A dark sphere shrouded it and pulsed larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka swore and looked at the lamp. Were these seals made of magic? She pooled white anti-magic into her hands and began to rub at the symbols. Immediately, they melted off. As soon as the seal was gone, the lamp seemed to have erupted. At the spout, a jet of white smoke shot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white genie appeared. It looked like a girl of around 17 years old. Its skin was pale white, with white hair, eyes, and cloths, but they were all different shades of white. She looked at them cautiously. Then she sensed the intense black magic in the air. She screamed \u201cAh!!! Get it away. It tainting me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka recoiled from the screaming. The genie did not like black soul magic in the least. Maka tried to help and pooled anti-magic in her hands. She tossed it into the air and created an anti-magic bubble that blocked out the black soul magic. \u201cGenie! In here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie saw a white haven and darted into it. As soon as she was in, she let out a sigh. Even though she was a creature of magic, the anti-magic wasn\u2019t being directed at her, so she was fine. \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at the genie cautiously. Why was it afraid of the black soul magic. It said it was being tainted. \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie looked at the girl and sighed. She stood up \u201cI am the one and only anti-magic genie, Bella.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was curious \u201cOk Bella, What does that mean\u2026 the only anti-magic genie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella replied \u201cIt means that I can do everything a regular genie can, but with anti-magic. You didn\u2019t think that all anti-magic did was cancel out regular magic right? Very few people can control it. Such as I.\u201d She pointed to her body causing her massive chest to wobble under its thin cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was interested in this anti-magic stuff now. \u201cWhat else can it do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cWell\u2026 this stuff.\u201d She lifted her hand and streams of anti-magic flew out attacking the soul magic dense air around them. There were explosions of soul energy as the two neutralized each other. Quickly, the magic began to replenish itself. Bella sighed and saw the source. \u201cInteresting\u2026 a weapon. I assume its yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cYah\u2026 I can here to get your soul, but I can\u2019t do that with him incoherent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella wasn\u2019t phased by the comment. She heard it al before. To bad each one them faced the wrath of anti-magic. \u201cI see. Would you now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka shook her head \u201cI doubt it. Besides\u2026 you seem like an interesting person. I wouldn\u2019t mind getting to know you better, and who knows. We could end up being best friends. Though\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you this. My soul just tells me that you\u2019re a good person.\u201d She looked into Bella\u2019s eyes with he own trustful and friendly eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella looked back and smiled \u201cIts our anti-magic wavelength resonating together. Unlike you and your partner. I don\u2019t even know how you two can still work together considering that you two are polar opposites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka laughed \u201cThat\u2019s the exact reason we can work together. We fill what the other one lacks. For me\u2026 I think it\u2019d be control. Soul has always been cool and level headed in difficult situations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle snorted and covered her face in shock \u201cSorry about that. Its just that I can sense the pleasure coming out of his right now. He must be having the time of his life. Care to explain? Maybe I can help since you did free me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cWell\u2026 it all started when we ate the soul of this magic cat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSo yah\u2026 we\u2019re here now trying t put his growth under lock and key.\u201d She glance over at Soul, and his scythe form was still sending out waves of black soul magic. Even faster and denser actually. The barrier she put up was starting to waver. \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to stop\u2026 is he\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella shook her head \u201cNo\u2026 it doesn\u2019t look like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka groaned and picked up a nearby rock. She threw it sending it out of her barrier. It suddenly slowed to a stop as soon as it entered the magic dense air. \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella sighed \u201cHow are we going to get out of here. I can\u2019t survive in a place full of magic! It eats away at me until I\u2019m nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cUnless we can do anything about Soul, then we just have to sit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella frowned \u201cI don\u2019t like either choices, so I\u2019m going to make a third one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cYou are going to have to eat my soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stood up in shock \u201cWHAT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella nodded \u201cYes. That way you can make your wish. However, it may or may not make more trouble. I do not know. However, it is our only choice. Take it and have your body assaulted by magic, or let me help you and your partner. You two seem like good kids, and I guess a young genie as myself could make a noble sacrifice for such potential benefactors to the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stammered \u201cBut I can\u2019t eat souls. It\u2019ll turn me into an ifrit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella smiled \u201cNot with a genie. How do you think normal people have been getting their wishes all these years? Now stop complaining. I\u2019m going to convert my body into soul form so you don\u2019t have to kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was about to object, but Bella was already starting to glow. He body enveloped in light and morphed into the purest white soul ever to be made. And then, it shot itself down Maka\u2019s gullet. She coughed and staggered from surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka felt her body heat up as the anti-magic soul merged with her own anti-magic soul. Suddenly, before she made her wish, the soul created one powerful wish without words. Its used Maka\u2019s feelings and intentions to get the wish to do what she wanted. A pure white beam shot out of her body and struck the scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room exploded with soul energy as the two forces exterminated each other. Maka closed her eyes against the light made by the merge. When her eyes cleared, she saw a scythe clattering across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scythe was vibrating at a tremendous speed. Anti-magic that was equal the magic made by Soul was somehow rapidly appearing inside the scythe. The two forces battered at each other until two distinct sides formed. One blade had turned white with a black lightning bolt in the middle. The other blade was black with a white lighting bolt. The handle was both black and white and its shape was not constant. Lightning was striking at each other on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul groaned \u201cMaka\u2026 what just happened?\u201d In his dark world, he had shrunken down to 7ft tall with slightly larger than normal proportional muscles. He looked strong, really strong, but his muscles didn\u2019t impede his motion, unlike before. His legs didn\u2019t rub against each other, and he could reach his face with no trouble at all.<br>\r\nHe looked around and saw cum as far as his eye could see. \u201cWhat on earth happened?\u201d Though he did have a guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cYou were growing again. And before you ask, I wished for something to fix it. Though, I don\u2019t know how I can word the wish. It was more of a feeling or desire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was astonished \u201cYou wished for something? How?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka laughed nervously \u201cFunny story\u2026 I swallowed the genie\u2019s soul. I\u2019ll tell you on the way home. Lets go.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Do you like how a soul tastes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cI didn\u2019t taste anything. She skipped the whole chew and swallow phase. Her anti-magic merged with mine, and now she\u2019s gone.\u201d He voice was filled with longing and regret. \u201cBella seemed like a pretty cool girl. I wonder why she was sealed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Maka felt her soul expand beyond her body. It grew and grew until it was 10m in radius. \u201cWhat the.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard a voice \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was gone. Did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked for the source of the voice \u201cWhat\u2026 where\u2026 huh? Bella\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella screamed \u201cYes! Now we can start your training!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cThat training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed \u201cThe training so that your anti-magic can grow strong enough to make me a new body! Its going to take time for you to gain enough anti-magic control to construct me a body, so we\u2019ll start now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka screamed \u201cHOLD ON! How are you still here!\u201d Suddenly, she started to jerk as the scythe shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cMaka! Why are you screaming! I can barely keep us straight because of my recent change.\u201d He lied. It was so much easier now. Before, it felt like he was being pushed in one direction, but now, there was a counter force pushing him the other way. The two canceled and now he was in perfect sync.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSorry, but Bella is alive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella included Soul in her conversation \u201cHello Soul. So you were the one making all that black soul magic. Good thing you can make anti-magic too or you would have been lopsided. All that magic would push you over the edge. Now both forces should be increasing in strength at the same rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhere are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed \u201cI\u2019m part of your soul right now. If you took a look, you might make out my image standing within your soul. I can\u2019t leave it since I\u2019m part of it, but I can eventually with your help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was smiling \u201cThis is amazing. Is it a prop to being the only anti-magic genie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed \u201cNo! If a genie was swallowed by a naturally magical being, it could potentially reform its body. The only reason you, Soul, can\u2019t is because you became magical. You weren\u2019t magic before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was still very confused \u201cSo you are in her soul? What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka explained \u201cBella is alive in my soul, but she can\u2019t leave until I gain enough control over my anti-magic. I assume that if I can condense enough anti-magic into the form of a body, Bella could take over it and create a new body for herself. Am I right Bella?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cYup! Now with training. I want you to pool as much anti-magic into your hands as you can without letting it spill. This is for practicing control over the body and the soul. When they two harmonize better, you should be able to actually make the anti-magic float in the air in front of you. Then when you get further, you can make shapes and even weapons out of anti-magic. However, that takes years\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was amazed \u201cHow come no one has done this before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed \u201cThere has been one living thing to do it, and that\u2019s me! I am the first anti-magic being. What do you think I do with my time? Practice magic? Nope, I use anti-magic. Now start by cupping you hands. You\u2019ve done this before, but on a small scale. We\u2019re going to a whole new level now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle cheered \u201cYes! That\u2019s it. And you\u2019re doing pretty well despite the fact were are on a flying scythe miles above the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cThanks.\u201d Her hand was filled with white anti-magic, but really dense since she had been practicing the whole time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cI can see Death City. They\u2019re going to ask what happened. Should we tell them the truth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cOf course. And I also want to give Lord Death a strong word or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed \u201cLord Death didn\u2019t lock me up because I was bad. He did it because I was impulsive. My anti-magic blew up an entire posse of witches. A dozen death weapons were made that day.\u201d She smiled at the memory \u201cAnyway, The head witch gave Lord Death a stern talk to, so he went and hunted me down. Sealed me away until I calmed down. 1,000 years can change a person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201c3000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You don\u2019t look older than 17!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella smiled again \u201cAww\u2026 Soul\u2026 that\u2019s so sweet. I try my best, but yes. I am actually 10,000 years old. I am young among my race.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSo how do you feel about Lord Death?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella sighed \u201cI put him in a tight spot. He had to either let me continue and let himself face the wrath of the Head Witch, or teach me a lesson so I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cBut how can he do that to you? What\u2019s relationship with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cWell, genies pop up every few centuries or so. They are made randomly from the children of highly magical creatures. Lord Death is my dad, and the head witch is my mom. Somehow, I was made into a genie with a strong anti-magic affinity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and Soul stared at each other\u2026 \u201cWHAT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is kind of odd\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His soul density and strength was growing so much faster, and it wasn\u2019t slowing down. How can someone be this strong to force Phobius to grow this much stronger! \u201cHoney! Wish the pain away. Wish it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius cried out his wish \u201cI wish it was gone. I do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul soured across the sky like a broom while carrying a single (two is you could Bella) passenger. He could feel his muscles getting denser and denser, but the feeling was neutral now. He didn\u2019t really notice the growth. It was the same for his magic and soul. The feeling was still there, but his mind had put it aside. However, now he could feel his anti-magic being made. He felt his soul energy rocket constantly, but the feeling should go away after a few days. \u201cMy scythe form looks so cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cThat\u2019s it. Try to double the volume of anti-magic in your hand by the end of the week, and then we can try step two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cOk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and Soul walked into Death\u2019s room quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cOhh! You\u2019re back, and you brought my daughter! Now have you learnt your lesson?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle spoke through her mind \u201cI guess I have. I haven\u2019t had time to test if I did learn anything, but I think I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath nodded \u201cGood.\u201d Then he turned to Maka and Soul \u201cYou two have changed. Did my daughter meddle with you a bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle pouted in her spirit form \u201cHey! I was only helping Soul from tearing his Meister apart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath raised his arms in resignation \u201cOk. Ok\u2026 I understand.\u201d He turned to Soul \u201cYou keep growing!!! Stop it!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul scowled \u201cHey! I didn\u2019t do this on purpose\u2026 well, I did kind of choose to, but its out my control now. Or\u2026 wait\u2026 its in my control now thanks to Bella.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cBut besides that, and Bella helping me improve my control over my anti-magic, we have nothing else to report.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath stood there \u201cok. Have a nice day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWas it me, or did Death seem a little to casual after seeing his daughter after 1000 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cYah, but he has lived a long\u2026 long time. 1000 years may be nothing to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella sighed \u201cYup\u2026 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul then remembered Kid \u201cHey\u2026 did you know you have a brother now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella yelled \u201cWHAT! When did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cA decade and a half ago? I guess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cShow me. How is he? What\u2019s he like? What\u2019s he look like? ETC.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid \u201cI HAVE A SISTER! AND YOU DID WHAT TO HER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cHey Kid. I chose this, so calm down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid tried to find the source. He saw a human shape standing in Maka\u2019s soul. \u201cAh\u2026 so you are right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella smiled \u201cYup\u2026 Well, my presence at least. I\u2019m not really tangible until Maka makes me another body. That may take a bit of time, but I can wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid tried to find symmetry in his sister\u2019s foggy shape, but he couldn\u2019t. He wanted to scream disgust and hate, but this was his sister. He would have to be more composed and wait until her new body is made. \u201cSo\u2026 how\u2026 umm\u2026 symmetrical are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella looked quizzical \u201cUmm\u2026 excuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid was twirling circles on his wrist \u201cYou know\u2026 how well does your left side match your right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle \u201cUmm\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen a mirror in 1000 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid sighed disappointedly \u201cOh\u2026 ok. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle shook her hands \u201cNo! Don\u2019t be. Its not your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul whispered \u201cHe\u2019s obsessed with symmetry. I\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t harassed me about my body yet.\u201d Then he saw kid charge at him \u201cSpoke to soon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, Soul was standing in a perfectly symmetrical pose. He sighed and changed into scythe form. At least the lightning was un-symmetrical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid gasped in shock. His face turned to disgust, but then it froze. He took out a cameral and took a photo from an instant camera. He studied the photo and almost passed out. \u201cThe symmetry\u2026 its constantly moving, buts its has symmetry\u2026\u201d He looked at the scythe floating in mid air. He crawled up and started to bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cMaka\u2026 is he\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cYup\u2026 though, he\u2019s usually not his bad. I wonder where Liz and Patty are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, those two people appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz saw the floating scythe and her meister bowing to it. She groaned and dragged Kid away trying to calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty was smiling like usual \u201cHehe\u2026 its floating\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe out of no where \u201cYOOHOOO!\u201d Black Star jumping in to the room via an open window. \u201cOhh\u2026. Soul? Is that you?\u201d He walked up and got shocked by a tiny bit of lightning \u201couch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cSorry. Only Maka can touch me as a scythe. Only she resonates with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star mumbled about how unfair it was for Maka to get the strongest weapon in the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki came running in through the door \u201cBlack Star!!!\u201d She started to nag at him to come home and take a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella was astonished \u201cAre\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cYup\u2026 Lets just go while they are all distracted.\u201d Maka walks up to Soul and grabs him. They left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul as he turned into a scythe. His whole form glowed black and white and then it morphs into a dual bladed scythe. I wonder what that would be like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul spun into her hands and lashed out waves of powerful anti-magic and magic attacks. The air around them crackled as the two forces eliminated each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella stared at the weapon in her astral form. Its was stronger than it looked\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The madness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul immediately turned into a scythe and Maka ran through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cWhat\u2019s going on. Is this the Kishin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cYes. We\u2019ve been looking for it, and it\u2019s finally popped back up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cWell, who ever it is, they are about to go home empty handed. They don\u2019t know how much either of you have changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in the air\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius was standing at his fullest height and looked at the world indifferently. He had learnt something through the recent pain he\u2019s endured. Pain is madness\u2026 and if you are simply mad\u2026 then the pain is gone. Nice and simple. So that\u2019s what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne looked at her husband nervously. She\u2019s never seen him act so\u2026 open. He was always close to her and scared, but now he seems to be indifferent. He stood at the top of the world and didn\u2019t have a single care.<br>\r\nShe senses a dense soul coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius \u201cSo they come. They will come to understand madness, and I will teach them. Isn\u2019t that right Arachne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne nodded \u201cOf course you will, but we aren\u2019t mad Phobius. We are enlightened. There is a difference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius pondered and smiled \u201cEnlightened. I like that. Yes\u2026 you and I are enlightened, and I am here to enlighten others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, two crescent shaped attacks flew at Phobius. One was black with white lightning, and the other was white with black lightning. Phobius raised both his hands and held the attacks in his hands. He channeled a strong madness wavelength into the attack and caused it to disentigrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was charging at Phobius (Kishin is you haven\u2018t picked it up). She cut at the air sending the two attacks again. Phobius simply destroyed the attacks by channeling madness into them. He was seething with madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius smiled \u201cNow\u2026 lets stop this. Why are you even attacking me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka glared and was about to be impulsive and attack again, but Bella stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cKishin. You were a human who ate souls. You have swallowed your weapon. You have killed innocent people for power. So now you will die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius frowned \u201cAww\u2026 I was only trying to enlighten them. Show them that madness is good. You don\u2019t feel pain and to you stop caring. It\u2019s a wonderful state of mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka frowned \u201cThen you have nothing left to live for. Not caring is the same as giving up on life. Why do you live if you care for nothing? For the sake of living?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius smiled \u201cBecause now its easier to have fun. No more restrains. For example. I don\u2019t care if my wife dies anymore! Ever since I chose this path\u2026 I feel so very alive\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne\u2019s eyes opened in shock. She smiled nervously \u201cPhobius\u2026 you don\u2019t mean that do you honey? You love me. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius turned around and smiled \u201cNope.\u201d Then he turned back to the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne fell to her knees. She descended deeper into madness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka, Soul, and Bella were shocked. How could he talk like that? How can he be so\u2026 so\u2026 indifferent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul said finally \u201cBecause he\u2019s mad. He is madness incarnated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella was looking at the creature in disgust \u201cKill him\u2026 before he \u201cEnlightens\u201d the rest of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka raised the scythe above her head and began to spin the scythe above her head. She was fuming and full of disgust. Quickly, a black and white halo formed above her. The blades lengthened until they touched. It looked like some tricked out yin yang symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius looked at it slightly surprised \u201cOhh\u2026 that\u2019s not good. Better fix that.\u201d He extended a finger and impaled Maka in the middle of her chest. \u201cThere we go. That should be good for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halo dissipated. The glowing scythe fell to the ground and the yin-yang symbol chattered and turned into soul energy. Maka fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He picked her up and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were glazed over. There was a hole in her shirt that showed a hole in her chest. A thing stream of blood flowed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella spoke screaming at Maka \u201cHang in there. If you die, then I die.\u201d She spoke to Soul \u201cI can slow her bleeding, but I can\u2019t do anything more. You have to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sat up. He eyes were still glazed over an inattentive. She raised her toward Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was overjoyed that Maka sat up, but her expression sent a chill down his spine. \u201cMaka\u2026? Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s eyes focused on her hand as though telling Soul to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul finally understood and grabbed Maka\u2019s hand to pull her, but something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s body flared white as it morphed into a scythe. It was pure white, but it was iridescent like a pearl. The blade was attacked to the handle with a pair of doves connecting the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at the scythe in his hands. It was longer than he was. Probably to match his height, speed, and strength. \u201cMaka\u2026 you\u2019re a weapon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella was breathless. \u201cAnd you\u2019re holding her\u2026 you\u2019re a meister\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius\u2019s eyes opened looking at the course of events \u201cOh\u2026 That\u2019s kind of neat. Oh well\u2026 you can die anyway.\u201d He got ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt the scythe send a wave of soul energy up his arm. It was warning him. Soul turned to see Phobius charging at them with sporadic purple madness in his hands. Soul blocked the attack with the handle of the white scythe. Purple madness running along the handle. Soul pushed Phobius way and tried to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius caught the blade in his hands and shoved it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cSoul! You have to send your soul into her! The scythe is useless if there is no soul going into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at the blade\u2026 could Maka handle his dense soul? He was going to have to trust that she could. He began to channel soul into her. The blade of the scythe began to glow white with the amount of energy going into it. Soul was wondering why he didn\u2019t feel anything coming back into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella heard his thoughts \u201cYou are, but you are so dense that it makes little difference. However, if you put all of your soul into it, then\u2026 well I hope you don\u2019t cut the world in half by accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked. He could do that much with his soul?\u2026 and with Maka\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul began to channel more of his soul into Maka. All the practice he had controlling his scythe form really helped right now. Quickly, the blade grew brighter and brighter. Suddenly, it doubled in length and continued to glow fight. Soul saw this and began to put more and more of his soul in. Quickly, the blade doubled again and out of nowhere, a second blade grew out the other end. Soul had to admit that Maka looked pretty epic right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius looked at it strangely \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked and shoved all of his soul in. There was a giant flash of white and every tree and mountain within a dozen miles was cut down. Soon, the light cleared to see a forest completely flattened and a mountain starting to slide off its foundation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius stared wide eyed and then he started to freak out \u201cW-w-w-why am I afraid\u2026 I thought I wished it away. I thought being mad would send it away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed in her mind \u201cBecause this blade is full of hope. Hope will outshine madness and despair. Hope instills courage and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at Phobius and got into a fighting stance. \u201cWe\u2019re ending this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius stammered \u201cN-no\u2026 get away.\u201d He held out his hands pooling what ever madness he could into them. Then he saw his wife and smirked. He ran over to her and stabbed her through her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s eyes snapped open wide. That ***. Soul charged at Phobius as fast as his long legs could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius held a purple soul in his hand and swallowed it. He turned to Soul cockily and he felt his calm sense of madness return \u201cThank you Arachne. I appreciate your last meal.\u201d He raised his hands and a giant ball of madness began to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul saw this and knew that he had to get rid of this monster. He pooled all his soul into Maka and the blades grew giant. They took the form of two pure white doves in a symmetrical dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius saw this and it only made him increase the madness he was putting into the ball. It was a giant 5ft wide ball of purple madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made contact. The doves sank into the ball and fazed through like a hot knife through butter. The ball turned white and exploded. Light filled the flattened landscape, and then it cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius stood staring straight ahead \u201cI was going to enlighten the world\u2026\u201d There was a white blade cut into him midway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cNo.\u201d He pulled the scythe through the rest of the way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhobius started to fall in two pieces, but his body exploded in white light before he touched the ground. Thousands of human souls appeared out of no where, and a single ash white and charcoal black soul remained where the body once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed and grabbed it \u201cMaka\u2026 are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said that, the scythe in his hand flashed white and morphed back into Maka. The hole in her chest was gone. Suddenly, she sat up with a jolt. She looked around to see a chopped down forest and some significantly shorter mountains. She looked up and saw Soul holding a creepy white and black soul. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at Maka in astonishment, but then he laughed. \u201cHold on. Let me get rid of this thing before anything else happens.\u201d He swallowed the kishin soul. \u201cOk. Done. I\u2019ll tell you what happened on the way home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella screamed \u201cMAKA!!!!! You and Soul looked so epic! Oh my god! You were the most gorgeous weapon I have ever seen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cI said I\u2019d explain on the way home\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was overjoyed \u201cMy daughter is a weapon like her PAPA!\u201d He was jumping, and when he stopped he latched on to Maka and picked her up. He started to spin her around in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s face was red from embarrassment \u201cP-papa stop. People are staring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, Death, Kid, Liz, Patty, Black Star, Tsubaki, Stein, and Bella were looking at them curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit saw this and set his daughter down. He coughed \u201cUmm\u2026 Right. Continue please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul rolled his eyes \u201cRight, so Maka turned into a pure white scythe. When I put my soul into her, she starts to glow and grow longer. I accidentally caused her to cut the forest down the first time I put all my soul into her. The second time, I focused it some more and her blades looked like\u2026 those birds\u2026 they\u2019re white and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella sighed \u201cDoves. Her blades turned into doves. The ball of madness that Phobius had made was purified by the doves and in the end. Soul impaled Phobius and killed him. When Maka woke up, he swallowed the Kishin\u2019s soul. The End\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was estatic \u201cMaka is a weapon! That\u2019s so cool. I can use you?\u201d He asked Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki looked at Black Star in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Black Star saw this and smiled \u201cYou\u2019re still my first pick Tsubaki. I\u2019m just being curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to turn into a scythe. I don\u2019t remember a thing about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit was on the verge of bursting out again, but he got a glare from Maka, so he controlled himself \u201cJust takes a little practice. That\u2019s all. Just focus on the shape and will your body to change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cFine. I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d She tried to imagine a white scythe in her mind. The felt like she knew the shape, but she couldn\u2019t make it solid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella advised \u201cTry meditating or something. It helps clear the mind of distraction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka gave it a shot. She sat down and crossed her legs.</span></div></div>",

Kid had turned around and began to paint what he thought Maka might look like as a scythe. Liz and Patty were asleep on the side. Tsubaki was letting Black Star rest on her lap. She was twirling his hair as he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cMaka\u2026 Lets go home and get some shut eye. It might be easier after some sleep. Getting impaled, changing for the first time, and healing takes a lot of energy. You\u2019re probably just tired.\u201d He looked at Spirit for some back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit understood Soul\u2019s concern, and as much as he wanted Maka to turn into a scythe, he wanted her healthy above all else. \u201cMaka, Soul\u2019s right. When you wake up and have had something to eat, it should be easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed and opened her eyes. She felt oddly calm. Her body was at peace after meditating for so long \u201cOk. I\u2019ll give it a shot tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul held out a hand to pull Maka up. Maka grabbed his hand and felt an image enter her mind. Suddenly it was clear to her. Her whole body glowed white and it morphed into a white dual bladed scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was awestruck. Spirit was beaming with pride. Death was going to put this in his memory as a historic point. Stein was analyzing and not thinking about dissections for some reason. Kid had turned around and gasped at its symmetry. Liz was still asleep and Patty was up looking at the pretty scythe. Black Star sat up and looked for the source of the light. Tsubaki was simply enjoying the sight. Soul on the other hand was thinking \u201cWe look so cool together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was in a dark world like Soul\u2019s. \u201cIts pretty dark in here.\u201d She looked up at an image floating in mid-space. It showed what ever the blades outside were reflecting. \u201cIs this how you usually see things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cI\u2019d guess so. Are you looking out of the blades?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cIts kind of homely in here. I don\u2019t feel afraid of this type of darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re in your border land. It\u2019s the place between body and soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul raised an eyebrow \u201cHow come no one ever told me that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein lit a cigarette \u201cI did, but you didn\u2019t pay attention in class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smirked \u201cYou were to busy making the room shake with your snores.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cWhat else did I miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cA lot. I\u2019m not going to explain it all. There\u2019s to much to say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cSoul, you also must have forgotten of our test next week. Better study up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul did a double back flip \u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka wondered \u201cSoul, what are you know? How do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul thought about it casually as they walked back to their apartment \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really feel any different. Kind of like when I eat any other soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka scrunched her faces slightly \u201cI wonder if it was because the souls was black and white. I kind of looked like your blade, but in soul form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul yawned \u201cWhat ever. A sou\u2019s a soul. Nothing else to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka halted \u201cWe both know that\u2019s not true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cYah\u2026 but I kind of just want to keep it simple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka rolled her eyes \u201cFine. Lets get home. I\u2019m exhausted, and I feel like there is a knife under my skin. Like I\u2019m on the verge of turning into a scythe with the slightest thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul agreed \u201cYah. I got that feeling at first. It dies down after a week or two.\u201d He walked ahead \u201cHurry up. Its getting late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul opened his eyes. He felt strange\u2026 \u201cWhat\u2019s g-\u201d His voice had gotten even deeper \u201cWha-\u201d He covered his mouth in shock. Then he felt that his body felt different. He looked down and saw that he was pretty much the same as yesterday, but he felt stiffer. As though there was more mass on his body. He checked his seal, and it was still in place. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was in her room thinking about life as a weapon when she heard a super deep, sexy voice. She bolted up \u201cSoul?\u201d She marched out of her room and knocked on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Knock Knock-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at his door. So I woke her up? \u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka walked in to see nothing different about Soul \u201cOh\u2026 sorry. I thought I heard something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul said in his really deep voice \u201cNo. You heard something alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s jaw dropped \u201cIs this the Kishin\u2019s soul kicking in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked over his body looking for anything to signify a change \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess so\u2026 I feel different. I feel stronger than I look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka wanted to test it out \u201cMaybe\u2026 how much could you lift before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201c300 for 3sets of 10reps. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was astonished \u201cWell, we could see if there are really any changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka frowned \u201cI can\u2019t believe there weren\u2019t enough weights for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed \u201cI can\u2019t believe how strong I am. The bar was bending! I couldn\u2019t believe I was lifting that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed and looked up at Soul. She saw something \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stopped walking \u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka pointed to his face \u201cThat stuff around your mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul reached up to his face and felt/heard a scraping sound. \u201cNo way\u2026\u201d He looked at Maka \u201cHey, do you have a mirror?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cNo\u20260.O\u201d Then she thought \u201cTry looking into my scythe form.\u201d She grabbed Soul\u2019s hand and turned into a white scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul held on as the scythe formed in his hand. He looked into the blade and saw his reflection. He was growing facial hair! His was less rounded as his chin had grown broader and more mature looking. He was getting older! \u201cOh my god\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at scythe through the blade. Soul had to be a year old that yesterday. He was aging? Or was eh simply speeding through puberty. Was this the Kishin\u2019s fault? \u201cSoul! To Death\u2019s Room now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein looked at Soul with a magnifying glass. There was a medical knife in his shirt pocket where Soul could see it. \u201cYes\u2026 I see. Soul, you are speeding through puberty for some add reason. Probably an effect of the Kishin\u2019s soul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stood there eyes wide. His face was covered in more fuzz now. When he walked, his briefs felt all scruffy. There was hair everywhere! \u201cHow old am I then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cI\u2019d say around 16 years old body wise, and getting older. I have no idea if this reduces your life span. However, I doubt that it\u2019d make that much of an impact. You may end up living forever because of your current circumstance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was looked at Stein and back and Soul continuously. Forever? That\u2019s like\u2026 a long time! How would she cope with aging while he stayed young forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella smirked and thought only to Maka \u201cDon\u2019t worry to much about it. You can always get a wish from another genie. And if that fails, I can go ask my mom for a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka thought \u201cThe Head Witch? Are you nuts! She\u2019d kill me for killing all those other witches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cNot necessarily. She understands that her kids are independent, so she lets them off to do their own things. If anything, she\u2019s probably glad that this might teach her children some humility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was surprised \u201cTalk about tough love. Is that a little cruel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella shrugged in her astral form \u201cYah, well\u2026 she can\u2019t baby them forever. There\u2019s just to many for her to handle. And besides, some aren\u2019t even her children. Some are grandkids and some are from distant families that probably originated from her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019d go to her as a last resort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle shushed \u201cWait. Stein\u2019s talking again.\u201d They stopped mentally chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cSoul, I estimate that you\u2019ll keep growing until your body hits its prime. That\u2019s based off of the fact that it seems like with each consecutive soul you\u2019ve eaten, it makes you stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cSo maybe till I\u2019m 18 or 21?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cProbably around that range. Once people exit puberty, they start to shrink ever so slowly. You\u2019ll probably be at your peak for the rest of your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cAny idea when I\u2019ll stop speeding through puberty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein inhaled via his cigarette \u201cAnywhere between a day and a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul thought about it. He got to skip the pimple/acne/breakouts/hormonal surges/mid-teen crisis/etc, and he got to stay at his prime fore the rest of his life. Not bad\u2026 except for feeling all scruffy. I hope I get use to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt a slight pressure build up. His hairs lengthened. He grew 5in taller. His groin bulged out more. His muscles pumped up a bit. Must have been some huge growth spurt between 16yo and 17yo for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein paused \u201cSorry. You might stop between an 1hr or 1day. You\u2019re about 17 now.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He gained 3 years in a day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella yelled at her mentally \u201cHey! Keep it together! Women must stay strong, or the idiocy of man will run amuck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul coughed \u201cI heard that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella retorted \u201cSo????? You\u2019re not the one watching your best friend grow older before your eyes. How would you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul paused \u201cNervous\u2026 anxious?\u201d He waited for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella stopped talking. She hadn\u2019t expected a response to her supposed rhetorical question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cMaka, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about, I\u2019m still me mentally. MY body is just a bit older.\u201d He tried to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cYah, I know. Its just that you look different and sound different. How long will if take for you to act different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouls sighed \u201cI kind already do. I almost squeezed the door knob into DWMA to the size of a thimble. I need to tone down on my strength. The **** seal won\u2019t do its job for some reason.\u201d he said bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein reasoned \u201cJust a bit of magic to it. It probably can\u2019t keep up with your growth rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cSo I just need to shove some magic into it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul gave it a shot. He focused on the magic in his soul and pulled it towards the seal. Suddenly, he felt his limbs grow heavier. \u201cWow\u2026 I feel kind of weak now.\u201d He rubbed his arms to make sure they were alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cIts to be expected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Soul shot up another 5in in height, and he got hairier and buffer. \u201cI should go shave\u2026 Just as soon as I buy a razor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, so one walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit looked around for Death, but Death wasn\u2019t here at the moment. Then he saw the other\u2026 and Soul. \u201cWhat in the name of Lord Death happened to you!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked over his body. His magic cloths still covered him, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cPapa, the kishin soul is speeding him through puberty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit looked at a larger and hairier Soul \u201cI can see that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cI\u2019m going to go shave. I may be 18 bodily, but this hair makes me look like I\u2019m 25.\u201d He walked away toward a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoment later, Soul came walking back. There were minor scrapes and cuts all over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka held back a smile \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul frowned \u201cI\u2019m a god **** scythe, and I can\u2019t even cut hair off my face! Its embarrassing!\u201d The he looked at Spirit smirking. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit laughed \u201cNothing to important. Let me guess. You turned your arm into a scythe and tried to shave that way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul frowned even more \u201cSo?\u201d He said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit \u201cMy face looked just like that! Try turning just your finger into a scythe next time. It\u2019s much easier than swinging at your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul face palmed but screamed. His face still stung from his recent endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and Bella were laughing their heads off in their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cSee! What did I tell you! The world would have fallen apart millennia ago if not for women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka laughed \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I did believed you. This is just funny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s cuts healed and a new beard formed. He jumped up 4 inches making him an even 8ft 2in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned and turned back to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit yelled behind him \u201cUse your finger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Soul came back rubbing his face. It felt all smooth and clean now. \u201cHow\u2019s it look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit smiled \u201cBetter. You used your finger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul raised his index finger and turned it into a small scythe. \u201cThanks for the help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit sighed as he thought of his first time. Then his frowned\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a pleasant time. \u201cWell\u2026 you owe me. I just saved you weeks of cuts and scrapes.\u201d then he mumbled quietly \u201cUnlike me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at Stein \u201cI\u2019m like 19 now right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cSome where around there. You\u2019re practically out of puberty. Though, weapons tend to have a large spurt at the end to give their weapon form an extra bump in power. So be ready for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded as he stared down at everyone. He just realized that he\u2019s grown over a foot in the few hours. He just prayed he didn\u2019t get 8ft8in\u2026 Kid would be following him for eons to come if it was the number 8... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Soul popped up another 2in making him 8ft4in. \u201c20 years now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this whole process, Soul\u2019s body had reconfigured itself. His back had spread out giving his a larger wing span and the much desired V taper that all bodybuilders have worked for. His biceps were thick as over grown cantaloupes. His pecs pushed out 3in and very defined 8-pack just below it. Under that was a more than decent package. The parcel contained a 36in hose with cantaloupes for water balloons. The only reason the pants don\u2019t explode is because there was a pocket in his briefs had a pocket that held his engorged shaft. There was more space in it than there appeared. Then there were the two tree trunks holding up his goliath torso. His calves were like large diamonds and his thighs were as larger as over grown watermelons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at Stein \u201cWhat age do you think I\u2019ll stop at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThe one after the largest growth spurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul rolled his eyes \u201cThanks for being specific.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smiled \u201cYour welcome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cI wonder when it will happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed. He was anxious. \u201cStein said that when weapons finish puberty, their weapon\u2019s strength is practically doubled, tripled, and in some cases, quadrupled. He said that once our body stabilizes, so does out weapon form, and that\u2019s why it gets so much stronger. I wonder if this just increases the rate I grow at\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to wait then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul paused for a moment \u201cOr not\u2026\u201d He felt his body heat up as it built up energy for a growth spurt again. Suddenly, he shot up a massive 8in bringing him to an exactly 9ft tall. His 36in hose got upgraded to a 40in long 7in thick pipe with two small watermelon shaped filters. His pecs pushed out another 1in and his 8-pack got deeper and even more defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt his shirt suffocate him for a moment, and then it expanded to match his growth. Everything about his was Bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella had found herself drooling in her astral form, but caught herself before anyone could see. She maybe 10000yo, but she still had teenage hormones charging around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka found herself wanting Soul a bit more. Some of Bella\u2019s emotions were leaking into Maka\u2019s mind and gave her some bad ideas. Luckily, her logical side took over and she stopped herself from doing something uncalled for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick and sudden as it was, it was over. Soul was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stood trying to regain his balance. It was thrown off a bit by his sudden growth. When he looked down, he realized how much he\u2019d grown. Maka, at 5ft0in stood just above his waist. \u201cHa\u2026 you\u2019re so tiny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka felt her anger flare. She jumped onto his head and gave signature move \u201cMAKA CHOP!\u201d She smashed her book onto his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul staggered and grabbed onto a lamppost for support. It snapped and fell on him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had been observing from a distance for a while now and he\u2019s discovered that they were perfect copies of each other shape wise, but there coloring is a bit off. However, he was pleased with it enough that it didn\u2019t bother him too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was sitting down playing with a string of anti-magic. She had been practicing and she can weave a scarf out of this anti-magic string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella smiled \u201cWe\u2019re making good progress. Maybe I can get a body by the end of the month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was sitting next to then thinking about stuff\u2026 just stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, a dirty-blond haired kid with tanned skin and a decent build was charging at Death City. He was panting and drenched in sweat. The sun had not shown him much mercy, and neither did the thing following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDWMA main office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid came running in \u201cI need a weapon. Now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk looked at the kid like he was crazy \u201cAre you a student?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid paused \u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClerk looked away again \u201cNot a student? No weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid was frantic \u201cBut its an emergency. If I don\u2019t its going to claim me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClerk was sensing the stress coming off the boy \u201cIt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid looked over his shoulders as though expecting it to arrive any minute \u201cIt\u2026 It! I need to get a weapon before it takes me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul and Maka were walking back when Maka stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked behind them and saw some dust rising in the distance \u201cSoul. Something\u2019s coming. And its fast. You want to take it, or should I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul yawned \u201cI don\u2019t feel like being meister today. You take it.\u201d He turned into a scythe and landed in Maka\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka focused on the things soul and gasped. It was thrumming with madness. \u201cSoul! This thing\u2026 its like the Kishin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul got serious now \u201cOk. Lets get ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing got closer and closer, and it\u2026 it\u2026 it was a 2ft tall black colored humanoid type of thing. It had a white X on its face with two white marbles for eyes. It charged past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka blinked \u201cUhh\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was similar, but he recovered first \u201cMaka! Quick!\u201d Using his soul, magic, and anti-magic, he propelled Maka forward so that they were flying/gliding through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were over it, Maka impaled it with the scythe and sent a deadly does of anti-magic and magic coursing into the thing. It disintegrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWe should go report this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cAny trace of its soul left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cNo\u2026 and also, it doesn\u2019t seem to have one. Did you see a soul materialize?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cNo.. lets go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hurried toward the DWMA when they heard screaming \u201cI need a weapon before it gets me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka pushed the doors to the Main Office open. \u201cHello? What\u2019s the problem here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid turned around and saw Maka holding a scythe weapon. Out of desperation, the boy lunged for the weapon. He latched onto it and ran away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stood where she was\u2026 she was shocked. How is that kid able to hold onto Soul? Can their souls resonate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was pissed \u201cHey kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid ignored him and looked around frantically. He was about 16 years old, Soul thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul repeated \u201cKid.\u201d He was stilled ignored. Now he was angry \u201cKID!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid jumped from shock \u201cHuh? Who said that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul groaned and turned into a human. \u201cI did! Now why one earth did you just grab me from my meister, and my weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid was freaking out. He began to back away \u201cDid\u2026 did you just\u2026 but you were a\u2026. b-b-b-b\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul screamed in his deep commanding voice \u201cWhat on earth are you doing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid fell to his knees crying \u201cThe thing\u2026 past 3 months\u2026 running\u2026so much running\u2026 needed a weapon\u2026 found a weapon\u2026 it\u2019s a\u2026 it\u2019s a\u2026 a\u2026 a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was still pissed, but he could tell that something was off with this kid. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid looked up \u201cSeth. And you were a weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was shocked. The kid was just flipping out and now he was totally fine. \u201cYes\u2026 I am a weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cA weapon that turns into a human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cYah\u2026 Seth, Where are you from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cHawaii\u2026 We don\u2019t have any good weapons there. No swords or anything. It followed me everywhere on Hawaii, and now its here. Wherever here is\u2026\u201d He started to rock back and forth in the fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was kind of at a loss now. He didn\u2019t know how to deal with the mentally insane\u2026 except for Stein. For Stein, all you had to do was show him a picture of Marie (the hammer death weapon). \u201cOk\u2026 is it a black thingy about this tall?\u201d He made some hand gestures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked at his hands and nodded \u201cYes\u2026 did you see it? Is it close?\u201d He was extra paranoid now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded \u201cHe was here, but that girl you took me from killed it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth shook his head \u201cNo\u2026 No\u2026 Noooo!\u201d He grabbed his head and began shaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is what Maka heard when she came by \u201cSoul! What did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was offended \u201cME? He stole me from you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid started to moan in his own agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka edged closer \u201cIts ok\u2026 Soul won\u2018t hurt you anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cIts not gone\u2026 its never gone. Not even under the boulder, or the fire, or the bombs, or the lightning, or the ocean\u2026 its never gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul pointed out \u201cHe\u2019s talking about that black thing you stabbed and disintegrated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka thought about it and asked the kid \u201cHey\u2026 its ok\u2026 We got your back ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt kind of awkward talking to a 16yo this way, but Maka\u2019s female defensive nature had already kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cNothing bad is going to happen to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella spoke to Maka \u201cPump some anti-magic into him. Its should make his soul a bit more balance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka did that, but slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Seth stopped shaking and looked at Maka and Soul. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u2026 why am I here\u2026\u201d Then he remembered \u201cOh my god. I need a weapon!\u201d he got up and ran for the main office again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka screamed \u201cNot this time!\u201d She grabbed his shirt and threw him to the ground \u201cSit!\u201d Her expression was filled with so much power and command that even Death might had sat down let alone a 16yo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth immediately sat down and listened \u201cBut I need a weapon. Now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cNot until you explain to us what is going on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was about to counter, but Soul stopped him. His deep voice said \u201cGive it up kid. I spent about 5 years with Maka and I have never won a single argument, and she has never lost an argument. She won\u2019t lose now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth opened his mouth but closed it as soon as he saw Maka\u2019s glare. \u201cFine\u2026 Its all started when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s the story?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was holding a flaming torch and shooting fire at this black creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth watched from a distance when he finally caught a huge wave. He ignored the torch guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started to reach the shores of the beach.  When he got there, he picked up his surf board and heard a screaming. \u201cRun! Get out of the way!\u201d Seth looked behind and saw the torch guy charging at him. They collided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy was freaking out. He pushed Seth out of the way and started to run again\u2026 it took to long. The thing jumped over Seth and latched onto the torch guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth stared wide eyed. The flame was dying. The other teen\u2019s skin started to pale. And it seemed to shrink on itself. Soon, it was just a floating white ball. Then the ball turned purple and the thing ate it. Then it turned around and saw Seth. It jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was frozen in place. All he could do was stare as it got closer and closer, but it stopped. It landed on the ground writhing in pain. It was covered in fire. Seth looked at the torch and saw that it had relit itself for a brief moment. Then when he looked back at the thing, it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth almost passed out. He got up and kind of went on auto pilot. Like some part of his mind had acquired the instinct to move. He reached for the torch, and grabbed it. The fire came back, and they ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope\u201d was carved into its handle along with \u201cCourage\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth had it confiscated when he boarded a plane to \u201cAnywhere\u2026 just anywhere.\u201d It followed him to anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth shot fire at it over and over again, and it seemed to build a resistance to it now. The flames were getting smaller as well. It jumped and Seth dodged. It got the torch though. Its flames burned black and then it vanished. The whole torch just dematerialized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he ran again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cI need a weapon ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady sitting behind a gun display. She looked the teen over \u201cNo. not old enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth tried to stay calm and polite, but that was getting hard to do since all it did was give IT more time to get to him. \u201cPlease. I need one. Anything. A knife, bow, arrow. What ever! IT is coming!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady looked at the kid quizzically. Could he be one of those people? She reached into her pocket and pulled out a card \u201cGo here. They might have one for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid took it and looked at it \u201cHow do I get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady smiled \u201cJust ask!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady \u201cI can\u2019t go any further. Just keep running that way until you see a strange city. Trust me, I\u2019m not trying to trick you. This is their test of persistence. See how far you can go on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked at the lady determined. He got off her motorcycle and bolted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still bolting\u2026 bolting for almost two straight days. He had seen a dark dot in the distance followed by a stream of sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bolted faster\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw it! The haven and place the lady spoke about. He needed to ask for a weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed \u201cSo I ran here and asked the clerk lady for a weapon. I didn\u2019t know I had to be a student!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled encouragingly \u201cTrust us, this city has you protected. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul scoffed \u201cBy the city, she means us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka frowned \u201cUs and a about a hundred more weapons and meisters!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWhat ever.\u201d Then he heard a sound. The air rippled and got compressed. A dark form grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth flipped out and screamed. He started to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed \u201cMaka, I\u2019ll take this one. You did it last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded and turned into a white dual bladed scythe. She was not a death scythe yet, but she was close. She just needed a witch\u2019s soul\u2026 only if they could find one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul held the scythe at a readied position. It glowed and pulsed with white anti-magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the black form had fully materialized and it was angry. This was its worst time yet. It felt so much pain in a single moment that it almost went more insane if it could have. It turned to face Seth. It could sense the girl, but where\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul charged and struck at it, but it dodged. However, it wasn\u2019t unscathed. The anti-magic in the air around the blade burned at its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt screamed and looked at them with hate. Soul charged again and sliced, but he added some soul into the attack. The anti-magic flared and saturated the air. Even before Soul got close to it, it had been dissolved into nothing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed \u201cIts gone\u2026 at least for now.\u201d He turned to face the kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes opened wide at what he saw. They were fearless\u2026 The scythe was glowing\u2026 What are these people? \u201cWhat are you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked up from where he was looking at \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWhat are you two? You can change into weapons and you attacked it without hesitating. What are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka turned back into a human. She smiled encouragingly \u201cWe\u2019ll tell you, but we have to report this to DWMA. We\u2019ll tell you along the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth tried to grasp all the ideas \u201cSo\u2026 there are two things basically. A weapon and a meister. They are both humans, but few people can actually be either of them. A weapon is basically a weapon, and the meister uses the weapon by shove their soul into it. This place, DWMA, is a place that trains weapons and meisters. Also, meisters can\u2019t pick up a weapon if their souls so not match up.\u201d Now he wondered \u201cThen what are you two? I saw both of you as a weapon and a both of you hold each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cYah, we\u2019re the only pair that is both weapon and meister, so we can change rolls when ever we want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth looked at the two. He saw how much older Soul looked. \u201cAren\u2019t you a bit old to go to school here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul rolled his eyes \u201cNo\u2026 I just look older. I\u2019m 14 like a lot of the other kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s jaw dropped. This guy could pass off as a 21yo modeler. \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cDon\u2019t think on it to much. We\u2019ll lets you know us bit by bit. There\u2019s a lot to cover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a giant tower with spires and other shorter towers next to it, etc.</span></div></div>",

How on earth did their souls resonate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein looked at Maka \u201cHow about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka shook her head \u201cHe hasn\u2019t held me as a scythe yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein looked at Maka and Seth \u201cGive it a try. I want to see if it works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded and turned into a white scythe. Seth freaked and barely managed to catch her. Then when he got his balance, he looked at the scythe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cInteresting\u201d He looked at Soul \u201cNow you turn into a scythe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul rolled his eyes, but played along. He morphed into a black and white scythe. The blades were like the darkest obsidian and the white was like a Maka\u2019s pearly blades. He floated over to Seth, and Seth caught him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein thought about it. Seth is capable of holding both weapons, and both are scythes (the strongest of all the type of weapons). Strange\u2026 \u201cSeth. Can you try to swipe at the air?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled. He was holding two weapons. There is no way that thing could hurt him now. He confidently swung at the air, but he almost lost his balance. He wasn\u2019t used to weapons. The white and black blade sparked as it cut through the air, but other than that, it was inert. Maka on the other hand left a glowing haze as it passed through the air. Seth was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein pondered \u201cOk. Maka and Soul, you can become human again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt his hands grow light as his two weapons vanished from his hands. He smile cockily \u201cAlright, now I should be fine since you are both my weapons. I expect you to be with me at all times. That\u2018s a command since I am your meister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul frown and Maka raised a questioning eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul could feel the arrogance coming off of Seth. Weapons don\u2019t belong to people. They were companions. \u201cMaka\u2026 I don\u2019t really like this guy\u2019s attitude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cNeither do I.\u201d She gave him a glare. Who did he think he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was confused \u201cWhat? I could hold both of you, so that makes me your meister. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul countered \u201cWrong.\u201d He held out his hand and Maka grabbed it. She turned into a scythe and he swung at the air. He pushed some of his soul into the attack. A white wave rushed out and flew off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Soul turned into a scythe and Maka became human. She swung at the air and a black and white wave flew out. The waves attracted each other and exploded off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWe are not your weapons. We can be your companions, but it our choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt himself becoming vulnerable again \u201cB-B-But I need you two. I have to have you two.\u201d He stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was still frowning \u201cNOT have\u2026\u201d He commanded. \u201cWe can help you if WE want to, but it is OUR choice to make.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth shrank down with each time Soul yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked down at the kid \u201cDo I make myself clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth nodded. This guy was supposed to be 14? He could beat me to a pulp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka put a hand on Soul\u2019s arm trying to calm him \u201cSoul, I think he gets the point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sneered \u201cHe had better, or I won\u2019t give a **** if that thing gets him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth whimpered in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka gave Soul a stern look \u201cSoul. He gets the point.\u201d She focused on Seth \u201cRight?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth nodded rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cOk. Good. You\u2019ll sleep at out place tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul protested \u201cWait. What? I\u2019m not letting him sleep in our apartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul \u201cYou look like a grown man! Act your age!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul pursed his lips a smidge \u201cBut I\u2019m only 14!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWith the body of a 21 year old!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cSO???!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSO! People look up at you, so you have to act like a role model. Plus, that voice makes you hard to ignore. There is no denying that you could get anyone to do almost anything with your body and your voice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul thought about it and sighed. \u201cI hate it when you do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cJust doing my job.\u201d She looked at Seth \u201cWe\u2019re going now. Stay close behind. We don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll pop back up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul pointed to a couch \u201cYou can sleep there. Do not touch anything that we didn\u2019t say you could. You can not enter either of our rooms. If you want to eat anything, go ahead. If you touch the chocolate pudding you will die. If anything happens tonight, give us a holler. If not, then I want it dead quiet. Understood?\u201d Soul looked down from his towering 9ft stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s head was bobbing up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul turned around and smile. Maybe Maka was telling the truth.</span></div></div>",

Scythe!\u201d Maka transformed and flew into Soul\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was edged into a corner. The thing was edging up closer to him. Its dark skin mixing into with the shadows of the night. Seth was shaking and trying to find anything to attack it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was partially pissed. He was having a nice dream about going to the Bahamas with Maka and there was no one there to bother him or her. However, he\u2019d never admit to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked at the thing and started to shove his soul into the white scythe, but he did not execute an attack. Quickly, the blades flared white and tons of anti-magic was being pushed into the air. As soon as it reached the thing, it screamed and slowly dissolved. It had turned and looked at Soul hatefully before It was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka turned back into a human and ran over to Seth. He was shaking and frantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cIts alright. Its gone. Get up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Mind Scape---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella sighed \u201cYou know that you\u2019re babying him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella \u201cLet me or Soul talk to him. He\u2019ll probably freak if he heard me. Soul is probably a better choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka scoffed mentally \u201cYou want Soul to talk to this guy nicely?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughed \u201cNo! I want him to rough this kid up a bit. Show him to stand up for himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka thought about it \u201cI guess that could work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Exit Mind Scape---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella just finished filling Soul in on the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul rolled his eyes\u2026 yay\u2026 more work. \u201cHey Seth. Get up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth still stammered. His eyes were glazed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul frowned and loomed over him \u201cGet\u2026 up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth remains unresponsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul growled. This is what Maka and Bella asked for. Soul picked Seth up by the first and walked to the front door. He tossed Seth out and followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Seth hit the ground, an awareness of vulnerability came over him. \u201cWait. What\u2019s going on?\u201d He looked up in time to block a kick from Soul. \u201cWhat the ****?\u201d He flew back 10ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul growled \u201cGet up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was moaning \u201cIt hurts. What was that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s face remained emotionless \u201cGet up. If you want me and Maka to protect you, show us that you\u2019re worth or time. If not, I\u2019ll keep kicking you until\u2026 well you can take a guess at that.\u201d His face was almost cynical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth backed up, but was still on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed and gave him another kick sending him back another 10ft. \u201cGet up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth groaned. His gut and his left leg were killing him now. Not to mention his ass. He looked up to see Soul approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cGet up.\u201d He got ready for another kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth felt time slow down. What was he doing? This guy was going to kill him, and he was doing nothing. The leg got closer and closer, and he\u2026 well Seth rolled out of the way. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem!\u201d He stood up limping slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked \u201cNothing. I just wanted you to stand so I could punch you.\u201d He raised a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth back up again. This guy was insane!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul swung and Seth block with his arms. Seth felt burning fire run up his arm and he toppled over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cGet up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth groaned, but got up. He saw another punch and ducked. Then he saw a kick and jumped. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked \u201cThat\u2019s it. Now dodge this.\u201d He swung twice and kicked and danced around Seth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth tried his best to see where the blows were coming from, and he did for the most part. It was like some instinct in the back of his mind was telling him what to do, and he just followed it. Then suddenly, he felt something odd. He raised both arms to block and suddenly a pair of shields grew out of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul felt his hand strike at something solid. There was a clank. He looked and saw two shields over lapping to cover Seth from his attacks. \u201cWhat the?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smirked but then he frowned. His body collapsed on the ground thoroughly exhausted. The shields on his arms disappeared and his world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was in the infirmary. He opened his eyes and blinked as they adjusted to the light. His body was on fire. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul chuckled \u201cDon\u2019t moan now. I was just starting to think you were cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth\u2019s head snapped toward Soul. Seth\u2019s eyes narrowed as they focused on him \u201cAre you mad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed \u201cNope. Wait, I take that back. Everyone is a little mad. IF not, then the world would be a pretty dull place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was still partially fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened to let Maka and the school nurse, Medusa, in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cYou\u2019re awake! I thought you might have decided to stay another week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was shocked \u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa smiled \u201c3 weeks. Just enough time for your bones to heal and some major bruises. Though, you are far from done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth almost passed out again \u201c3 weeks!\u201d He glared at Soul \u201cYou!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smirked \u201cYes\u2026 me. But on the bright side, we discovered that you are a Shield.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cA what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cA shield. They are extremely rare. There hasn\u2019t been any reappearances in over 5 centuries. At least until you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was dumbstruck \u201cBut what is a shield?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka explained \u201cThey have an incredibly strong defensive soul which takes the form of a shield. It is almost impossible to break or pierce. The person, you, who is a shield will grow stronger the more souls they eat. However, not human souls. If you did that, then you\u2019d turn to the Dark Side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was lost for words. I am a shield? Is that what happened when Soul was beating the **** out of me? \u201cWhat else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWell, they can take the form of a shield attached to someone\u2019s arms. Or, if you have enough experience, you can become a suite of armor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was amazed. I can do all of that? \u201cCan I become a shield now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa shook her head \u201cI highly advice against it. Your body s still recovering from your ordeal. If you transformed now, you might lose the ability. You\u2019re body is still adapting to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth sighed. He really wanted to change into a shield now, but he didn\u2019t want to lose the ability, so he waits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cBeing a Shield explains why you could hold be and Maka. A shield can resonate with anything! You\u2019re basically universal and you are a nearly indestructible defense. You might be lucky enough to have a special ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cIn the past, Shield could possible have an attribute or skill. Such as an attack such as coating yourself in lightning, or create raging infernos. Some had abilities such as healing or long ranges defense. Like a force field. None are the same. At least not that we know of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth groaned \u201cI hope I get better soon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth was growing ocean blue. He was focusing on the shape of a shield. He remembered his arms becoming shields, and now he wanted to trying becoming one fully. Suddenly, his whole body was enveloped in a blue light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul walked over and picked up the shield. It was shaped like a pentagon with an ice blue sapphire in the middle of it. Intricate designs flowed from the pentagonal sapphire. Its reached out and touched smaller ones. It was an ocean like wave that flowed over the shield. \u201cI might be wrong, but I think you\u2019re special skill has to do with water.\u201d Soul held it up and saw that it was about a meter in diameter. It gave Soul decent coverage from any assault. \u201cI have to admit, you do look kind of cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth beamed \u201cWell duh! The only shield in centuries has to be pretty cool. Now try punching me. You won\u2019t leave a dent I bet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul made a face \u201cIs that a challenge? Fine then. I accept.\u201d Soul pulled back his arm and punch the shield with al her had. There was a loud thud, but nothing else. \u201cWow\u2026 nothing.\u201d Soul looked it over and there really was not a single dent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth smiled. This were looking up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw Soul\u2019s soul pulsing with explosive amounts of soul energy. Then it stopped. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was smiling as he felt power flowing through his veins, but the feeling soon fled. He sighed \u201cOddly normal, but I feel so pumped. Like there\u2019s liquid energy running through my veins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cWell Death Scythe, shall we go home?\u201d She pointed down the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cRace yah!\u201d He started sprinting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka smiled \u201cNo fair!\u201d She laughed as she ran to catch up with her weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was jumping past pumpkins and tree root when suddenly he smashed into a pair of flesh globes. \u201cOomph.\u201d He pushed his face and looked up past the two fleshy mounds. His mind blanks out \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cat -like lady pouted \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice. Killing me while I was being nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Maka had caught up. As soon as she saw the witch, her feet tripped up and she fell over. She got up and ranted \u201cHow on earth are you still alive! I thought I killed you! Soul ate your soul!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch turned into a cat and meowed \u201cI\u2019m a cat. What did you think I was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul tipped over in embarrassment \u201cI\u2026 I ate a cat\u2019s soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed as she felt humility take over her mind. They were the only pair to willingly eat a non-witch soul for their 100th soul\u2026 \u201cExcuse me, but why are you alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat meowed \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m a cat. didn\u2019t you know we have more than one life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka took a deep breath \u201cOk Soul. We\u2019re going home. Back to square one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was still on the ground moping. There were comical wavy lines of depression floating above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka sighed \u201cLets go. Get up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul still stayed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka frowned \u201cGet up!\u201d, but he stayed down. She had enough \u201cMAKA CHOP!\u201d She took her book and smashed it down on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul rocketed up and began to yelled \u201cWhat was that for! Can\u2019t you see th- Hey Maka, did you get shorter?\u201d Soul was tilting his head down slightly. They used to be at eye level, but he was a good 3in taller now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka looked at Soul wide eyed \u201cN-no\u2026 but I think you got t-t-taller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked down at the ground. There was a slight change in view points, but nothing too huge. Then suddenly, he felt a tingle run over his body. He felt his muscles thrum with energy. \u201cM-Maka\u2026 I feel something happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat turned back into a human \u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s the weirdest allergic reaction I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul and Make looked at the cat lady with surprise \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat lady \u201cYou\u2019re body is reacting strangely to the magic in my soul. Well, that\u2019s what my eyes are telling me. Did I tell you that cats can see magic? We have such good eye sight.\u201d She sighed as she thought about how great cats were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked down at his body. He felt his shirt grow tighter and tighter as he grew bigger. Already, you could see the outline of some meaty pecs, and a pair of large biceps. If his shirt was off, you could see a 6-pack forming. RIP. The sleeve to his shirt started tearing off. With every heart beat, he grew more and more. The veins on his arms bulged out as they fed blood to his ever growing muscles. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d He felt kind of odd, his pants were really tight, and were getting tighter. With every pulse, his semi-erect cock lengthened. It tried to fill with blood, but it grew to fast to be filled. POP! His button popped off and the zipper ripped open. A pair of tight briefs were revealed, and they looked just about ready to explode. Soul continued to moan\u2026 it felt so good. RIP! His shirt fell to tatters as his growing torso expanded. His helf like pecs covered his view. His massive 6-packs were as big as CD\u2019s. His biceps were larger than his head, and his forearm was like a football. RIP! His pants had torn off to show watermelon thighs and bowling ball calves. There was a CRACK as his bones started to grow to fit his growth. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d RIP! SNAP! His briefs flew off into the distance and a one-eyed snake flopped to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka\u2019s face turned red, and she turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat wasn\u2019t as modest. She walked up and smiled into Soul\u2019s glazed eyes \u201cBig boy aren\u2019t you?\u201d She jiggled her chest to catch his attention, and then suddenly his snake turned into a 16in flag pole. The cat felt extra playful now. She looked at the giant mushroom head and then turned into a cat. She pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cOh! Faster! Faster!\u201d Pleasure was surging down his monster python and up his spine. White pre began to leak out and splatter over the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat climbed up (without claws) and started swatting at the head playfully and started to jump and run around. It jumped off the head and landed on his baseball balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul screamed in pleasure and then his fiery rod erupted with white lava. Buckets were coming out and the cat was running all over for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stood to the side chanting away the scene behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul panted. His flag pole fell limp and landed on the ground. He lay still in his post orgasm glow. Then he realized \u201c**** I\u2019m naked!\u201d He turned into a scythe so Maka could turn around. \u201cMaka\u2026 I\u2019m a scythe now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka turned around and saw a scythe laying in a giant pool of steaming white seeds. She sighed \u201cI\u2019m not touching that.\u201d She remained abstinent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked out of his blade and saw what she meant. He quickly turned back into a human, but he reappeared behind a tree. \u201cOuch!\u201d He just bumped his head on a branch 7ft off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cNothing. Don\u2019t worry about it. Catch.\u201d He turned back into a scythe and Maka caught him. They started walking to the DWMA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat was on the ground licking up its precious milk. She thought \u201cWhat a strange allergic reaction. Maybe I should die a second time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My daughter!\u201d Spirit, Maka\u2019s father whom she ignores, came sprinting into the room only to be stopped by a largely muscled arm. \u201cOomph.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled. He hadn\u2019t felt a thing  It was that easy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit looked up to see a mountain of muscle and then a head that he recognized \u201cSoul!!! W-W-What happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul smiled \u201cNothing bad, if that\u2019s what you wanted to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit frowned \u201cYou know what I mean. How did\u2026\u201d He waves at Soul\u2019s body \u201c\u2026 all that happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cI\u2019m allergic to magic, I guess, and it makes me grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit paused. Was that even possible? Then again, magic could do a lot of random things. Spirit sighed and turned toward Maka \u201cMaka! How\u2019s it feel to make a death scythe at only 14! That\u2019s a huge achievement, and I\u2019m very proud.\u201d Then heard a sniffing sound. He looked at his daughter and saw her shaking slightly \u201cMaka?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka blurted out \u201cI didn\u2019t make a death scythe! It was a magic cat\u2019s soul\u2026\u201d She started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit recoiled. He had thought she would succeed, and that this would help repair their bond, but it did the opposite! Suddenly, he felt himself flying back a few yards as a giant arm tossed him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul fumed. His eyes told Spirit to stay away or else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit glared at Soul. Maka was HIS daughter, and he\u2019d be as annoying as he wanted. He\u2019d do anything\u2026 ANYTHING! For his little girl. But he could wait for now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul bent down and tried to get Maka to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath was watching and he decided to make a phone call. He went to his mirror and spoke \u201cStein. Please come to my room. ASAP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image of a pale man wearing stitched clothing, and a screw in his head, nodded at Death\u2019s request, and then the image cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cSoul and Maka, I\u2019d like you to meet one of the brightest students ever produced at DWMA, Stein. I think he\u2019ll be able to help you two.\u201d Death points to the man that was in the mirror before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth whispered to Maka \u201cIs it me, or does that guy have a screw in his head?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka shook her head \u201cNo\u2026 I see it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein was smoking a cigarette \u201cI can hear both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka \u201cSorry\u2026 uhh\u2026 Mr. Stein.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cJust call me Stein.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cFine Stein, do you know what is going on with what happened to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein smirked evilly \u201cI\u2019ll need to dissect you first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a voice yelled \u201cWHAT IS HE DOING HERE!\u201d Spirit had just walked in, but hid behind Soul the moment he saw Stein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein\u2019s eyes opened upon seeing Spirit \u201cOh! Spirit, good to see you. I\u2019ve missed dissecting you at night before your wife came along and took you away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit yelled \u201cI\u2019m glad she did! The scars have just all vanished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein sighed. He pulled out a surgical knife \u201cMaybe tonight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit shrieked and ran out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was shocked by what just happened, but one thing was clear \u201cYou are not cutting me open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein resigned \u201cFine\u2026 it was worth a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka asked nicely \u201cSo, Stein, could you please tell us what\u2019s going on with Soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cYou both know that magic is a very volatile particle, and it reacts with everything and changes it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka and Soul stare at Stein with lost gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein ignored the faces \u201cWell, everyone reacts to magic differently in its pure state. An example of a non-pure state is a spell. The particles are changed to follow a certain order and to achieve a certain goal. The pure state, however, could simply be a ball of magic, or a magic soul. There are other examples that I won\u2019t go into detail. For Soul, it seems that you react by growing dramatically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded as the ideas flowed into his head \u201cI think I understand. So it is like an allergic reaction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cIn a sense, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul \u201cSo if I were exposed to more, then I\u2019d grow more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein nodded \u201cMost likely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul nodded understating \u201cI see\u2026 how about others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cWell, some people get rashes, or their body simply blocks out the magic, but they could block it in different ways. Some people\u2019s souls become increasingly dense to block out the magic, and some other absorb it and turn it into something else. It always varies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul thought about it, and the thought of growing stronger entered his mind. He was huge after eating a simply magic cat\u2019s soul. What if it were an actual witch\u2019s soul?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka was wondering how she reacted to magic. It\u2019d help her, to know when she fought a witch or something. \u201cStein, is there a way for me to see how I react?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein thought about it and nodded \u201cYes. You will need a Magic Mist Crystal and a full moon. When the moon beam passes through the crystal, the light should be turned into magic. Just touch it, and you should see. The beam is relatively low in concentration, so you should be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded \u201cDo we have a magic crystal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath responded \u201cNope, but it\u2019d be nice if you two found one for the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stared at Death with a sarcastic and lazy look \u201cReally? Why Maka and me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cBecause I asked you to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was about to counter, but Maka told him to give it up. No one wins against Lord Death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cThe crystals are mined in a cave inside Fog Forest. When you get there, you should be able to sense a strong source of magic. Follow it and you should find the cave. To get the crystal, you need to Soul as a pickaxe. Once you get it, just retrace your steps and come back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s logic was screaming at him \u201cIf its that simple, why aren\u2019t there more in the world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein \u201cBecause they are made very slowly. You\u2019ll have to hunt for one that someone missed. Oh, and also. The deep you go, the more condensed the crystal is, and the stronger the magic it makes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka nodded and dismissed Soul and herself. \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll be going then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath \u201cGood luck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His skin, tanned from the beating sun, rippled lightly as muscles worked to swing the broom back and forth. \u201cYes Lieutenant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large, plump man with rather bulbous features glared down at the 15. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Know your place, and one day, you may be as great as I, the amazing Marechiyo \u014cmaeda!\u201d Then the great Marechiyo \u014cmaeda suddenly found himself falling to the ground with a nimble foot in his face. He looked up \u201cC-Ca-Captain Su\u00ec-F\u0113ng. I-I-I was just telling Senju Daiken to get off his lazy ass an-\u201d He found himself flying through the air with another kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui\u2019s face was monotone and unchanging \u201cNever use such low life language in my presence\u2026 even if you may be one with the low life\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmaeda\u2019s eyes watered. He looked up to his captain (and feared her) to no ends! \u201cB-Bu-\u201d He stopped talking. Sui\u2019s eyes were filled with so much will and fire that Omaeda thought he might be paralyzed for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju  was still working diligently like nothing new was happened (which wasn\u2018t all a lie).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*If any of you could tell me what Senju means, I\u2018d appreciate it.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui looked at Senju \u201cSenju!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju looked up and ran up to Sui. He was totally composed and waiting for his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui smiled. She liked this kid\u2026 reminded her of herself when she was his age\u2026 maybe a few decades ago. \u201cSenju, you have been assigned to Karakura town to help Zennosuke\u2026\u201d She trailed off as painful memories of what the klutz was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju thought that was unusual \u201cSui\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui snapped back into reality \u201cWhat! Do not interrupt my train of thought.\u201d She silently thanks Senju from saving her from her own mind. \u201cYou will pack a change of cloths, and your Zanpakuto with you.\u201d She waited a moment to let him think. She knew of his little issue \u201cAre there any questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju sighed \u201cI know you know that I can\u2019t use my zanpakuto\u2026 well, I can, but my spiritual pressure is so low that I can\u2019t even cut a hollow\u2026 let alone defend a whole town. So why send me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui smiled \u201cYou may have heard of a certain substitute shinigami. His names makes my blood boil, but he is of use to Soul Society. But back on topic. You will accept what I will say as truth. Understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju nodded and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui sighed \u201cYou, other than my predecessor, are the only one who has ever been able to sneak up on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju\u2019s eyes opened in astonishment. Sure, he messed around one day and popped up behind the Captain, but she didn\u2019t act surprised or anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmaeda\u2019s unconscious mind heard this and made him wake up \u201cWhat! I-Impossible! Captain Sui, surly you are joking! Even I, as you second in command, could not do such a thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui gave his a silencing glare, but decided to deal with him later. She turned back to Senju \u201cYes. I am not lying to you. You have great skills. Maybe the best\u2026 next to me at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju argued humbly \u201cCaptain Sui, I-I\u2026 I\u2019m not that great. Sure, I do well grade wise. I can pass the exams, but I can\u2019t work with others. I mess up to much to be part of a team. The written grade is fine, but the actual application is couldn\u2019t be worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui raised a challenging eyebrow \u201cNow really? How do you explain the fact that you snuck up on me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju paused and thought about it \u201cIt must be that my Spiritual Pressure was so low that no one could register me. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui laughed \u201cDo you think that is all I look for? I am always watching. Even when I sleep. I listen and a feel. The air moves when something moves. The earth vibrates with every step. I smell\u2026 well, I don\u2019t usually have to resort to that because of\u2026\u201d She turned to Omaeda and gave him a hateful glare. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t just look for spiritual pressure. I listen for other tangible things as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju couldn\u2019t believe this. He couldn\u2019t possibly be that good. He always goofed up in class, and when people looked at him. He liked it when he was alone with his surroundings. His favorite place is a small stream that existed next to a small waterfall. He could sit for hours and simply be. \u201cBut Captain Su-\u201d His instincts told his to duck, so he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightning fast arm missed his head by inches, and continued past it towards a larger target. Omaeda found himself on his knees clutching his face in agony. A neon red hand blared on his left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui smiled \u201cYou will leave tomorrow morning. Meet me at the main Senkaimon Gate.\u201d Sui turned and walked away. She thought \u201cIf anyone can help him, then that orange haired Spiritual Pressure monster of a human could help. Well, Him and Urahara.\u201d She gagged at the thought of that candy seller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju was shocked. What did he just do? Maybe Sui went easy on him. He couldn\u2019t have evaded her attack. Then he saw a note place where Sui was standing. There was a cute chibi of her giving a thumbs up. It said \u201cNo\u2026 I did not go easy on you. Go ask Omaeda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju\u2019s hands were shaking as he read the note. \u201cLieutenant Omaeda, how strong was that hit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmaeda got up slowly as he looked out for his captain. There was a red hand still imprinted on his face. \u201cWa\u2019th? Th\u2019am it\u2019th. I bi\u2019th ma th\u2019ongue!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Senju needed to hear. Could she really have been serious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju looked at Sui. A hell butterfly flapped by his head waiting to take him over to the other side of the Senkaimon Gate. \u201cCaptain Sui\u2026 are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui nodded firmly \u201cYou will go to that town and you will keep watch. Understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju bowed as he said yes. He looked at the white portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui sighed patiently \u201cYou know\u2026 you might even learn how to call to your Zanpakuto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju felt his heart skip a beat. He\u2019d have done anything to learn the name of his Zanpakuto. It was one of the few ways he could improve his abilities, and maybe even increase his spiritual pressure. However, he was told it was impossible because his spiritual pressure was far to low to even support a Shikai (the second form of a Zanpakuto that is initiated by calling out to the spirit inside the Zanpakuto). He stuttered \u201cY-Yes C-Captain Sui.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui smiled \u201cGood. Now go. Zennosuke will be waiting for you on the other end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju bowed respectfully and began to walk towards the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui remembered something \u201cOh. One more thing. If you get the chance, please put some lice in his hair. Telling him that he doesn\u2019t need to worry about the incident anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju listened. His curiosity was starting to peak, but he knew better than to ask \u201cYes Captain Sui.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui \u201cGood. Now go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju walked into the white portal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the hard work went into developing stamina, strength, and speed. But still, he wasn\u2019t like those giant muscle giants like Kenpachi or even the General Captain! His build was more modest, and built for speed and endurance. He was the fastest in his Squad, but when someone looked at him, he always tripped up. But anyway, he kind of looked like a stereotypic Hawaiian kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake a look at this photo and see for your self. I\u2019d like the thank Boo Boo Stewart at this time:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i613.photobucket.com/albums/tt216/runsfromreality/Wolf%20Pack/0429-booboo-stewart-splash-credit.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i613.photobucket.com/albums/tt216...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke was standing in his usual proud posture. The Sekaimon gates appeared and his guest appeared. \u201cWELCOME TO KARAKURA TOWN! MY DOMAIN!\u201d He yelled obnoxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light cleared, Senju looked and saw where he was. He thought \u201cDammit. Why am I in that air? I can\u2019t even walk on air yet because my spiritual pressure is so low.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke was bewildered. \u201cWell come on! Get down here so I can show you my true strength!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju was trying to think of what strength he could possibly be talking about. From what he could see, and what he collected from Sui\u2019s actions, this Zennosuke guy is a buffoon. Almost as much as he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit him. Both buffoons of Soul Society were sent to the same town\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju sighed. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t have been that amazing.\u201d He yelled to Zennosuke \u201cHey! How hard are the Hollows here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke smirked \u201cThey are all pipsqueaks compare to my strength. Do not fear! For Zennosuke is here! Now come down. Let me show you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju held onto the doors of the Sekaimon. \u201cI can\u2019t get down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t think I heard you right. You can\u2019t get down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju bobbed his head in shame \u201cYes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke smirked \u201cWell fine them. I\u2019ll be right up, and then I can show you around.\u201d Finally! Someone to admire my strengths. Unlike that supposed Substitute Shinigami around the corner, or what ever he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke was talking long strides \u201cKeep up! Keep up!\u201d His eyes closed in ignorant pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju stopped walking \u201cZennosuke, I\u2019m in front of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke frowned \u201cGet back here. I\u2019m head of this town and you better listen. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju was trained to obey superiors, and by rank, Zennosuke was superior\u2026 Though Senju felt like he could have taken him on. Obliging, he walked back and trailed byhind the slow Zennosuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke smiled \u201cGood. Know your place. Since its your first time, I will excuse you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju mentally rolled his eyes \u201cYes Zennosuke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke \u201cThat\u2019s Head Zennosuke to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju\u2019s head tilted in exasperation.

Why did you do this to me\u2026\u201d Then he remembered something, and he smirked \u201cI wonder where I can get some lice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke was screaming\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZennosuke\u2019s face was beet red, and his ears were steaming \u201cGet out, and don\u2019t come back until you learn some respect.\u201d The doors slammed shut. The last thing Senju saw was a disheveled head of hair, and some tiny bugs jumping around in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju pulled out his phone, and a message appeared \u201cVideo Sent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead Captain Yamamoto \u201cSui, why have you asked my to call all the captains together? What has your stealth squad found out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui\u2019s face was blank, but her mind was screaming. \u201cCaptain Kurotsuchi, if you would please turn your large screen on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head of the science department rolled his eyes \u201cIf I must\u2026\u201d He pushed a button on a remote, and a screen appeared from the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui went up and connected her phone. She pressed play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Head Captain Yamamoto was smiling, and then he frowned. \u201cCaptain Sui!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery captain and lieutenant grew serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui \u201cYes Captain Yamamoto!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead Captain Yamamoto \u201cI order you to forward that video to every phone in all of soul society!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the people in the room looked at each other oddly. Did we hear Head Captain Yamamoto correctly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSui smiled \u201cYes Head Captain Yamamoto!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, all of the spirit world was filled with joy. Drinks were shared and parties were started. \u201cHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAA!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju smiled lightly. \u201cNow where do I go?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Senju strolled down the street. He didn\u2019t worry to much about sticking to the shadows since none of the humans could see him. Suddenly, he felt an increase in pressure. A Hollow had just appeared. \u201cDammit.\u201d He started running to the source. I hope it\u2019s a pip-squeak like he had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju passed by dozens of houses. Some were made of stone. One house, however, made him pause. Its was a clinic. \u201cKurosaki Clinic.\u201d He sensed a strong spiritual pressure coming from with in the house. Immensely strong, but it was a human\u2019s pressure. He\u2019d have to hurry them. This human would most likely draw any hollow within a dozen miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju sprinted pasted the clinic with his Stealth Squad Speed and found himself in a park. He looked around, but the hollow seemed to have disappeared. He smashed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant white gloved hand, and a heavily muscles eight-armed humanoid hollow stood above him. Its giant hand, bigger the Senju, easily held down the weak Shinigami. It pounded the ground once more to make sure its meal was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju was broken bodily and mentally. His body was sending waves of pain to his mind, but it was so great that his mind could not comprehend it. It simply ignored it. He saw the hollow pick him up and he thought \u201cIs this how it ends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, it really looked at him and threw him aside. His soul was so weak in spiritual pressure that it wasn\u2019t interest. It\u2019d take more energy to process his soul than the power it would give. It turned and faced a small child passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child hadn\u2019t noticed the sudden appearance of a crater in the ground, so it moved forward indifferently\u2026 until it was picked up. The little girl started to struggle and scream for help, but it was silences. Her eyes were filled with panic and horror. It was an invisible monster!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju was on the ground with a broken body. He was yelling at himself \u201cThe child! Don\u2019t you dare!!! Come on Senji Daiken! Dai is for big and Ken is for strong! I need to be strong. GET UP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard a voice. His smaller than average Zanpakuto was glowing a hazy watery blue. \u201cWhy do you want to be strong?\u201d The voice was a serene and calm voice, but it had incredible command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenju was silent. This was his Zanpakuto speaking to him. Like all the others, he had to pass its test to learn its name. \u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Then he saw the little girl being held higher as the hollow opened it mouth. It revealed a dark and bottomless pit. \u201cI want to protect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was silent. Then there was the sound of crashing water. \u201cYou may call me Seishin Mizu\u2026 the spirit of water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenji felt his body fill with spiritual pressure. It was like a dam had fallen and it had released a torrent of power into his body. His Zanpakuto pulsed as it grew larger and longer (Zanpakuto were swords that grew in size to match the spiritual pressure of their master. Their shikai form could be almost anything. And finally, their Bankai form is like the Shikai form, but to a greater degree.) Not in Shikai form, his sword had kept growing to match the ever growing pressure its master was now making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, like his sword, his body had started to grow. It was making to much spiritual pressure that it couldn\u2019t handle it all. It needed to get stronger to handle it all. Quickly, Senji felt his body heal and his muscles started to tingle. He looked down at his arm and saw it was rippling. It got toner and slightly larger than before, but other than that, there was no huge change. However, the tingle was still there. He felt himself growing stronger still! One part kept growing though. His sword (not the Zanpakuto) started to grow longer and longer as it tried to break free of its own sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, his body stopped growing as it matched his spiritual pressure. It was a really tight build meant for stealth, strength, speed, and other things. Though, his knew endowment may or may not get in the way of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Zanpakuto was still growing though, so that meant he wasn\u2019t quite done. His body was getting stronger along with his growing pressure, but it seemed to get squished into his frame. His Zanpakuto had reached out 10 meters now, and his own sword had reached about 35cm long and 7cm wide. It carried two baseball sized ornamental bells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hollow had stopped messing with the girl as it sensed the growing power of Senji. It dropped the girl and made it way toward its first meal choice. A 50m long sword crushed the hollow\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenji was still laying faced down. His arm was up holding his absurdly huge sword that was still growing longer. It was actually growing faster and was getting as long as a tall hotel. He looked to the side and saw the girl was on the ground bleeding and unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard himself saying \u201cI call upon thee Seishin Mizu, the spirit of water.\u201d His Zanpakuto glowed ocean blue and the scent of salt and ocean filled the air. Then it evaporated into the air as steam. Soon, though, a bubble of water formed around the girl and glowed. The girl coughed as she started to breath again. The blood stopped bleeding, and it was replenished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as that was gone, the water vanished and a sword appeared in Senji\u2019s sheath. Then he passed out from all the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSenji was sat up with a jolt and he felt something was wrong. He felt his world shatter \u201cWhat was the name of my Zampakuto!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and suddenly he grabbed onto a nearby tree. He felt light headed as he was at least a foot taller than before. Standing at 7ft tall now at age 15, he had to be the tallest for his age group in all of Soul Society. His build was slightly above average (compared to his height), but it looked good on his body. It did not impede his well honed flexibility, or speed. \u201cI guess its not all bad.\u201d But he was still screaming. He wanted to punch himself senseless until he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The epic scene of Voldemort\u2019s defeat was playing all ever the newspaper. Sadly, he didn\u2019t enjoy it all that much. He never was a person who enjoyed attention... less it was quidditch. In his mind, he just never got used to the whole idea of being the chosen one. Now he was sitting in a large private room the school had given him in honor of his victory.<br>\r\nHe heard a knock at his door. \u201cCome in!\u201d<br>\r\nHe was greeted with the sight of his bestmate ducking through the doorway, \u201cHarry, how\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been ok. A lot of attention.\u201d He faked a smiled.<br>\r\nRon snorted. \u201cMore than a lot. The public\u2019s gone bonkers! I saw t-shirts with your face earlier today at Diagon Alley. Girls were lining up at posters of you and kissing your face. I swear there\u2019s more lipstick and ink left on those papers.\u201d Ron warned, \u201cYou know you\u2019ll be murdered if you go out there. They\u2019ll suck the skin off of you with your suckers they call lips.\u201d<br>\r\nHarry sighed, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just stay indoors for a while. It\u2019ll calm down eventually.\u201d<br>\r\nRon nodded, \u201cYah, I guess you could keep doing that. It\u2019s been what? A month since you defeated Voldemort. The wizarding world is still recovering.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI just wish they would give other people the credit they are giving me. Like I couldn\u2019t have down it with you or Hermione. Hermione had all the brains, which probably kept us alive all this time. And you, when we had to get Helga\u2019s cup from Gringotts. Only all 9ft of you could have reached the cup since we couldn\u2019t use magic in the chamber. That, and you won that chess match back in first year, and saved me from that cursed necklace. I just wish they would acknowledge that.\u201d Harry said downtrodden.<br>\r\nRon said, \u201cHey, I think I found a way for you to get away from all this. It\u2019ll be like you were never the Boy-Who-Lived in the first place. People would leave you alone.\u201d<br>\r\nHarry perked up, \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After flipping through the pages, Ron stopped somewhere near the end. \u201cThis spell is the transfer of identity and destiny. It will allow you to pass over your identity as the boy-who-lived, and all the hogwash fame will be lifted off your shoulders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was amazed. Being the boy who lived has been a pain since the first year of his life. His parents died, his relatives were Satan reborn, Voldemort trying to kill him, enemies, death, monsters, and so much more. But being able to get rid of it all would be\u2026 would just be a dream come true. And this was his friend Ron talking. He\u2019d trust his best mate with his life. \u201cHow do we get started?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was hoping you\u2019d say yes, so I had the potions all prepared. Just drink this and it will be done.\u201d Ron handed Harry a golden colored solution.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? Just drink this? What\u2019s in it?\u201d Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhoenix tears, basilisk scales, willow bark, acromantula silk, and newt eyes. It was a complex potion to make, but I had help.\u201d Ron explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded as he lifted the small vial. \u201cWell here\u2019s to a quieter future!\u201d Harry tipped the vial back and down the solution. He smacked his lips a few times, \u201cTastes like apple juice.\u201d Suddenly he felt a burning feeling down in his gut. It was quickly spreading outwards to his extremities. \u201cErg! It burns Ron. Did you know this would happen?\u201d Harry grabbed and leaned against a table for support. Then he looked up at Ron who was grinning almost madly. \u201cRon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fight it Harry. The potion needs to mess with your body and soul for a bit. In order for you to get rid of your fame, you need to get rid of the thing that fame is attached to, and that\u2019s your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. \u201cW-Why\u2026 what\u2019s going to happen to me?\u201d He felt the heat getting stronger. At some point, he lost grip on the table and collapsed on the ground, his body convulsing. He saw a golden light and suddenly he was ejected from his body. The pain and all physical limitations vanished. \u201cW-what happened?\u201d He tried to say, but no sound came out. What happened? I can\u2019t speak. He looked around and found that he was floating in the air. Below him, he saw Ron crouching over his own body. Harry lifted his hand and was surprised to see that it was transparent. Oh my merlin\u2026 am I dead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw his body being lifted over Ron\u2019s shoulder and then forcefully shoved into a small bag. Harry followed Ron as they left the school and headed for the Shrieking Shack. There was a cauldron bubbling in the middle of the room already. \u201cAlright then. Time to get famous.\u201d Ron said to no one in particular. \u201cSorry Harry, but you weren\u2019t enjoying your life anyway. Maybe I enjoy it for you.\u201d Ron opened the small back and dumped Harry\u2019s body onto the floor where Ron proceeded to rip Harry\u2019s close off. He had a little trouble around Harry\u2019s midsection, but he his pants and briefs came off, Ron was a bit shocked. \u201cMy god, how on earth did you pack that monster away every morning?\u201d His face grew a bit red with envy, but then he smirked. \u201cIt\u2019ll only be added to what I have anyway.\u201d Ron took the now naked body of Harry Potter and slowly lowered it into the cauldron of bubbling, brown solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had attempted to stop Ron, but found that his ghostly arms could only pass through solid material. Ron you lying bastard! This isn\u2019t what I wanted! I thought we were friends!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown solution started to clear up into a perfectly transparent solution. \u201cFantastic, it\u2019s down.\u201d He started to strip off his cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, even in his death, finally understood a lot of Ron\u2019s insecurities. Oh\u2026 he had that prick of a half man? Damn, no wonder he was always jealous of me. Heck, I\u2019m even more fit than him\u2026 though he is stronger. But still, look at the tubby stomach of his. He\u2019s lucky the school robes are baggy or everyone would see where all that food went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets see, is his body fully dissolved?\u201d Ron looked in the cauldron and saw nothing. \u201cGreat, time to cool you down.\u201d He whispered a cooling charm and the bubbling died down to a calm roil. He stepped in slowly as to not spill a drop. \u201cAh\u2026 cozy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon started to feel a tingle through his body as the potion did its stuff. He looked down and saw that his head was rising higher. \u201cYes, it\u2019s working!\u201d Ron let out a moan suddenly as she shifted slightly in the quickly shrinking cauldron. He felt something between his legs, and grabbed it. Thousands of pleasure signals surged up his spine as he rubbed his dream shaft. It was easily twice as long as before and just as thick. He cupped his gonads in his hands and felt the large spheres as they continued to inflate in the diminishing solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stood to the side and watched as his friend grew taller and more ripped than ever before. Harry could only assume that Ron was assimilating all of Harry\u2019s labored and sweat earned body into his own. At some point, Harry saw a mushroom shaped object grow over the height of the cauldron. Oh my Merlin. That potion gave him my dick too? But it\u2019s bigger than before. Was it added to his own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon had own hand stroking his engorged shaft and the other hand was left rubbing his expanding chest. He cupped the growing muscle as it expanded. He let out another moan. As the solution was completely assimilated into his body, he felt his massive testicles tense closer to his body as hot fire surged out of his third leg. A thick white rope surged into the air lassoing all over Ron\u2019s chest. He fired that one load for at least a good minute. When he had finished, he was crouched in a small cauldron. He felt his chest rise and fall as it pressed against his bulky thighs. His pole deflated downward. He felt it rub against his stone hard abs as it shrank down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, time to get out of this.\u201d He started to stand, but found that his body was wedged into the cauldron. He struggled and grunted for a bit, before stopping to say, \u201cFuck, I didn\u2019t think this through. I didn\u2019t think his magic and body would grow me this much.\u201d After a while longer, he grew increasingly frustrated. In a burst of accidental magic, the cauldron exploded to bits. \u201cAh\u2026 that\u2019s better.\u201d He started to rise, but stopped when he bumped his head on the 10ft ceiling. He had to stand on his knees, but even then his hair was brushing the ceiling. As he waddled over to a mirror, he felt his shaft and bells dangle and brush the floor ever so slightly every few moments. \u201cDamn, I\u2019ve got to the hottest fucking giant wizard in the world.\u201d He flexed a few poses, kissing his giant basketball biceps, and feeling his hardened abs. It was surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. It should have been anatomically impossible, but magic could do a lot of things. Now what? Harry felt his confusion slowly consuming his anger and will to live. What do I do now? He floated over next to Ron and stared at his ex-friend\u2019s body. It was sculpted and bronzed from the potion, and his flaccid penis looked like it could rip women in half. Harry had yet to see a real giant, but from what he\u2019d read, Ron was right in the ball park of descriptions. Damn, he could probably take on that troll back in year 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon used a spell and cleaned the cum off his body. Then he expanded his cloths to fit his new sculpted frame. Feeling a like showing off a little, he shrank his close a bit so they hug his every muscle closely. As he walked, he felt the threads tense and reveal his massive bulk. He could have jizzed again right there and then. Looking down, he felt basketball of a bulge between his legs grow tighter. He quickly distracted himself, and felt the pressure die down just a little. \u201cToo sexy for my own good.\u201d He smirked as he walked out of the shack and back towards the castle. He had to crouch as he went through the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped outside, he stood as tall as he could and saw how he was eye level with some small trees. He wondered how strong he was now, so he walked over to one of the tree and tied yanking it out of the ground. He heard the trunk groan and stretch under his grizzly like grip, but it did not tear out of the ground. However, he did leave a serious imprint in the bark and deformed it\u2019s shape with pure strength alone. He was satisfied with that for now. \u201cNote to self, work on guns a little more. Need to rip a tree out of the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry rolled his eyes as he followed along. For some reason, he was finding it hard to pay attention to Ron. His eyes were getting heavier, and he let out a yawn. No! Can\u2019t fall asleep yet. Need to follow Ron and fix this mess! He blinked the weariness from his eyes and followed behind the muscle behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry flew ahead and saw the familiar school. There were posters everywhere like before, but now there were pictures of Ron plastered on every wall. One image was easily 15ft tall and it was labeled, \u201cLife Size Image!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

CONTINUE AT YOUR DISGRESSION.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Beep Beep Beep*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand slammed down on the alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent was your typical high school student. Average in basically every possible way. In a never changing loop of his teen years. What does he think about his current life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent trudged to the bathroom and did\u2026 the usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out and went to put on his \u2026 usual attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt breakfast, he ate the\u2026 usual cereal and milk combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way out, he grabbed got his\u2026 usual \u201cBye son. Have a nice day!\u201d from his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood bye the bus\u2026 as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and sat next to his best friend, Tyson\u2026 like usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I think you get the point. Everything is\u2026 the usual -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent walked home that day pretty much tired\u2026 as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom, Sarah yelled from upstairs \u201cWelcome home son? Anything new happen today<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent felt his mind deflate \u201cNo mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah \u201cThat\u2019s nice honey. Go have-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent \u201cI know\u2026 a fruit or something in the kitchen\u2026\u201d He though, at least I know that we have \u2018different types of fruit\u2019. He walked in and saw a fruit basket full with oranges. He lost his appetite immediately, and walked up to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his laptop and started to work on his programming homework. His favorite class was Computer Sciences/Programming. They were working on individual projects, and he was having a hard time coming up with an idea. The lack of change has impacted his creativity greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent \u201cMaybe I can get an idea from the internet.\u201d He went to his computer and typed in \u201cProgramming Projects-\u201d He was doing this with Google instant on, so a few things had already popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a bunch, but one of them really stood out to him for some reason. \u201cReWritten: Its Your Life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent was curious \u201cWhat\u2019s ReWritten?\u201d He read the small description at the bottom. \u201cLooking for feed on latest reality manipulation program project. First 20 testers get to keep program indefinitely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent decided that it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try it out. He ran a scan on the website, and it was clear of viruses. He clicked on it and an installation window opened up. He clicked download, and then he installed it. Finally, he opened the program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to ReWritten. Please select segment of history to be ReWritten.\u201d Suddenly, a timeline of Kent\u2019s whole life appeared. Starting from when he was born to current time. The time line was still growing since time wasn\u2019t stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent \u201cWhat they. How\u2026 where. What?\u201d Kent was looking and reading. How on earth did this info get on the internet. How do they know this stuff. Kent started reading parts of his life that he had long forgotten about. Slowly, he began to creep up the timeline until recent times. Things started to get repetitive in high school. You thought you had read the same line twice, but it had actually popped up twice! \u201cNo ****** way! This has to be a scam\u2026 but\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe that his whole history was being displayed by the program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a voice played \u201cPlease select segment of history to be ReWritten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent\u2019s hand was shaking. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be insane to trust this thing, but ok then.\u201d Kent scrolled down to change something minor. \u201cLets see what would I change.\u201d Then he saw it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day of the spelling bee. \u201cI hated that day. I almost one. If only if I spelt Received E-I and not I-E. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to change.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent highlighted that part of the time line, and another pop-up came up. \u201cSegment selected. How will it be changed.\u201d Then a small text box appeared. Kent typed in \u201cKent spelled RECEIVED correctly.\u201d Then he pressed ReWrite. A pop-up appeared \u201cAre you sure you wish to change this?\u201d and below was a check box to never show it again. He checked the box and pressed \u201cYes\u201d. The program \u201cPlease wait we\u2019ll segment is ReWritten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent waited a moment, until a loading bar finished loading. \u201cFinished. You have won a spelling bee. Congratulations.\u201d Kent thought about the spelling bee, and still remembered losing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent \u201cWhat a dud. I feel like an idiot now!\u201d Kent was rather disappointed. \u201cMight as well delete this junk program.\u201d Kent reached for the mouse again, but saw something next to it. It was a small trophy \u201cFor Excellent Spelling: Kent Huffman\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent was shocked \u201cNo way\u2026\u201d He grabbed the small trophy to make sure it was real. \u201cI won?\u201d Then a new memory popped up in his mind \u201cI did win!\u201d, but he could still remember losing. He turned back to the computer screen, and he saw the program was waiting for another command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent was shaking with shock, amazement, and excitement most of all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Puberty hasn\u2018t been evil or kind. A zit appears every now and then. His body was about  average. His IQ was also average. \u201cLets see what we can do about all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Kent was\u2026<br>\r\nClass: Sophomore<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nHeight: 5ft 7in<br>\r\nWeight: 146lbs<br>\r\nDescription: His hair is blond, and his skin is slightly on the pale side since he spends a lot of his time making programs. Physically, he can pass gym, but is nothing amazing. He was always one of the middle kids to get picked to a game or anything. In class, he was barely noticed since he was so normal. Even in programming. He is pretty good at it, but he isn\u2019t a pro like some of the other kid. Also do to his average-ness in a certain external organ, he didn\u2019t get much notice from the girls that were higher up in the social hierarchy, or the lower parts. Sadly, he\u2019s simply to \u2018average\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to go back to the day he was born. He needed to go and change things at the heart of his life \u201cMark Huffman will live a fun and exciting life. He will be above average in every possible way, especial with his body. His skin will always be blemish free and he has the highest grades in school.\u201d His hands were tingling with excitement and anticipation. He click submit. A loading bar appeared \u201cThis may take a while\u2026 Time Gauge: 8hrs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent \u201c8hrs? That isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d He was looking up to the prospect of what he would wake up to tomorrow morning. He decided to sleep out the wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----The Next Morning----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Beep Beep Beep*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA decently muscled and tanned arm came down on the alarm turning it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent sighed \u201cTime for another boring and dull day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent got up and went to the bathroom like\u2026 usual. He stripped and went into the shower like usual. Then he started to rub his body with soap\u2026 like usual. He felt some bumps of muscles like\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent blasted the water on high washing all the soap off his tanned and pretty muscled body. He Jumped out of the bath tub and looked in the mirror. \u201cNo way! Its worked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at an above average 6ft 1in, he is one of the taller kids of his class, but there were kids who were taller. His muscles matched that of a decent swimmer, but nowhere near the giant bulk of a professional swimmer. Then he saw the biggest change. His previous 3in Kent Jr. has grown to a full blown 8in long, 2.5 in wide Kent Sr. with two tennis ball sized children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent gasped as he saw muscles he never had before an the endowment he now owned. He started to flex and strike various poses trying to gauge his strength. Suddenly, a flood of memories entered his mind. He was the smartest in his class of sophomores, he was one of the most popular, his parents were loaded so they send him on vacations when ever he has time, he is sought after by 75% of the female student body, and he volunteers as a modeler for a company that publicizes the need for teen health and fitness. However, he didn\u2019t even do a sport. It appears like his body was naturally muscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t all, even his childhood was changed. Kent fell to the ground shaking from the backlash of taking in to much new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then suddenly it hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in a giant marble clad bathroom. \u201cWhen did this all get here?\u201d Then he remembered that things began to morph after he fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent gave his body one last look over and went back to his room to pick out something new to wear. He went for a striped t-shirt with the picture of every muscle group on the body on it looking all innocent, and a pair of cargo shorts. (Apparently, its muscle awareness day at school). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a question hit Kent \u201cWhy am I still going to regular school? I thought I was loaded.\u201d Then he got a new memory. His parents didn\u2019t want his to become some snooty rich, so they sent him to a public school to learn to have fun the right way, and not to be all stuck up and bossy. \u201cI guess I can deal with that. Besides, public school are a lot more fun, I guess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left his room, and saw that nothing in it had changed from the old reality (because he had asked his parents for a normal room, and not some tricked out hotel floor). Well\u2026 except for his wardrobe. That closet grew exponentially. The rest of the house was totally tricked out. It was a large stone mansion with dozens of marble pillars and statues. The main entrance was enormous. The floors were covered in tiles and TV\u2019s lined the walls. It had hundreds of rooms and a grand stair case leading downstairs. The dining room could hold hundreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the dining room, he saw that there was one single plate with a glass of milk. \u201cCereal and milk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jeffry appeared \u201cNow sir! Cereal and milk indeed! I take that  as an insult. Why don\u2019t you go and take a look at what it is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent raised a questioning eyebrow. When he got to the bowl, he saw that it wasn\u2019t cereal, but some type of pancake fondue. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffry was starting to worry \u201cSir, are you alright? You have never questioned my cooking before, nor have you ever spent that much time in the lavatories. I do not wish to pry, but its is my job too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent felt more memories pop in his head. Ever since he was little, Jeffry was there watching over him. Jeffry made sure that he was always ready for what he needed to do, and he practically raised Kent. Taught him manners, etc. \u201cSorry Jeffry. I\u2019m just having a slow start today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffry nodded understandingly \u201cVery well. I do hope it gets better. Now sir, I would eat before the bus arrives. This is a large house, so it has a long walkway toward the bus stop. I would get a move on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent smiled. \u201cThanks Jeffry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffry bowed in reply \u201cYou are most welcome sir. If you need anything, I will be waiting outside the dining hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent nodded and began to scarf down his breakfast as breakneck speed. Good thing Jeffry wasn\u2019t there, or he\u2019d have had a fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne that was gone what did Kent do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tyson saw this and looked away avoiding eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent saw this and was surprised. What happened? What Tyson hurt? Then it hit him. The popularity difference between Kent and Tyson was astronomical. He had better fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent walked on over and sat straight next to Tyson. Tyson looked in shock as one of the most popular kids in school sat next to him. His was nervous and jittery. What evil purpose did Kent have I for sitting next to a lower geek?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent pulled out his phone and opened up the app. He went over to Tyson\u2019s timeline and began to fix a few things. \u201cTyson\u2019s family lives right next to mine, and they are almost as rich us my family.

Kent followed through. \u201cHey Kent. You look excited. What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent laughed \u201cI just woke up to a good morning.

I heard they opened up a new bowling ally down the street from our school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent thought about \u201cSure why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson \u201cAwesome.\u201d Then someone caught his eye \u201cHey lover boy. Guess who\u2019s behind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent was shocked by the sudden change in topic. Lover boy? What could that possibly mean? Kent turned around and found himself face planted into a pair of GG cup boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a dozen \u201cooohs\u201d from the other teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feminine voice \u201cAww\u2026 Kenty-poo. Having fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent was paralyzed. His face began to fill with blood, and he almost had a nosebleed. Was this who he though it was. The crush of his life\u2026 Amy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and out of the two mounds and it was true. No one else had a set like hers. \u201cA-a--a- Amy! Hey! Um\u2026. Ahh\u2026. This isn\u2019t\u2026 I meen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy put a finger on his mouth and giggled \u201cIts alright. I\u2019ll forgive this once. If you bye me lunch today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent was still unable to accept this reality. He had this girl! This girl! In this reality! He was loving it more and more! \u201cOf course. Anything for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pouted \u201cAnything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent felt a shiver run up his spine, and he was suddenly afraid. He quickly added \u201cWith in reason of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cOf course! When haven\u2019t I been reasonable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent smiled \u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled \u201cSo lunch right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent smiled \u201cRight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy continued past him and sat by some of her girl friends. They were doing their little chats and gossips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent turned around and came saw a Tyson ready to tackle him with excitement. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson \u201cIt\u2019s amazing someone like her existed with a rack like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent smiled \u201cI know, and I\u2019m in a relationship with her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson \u201cYour one lucky guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent smiled \u201cAnd she\u2019s wicked nice. Funny too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson nodded \u201cYup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent continued to name Amy\u2019s good qualities until he noticed a change in Tyson. Tyson seemed less happy now. As if he was jealous. Kent search his memories on the topic. Then it hit him. Tyson was single!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent pulled out his phone ready to correct the little mishap. \u201cTyson is in a deep relationship with Rina, Amy\u2019s best friend. They spend as much time together and Amy and I.\u201d Then he submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tyson wasn\u2019t so gloomy anymore. He seems kind of excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent \u201cNow you look excited and a little anxious. What\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson \u201cIts my half year-adversary with Rina. I got her something special, and I hope she likes it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent smiled \u201cTyson! You player!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson chuckled nervously \u201cOk\u2026 ok. I get it. I know that you know a pretty sappy guy at relationships. Stop pushing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent raised his hand is a sign of peace and resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He already knew everything the teachers were teaching him. What he was waiting for was lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, he was anxious to get to know he g-g-girlfriend better. Though its clear in his memories that they knew each other since preschool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors open, and his goddess arrives to sit next to him at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cHey Kent honey. Ready to get me lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent nodded slowly as his mind was lost staring at something. His pants were being stretched as the bulge in his pants grew into a monstrous anaconda. \u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned \u201cKent. Wake up. We have to get in line!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent snapped out of his trance \u201cRight\u2026 line. Want to join me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed \u201cI\u2019d follow you any where as long as you keep you promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey get in line, which was moving mind numbingly slow.  While they waited, Kent got lost again and his cargo shorts began to bulge slightly. Luckily, the material was baggy and strong enough to hide the might of his hot rod. As they walked slowly, the sides of his shorts rubbed against his above average sensitivity shaft. He felt his body temperature rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy could feel the above average heat radiating off of Kent. \u201cAre you ok? You\u2019ve been acting a little off today.\u201d He usually has more control than this. Is he having a hormonal imbalance? (Amy has been with Kent for so long that their relationship is similar to a friendship. They understand each other relatively well.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent was slowly getting the words out. He tried to ignore the increasing sensitivity and horniness that he was trying hard to suppress \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 fine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud piercing voice \u201cNEXT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent snapped out of his trance \u201chuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch lady \u201cI said NEXT! What do you want? I don\u2019t have all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent looked at Amy \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy \u201cI\u2019ll have the garden salad. Hold the dressing please.\u201d The lunch lady handed her a plastic container. Then she turned to Kent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent shook his head \u201cNo. I\u2019m good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lunch lady glared at him \u201cNEXT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved on, and Amy said \u201cThat was a little rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent nodded \u201cYah\u201d, but he was secretly glad. He didn\u2019t know how much longer he would have held out. He wanted to let loose so badly. Maybe being above average in everything wasn\u2019t such a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Goodbye\u2026 see you soon\u2026 etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that, he went to gym class. \u201cI wonder what we\u2019re doing today?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the locker room and saw that he was place in the gym class for the most popular student. At his high school, you got to pick which classes to go into, so there ended up to be a class full of the weak and meek kids, and a class full of the strongest and most proud kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kent entered, he was hit bye the sent of the precious\u2019s class\u2019s male sweat and musk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard someone yell \u201cThey need better ventilation. This room reeks.\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome one else yelled \u201cThey would, but the concentrated sweat of a whole school of boys could potentially destroy all life as we know it.\u201d This got that kid a few slaps on the back and a few chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent smiled. This was his type of group. He walked on over and tried to relate. They seems relatively open to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a 6ft5in, bulging behemoth opened the door so fast that it created a small vacuum in space to be filled with air. He walked/ shook the school as he walked over. Senior, Mark James Tootsie, was the schools ultimate jock. He was far to aggressive and far to dominate for anyone to saw anything about it. His shelf like pecs made it impossible for anyone to see his face when he was in front of them. If you stood next to his arm, you felt like they would crush you for being so near. All this muscles must make you think his testosterone factories must be pretty larger. Right? Wrong! With pea sizes testes and a 2in Mark Jr., he\u2019s far to embarrassed to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stormed pass your group and gave you a hard cold glare. He hated you because of the abnormal bulge you normally display. He hated his name, and wanted a more appealing one like yours. However, he was glad that his body was better. He had to take medical steroids to keep up, and he does sneak another one in every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he passed, the group let out a sigh. Kent, \u201cWhat\u2019s his problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group still felt the tension from moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson \u201cYou don\u2019t remember what \u201cThe Violator\u201d did to the last kid that messed with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent paused and thought about it. The image of two broken legs came to mind. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he get suspended again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson \u201cBecause they couldn\u2019t prove it! He used gloves and every thing to keep his DNA and finger prints off the body. He even poked a hole in his vocal cords so he couldn\u2019t talk! He violated basic human murals. That\u2018s what he did!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent\u2019s face paled. He went to school with a psychopath! He had change something, or else he\u2019ll get hurt. \u201cOk\u2026 thanks for reminding me.\u201d. He turned away from the group and hid behind a stall, and pulled out his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he had above average strength that was relative to his decent muscle mass, but he was going to need more. \u201cKent Huffman will grow to be one of the strongest kids in school.\u201d Then it hit him that even though he was big, he couldn\u2019t keep and eye on Mark all the time, and Mark could hurt someone else. Kent went to the source of the kids problems and tried to fix them. The one that everyone knew about was his name. \u201cMark James Tootsies was named Mark Jetson instead.\u201d Maybe this would make the mean\u2026 well\u2026 less mean. He pressed submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loading bar appeared and then vanished, and he waited for his changes. Nothing changed. \u201cWhat they?\u201d He looked in the mirror to see if anything new happened, but he stilled looked the same. He looked for changes on the phone and it said the change has been made. \u201cMaybe I need to wait?\u201d He gave waiting a shot and put his phone away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent changed into his set of gym attire and went out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Miller was running the show to do. As the request of the principal, he would have to run a fitness test. \u201cOk. Everyone! Line up! We\u2019re completing a required fitness examination today.\u201d the previous class groaned since they were the less developed class. This class seems more enthusiastic about seeing their rank in the school\u2019s physical hierarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKent felt a bit anxious. What if he was to weak? He didn\u2019t see any of the changes. He looked down at his arm and noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
