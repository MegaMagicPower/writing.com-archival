            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A black screen is shown with a quote which reads: \"I am tired and sick of war.  Its glory is all moonshine...war is hell.<br>\r\n--WILLIAM T. SHERMAN<br>\r\nEARTH BEFORE THE WAR<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting: Earth 2010 A.D. appears at the bottom of a black screen. An image of the Great Pyramids and nuclear missiles rising out of the ground before them appears on the screen.  Nuclear missiles are seen rising out of the ground before the Washington Monument, the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Libery, and Big Ben.  Then , the screen switches to a large platform where thousands of people are running and screaming.  Shuttles are taking off everywhere.  Camera pans up to a cloudless blue sky and frames a nuclear missile that is heading straight for the platform.  The screen goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALIEN HALLWAY<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarth 3010 A.D. is shown at the bottom of a black screen.  A dark hallway, lit only by an eerie green glow is all that is seen.  Then, JACKSON being dragged by two closely robed figures appears from around a corner.  JACKSON has a bald head and a beard.  The trio comes to what looks like a wall, but one of the robed figures reaches out a three-clawed hand.  It inserts its claws into three holes positioned in a triangle and the wall slides open.  The cloaked figures drag JACKSON into the room and set him before an alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALIEN SCIENCE CHAMBER<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA<br>\r\nHello, human.  I am going to ask you a question and I want an answer (threateningly) immediately.  What are you doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJACKSON spits in CHAMIDA'S face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA<br>\r\nPerhaps you can be persuaded to answer my question. (Reaches up and puuls down an instrument shaped like an upside down dowl with two needles sticking out side by side.  She then places the two needles in front of JACKSON'S eyes and camera switches to JACKSON'S perspective.  There is a bright flash of violet light and everything becomes dark, wavering shadows as JACKSON screams. The camera switches back to third person perspective.) Now, has that persuaded you to talk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJACKSON is silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA<br>\r\n(motioning to robed figures) Destroy him. (One of the robed figures pulls down another bowl-shaped instrument with a needle protruding from the base.  He places the needle directly above JACKSON'S head and there's another flash of violet light.  A trickle of blood runs down JACKSON'S head and the front of his face.  He then shimmers and falls to the floor like water. His voice is heard in the background:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJACKSON<br>\r\nHelp me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN'S BEDROOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\n(sitting up in bed) What a strange dream.  (Gets out of bed and walks to a window, draws curtains aside and sunlight streams into the room.  Camera pans around room: the posters are faded and yellowing at the edges.  Outside, there is a blue and yellow sun in a purple sky.  Enter ANSON REED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nHey Rai. What's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\n (a little confused)<br>\r\nI don't know.  I had this weird dream.  Something about aliens and some bald guy.  I was (pauses) just weird.  (turns back towards window)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nMaybe Mentez could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\n(enthusiastically)<br>\r\nMentez is sure to know what my dream meant.  After all, he's been around longer than anyone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN walks into one one of the doorways and it slides shut behind her.  Seconds later, she comes out fully dressed.  RAILIN and ANSON exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW HOPE HALLWAY<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nSo, tell me about your dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\n(struggling)<br>\r\nWell, it's kind of hard to explain.  There was this guy and he was being asked questions by this really weird looking thing. And then (she pauses and tears come to her eyes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN doesn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nRai? Rai!<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\n(snapping out of her trance)<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nThen what happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nThey killed him, but that's not the strange part. When they killed him, he fell to the floor like water and even though he was dead I thought I heard him ask for help.  But what's even more strange is that I felt like I knew him.  Like, like (struggling) like he was my brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\n(matter of factly)<br>\r\nWell of course you did.  I mean, you're the one who dreamt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nNo, that's not it.  It's different...somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nWell, you can ask Mentez, because we're here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN and ANSON enter MENTEZ'S room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ'S CHAMBERS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN and ANSON enter into the room.  MENTEZ is sitting on a rug in the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nMentez?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nYes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nMy sister had a dream and she\u2019d like to know what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\n(looks towards RAILIN)<br>\r\nCome here, child, and look into my eyes.  RAILIN walks towards MENTEZ and looks into his eyes.  Her dream is replayed in them.  Ah, I see.  You seek guidance little one and I am here to give that to you.  It all begins with a story of long ago.  You may want to have a seat as this story will take a while.  ANSON and RAILN sit on the rug across from MENTEZ.  It all started many years ago.  Cut to younger MENTEZ sitting at a computer.  I had found a file in the \u201cArchives of Earth.\u201d  It said that we had fled Earth in 2010 A.D. during a world-wide nuclear war.  Within that file I found a story about a young man who was the only one to survive from his allotted escape ship.  His name was Maritime Reed, one of your ancestors.  You see, the ship he had been on was severely damaged as it crossed the asteroid belt and he had to stop by our humble outpost before continuing on to his scheduled planet.  He was, however, a drifter by heart and I often thought he didn\u2019t plan on going to that planet.  But while he was here he met a beautiful woman named Atonia and he was instantly in love.  Time went on and Maritime and Atonia were married.  They had children and their children had children.  This continued for many years and when your father, Talonis, was born and married your mother, they had three children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nGasps<br>\r\nBut there have only ever been two of us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nAh, but the third child was the man in your dream.  He was your older brother, Jackson.  Eighteen years ago, right before you were born Anson, he left on a mission to Earth.  Our elders had wanted to send an expedition to see if we could return to our rightful home.  Your brother was chosen to head the expedition.  It seems, Railin, that you and Jackson had a special connection, one that allows the other to see their final dying thoughts.  When the elders sent those explorers they never counted on alien infestation being a variable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nI don\u2019t believe it!  We have an older brother, who our parents never told us about and now you\u2019re saying he\u2019s dead, sent to some stupid planet on an idiotic mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nIrritated<br>\r\nCalm yourself, Anson.  Nothing you believe in can ever be stupid.  Your brother believed in the mission he was sent on.  So much, in fact, that he was willing to sacrifice his own life.  Sadly, it seems we must go to war with these alien vermin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nBut why?  They never did anything to us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nPutting a hand on RAILIN\u2019S shoulder<br>\r\nWar, like so many things, is human nature.  Especially when claiming what is yours from scum that has taken it from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nI still don\u2019t believe it.  How could we have an older brother and our parents never tell us about him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nENTER CAPTAIN TALONIS REED<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTALONIS<br>\r\nBecause we thought he had died years ago.  As he was landing on earth we heard shots firing and people screaming.  His communicator went out and we thought he had died.  We waited for many years to hear from him, but you can only wait so long.  When you were born, Anson, we had given up hope.  Your mother and I decided that it would be best not to tell you.  We didn\u2019t want you to have to endure the pain that comes from wondering, every day, if your loved one is alive or dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nAngrily<br>\r\nBut could you?  I mean\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTALONIS<br>\r\nI was protecting you and Railin!  Begins to shout:  Do you know how much pain and suffering there is in life?  I couln\u2019t expose my children to more than they\u2019d already have to bear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nClose to tears<br>\r\nHow could you deny your son the right to know he had a brother?<br>\r\nExits quickly from room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nWalks over to stand beside her father<br>\r\nDon\u2019t worry, Dad.  Anson just needs some time to cool off.  He\u2019ll be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTALONIS looks down at RALIN through tears.  RALIN smiles up at him and then exits.  TALONIS sits down at the table and weeps into his hands.  MENTEZ hovers in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIN\u2019S ROOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIN is sitting on her bed reading a book when an alarm begins going off.  Running footsteps are heard outside her door and ANSON bursts in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nRailin!  It\u2019s starting!  Hurry, we don\u2019t have much time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIN<br>\r\nTrying to yell over the sirens,<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nDon\u2019t ask questions.  Just follow me.  Hurry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPACE SHUTTLE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILN and ANSON run into a large room where ships are taking off and they board one.  ANSON sits down at the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s all this about, Anson?  Where are we going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nEarth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nEarth?!  Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nTo find out brother.  I know he\u2019s still alive.  I just know it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nAnson, he\u2019s dead.  I saw it in my dream.  Mentez said so.  Father agreed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nWhat father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIN<br>\r\nAnson, he was just protecting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON doesn\u2019t answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIN<br>\r\nAnson?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no answer from ANSON<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nPauses, stares gloomily out the window<br>\r\nHow\u2019d you get this craft, anyway?<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nI joined The Officials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nYou what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON doesn\u2019t answer.  He\u2019s concentrating on flipping switches and pulling levers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIN<br>\r\nAnson?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nYeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIN<br>\r\nWhy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nTo show father that I\u2019m just as good as Jackson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN begins crying softly and moments later a voice crackles over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nPrivate Reed.  Come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nLifts what looks like a watch to his mouth<br>\r\nReed here.  What can I do for you Lieutenant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIN stifles a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nWhat was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nNervously<br>\r\nUm\u2026that was my sister ma\u2019am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nAngrily<br>\r\nPrivate Reed!  I told you this was a dangerous top secret mission.  No civilians permitted aboard any ship.  Why did you go against my orders?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nI had to Lieutenant.  I couldn\u2019t leave behind my family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nWhat about you father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON is silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nReed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nColdly<br>\r\nI have no father\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMAKESHIFT HQ, LT. TOYA\u2019S TENT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nHow could you have done something so stupid\u2026so irresponsible\u2026so arrogant?  You knew that no civilians were not to be brought along on this mission.  You have jeopardized this entire expedition.  Why did you go against the orders of your superior?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nSnapping to attention<br>\r\nSome rules need to be broken if you want to take care of your family, ma\u2019am!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nThat is no excuse for disobeying direct orders.  Drop and give me fifty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON begins his push-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nI can\u2019t hear them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\n1, 2, 3\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnter GENERAL ELIOT MATTHEWS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nAttention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON stands and salutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGEN. MATTHEWS<br>\r\nAt ease, Private.  I happened to hear what you did, bringing a civilian on this mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nHesitantly<br>\r\nYes sir, I did.  And I deeply apologize for going against the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGEN. MATTHEWS<br>\r\nNo, no.  Don\u2019t apologize.  It was a job well done.  You se, I also heard that the civilian was your sister.  Family comes first, you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nYes sir.  Thank you, sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGEN. MATTHEWS<br>\r\nThat kind of loyalty deserves a promotion which is why I am promoting you to Corporal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nTh-Thank you, sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGEN. MATTHEWS<br>\r\nDon\u2019t mention it, my boy.  Welcome to The Officials.  I\u2019ll let you and the LT. get back to your exercises.  It\u2019s always commendable seeing someone keeping in shape when they don\u2019t have to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExit GEN. MATTHEWS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nWell, what are we going to about your civilian sister, sneers, Corporal Reed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nI\u2019m not quite sure ma\u2019am.  The orders were for no civilians to be brought on this mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nWell, we\u2019ll just have to change that, won\u2019t we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nBut how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nI think I have an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nWhat is it?  You must tell me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nNo, long pause, not really.<br>\r\nDismissed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON/RAILIN\u2019S TENT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nWalks over to a chair, sits and begins to weep.<br>\r\nWhat am I going to do?  I can\u2019t do this anymore.  Slips out of chair and falls to knees with hands clasped together.  Lord, please help me.  I can\u2019t carry this burden by myself.  Please send someone to help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnter RAILIN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nRushes over to ANSON.<br>\r\nAnson, what\u2019s wrong?  Are you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nQuickly stands and composes self.<br>\r\nOh, I\u2019m fine.  Just going through some, uh, discipline exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nSkeptically<br>\r\nOkay.  Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nWhat are you doing here anyway?  I thought you were out taking a tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nOh.  Lt. Toya told me you wanted to see me.  Something about protocol?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nhalf to himself<br>\r\nI can\u2019t believe that woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nSomething wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nOh no.  Nothing\u2019s wrong.  It\u2019s just that, uh, I have some news that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to appreciate hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nWell, from the expression on your face, I don\u2019t think you like it very much either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nGestures to the only chair in the tent<br>\r\nYou may want to sit down for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN sits<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nGrimacing<br>\r\nThis is hard news to bear.  Especially to a family member who I feel solely reliable for, but long pause, mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nWhat?  I couldn\u2019t hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nYou\u2019re going to have to join The Officials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nWhat?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nYou\u2019re going to\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nI know!  I heard you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nRai.  I can\u2019t help feeling responsible for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nThat\u2019s because you are responsible for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nRailin, I\u2019m sorry.  It\u2019s just that civilians weren\u2019t supposed to be on this mission.  And, well, since you\u2019re a civilian that problem needs to be solved.  I\u2019m sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nDon\u2019t talk to me.  I don\u2019t want you to talk to me, ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExit RAILIN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON falls to his knees crying.  Then prostrates himself, buries his face in his hands and cries even harder.<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nI\u2019m sorry, Rai.  Please forgive me.  I\u2019m so sorry\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamera fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA THRONE ROOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA<br>\r\nTwo robed standing on either side of her.<br>\r\nYou pathetic human.  You think you can beat us.  You have no idea how powerful I am.  I can have your limbs torn off with a single wave of my hand.  But that would be much too nice of a treatment for you worthless kind.  Snaps fingers and one of the robed figures produces a jar full of inky, black liquid.  The jar is handed to CAPTAIN TALONIS. Please with contempt Captain, look into the jar you are holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCAPTAIN TALONIS looks into the jar and two eyeballs float to the top.  The pupils dilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJACKSON<br>\r\nPlease\u2026help me\u2026father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCAPTAIN TALONIS<br>\r\nHysterically<br>\r\nJackson!  My son!  Come back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJACKSON is silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCAPTAIN TALONIS<br>\r\nSadly<br>\r\nPlease, come back.  Your mother I, we\u2014I need you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA<br>\r\nEnough!  Snaps fingers and the jar is taken away from TALONIS. So, do we have a deal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTALONIS<br>\r\nShamefully<br>\r\nIf you return my son then yes, I will do whatever you wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA<br>\r\nGood.  Good.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.  CHAMIDA turns to a robed figure and in hushed voice, A soon as tells us what we want to know, have him killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobed figure bows in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIN &amp; ANSON\u2019S TENT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN awakes in her cot, beside ANSON.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nWaking up<br>\r\nRai?  What\u2019s wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nIt\u2019s--Oh, I can\u2019t\u2014I mean\u2026<br>\r\nBegins to cry harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nGets out of bed and walks over to RAILIN, sits down on her bed and holds her as she cries.<br>\r\nShhh. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here.  Calm down.  It\u2019s okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN begins to calm down, but still breathing and sniffing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nNow, tell me what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nIt was our fther.  He was in some sort of throne room with an alien.  And he was on his knees and Jackson\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nJackson!  What about Jackson?  Was he alive?  Is he alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know.  It was all so horrible.  And is still so vague.  But the one thing I do remember is that father said he was going to help the aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nFather said that!  I knew he was a traitor.  Lt. Toya must hear about this.<br>\r\nBegins to dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nBut Anson-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nNot now, Rai.  I\u2019ve got to get to Lt. Toya.<br>\r\nExits quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAILIN<br>\r\nHalf to self.<br>\r\nBut Anson, it was just a dream.  Begins to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarms sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nRunning back into the tent.<br>\r\nRailin, get dressed!  The aliens have found us!  They\u2019re attacking!  We\u2019ve got to go NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRALIIN dresses and exits quickly with ANSON.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLACK SCREEN:  Quote:  \u201cHe who is the author of a war lets loose the whole contagion of hell and opens a vein that bleeds a nation to death.\u201d ~Thomas Paine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW HOPE CONFERENCE ROOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nThe aliens must be stopped.  As we hold this counsel our base on earth is being attacked by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nELDER #1<br>\r\nThat\u2019s because we\u2019ve invaded thir home.  They are scared and as savages tend to do they are fighting what they do not understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nELDER #5<br>\r\nThey are not savages!  They are intelligent beings from another planet as all of my studies have shown us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCELIA<br>\r\nOh, pooh on your research.  I agree with Mentez. We should fight the aliens.  That is our ancestor\u2019s land and we have a right to take it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nThank you, Celia.  I\u2019m glad that someone is on my side.  But I didn\u2019t call this meeting so we could sit here and bicker.  I called it because the people who sit at this table have the power to release the Lusus Naturae.  Several gasp I know, I know, but with it\u2019s help we have a chance to win this war.  We\u2019ve already had World War Three and now after thousands of years of somewhat peace we may have the first War of the Universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY<br>\r\nBut if we release Lusus, then we may vary well call Armageddon down upon ourselves.  For you all know Lusus was created in the form of a dragon.  The Lucites worshipped dragons and thus created him in that form.  Also, our ancestors speak of a dragon, in the Holy Texts, that takes control of the world in the ending days and almost destroys it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER COPEN<br>\r\nSo you are saying that this Lusus may be the Anti-Christ?  How ridiculous!  He is under our control.  How can something we control rule over us?  The entire idea is preposterous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY<br>\r\nYou new priests and your absurd ideas.  Just because we control something now doesn\u2019t mean we will control it always.  Lusus is as unpredictable as a human.  He was created to help stop the third world war, but he was created to kill.  That is why he was imprisoned on the moon as our ancestors left earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER COPEN<br>\r\nIf we imprisoned him once, then we can do it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nPlease, please, calm yourself my friends.  That is why I have called all of you here today; to discuss this matter.  If we release the Lusus Naturae then we can easily defeat the Aliens and save ourselves, but we may begin Armageddon.  Becoming angry I want to end this matter and I want to end it now!  We decide now.  Release the Lusus Naturae or fight the aliens by ourselves.  Who says to release the monstrosity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive raise their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nAnd who says to keep it imprisoned?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive raise their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nWell it seems that I hold the world in my hands.  I must cast the deciding vote though it bears a heavy weight on me to do so.  I say we release him tomorrow.  This counsel is now adjourned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera zooms in on FATHER COPEN, a large smile spreads across his face and fire flares in his eyes.  [Fade.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMOON OF LUSUS NATURAE<br>\r\nA gigantic blue dragon muzzled and chained in the center of the crater stares down at FATHER COPEN, FATHER MONTGOMERY, and MENTEZ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nWhy do you insist on keeping me chained here like an animal?  Did I not free your ancestors from a great and terrible threat?  My work is done now.  I am harmless\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nYes, you did free our ancestors, but if you are so harmless then why did they imprison you here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nBecause they were all fools.  They did not have the knowledge you have.  Human brains now must be far larger than they were then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER COPEN<br>\r\nHe does have a point Mentez.  If we release him we can control him much more easily than our ancestors did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nBarely audible.<br>\r\nYesss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nI\u2019m not sure if that is completely correct, but we do need his help.  Very well, take your positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY moves to the left side of LUSUS and FATHER COPEN moves to the right where they both begin sifting through the dirt where the chains are connected to the earth as MENTEZ does the same in front LUSUS.  They each take keys that hang around their knees and place them in locks that are found in the ground.  As they turn the keys the chains fall along with muzzle and disintegrate before hitting the ground.  LUSUS lets out a mighty roar and FATHER MONTGOMERY cringes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nBends towards FATHER MONTGOMERY<br>\r\nSo you are afraid of me?  That will not do.  If you are afraid of me then everyone else will be as well.  Perhaps\u2026to self\u2026yes that\u2019s it.  <br>\r\nLUSUS begins to what looks like fold and when he is finished \u201cfolding\u201d he is a man with that are milky white.  This will not scare many people, correct?  LUSUS looks at MENTEZ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nEyes wide with awe.<br>\r\nI believe the new form you have taken will do just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER COPEN<br>\r\nPerhaps with your new form, you would like to choose a new name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS looks oddly at FATHER COPEN<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER COPEN<br>\r\nSpeaking quickly<br>\r\nStrictly so you will not cause suspicion among others and be bombarded with questions or turned away from.  The name Lusus is widely recognized and known on the new planet.  Especially among our youth, who seem to have a fondness for stories of the Old World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nYes, I belive a new name would be quite useful.  I also feel ready for a change.  What do you think of, long pause, Noangelo\u2014Noa for short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER COPEN<br>\r\nAh, what a wonderful name.  I will personally see to it that your identifications are made in that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nLooking toward the horizon where New Hope can be seen<br>\r\nIt is getting late.  Perhaps we should be returning to New Hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY<br>\r\nQuite right, Mentez.  It is beginning to become a bit chilly.  FATHER MONTGOMERY throws a cautionary glances at LUSUS and speaks half to himself And I wouldn\u2019t want to be on this planet with that thing after sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nPulls dark glasses from a pocket inside his jacket and puts them on.<br>\r\nIf you\u2019ll follow me then I think I can show you something which you\u2019ll find quite useful. Begins walking towards the side of the crater, but stops halfway and bends down, brushing dirt aside.  A metal trap door with three key holes in a triangular pattern is seen. I do believe we\u2019ll need the use of those keys again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe keys are put in the holes and the trap door is opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nThis is something that the people of the Old World left in my care.  I was to show it to the ones who released me.  Please follow me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS climbs down into the darkness followed by MENTEZ, FATHER COPEN and then FATHER MONTGOMERY. Camera follows them into the darkness. [END SCENE]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUMAN BASE.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDifferent styles of ships are flying through the sky shooting at each other.  Camera enters Lt. Toya\u2019s tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nOut of breath<br>\r\nLt. Toya!  I have some wonderful news!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nButtoning shirt<br>\r\nWhat can be wonderful about being attacked by aliens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not about the aliens, it\u2019s about Captain Reed.  I know something that could help you gain his position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nskeptically<br>\r\nReally?  And what might that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nNot now.  First you have to agree that Railin can stay a civilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nDone!  Now what is this wonderful news?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nCaptain Talonis Reed is planning on helping the alien race overthrow our defenses.  If we act quickly this can work to our advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nHow did you come by this information.  No, don\u2019t tell me.  It could be a court-martial able  offense.  Long pause I assume you have a plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nYes ma\u2019am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA<br>\r\nOkay. I\u2019m putting you in charge of Platoons three and five.  Brief them on your plan and report back to me in two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nYes ma\u2019am!  Salutes and leaves the tent in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLT. TOYA <br>\r\nTo self<br>\r\nFinally!  If I can get rid of Captain Reed all that stands in my way will be that old fool Mentez.  Soon everyone will bow to Queen Ramona Toya. Laughs evilly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamera pans to shadowy corner, enters and comes out in CHAMIDA\u2019S  throne room where CHAMIDA  and her two guards were watching the scene on a monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA<br>\r\nExcellent!  Everything is going just as I have planned.  Isn\u2019t that wonderful Captain Reed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTALONIS<br>\r\nTurns to face CHAMIDA and device is attached to back of neck<br>\r\nNo, it\u2019s not.  You\u2019re horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA presses a button on her throne and lights blink of TALONIS\u2019S device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTALONIS<br>\r\nForgive me, my queen. Bows You\u2019re idea is brilliant beyond all comprehension and it will be a wonderful ruse once everything has played out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHAMIDA<br>\r\nI hope you are right.  For your sake and for all of our species sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Camera fades into next scene.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHALL OF HUMANS (HALLWAY ON MOON)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nReaches out a hand and touching a panel<br>\r\nWelcome to the Hall of Humans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green lights flash brightly and what appear to be fetuses can be seen floating inside large containers.  Their eyes are wide open and blinking.  Once reaches out a hand to FATHER MONTGOMERY.  FATHER MONTGOMERY reaches out his hand and LUSUS steps in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nCareful, Father.  These are no ordinary humans.  I wouldn\u2019t get near any of these people if I were you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS steps away from the container and the person in the container is looking directly at FATHER MONTOGOMERY, but we see the creature\u2019s back.  It\u2019s head begins to revolve slowly to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY<br>\r\nHow does this place exist?  Why does it exist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nThis, my friend, is where your ancestors tried to solve the mysteries of life.  They never did succeed though and they did make a few mistakes along the way.  These, Father, are just a few of the less harmful ones.  The more terrible creatures are many decks below us. <br>\r\nLUSUS smiles crookedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER COPEN<br>\r\nLusus?  What do you mean the more terrible ones?  And how have these creatures survived all of these years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nBored<br>\r\nThe scientists that created these creatures may have been twisted, but they were not cruel.  Each of these creatures has a new way of survival.  That creature you encountered earlier, Father Montgomery, feeds off of energy\u2026any energy.  Even human energy.  If you had touched that glass you\u2019d be lying on their right now. Slow smile. Most likely dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group walks into a large circular room with a shaft of dark red light in the center.  In the light is what looks like an egg.  To the right is a large piece of velvet black cloth draped over a rectangular object.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nWalking over to the cloth covered object<br>\r\nThis, gentlemen, is your way home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS pulls cloth off of object to reveal two prongs sticking in the air with a shimmering static in between the two.  LUSUS presses a few buttons on a control panel and the New Hope conference room appears between the two prongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nThis technology is amazing!  I never knew it existed.  Why don\u2019t we still have these capabilities?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nWell, let\u2019s just say there were\u2026complications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY<br>\r\nSlightly scared<br>\r\nIs this technology safe for us to use?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nA bit distracted and fiddling with the control panel<br>\r\nYes, yes of course.  But we must hurry.  There\u2019s not much power left in this old equipment.  Pauses Please, my friends, just step into the image and you should be instantly transported back to your world.  You may feel a bit disoriented when you arrive, but that\u2019s normal.  Mentez, if you\u2019d be kind enough to step forward, I\u2019ll monitor the equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nHesitantly steps towards the portal.<br>\r\nAnd you\u2019re sure this is not dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nAbsolutely, the most you\u2019ll feel is a little\u2026tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMENTEZ<br>\r\nTurns towards FATHER MONTGOMERY<br>\r\nI\u2019ll see you soon.  Turns back to portal and half to self: This should be interesting.<br>\r\nMENTEZ steps through the portal, into the Conference Room, turns around and waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nFather Montgomery, it\u2019s your turn now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY<br>\r\nVisibly nervous<br>\r\nI suppose if Mentez is waving, then he was not hurt in any way.  He looks well enough.<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY steps toward the portal and it begins to flicker, he hesitates and looks towards to LUSUS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nBecoming irritated<br>\r\nPlease Father, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.  It was just a power surge.  This machine is almost out of energy.  All you need to do is step into the image and you\u2019ll be home.  FATHER MONTGOMERY turns toward the portal, closes his eyes and under breath:<br>\r\nHere I go.  He steps into the image and embraces MENTEZ after a brief pause.  They both turn to motion FATHER COPEN to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nPulls FATHER COPEN to the side, where MENTEZ and FATHER MONTGOMERY cannot see.  LUSUS holds FATHER COPEN\u2019S head between his hands.<br>\r\nMy child, you have done well.  My release is exactly what the universe needs and you will be greatly rewarded.  LUSUS kisses FATHER COPEN on the forehead who winces as flames flare in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER COPEN<br>\r\n Thank you Master.  I will not let you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nFor your sake, I hope you don\u2019t.  Now go, join the others.  You know what is expected of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs FATHER COPEN steps towards the portal and the image of the conference room begins to flicker faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nHurry, there\u2019s not much time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER COPEN<br>\r\nThank you Master.  Steps through the portal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nTo no one in particular<br>\r\nI would not be thanking someone who will be the downfall of your race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of the conference room begins to flicker even faster, then disappears.  The screen goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSONS TENT<br>\r\nA large group of men is gathered, some sitting, some standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nYou have your orders.  Until I signal you, you are all to go about your business as normal.  Is that clear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMen salute in unison: Yes, sir!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nOkay.  You are all dismissed, except for Privates Jones, Johnson and Harden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll others exit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nYou three are to forget everything we just went over.  You are going to come with me and we are going to save Captain Reed and hopefully get rid of LT. Toya in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe privates exchange glances and smiles begin to creep across their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRIVATE JOHNSON<br>\r\nPermission to speak freely, sir?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nGranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRIVATE JOHNSON<br>\r\nIt\u2019s about time someone had the balls to take out that woman.  Sir, we salute you all salute and will do all we can to help you with this mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nI was hoping you\u2019d say that.  I picked each of you because you all have specific talents that will help with this mission, but also because you three have been singled out by the L.T. as troublemakers, just as I have.  If she has her way we\u2019ll be the first ones gone and I don\u2019t mean court marshaled, honorable or otherwise.  Johnson, I picked you because you\u2019re an expert in stealth and demolitions.  [flashback with voiceover] You showed all of us that when the officer\u2019s latrines exploded last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRIVATE JOHNSON<br>\r\nMouth gaping open<br>\r\nNo one knew that was me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nWell, no one, but you and me.<br>\r\nTurns to PRIVATE JONES<br>\r\nJones, you\u2019re here because you have a way of getting what you want.  You have connections throughout the unit and those connections are going to be very useful to us.  B<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRIVATE JONES<br>\r\nLights up a cigarette<br>\r\nI do what I can. Smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nAnd Harden\u2026you\u2019re probably the best pilot this army has ever seen.  But they think you take too many risks.  Myself, I like risks.  You\u2019ll be the one getting us in and out of the alien\u2019s lair.  Pauses Now that you all know why you\u2019re here I can tell you the real plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Camera zooms back as sound fades.  Camera zooms out of the tent and RAILIN is standing by the flap peering inside just out of view of the men.  A smile slowly creeps across her face. FADE]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLANET NEW HOPE<br>\r\nNew Hope is seen on the screen, numbers are quickly ticking down from 24:00.  When they reach \u201c0\u201d New Hope explodes.  A dragon flies toward the screen and the camera enters the dragon\u2019s mouth.  Screen goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY\u2019S ROOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is dark, a digital clock reads 4:23 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY<br>\r\nWaking up quickly and sitting up in bed.<br>\r\nThank God.  It was only a dream.  But\u2026what does it mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nWalking out of the shadows<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt means lifts a hand towards FATHER MONTGOMERY and squeezes it into a fist, FATHER MONTGOMERY gasps, grabbing his chest that your races time coming to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFATHER MONTGOMERY winces in pain and slumps over.  CREATURE emerges from the shadows that LUSUS came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nTake care of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCREATURE raises its hands (tiny mouths are seen in its palms) and places its hands on FATHER MONTGOMERY. CREATURE\u2019S head begins turning as FATHER MONTGOMERY\u2019S body begins to shrink and finally disappears.  As CREATURE\u2019S head makes its last turn its face has taken on FATHER MONTGOMERY\u2019S appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nVery good.  You are to remain here and act as the late Father would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCREATURE<br>\r\nGuttural<br>\r\nYes clears throat and in voice of FATHER MONTGOMERY Yes master.  I will do whatever you ask of me.  After all, you did free me from that scowls prison.  And I would do anything for revenge on the scum that imprisoned me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUSUS<br>\r\nSmiling So would I long pause So would I. <br>\r\nLooks out window and the camera follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUMAN SPACE SHUTTLE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnson, Privates Jones, Johnson and Harden are present.

The fun is about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two privates buckle into stations on either side of the ship.  ANSON begins climbing towards a seat in the ceiling as a voice crackles over the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMUER<br>\r\nMy name is Muer.  You have entered restricted territory.  Please disarm your weapons and follow our lead ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere appears an alien vessel on every side of the human shuttle as an alien vessel rises into view in the window, a large blinking blue light at the center of its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nPrepare to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMUER<br>\r\nYou have five seconds to disarm your weapons or it will be necessary for us to use force.  5, 4, 3\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANSON<br>\r\nFire on all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultiple concussive booms are heard as the human shuttle rocks back and forth.  A red light begins to flash and an alarm sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRIVATE HARDEN<br>\r\nSir!  We\u2019ve been hit on all sides.  It seems every fire we shot was ricocheted back at us.  You might want to prepare for a very rough landing. To self If I could bend over far enough, I\u2019d kiss my butt goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ground looms nearer, faster and faster, through the window, it suddenly stops and begins to back away as a blue glow fills the vision in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMUER<br>\r\nYou were warned, but as it was a first offense I will overlook it.  Now, if you\u2019d be kind enough to join us.  We have much to discuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPRIVATE JOHNSON<br>\r\nLike we have a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
