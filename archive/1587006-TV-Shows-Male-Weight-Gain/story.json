She was fully dressed, and had clearly been up for a while. J.D sat down at the table, which was already loaded with pancakes, sausages and scrambled eggs, as well as some hash browns and a pitcher of orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you cook all of this?\" he asked in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she replied, sliding the cooked bacon on to a plate, \"why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just never really thought of you as 'domestic'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our maid used to teach me how to cook on Saturday mornings, during my parents' weekly passive-aggressive squash match.\" Elliot explained as she carried the bacon over to the table, \"She taught me so much... Until my mother fired her for 'enabling my trip to tubby town'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D stifled a laugh at his girlfriend's dysfunctional homelife, and instead raised an eyebrow at the sheer amount of food. \"Why did you cook so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot shrugged, \"I dunno, you don't have to eat it all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D reached for a plate, but Elliot stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed him a bright green pill and a small glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" he asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a vitamin pill.\" she explained, sitting down, \"You're supposed to take it with meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D shrugged and gulped down the pill. Almost immediately he felt a powerful hunger, and began loading up his plate with big piles of eggs, bacon and potatoes. Elliot smiled and pushed a stack of buttery pancakes towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, and J.D sat back, completely stuffed. He had eaten almost everything on the table, as well as the entire jug of OJ, and it showed. His belly bulged out over his pants, rigid with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oogh,\" he groaned, before letting out a burp, \"I am so full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Elliot, who was smiling at him over a mug of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he said, looking at her clean plate, \"didn't you have any?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot stood up, fanning a napkin to his greasy lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm not really a big breakfast person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you go get ready for work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" exclaimed J.D, looking at the clock. Moving as fast as his stuffed belly would let him, he got dressed and left for work, leaving a happy Elliot to clean up the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Visiting patients, making diagnoses, annoying Dr. Cox, avoiding the Janitor... It was just another routine day at Sacred Heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact the first time he broke routine was at lunchtime. Normally he would have lunch with Turk, but since he was away, J.D had arranged to meet Elliot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Carla,\" he grumbled, \"Insisting they go on honeymoon 'alone'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indulged in a brief fantasy, where Turk and Carla were sitting on the beach, bored without their best friend J.D there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the cafeteria to find Elliot already there, sitting next to the window eating a salad. He kissed her on the cheek and told her he was just going to get his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need.\" Elliot replied, \"I already got you some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured at the tray opposite her, which was absolutely loaded with food. There were two huge cheeseburgers, sitting in a sea of french fries, onion rings and potato chips, as well as a large bottle of soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D was staggered by the amount of food, but didn't want to seem rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" he replied sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know you like cheeseburgers, so...\" Elliot shrugged, sensing his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at his plate, not really sure where to begin. He was still pretty full from breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait.\" said Elliot, sliding over a napkin from her side of the table, followed by a bottle of water. Right in the center of the napkin was another little green pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like, a two-a-day vitamin?\" Elliot explained, \"Twice as many vitamins as the one-a-day kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D knocked back the pill with a swig of water, and almost immediately found his appetite returning. He grabbed a burger and took an impressive bite, followed by another, and another. In no time at all he demolished the burger, before starting on the sides, grabbing an indiscriminate handful and cramming it in his mouth. He was lucky it was a slow time for the cafeteria, so no one was there to witness his gluttonous display, aside from Elliot, who didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tore into the second burger, dripping ketchup right down his top. As he finished off the sides and chugged the soda, Elliot went to get dessert, apple pie with whipped cream. She gave him the larger slice, and quickly declared herself full after one tiny bite of hers, which she then fed to the seemingly insatiable J.D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact it took two slices of the other dessert option (a creamy chocolate cake) before J.D sat back, finally full. His stomach was huge, even bigger than at breakfast, poking out from under his stained top. He groaned as Elliot popped the final crumb of cake in his mouth, before she kissed him on the forehead and told him she had to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there for ten minutes, unable to move. He only struggled to his feet when his pager went off, reminding him he was at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, J.D decides to go...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course their priest was a patient at the Hospital because Turk had failed to show up for the actual wedding ceremony, and they were married in the hospital room. They were finally married and off they went to their all-expense-paid honeymoon in Fiji on the luxurious Turtle Island. They were so happy to be married and excited to have two weeks off at the hospital to just enjoy each others' company and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla called out commands to Turk as the packed the car to go the the airport,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luggage?\"<br>\r\n\"Check,\" Turk replied.<br>\r\n\"All three suitcases and the carry-ons?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear.\" <br>\r\n\"Camera?\" <br>\r\n\"Check.\"<br>\r\n\"Passports!\"<br>\r\n\"Check. Carla, honey, this is the third time through the list...we have it all. Just get in the car and lets go!\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, sweety, I'm just going to grab my purse and then off to Fiji!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk and Carla got their stuff together and made their way to the airport. They checked their bags and made their way to the terminal. They waited at the terminal and then final boarded the plane. The plane was going to be a long 11 and a half hour flight; Turk was not excited about this, but the destination was well worth the flight, and then the flight attendant started her regular in-flight safety speech,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the seat pocket in front of you is a pamphlet about the safety features of this plane. Please follow along while I demonstrate in the front. There are 5 exits aboard this plane: 2 at the front, 2 over the wings, and one out the plane's rear end. If you're seated in one of the exit rows, please do not store your bags by your feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk tried to listen, but the food choices for the flight caught his attention instead; it was going to be a long flight and he can't remember having eaten anything before leaving...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFruit &amp; Cheese Plate - Healthy sized wedges of Cheddar, Smoked Gouda, and Brie offered with juicy Grapes, Pecan halves, and dried Apricots. Served with Pepperidge Farm\u00ae Crackers. - $6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe something a little more substantial,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThai Chicken Salad - Headlined by a sliced Thai Grilled Chicken Breast, this salad includes a bountiful mix of Mesculun Mixed Greens, Basil, Cilantro, Fresh Mint Leaves, Julienned Red Peppers, Mandarin Oranges, Shredded Carrots, and Peanuts. Served with Ginger Dressing and Breadsticks. Note: chicken, dressing, and breadsticks served individually. - $8<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a twelve hour flight...this won't hold me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomestyle Steak Burger - A 1/2 pound Angus burger sits on garlic toast with saut\u00e9ed spinach, roasted tomatoes, onions and tangy Hollandaise sauce. It's served next to sides of homemade fries and coleslaw. - $10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly Famous Steak Sandwich - Tender chuck steak, grilled to your liking, on a Sheboygan hard roll with melted provolone, mushrooms, horseradish mayo, fried onion strings &amp; side of your choice. - $10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk's mouth started watering, \"There we go,\" he thought, \"Finally something good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the flight attendant finished, \"Thank you for choosing and enjoy your flight. The flight attendants will be around to offer beverages and meals when we have reached a safe cruising altitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be so great!\" Carla whispered to Turk as she grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n\"I know! These meals sound amazing.\"<br>\r\n\"I was talking about the honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, it is some well deserved r and r.\"<br>\r\n\"The brochure looked stunning I can only imagine it in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane reached cruising altitude and the flight attendant came around. Carla got a water and a fruit and cheese platter. Turk got a soda and couldn't decide between the burger or the steak sandwich, so he got them both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey just because were married doesn't mean you can let yourself go...I only married you for your body. \" Carla said with a laugh.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know.\" Turk smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir food came and Turk began devouring his burger. He was much hungrier than he thought. Soon his entire plate was licked clean and he moved on the his steak sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow Turk!\" Carla exclaimed, who had not even half finished her snacks, \"This is a long flight, you can slow down, and anyway we have dinner reservations when we arrive.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is a long flight. I won't be full by the end. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk finished eating his steak meal and his belly was bloated to the max. He loosened his seat belt and went to sleep. He hadn't slept all night because of the early departure. Carla fell asleep to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane ride went pretty fast after they fell asleep and when they woke up there were only three hours left. Turk ordered some snacks and finished the remained of the trip watching the end of the in flight movie. When they landed in Figi it was around 6 at night. The two got their luggage and checked into their villa for their two week honeymoon.</span></div></div>",

Our reservations are a 8 so we only have 45 minutes.\" Carla said.<br>\r\n\"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk jumped on the bed while Carla went off to shower. Turk sat on the bed and watched t.v. Carla finished her shower and got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Turk, now you better get ready or else we'll be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk showered and got dressed and off they went to dinner at Ohana Restaurant. When they got there the dining room was dimly lit by candle light and each table was separated by a loose translucent sheet. The tables were covered in rose petals and there was a bottle of champagne cooling for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How gorgeous,\" Carla whispered to Turk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down and ordered. Carla got the Lemon Grass and pan-seered Mahi-Mahi. Turk got the all you can eat seafood medley and the side of fries and onion strings. Their food came and Turk dug in. He finished his first plate of seafood and sent out for the next. While he was waiting he chowed down on the fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry much?\" Carla asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, plus we're paying for this so we might as well eat it all.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, its already paid for...this is an all expense paid trip.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what I meant. Eat up.\"<br>\r\n\"Anyway what do you want to do tomorrow? I was thinking we go spend the day at the beach.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah that sounds awesome. The view from our villa was amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurk continued taking advantage of his all expense paid trip...getting three more plates of seafood. He felt his shorts getting tighter and undid his belt and unbuttoned. He didn't care it was pretty dark in the restaurant and it was pretty private. Turk was relieved by the release of his bloated belly. It fell onto his lap and stretched the elastic band on his underwear. His belly was pushing up against his silk button up but it felt strangely good. The waitress returned and noticed Turk's belly predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will their be any dessert for our stuffed guests? or are you too full?\"<br>\r\nTurk quickly added that he would have the, \"Tiramisu, Chocolate Eclair, and the Island Fruit Cheesecake.\"<br>\r\n\"Looks like you found one with quite an appetite on him,\" the waitress said to Carla.<br>\r\n\"I know, he's not usually such a food vacuum, but its our honeymoon and its an all expense paid trip.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh we get that all the time, but it can do some real damage to the waistline...I've seen it happen.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but its only two weeks...what's the worst that could happen?\"<br>\r\n\"Anyway can I get you anything for dessert..he seems pretty set over there.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure I'll just have a slice of the Raspberry Summer Sensation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the desserts were coming Carla moved closer to Turk and saw his bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at my big tubby hubby,\" Carla remarked as she patted his belly.<br>\r\n\"I love you Carla.\"<br>\r\n\"I love you too Turk.\" Carla began to rub his belly as she rested her head on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDessert finally came and Turk ate his Tiramisu and eclair with ease. His stomach has gone down and the rubbing felt so good. He struggled to finish the cheesecake, but Carla fed him the cheesecake and the rest of her cake. Turks belly was very big and Carla rubbed it again. Turk loved the sensation of his tight skin and expanded belly being rubbed and caress. Finally they finished dinner and Carla and Turk got up to leave. Turk had forgotten that he had undone his pants and sucked it in to close the button, and do up the belt. He then let his belly out and it pushed against his shorts again. They made their way back to the villa and settled done for the night. Carla went into the bathroom and \"freshened-up\". while she was in there, Turk undid his belt again and his belly again filled out and Turk took his shorts off and his shirt as well. He laid on the bed in his underwear with his plump belly sticking out. Carla emerged in sexy negligee. She jumped on the bed and laid atop Turk. Her hands worked their way over Turks body and felt his meaty thighs and made their way to his firm filled belly with a soft layer of fat, she stayed at his belly for a while caressing it with her hands and then kissing it. Her hands were like magic and made Turk very excited. Carla felt his softened pecs and then they finished their night making love and Turk fell asleep the happiest he could ever remember.</span></div></div>",

Here get you swimsuit on.\"<br>\r\nShe tossed him the swimsuit, it was from last season and looked a little small.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll just get it on at the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey packed up and started down to the beach, but not before Turk scarfed down a plate of pancakes, two bagels, and a bowl of fruit. Turk threw on his button up shirt and off they went. When they got to the beach Carla set up their spot with towels, lounge chairs and an umbrella. Turk went to the changing room and put on his swim suit. It was little tight. The elastic was all the way out and his little layer of fat pushed out over the waistband. Turk walked out and over to Carla. Carla poked at his belly fat,<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's suit is a little snug.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I did put on a little weight over the wedding planning because I picked up extra hospital shifts to help pay for the honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n\"And the way you ate late night certain didn't do anything to help.\"<br>\r\n\"So I haven't been able to get to the gym in a couple months...its only a little weight and I could lose it fast.\"</span></div></div>",

She raises an eyebrow and points at his bloated tummy. \"I thought we agreed you'd go to the gym?\" Turk sighs and looks back at the mirror. <br>\r\n\"I kind of like it, though. Don't you think its sexy?\" Turk strikes a few poses before returning his attention to his wife, who's glaring at him nodding her head. \"Tomorrow you're hitting the gym. Don't make me take you there myself.\" She turns and leaves the room, leaving Turk to stare at himself once more. He didn't want to say it, but he'd actually started to like the weight.

There must be tonnes of guys out there who would love getting paid to eat ice cream! And now we can!\"<br>\r\n\"What's the catch?\" questioned Cody.<br>\r\n\"There is no catch!\" said Tony. \"I run an ice cream parlour, and some of the flavours are yet to be tested...that's all. It's just ice cream, the worst that could happen is if you get brainfreeze\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Cody, you should join in\"<br>\r\n\"Isn't ice cream bad for your health?\" he said, arrogantly. <br>\r\n\"Well, if your really that unsure, I can let you try some of my samples right now!\"<br>\r\nThey both followed Tony into his shop. It was sparkling and new, and they could here the freezer rumble at the back of the shop. He quickly fetched two sundaes and laid them in front of the twins.<br>\r\n\"Just to water your mouths a bit\" he grinned. \"Just try these, tell me what you think and then you can decide whether to take the job or not\"<br>\r\nZack grabbed a spoon and scooped the ice cream into his mouth.<br>\r\n\"It's delicious!\" shouted Zack.<br>\r\n\"Great\" said Tony. \"I'll go get some more\"<br>\r\nCody took his first spoonful.<br>\r\n\"Hey, this really isn't that bad\" said Cody.<br>\r\n\"Not bad? It's fantastic!\" said Zack.<br>\r\nTony came back with a trolley filled with small bowls. In each of these bowls were five scoops of ice cream.<br>\r\n\"This are my new test flavours!\" said Tony. \"I come up with about a dozen more every day, they're easy to make. All's you have to do is eat fifteen bowls a day and then write your thoughts down. I'll pay you seven bucks an hour, plus a fifty cents pay rise every two weeks you work here\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" said Zack. \"I'm all up for it!\"<br>\r\n\"Fifteen bowls!\" said Cody, gobsmacked. \"We can't eat all that each!\"<br>\r\n\"I can\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"But, you've got your health to worry about\"<br>\r\n\"I'll let you worry about my helath and yours while I eat this ice cream\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"But, you could get fat!\" said Cody.<br>\r\n\"Hey, so could you Mr Healthy! Come on, as long as we walk from our suite to Tony's and back, our figures will be fine!\"<br>\r\n\"I guess it's ok then...this is ordinary ice cream, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...not quite\" said Tony. \"I've added extra flavour but their may be a few side effects\"<br>\r\n\"Oh all right, I give in\" said Cody. \"Sign me up too!\"<br>\r\nTony put the fifteen bowls of ice cream in front of them. Zack dug in, and soon after, fifteen bowls were gone. He'd eaten more than he could take, but still wanted more.<br>\r\n\"You don't look so great\" said Cody, who was on his eleventh bowl.<br>\r\n\"Neither do you\" said Zack \"Heck, you look stuffed\"<br>\r\nCody burped loudly and rubbed his thin waist.<br>\r\n\"I feel bloated\" said Cody. \"But I think I can take a little more\"<br>\r\nTony came back through with a camera and began snapping photos.<br>\r\n\"What are the photos for?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Advertisements, blogs...that sort of thing. I need more customers to boost my business, and you look like great mascots. Hey, I'll even stick the pictures on the wall so people can see you enjoying yourselves when they come in\"<br>\r\nTony took out the first two pictures and wrote \"Week 1\" on a noticeboard. He then pinned the seperate pictures of Zack and Cody eating ice cream on and smiled.<br>\r\n\"Not bad. Are you guys done?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm finished\" said Zack, pushing away the fifteenth bowl.<br>\r\n\"I can't take anymore\" moaned Cody, belching over his half finished thirteenth portion.<br>\r\n\"That's ok\" Just write your thoughts down on the noticeboard over there\"<br>\r\nCody groaned and got off his seat. He and Zack walked over to the noticeboard and put mainly positive comments. They then collected fourteen dollars each, <br>\r\n\"So what did you think?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"I think I have indegestion\" groaned Cody, clutching his stomach.<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby, come on lets go buy a hot-dog\"<br>\r\nThey each bought one, and Cody slowly nibbled his way through his. It warmed up his taste buds a little.<br>\r\n\"That;s better\" he said. \"What did Tony do with the ice cream I didn't finish\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I ate it\"<br>\r\n\"You did? Man, your stomach must be huge\"<br>\r\nThey got back into their room and slouched on the couch, exhausted. <br>\r\n\"So your coming back tomorrow?\" <br>\r\n\"I'll try\" said Cody. \"I'd better take the stairs next time, I don't wanna let that stuff get to my hips\"<br>\r\n\"Who cares, it's only ice cream\" said Zack. \"Our summer break is fourteen weeks, we can pack in the job by then and spend the money\"<br>\r\nThey watched Tv for a few hours, before ordering large lunches and dinners from room service. Finally, they got into their pyjamas and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He brushed his long blonde hair out of his eyes and took some underpants from the dresser. Then, he took his pyjamas off and rubbed his waist. It was lined with red stretch marks, and he'd been having trouble sleeping all through the night because they had become uncomfortable. He scratched his gut a little and burped.<br>\r\nZack groaned and rolled straight off his bed, taking the duvet with him. He rolled onto the floor and slowly got up again.<br>\r\n\"Hey\" said Cody. \"You'd better get changed, we're going shopping while we're boarded today\"<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too, but we've got to hurry. There's a sale at Gradudats\"<br>\r\n\"Gradu-whats?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"It's a big clothing store and I wanna spend some of this cash\"<br>\r\nThe twins had made nearly two hundred bucks, and had recieved two pay rises each. Zack had now extended his ice cream rota to twenty bowls a day, and was nearing twenty five. Cody could not match this, but had soon found he could muster more than just fifteen bowls now. Twenty was now his new target. Tony provided more and more interesting flavours, and both twins thought they were delicious. However, they tended to eat so much that they gave themselves stomach ache, and instead of walking the two mile journey and taking the stairs, they had resorted to using cabs and lifts before slouching on the couch lazily. They always felt too sluggish after a big quota at Tony's.<br>\r\nCody found his underpants and slipped them under his feet. They went up over his legs and he pulled them up to his waist. He then pulled the elastic waistband and let go. It snapped against his stomach, painfully, and it wobbled a little.<br>\r\n\"Ow\" yelled Cody, who rubbed his sore gut. He then walked over to the dresser to get his pants and sweater vest.<br>\r\n\"Whoah\" said Cody. \"This is sorta tight!\"<br>\r\nHe ran a finger over his waistline and snorted.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...they must have shrunk\" he said. He went to the mirror and looked at the underpants. <br>\r\n\"Ooof\" he groaned, as he felt a pang of tightness. \"It's worse than I thought!\"<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" said Zack,his head still in the duvet.<br>\r\n\"My pants must have shrunk in the washer yesterday\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,ok\"<br>\r\nCody nervously ran a finger over his waistline. A ring of fat was slowly wobbling over the rim of his underwear, it went all the way around his waist and was nearly touching the button at the front. He stroked his gut and walked back over to the bed. By now, Zack had also gotten up.<br>\r\nCody chuckled as his brother drowsily grabbed some underwear and looked in the mirror. Zack had gained weight. His pyjama top didn't cover his gut any more, it had become tighter and less well fitting. His pants were the same, and he also had stretch marks when he took them off. He grabbed the underwear and tried to put them on.<br>\r\n\"Hhhh....hnnnggghh\" he groaned. \"They're too small...gotta try again\"<br>\r\nZack pulled them up, hard. His gut began to wobble, and an even bigger ring of fat was stopping him from pulling up the pants. He began to jump up and down, but this made his larger waist even more obtrusive. He was beginning to tire. Cody stared at him strangely. How had Zack gotten so fat?<br>\r\nHis attenttion turned over to his own underwear. He hadn't done the zipper yet. Cody turned around and pulled the zipper up, but it slipped out of his hands. He tried again, but it only went up so far before his gut began to jiggle and they felt too tight. He then breathed in and sucked his stomach up. The fat bulging over the underwear disappeared. Cody smiled, zipped up the zipper and exhaled again. But as he did so, the layer of fat suddenly fell onto the pants again, the zipper unzipped and his gut bulged forward.<br>\r\n\"These pants don't fit!\" shouted Zack. \"How come?\"<br>\r\n\"Your pants must have shrunk yours in the wash too!\" said Cody. \"We need new pants\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody put on a sweater vest and some pants and Zack had found some elasticated shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater when they were boarded they went to an nearby mall and...</span></div></div>",

I think they were a pretty tight squeeze on you too, Mr Still-Skinny\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, Your fattening both of us up here. All that ice-cream, all that junk food, it hasn't done you any good. And unfortunately, a little of what you do is starting to show on me\"<br>\r\nCody lifted his sweater vest to show Zack the unsightly roll of fat he had tried to conceal underneath his baggiest T-shirt. His whole body had plumped up a level, he looked fatter and more sluggish<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault you're bigger. You took that job, you should fear the consequences\"<br>\r\n\"So should you, chubby\" said Cody, who took a bite out of his second burger. \"I should go on a diet\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, eating a burger...what a great way to start\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"The best way is by weighing myself first, I'll slow down gradually on the junk. Then I'll go on a diet...after a bowl of ice cream....or some fries...mmmmm...I'm sure I can eat in moderation\"<br>\r\n\"Let's go to those scales\" said Zack.<br>\r\nHe threw the rubbish in the bin and took out a few dollars. He inserted it into the machine.<br>\r\n\"When did we last weigh ourselves?\" said Zack. <br>\r\n\"We were at the doctors two months ago\" said Cody. \"I was one hundred and twenty eight pounds, you were one hundred and thirty six\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'm sure I'll be ok now\"<br>\r\nZack inserted the number sixteen into the machine for his age, followed by his previous weight on 136 pounds. The machine read HEALTHY WEIGHT.He then stepped on. The scales shot to a result instantly - 157 pounds.<br>\r\n\"Well, well...twenty one pounds in two months, you probably gained one and a half stone when you started working at Tony's four weeks ago. Man, check what the scale says!\"<br>\r\nThe words ALMOST OVERWEIGHT were in bright red letters above Zack's reading.<br>\r\n\"So what, my extra pounds are part of me now.It'll be gone next cemester. Your turn, Mr Skinny...\" <br>\r\nChuckling, Cody inserted his money and got on the scale. He typed his age, and then his old weight of 128 pounds. The scale read ALMOST UNDERWEIGHT. <br>\r\n\"See, I needed to gain a little anyway\" smiled Cody, rubbing his gut. The scale went up to....- 141 pounds. Cody gulped nervously and waited for the machine reading. It came as BEYOND HEALTHY WEIGHT.<br>\r\n\"Oh...errmmm....I must have taken it a little too far\" groaned Cody, stepping off. He raised his shirt again and looked at his gut, concerned. His flat stomach wasn't there anymore, it had become bigger and more noticeable. But while Cody's sweater vest only revealed a trace of his overeating, Zack's T-shirt was under strain. It didn't quite cover him and it showed every pound of his weight gain.<br>\r\n\"Not exactly super-fit are you?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up. My extra thirteen pounds are a little more spread out than your whopping twenty one\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, we've both gained more than a stone\" snorted Zack. \"If your not careful, you might get bigger!\"<br>\r\n\"That's never gonna happen. I'm not even gonna try and diet, being beyond healthy weight isn't that bad. I'll be in perfect shape for the swim tryouts for the races the ship is having, the grand prize money is $1000\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Come on, let's go to Gradudats\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

When they go over to the changing rooms all of them but one are occupied, so they share one Cody takes off his his shirt and his little gut jiggles it now only hangs about 3 inches of his waist. Zack pokes it and says \"Mr. Healthy is looking kinda chubby, the scale was definitely  right you are  beyond a healthy weight. Haha!\" Cody puts a new  slightly larger sweater vest. It fits like a glove and  you hardly can see his weight gain.  He then takes off his pants, and Cody's  slightly plump ass is visable through his tight under wear. Zack grabbes Cody's  butt and says tauntingly \" looks like is itsnt all  going to that little gut of yours. Never the less Cody slips a new pair of shorts with ease and zips them with no problem. Cody then left the changing room to go and pay for the clothes. Zack was  relieved because he didn't want Cody to see his  huge gut and bulbous ass. Zack took off his shirt and his large potbell flopped out. He looked in the mirror and jiggled his gut, then slightly smiled. He tried on his first shirt but he couldn't get it to cover his husky frame. He then moved on to the next but his gut was still visable at the bottom. He tried on the last shirt that was the largest size and it barly fit but if zack moved the shirt would go flying up. He then tought to him self \"I don't really need a new shirt\" so he moved on to the pants. He couldn't even move the first pair past his thunder tighs. The next pair made it a little further but not much the got  stuck on zacks enormous ass. He FINNALLY got a pair to waist but once he didn't the zipper wouldn't budge. So Zack took a dealp breath and sucked in. He zipped it and button the top but when he exhaled the botton went flying  off and the zipper unzipped. When zack bent over to pick up the botton the shorts ripped at the butt seam. Zack decides to just give up on clothes shopping for today.</span></div></div>",

Thudding up and down on the floor shaking the ceiling below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin came running upstairs and into Joe's bedroom to see him standing there shirtless, with his jeans stuck at his thighs.

He knew he had a big butt, but for his bother to point it out and pat it like this was weird. But little did Joe notice how much bigger it had gotten recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last pull they got them up and Kevin helped Joe button them shut, they were straining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, thanks Kevin\" said Joe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick come up stairs and walked into Joe's bedroom, \"what's with all the noise?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I was just helping Joe with something\" said Kevin on his way out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at Joe strangely as he was standing there in nothing but a pair of tight skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was just helping me get them on\" snapped Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need help getting them on?\" laughed Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Nick, they shrunk in the wash.\" said Joe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think they've shrunk, I think you've grown\" laughed Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" asked Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't get them on because you've gotten fat, I found out what Kevin's up to, he's fattening you up.

That's ridiculous Nick.\" scoffed Joe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I'm serious look at yourself.\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe walked over to his full length mirror and started to check himself out, he noticed how straining the jeans were around his butt and thighs and how much the waistband was digging it, his butt was definitely bigger, his stomach wasn't as flat was it was two weeks ago either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I've put on a few pounds, but that's just because I'm on break, I'm sure you have too, accused Joe, and my butt just looks bigger because I've added more squats to my work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and when was the last time you worked out Joe? And squats don't make it soft like that\" Nick accused back. \" And yeah maybe I've put on one or two pounds, but you're weight gain is far more than that.

He didn't care what people said, he knew Sam would give him a titty twister but he loved his fat rolls. Gibby took off his pants and was stripped down to his boxers. Gibby went to his kitchen to get all his favorite junk foods and brought it back to his room. He began to eat and feel his fat grow. He didn't think of it as bad, he loved being pudgy and having his rolls of fat. There was a knock at his door, too lazy he felt to put on anything, he went to the door. He saw that Freddie was standing there, Gibby opened the door and let Freddie in. Freddie looked at Gibby with big eyes and said \"Gibby, you know you're pretty much naked.\" <br>\r\n\"Dude, I have boxers on!\" Gibby said in disgust.  \"If you aren't happy, there's the door.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't mean..\" Freddie didn't mean to upset Gibby and felt embarrassed that he could only fixate himself on Gibby's round belly. \"So what are you up to Gibby?\" Freddie tried to change the subject. <br>\r\n\"I am trying to get fatter.\" Gibby said rubbing his belly. <br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Freddie kind of confused. <br>\r\n\"Freddie, you are pretty skinny.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah so what's your point Gibby.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, we are friends and I think that Carly would probably like you fatter.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know Gibby.\" <br>\r\n\"C'mon dude gaining, it's not that bad, I can help you.\"<br>\r\n\"Gibby, why not.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool, take you shirt off.\" <br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" Freddie looked at Gibby a little astonished that Gibby asked that. <br>\r\n\"Dude, I am fat and shirtless! You will be skinny and shirtless big whoop!\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" As Freddie rolled his eyes and took off his shirt. <br>\r\n\"Wow, you are way to damn skinny, you got no manboobs or belly at all.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah so..\" Freddie kind of embarrassed by Gibby checking him out.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well you gotta be a chubby one like me. I got rolls that jiggle, you got nothing that jiggles not even your ass.\" Gibby said as he slapped Freddie in the ass. <br>\r\n\"Gibby! I know I am too skinny.\" <br>\r\n\" I will fix that and you can be as fat as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*a couple weeks later*<br>\r\nGibby came over to Freddie's apartment, 30lbs heavier to find that Freddie also had gained weight. Gibby knocked on the door to see that Freddie was fat also. \u201cDamn, you are pretty fat, Bensen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Gibby, yeah I have got some fat rolls.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDude you wanna come back to my house.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure, let me tell my mom.\u201d Freddie waddled over. \u201cMom, I am going over to Gibby\u2019s.\u201d They got back to Gibby\u2019s and they sat around for a little bit. <br>\r\nFinally, Gibby had spoken, \u201cWhat you wanna do Freddie the fatty.\u201d They both laughed. </span></div></div>",

He waited  anxiously every night have that feeling and the would rub his bloated massive belly feeling the small divet that was his belly button. It was heaven. But still...

He snuck down at around 2:00 in the morning and looked for food.  Nothing was safe from his growing hunger, sweets, vegetables, his moms crap cooking, nothing! With his recent eating habits, he grew a nice big belly, that looked like a basket ball and he also had a nice big ass and some moons. One night, Dewey was eating as usual when he let out a loud burp! He covered hoping nobody would here. There was no one. \u201cThat was close!\u201d, Dewey thought to himself.

The boys had been enjoying their time off by engaging in activities that writing music and being on tour left no time for. Carlos had been playing hockey and had joined an indoor league, Logan was learning how to code, and James? Well, Kendall wasn't exactly sure of what James was doing but whatever it was it kept him very busy. Kendall sat up in his bed and stretched, his black tank top riding up ever so slightly revealing a strip of flesh between his tank top and his boxers. Writing the new album and finishing the accompanying tour had exhausted him, more than he had ever expected. So instead of pining his free time away by doing more work, he'd been relaxing by the pool, getting some sleep, and playing video games. He left his room and walked down the hallway into the ample living room and kitchen of their new house. Now that the boys were older, they had moved into a beach house on Laguna Beach. The house was surprisingly large and boasted an ample upstairs and a rooftop balcony that overlooked the beautiful beach below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall opened up the fridge and grabbed two slices of the pizza that he had ordered the night before, stacking them on top of each other Saturday Night Fever style and took a bite. He continued munching on the pizza as he got out a bowl for cereal. The microwave clock said it was 9:30 which meant that James would already be out and that Logan and Carlos would be awake soon enough. He finished the pizza and took his bowl of cereal and walked to the couch in the living room positioned in front of the TV and turned it on. He switched it from cable to Netflix and continued watching season three of Grey's Anatomy. He finished the bowl of cereal and was still a bit hungry. He took the bowl back to the kitchen and grabbed the remaining two slices of pizza from the fridge and dumped the empty box into the recycling. He returned to his seat and polished off the pizza, feeling pleasantly full. His belly bowed out slightly and he stifled a burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the episode was over, he used the twenty seconds until the next episode started to grab a drink. He reached for a soda and was surprised by:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kendall almost dropped his soda, thankfully he hadn't opened the can yet. He heard muffled noises coming from Logan's room that sounded suspiciously like swearing. Kendall popped the tab of the soda opened and headed to Logan's room to investigate. Logan's door was open, revealing the disaster inside. Papers were scattered all over the floor and Logan's bed. A computer system was set up with a few monitors and towers as wells as a partially deconstructed laptop. Logan was sitting on the floor next to an overturned chair. Kendall leaned against the door frame and took a long swig of soda. Logan was shirtless and rubbing his forehead. It might have been his imagination, but Logan's abs seemed to have faded a bit. <br>\r\n\"Dude what happened in here?\" Kendall inquired, taking in the scene in front of him with a bemused smile.<br>\r\n\"I fell asleep in that chair last night, I must have leaned back when I woke up and fallen over,\" Logan replied with a sigh.<br>\r\n\"You gotta be careful man, staying up all night like that isn't good for you.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, but I was on a roll and I kept telling myself one more line, every time I finished a line.\"<br>\r\nKendall chuckled and finished his soda. Logan got up and picked up his chair, tucking it under his desk. Logan looked at Kendall with an expression Kendall couldn't quite identify. <br>\r\n\"Do I -urp- have something on my face?\" Kendall asked.<br>\r\n\"Uh no, no I just... uh, well I'm gonna get dressed, I'll be out in a little bit,\" Logan stammered. Weird. Kendall shrugged and headed back to the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan sighed, thankful one of the monitors on his desk separated his boxers from Kendall's line of sight. Logan knew Kendall had put on a few pounds, in fact, if he was being honest, they all had. But his belly stuffed tight after a big breakfast? He had no idea how much it would turn him on. Logan closed the door and headed to his bathroom to change and take a shower, a cold one. Kendall was like his brother. Logan shook off the weird feeling as he shampooed his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kendall tossed his soda can into the recycling with the pizza and headed back to the couch as Carlos charged down the stairs into the kitchen. He had work out clothes on and looked panicked. <br>\r\n\"Where's the fire buddy?\" Kendall laughed as Carlos started to empty the fridge of the leftovers and started laying them out on the counter.<br>\r\n\"I have to carb-load today, we are doing some super intense cardio at practice. I totally forgot last night,\" Carlos responded in rapid fire action. Intrigued, Kendall paused Netflix and sat on a one of the bar stools opposite Carlos. Kendall noticed Carlos's middle looked thicker, and his pants seemed tight around his butt and thighs. But he had been working out with the hockey league and had always been a bit thicker than the other boys. He dismissed it and watched Carlos load up a huge plate with the remnants of meals the boys had cooked and ordered out throughout the week. Carlos looked up, a bit sheepish.<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude, did you want me to make you a plate too? Ah man, I didn't mean to steal something you were planning on eating,\" Carlos said apologetically. Kendall was about to say no, he had already eaten but he paused. He could eat a little more, but he was already pretty full. Kendall debated, and decided on:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure I haven't really had breakfast yet,\" Kendall replied. Carlos smiled and started piling up another plate. He almost seemed relieved. Carlos placed the two overflowing plates into the microwave and started making two more. Kendall was surprised, there was no way he'd be able to eat two plates of a week's worth of leftovers, even if he hadn't already eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa wait I only agreed to one plate,\" Kendall protested, although he wasn't sure he even wanted that anymore. Carlos smiled and shook his head.<br>\r\n\"Can't carb-load on one plate, dude. Gotta get that protein too,\" Carlos retorted as he removed the first two plates and loaded the new ones in. Kendall was dubious. Carlos gestured to the couch in the living room and Kendall carried the first two plates in and placed them on the coffee table in front of the couch. He reluctantly sat down in front of one of the monster sized portions. Carlos appeared with the other plates as well as napkins and forks. He plopped down next to Kendall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall unpaused Netflix and the two of them began to chow down. At first, Kendall thought there would be no way he could finish more than half of the first plate. But then he was in the zone. He and Carlos made comments about the show between mouthfuls and before he knew it, he had finished his first plate and was on to the second.His stomach throbbed with a dull ache, but he soldiered on, finishing off the second plate with an unexpected burp. Carlos laughed and clapped him hard on the shoulder, causing his belly to slosh and sending a sharp needle of pain through his gut. He glanced over at Carlos and was amazed at what he saw. Carlos's belly had swollen up, it looked almost inflated. His blue work out shirt was pulled tight against the curve of his stuffed belly. In fact, a tiny sliver of tanned belly poked out where his shirt met his shorts. He drew his hand lazily over the curve of his belly and let out a burp of his own. Kendall was transfixed and thankful for the napkin that concealed his tenting boxers. He had no time to analyze this sudden arousal because Carlos stretched like a cat in the sun, exposing his stuffed middle. His bloated midsection had the remnants of muscle, but no abs and no definition to speak of. It was tan, smooth, and had a kiss of hair whirling around his belly button. A gurgle in his stomach caused Kendall to examine his own middle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHis belly had gone from slightly bowed out to full blown stuffed. His black tank top had ridden up slightly, revealing a pale strip of bloated belly. Kendall knew he had put on some weight since the hiatus but he looked about four months pregnant with all the food crammed into his aching stomach. Kendall attempted to stretch like Carlos had but it sent a jolt of pain through his swollen middle and caused him to let out a quiet whine of pain. It wasn't unpleasant, exactly, but it still hurt to upset his taut and rounded gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-urp- Next time, if you're gonna carb load, you may want to skip the breakfast,\" Carlos teased, turning slightly so he could prod at Kendall's bloated middle. Kendall swatted his hands away with a moan of discomfort.<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\" he moaned, rubbing his exposed belly. He couldn't believe it. Even if it was mostly bloat, his belly looked like a proper gut. And the more he rubbed it, the more he saw of Carlos's bloated and thicker midsection, the more intense his arousal became. He began to sorely regret not putting on pants. Carlos chuckled and gently patted Kendall's swollen belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw the pizza box, bro. Gotta be careful if you don't want to lose that girlish figure of yours,\" Carlos prodded. Kendall laughed but the movement hurt his belly and he let out another moan. Carlos grunted and began the laborious process of getting off the couch. Once he was standing Kendall could really see just how much his belly stuck out. He carefully placed one hand over the napkin. He'd have to wait until later to figure out what this all meant. Carlos stretched his hands behind his head, really causing his shirt to ride up this time and let out another burp. He affectionately swatted his belly then turned to face Kendall. His smile faltered for a second as he turned to see a stunned Logan standing in the hallway adjoining Kendall's and Logan's rooms to the kitchen. He was holding a notebook and a stack of papers that he promptly dropped once he laid eyes on Carlos's bloated belly and shirt that perched just above his belly button. Logan desperately began collecting his fallen belongings as Carlos waddled towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kendall, I'd skip lunch,\" Carlos teased, pulling his tightly fitting athletic shirt down to cover his belly, \"I gotta go work this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan stood up and held his notebook and papers surreptitiously over his groin and was trying very hard not to pay attention to Carlos's or Kendall's bloated midsections. Or how Carlos's shirt barely covered his belly. Or how tight it was. Or how Kendall's tank top was hiked up over his pale, bloated gut. Or the sudden tightness in his own pants caused by his two bloated friends sheepishly nursing their guts after overindulging. No, Logan tried very hard not to notice any of that. Kendall let out a quiet burp and Logan rushed back to his room sputtering that he forgot something and Carlos gave Kendall a quick wave as he exited. Kendall struggled to his feet still cradling his belly and waddled back towards his bedroom. He passed Logan's room to see the door was slightly ajar. Logan was acting really weird, but Kendall's belly ached so much from all the food crammed inside of it. He thought for a moment and then decided to:</span></div></div>",

His belly hurt too much to do anything but lay down, so kendall took a nap in his room. He slept for 6 hours, and the pain and tightness of his gut soon vanished. It returned to normalish size, maybe slightly pudgier, but it no longer caused Kendall any pain. When Kendall awoke, he smelt the aroma of pizza. Hungry after his longer-nap, Kendall quickly got out of bed and walked to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos had just walked in carrying 4 large cheese pizzas. \"Hey guys! I got each of us a pizza for dinner!\" he called, and Logan followed Kendall downstairs. James was a no-show again, so there were 3 guys and 4 pizzas. Carlos set a pizza in front of each seaf and he began on his own box. Kendall and Logan joined him and began eating the 8 large slices of pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys ate their pizza hungrily. Kendall found that it tasted amazing, and when he had finished his pizza box with ease, he still wanted to eat more. Kendall slowly brought James' box fo his seat, craving more of the pizza. Besides, James wasnt coming downstairs, he never did anymore. And Kendall didn't want to waste any food....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan and Carlos were so concentrated on their own dinner that they didb't notice Kendall grab James' box. The three enjoyed their dinner and Kendall's shirt began to expose his hairy belly. Kendall unbuttoned his jeans and felt a sigh of relief and continued eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice.\" Logan said<br>\r\n \"Agreed.\" Kendall replied.<br>\r\n\"I dont know about you guys, but I'm still hungry.\" Carlos said, patting his belly. <br>\r\n\"I guess I could eat more...\" Logan said. Kendall, having eating double of what the others had, was feeling pretty full. He didnt want the same pain as earlier, but he didnt want to admit that he had eaten James' dinner. \"Sure!\" Kendall said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Carlos re-entered the kitchen with 2 medium sized cakes. \"Here's dessert!\" he said. He placed the 2 cakes on the table and cut each into 8 pieces. \"Each of us can have four, and we can save 4 for James!\" Carlos said. \"Speaking of James, where's his piz-\"<br>\r\n\"Let's dig in!\" Kendall said and took out a piece from the cake to eat. Four pieces isn't bad, he thought. But once he swallowed the first bite, Kendall fell in love with the taste. The chocolate cake tasted like heaven, and he knew he could finish the other four pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall chomped away, gladly chewing and swallowing each bit of his cake, until there was none left. Kendall was in an eating bliss and he accidentally ate James' portion. Kendalls belly now stook out of his shirt with no covering, and everything under his naval was revealed. He tried to button back his jeans witg no luck, so he sat in the chair rubbing his belly, hiding the James' missing food in his pizza box. He threw his away, but not unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have there?\" Carlos asked Kendall. \"What?! Nothing.\" Kendall quickly replied, embarassed of eating double his meal. Carlos got up, and turned Kendall around and slapped Kendall's gut. \"Good dinner?\" Carlos laughed. <br>\r\n\"Looks like you had one too!\" Kendall joked and patted Carlos' gut that also poked out of his shirt. Logan stood up and he seemed to follow the trend. Although Kendall's gut was noticeably bigger, the three laughed. Kendall's stomach pain from earlier had returned, so he re-entered his room for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night, noises awake Kendall from his sleep. Worried of a robber, he grabs a bat in his room and slowly walked downstairs to the kitchen. In there, he found....</span></div></div>",
