But it isn't much of a date where they can hang out and have fun.  Oh no.  It's more along the lines of testing out something he created.  It is a small remote device that he made that can turn anyone into anything.  All he needed is to test it out and he told his girlfriend about it.  Out of curiosity, she agreed to use it as a way of a date.  It does depends on if the device works for not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to her place, he needs to look the part.  And at twenty-five, he aims to impress for this special date.  He was a well built man, not body builder type, but average for someone his age.  With tight pecs, six pack abs, tones biceps, and a face that is chiseled and rugged with stubble on his face, hazel eyes, and spiky black hair, he was the type of guy women could drool over.  He was sporting a gray polo shirts, long blue jeans, and a pair of boots, he was dressed to impress his girlfriend in more ways then one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading up to her apartment complex, he reached her door and started to knock on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opened, John's 25-year-old girlfriend, Jenny, came out and saw him standing there.  Now Jenny is the kind of girl next door type of person that has fair skin, C cup breasts, curvy hips, bubble rear, and angelic face with sky blue eyes, pouty lips, thin nose, and long flowing sandy blonde hair.  She was wearing a strap tank top that shows off her cleavage, tight blue jean skirt that goes down to above her knees, and a pair of three inch heal sandals.  She was really ready for this date and wanted to look the part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him, she smiled and said, \"Well hello John.  I was expecting you.  Ready for our date I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn chuckled and rubbed the back of his head, saying, \"Yeah...  Well this has to be a special one, so I need to look like I'm ready for one.  But first, I do want to show you what I am working on.  May I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy knew that he want this to be private so she let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.  Come on in.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo John started to head on inside and Jenny closed the door from behind. Once the two were in her apartment, Jenny looked to him and ask, \"So...  What you got there?  You said you have something you've been working on that will make our date quite interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smirked and showed her.  \"I'm glad you ask.\" he said as he took something out of his pocket, \"Here it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at the object he has and wasn't impressed.  It look like some kind of remote with a built in computer screen and a small set of buttons that contains arrows, numbers/letter combo, and an enter sign.  Looking at the screen, she was a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" she started, \"That's it!  That's this special project you've been working on for quite a while.  Some remote.  I was expecting something a little more...exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sighed and decided to explain it to his girlfriend.  \"True...  It looks like a remote, but it's no ordinary remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny heard that and was curious.  \"Oh really...?  And what is it though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when John explained to her what it is.  \"This remote is actually a transformative remote.  Meaning it's a remote that can change anyone into whatever I like.  All I have to do is choose the person or people with the scanner on the remote and then I choose what type of transformation I can use.  Now the changes vary with what I can choose.  Whether I age or agress them, turn them into animals, inanimate objects, or different people, change their size, switch genders, alter their race, or any other thing, the sky is the limit.  Now this is just a minor prototype, but I need to test it out in the field to see if it can work before I can create more of them.  So it's the reason why I want to go on this date, just to try out my new invention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny heard this and still wasn't sure if what he's saying is true, or if it's just some pipedream of his.  Rubbing the back of her head, she said, \"Gee...  I don't know...  It seems really hard to believe if that device of yours will work or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me give it a try.  Who knows, maybe if it works, it will be a date that we will never forget when it's over.\" he promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny gave it a bit of thought and wondered if it is wise using this questionable device on a date.  However, this is suppose to be special, so she might as well give it a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...  Since this is our special date, might as well live a little.\" she said to him, \"So...  What should we do for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn heard her question and wondered too.  \"I don't know...  I just come in here to show you the device.  Why don't you make the decision on where we should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny heard that and was surprised by that thought.  So she rubbed her shin and thought about where to go.  Finally, she came up with a decision and told him where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...\"</span></div></div>",

Why don't we just stay at home to try the device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn heard that and was quite surprised that she wants to stay home and test the remote.  \"Really?\" he said in confusion, \"You really want to just stay in your apartment to try this beauty out.  I thought for sure that you want to go out someplace.  Maybe a mall, or a park, or even someplace even more romantic.  A lot of people and there are a variety of choices to go by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny put her hands on her hips and said back, \"True...  But you said that this is a prototype, right?  So what better place to test it out then in the comfort of your own home.  Besides, I think it's best we try it on each other and not at anyone else until we know for sure that it's safe to try out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn listened to her side and thought that it might work.  \"Hmm...  You made a compelling argument.\" he said with interest.  \"All right then, let's try the device ourselves in your place.  So who should go first?  Me or you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny thought of that and realized that they have to test it on each other.  Whether it be her, her boyfriend, or both.

Might be fun to see what happens, if what you said about the device is true.\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn heard this and thought maybe it's best his girlfriend would try it out.  After all, she was interested in how the device works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" he started to explain, \"Whatever you say.  Now first I need you to stay still.  I will point the device towards you and it will scan your body.  It will put down the information about you and the stats you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny heard him and decided to hold still for the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.  Scan me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn soon pointed his remote at her and begin the scanning process.  An invisible scanner soon came out of antennae and went down from her head to her feet.  The screen on it was showing the <i>'Scanning in Process'</i> message with a loading bar going from left to right.  When the scan is finished, he looked to the screen and it started to show the stats.   He soon showed the stats to Jenny and said, \"See, the scan is complete and your stats are present on the screen.  Have a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny approached the remote and took a good look at it.  She soon saw her profile on the monitor and it showed everything about herself.  It reads...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Name: Jenny Kendrick<br>\r\nAge: 25<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nRace: Caucasian<br>\r\nIQ: 110<br>\r\nLanguage: English<br>\r\nSex Drive: Medium<br>\r\nHeight 5'6<br>\r\nWeight: 160 lbs.<br>\r\nBuild: Athletic Build/C Cup/Thin Hourglass/Bubble Butt<br>\r\nHair: Long/Sandy Blonde/Flowing<br>\r\nEyes: Sky Blue<br>\r\nOccupation: College Student/Sports Athlete<br>\r\nFamily: Mother/Father/Young Brother/Grandmother/Grandfather (Deceased)/Aunt<br>\r\nLove Interest: John Miller</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny look to the stats and was impressed by a bit.  \"Wow...  Look at my profile.  It has every known information out there.  So...  What happens next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn soon started to explain to her on the next part.  \"Now, I need to choose what type of transformation you will go through.  As I stated before, this device has every transformation available and it depends on what I pick.  But on every change, there is an option if you want to keep and change your mentality, clothes, reality and awareness.  I'll leave the first three options off for now, but I'll leave the awareness on just so you can see the changes firsthand.  However, if you want to switch any of those options on, please let me know and I'll do it before change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny rubbed her chin that gave that some thought.  \"I'll bare that in mind when we get the the changes.\" she said in eagerness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn soon asked her, \"So, what changes do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny shrugged her shoulders and answered, \"Hey!  It's your device, I'll leave the choices up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, John went to the remote and turned on all the options of different transformative properties.
