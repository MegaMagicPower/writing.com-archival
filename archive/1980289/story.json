The unseen wind blew across the sky and whisked through Tracer\u2019s brown hair. Tracer swung her legs over the side of the runway that\u2019s located on the top floor of the building. It\u2019s not every day an Overwatch agent gets to sit down and take in the scenery. Yet, Tracer\u2019s enjoyment could only last so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhooey. This is boring. Wonder what the others are up to,\u201d sighed Tracer rising to her feet and dashing off into the interior of Overwatch HQ. The doors slide open sideways for Tracer to enter, however she abruptly bumps into something soft and firm. Two gasped as they fell onto their backs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Watch where you\u2019re going!\u201d a careful voice barked while picking up the scattered cartons. Tracer adjusted her orange visor and rubbed the back of her head, \u201cMy apologies, Mei.\u201d The climatologist too adjusted her classes, \u201cOh, Tracer. Sorry for yelling. I\u2019ve just been so busy working on this experiment that I haven\u2019t had much sleep or food to eat. So, I uh-got a little crabby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d Tracer hands Mei the remain cartons she was carrying, noticing that they are bone-chillingly cold, \u201cSay. What are these cartons of ice cream for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much to say about them since it\u2019s an early prototype. But I can tell you that\u2019s it\u2019s aid for someone entering hibernation. If you come by my lab, I\u2019ll be more than happy to explain more and maybe let you try a little.\u201d Mei waved Tracer off as she headed toward her lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be something to consider.\u201d Tracer turned on her heel and continued walking around the HQ until she found herself in the Technical Bay portion of the headquarters. Here things like Pharah\u2019s Raptora armor and Reinhardt\u2019s hammer were stored and repaired here. Somewhere amongst the room Tracer spotted brief flashing of bright light followed by sparks scattering around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve about had it with this blasted thing!\u201d Suddenly a staff flung across the room right into Tracer\u2019s general direction. Using her quick reflexes, she caught it before she was struck, \u201cHaving a hard time, Torbjorn?\u201d Torbjorn\u2019s grumpy scowl on increased in intensity once he laid eyes on Tracer, \u201cFeh. Like you care, Rookie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can stop saying that. As of last year, I\u2019m only one rank below you.\u201d Asserted Tracer. \u201cYeah. Vell in my eyes you\u2019ll alvays be a rookie.\u201d Torbjorn twiddled his long beard and tapped Tracer with his big robotic claw, \u201cHey, since we rank so closely why don\u2019t you take a gander at Angela\u2019s malfunctioning Caducaus Staff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to blow up on me, is it?\u201d Tracer said suddenly reluctant for catching it. Torbjorn replied all too passively, \u201cI hope so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Torbjorn\u2019s sick sense of humor never gets old.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway. What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d The short and stout engineer rolled his eyes, \u201cAngela mentioned something about Fareeha getting a weird bloated sensation after prolonged use of the staff. The vay I look at it is she\u2019s just using it as an excuse to spend some \u201cquality time\u201d with her. Pheh. Love birds.\u201d Torbjorn shook his head giggling and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps, I could use the opportunity to upstage him. Show him that I\u2019m not a rookie anymore. Then again, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m the type to be messing with Angela\u2019s staff of all things.\u201d Tracer thought, setting the staff down on the work bench and seeing herself out. Around the corner, Winston and Zarya laughed among themselves, \u201cSalutations, Lena.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi. What are you two up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to grab lunch. Zarya here says she can eat as much as me. How\u2019s that for a scientific impossibility.\u201d Zarya snorted, \u201cYou\u2019ll be needing to work on a new theory once I put you to shame. Eating as much as an average gorilla? Not difficult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh-Scientist,\u201d Winston chortled with his massive fangs flashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame difference.\u201d Zarya smoothed her short pink hair, \u201cIf you would like to join us, we\u2019ll be down in the mess hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer folded her hands behind her head and continued down into the lobby of Overwatch HQ. She\u2019s surprised to see how relaxed everyone is today. Probably because there isn\u2019t some big omnic crisis occurring or droves of protestors knocking at their doorstep, \u201cGee. There\u2019s so much going on right now. What should I do with my day?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weighing her options carefully on what was going to do for the day, Tracer eventually shrugged with both hands and said, \"...Eh, why the hell not?\" And with that, she decided to voluntarily assist Mei in her Ice Cream experiment. After all, most people don't know this besides her girlfriend Emily, but Tracer was known to have an adequately sized sweet tooth when she was a kid. Or rather, she was pretty fat as a kid, but she eventually lost the weight as she got older. Tracer couldn't help but lick her chops a little upon thinking of the ice cream Mei was experimenting with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, within the spacious but archived confines of her personal laboratory, Mei-Ling Zhou was currently preoccupied with recalibrating her Cryo Gun, working diligently on some new modifications for her primary weapon of choice, as her emoting flying drone companion, Snowball, was recharging it's batteries from the safety of a nearby charging station, with the blue drone's battery being merely 62% charged and slowly but steadily rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Mei certainly felt right at home in a laboratory at Overwatch HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unbeknownst to her awareness, the mechanical doors that led into her lab automatically slid open, revealing the young spry adult Lena Oxton, better known more commonly as \"Tracer\". Tracer casually walked inside the laboratory, her arms leisurely placed behind her head, as she then noticed a preoccupied Mei. Being quite the talkative Brit that she was, Tracer faced Mei and exclaimed, \"Oy, Mei!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei's reaction was nothing short of being caught by surprise, as she swiftly jumped slightly, accidentally knocking over several nozzle modifications for her Cryo Gun in the process, as they scattered across the pristine tile floor with a clatter. \"Tracer, you scared me!\" Mei said, as she managed to easily calm herself down some, just as Tracer soon apologized, \"Oops! Sorry, love! Didn't mean to give ya a jolt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, uh... That ice cream you've mentioned earlier, Mei. What are you really doing? Ya know, besides hibernation.\" Tracer asked, diverting onto a different topic, as well as being curious about what Mei was doing with cartons of ice cream, while she assisted Mei in retrieving the scattered Cryo Gun nozzles. Shortly after the duo managed to place the nozzles back on the table, Mei turned around to look at Tracer and said, \"H\u00e2o ba (Alright then), Tracer. What do you want to know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot usually the type of person to ponder about the bigger questions in life, Tracer wasn't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed when it came to super highly-advanced science. After all, she was more accustomed as a pilot, not a rocket scientist! So, in an attempt to come up with a reasonable question, Tracer cleared her throat a little and asked, \"...Well, why are you making this super-enhanced ice cream anyway, Mei? Knowing you, you're more into freezing things than anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was mildly offended by Tracer thinking she likes freezing things too much, Mei decided to ignore that last sentence and focused on what Lena asked her. After all, the agile Brit did raise a valid point as to why Mei-Ling Zhou, a well-known climatologist within the scientific community, would divert her research towards ice cream. So, in response to Tracer's question, Mei spoke toward her and explained that....</span></div></div>",

I must finish what my, um...\"late\" comrades and I were researching involving severe weather anomalies.\" Mei bluntly explained, showing a hint of sadness amongst her positive demeanor. Of course, Tracer instantly realized what Mei's intentions were: The Chinese climatologist planned on returning to Ecopoint Antarctica, the very research center where Mei became the only surviving member of her research team after being in cryostasis for approximately 9 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Winston told her what had transpired at Ecopoint Antarctica when Mei reunited with Overwatch, including the names of the 5 deceased members of Mei's research team. Adams. MacReady. Opara. Torres. And Arrhenius. A massive snowstorm hit the Ecopoint, and they lost connection to outside world. And when their food and energy supplies dwindled, Mei and her fellow scientist were left with no choice but to freeze themselves in cryostasis until help had arrived. Unfortunately, almost an entire decade had passed, and the only survivor of the cryostasis was Mei-Ling Zhou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?! But...but why? Why  would you want to go back to the very place where your bloody mates died?\" Tracer asked, confused as to why would Mei ever want to return to the very same research facility where her fellow scientists and friends died, as she witnessed pack a few things in an industrial-sized duffle bag, where Mei then spoke toward the British woman with a calm but stern tone in her voice and answered, \"...It is a manner of paying my respects to the friends I've lost, as well as to make sure our efforts to avert an extremely dangerous shift in the climate were not in vain. Adams, MacReady, Opara, Torres, and Arrhenius...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as she gave a long paused look at the USB drive in her hand, which held all of the accumulated research data gathered at Ecopoint Antarctica, then closed her fingers around the USB drive, exhaling a deep sigh and said, \"...I need to finish what they started. What WE started.\" Upon hearing Mei's determination to complete the research she and her fellow scientists had started, Tracer couldn't help but feel a tinge of guilt, especially since there was a high possibility that Mei was going to do this alone, which didn't exactly sit right with the spunky Brit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Mei!\" Tracer exclaimed, as she quickly grabbed Mei from behind her shoulder, which prompted Mei to look back at Tracer, just as the British brunette then spoke toward the Chinese climatologist and bluntly retorted, \"...I'm goin' with you.\" In response, Mei couldn't help but express a look of surprise, her brown eyes wide open with shock, since she honestly wasn't expecting Tracer to say something such as this. At first, Mei wanted to ask Tracer if she was absolutely certain about accompanying her to Ecopoint Antarctica, but instead, she displayed a grateful smile towards the British woman and said, \"...Thank you, Tracer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, um... No prob', love. Just, uh... Let me call Emily and let her know what's goin' on.\" Tracer replied, which Mei nodded in agreement. After all, she was well aware of how close Tracer and her girlfriend Emily were.</span></div></div>",

Known for being the coldest, driest, and windiest continent on planet Earth, Antarctica was a massive landmass known only for it's freezing temperatures, capable of reaching up to over -81 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as being the only place where only those who were prepared would survive in this wintry wonderland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to one Chinese climatologist and a certain female Brit wearing a Chronal Accelerator on her torso... This was their intended destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mei-Ling Zhou formally announced her plans to return to Ecopoint Antarctica to her fellow Overwatch members, their responses were...mixed, at best. Reinhardt and Zarya were slightly disheartened, since they were going to miss Mei's always positive and optimistic attitude. Pharah was taken aback, since she had barely gotten to know the somewhat plush Chinese climatologist a little more in their brief time together. Mercy showed concern towards Mei's mental health, with both her and Torbjorn agreeing that she has been through much trauma at Ecopoint Antarctica. However, the most understanding of Overwatch's members who were cautious but supportive with Mei's decision were Ana, Soldier 76, Winston, and even Genji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, those who understood what Mei had endured, they knew that she needed to get some closure, both for the research she and her comrades were analyzing, as well as forgiving herself for said comrades' deaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what the entire group didn't see coming, was the fact that Tracer was going along with the Chinese climatologist to Ecopoint Antarctica. And yet, despite such shocking revelations, the members of Overwatch gave their support toward Mei and Tracer's \"expedition\". Unfortunately, due to Overwatch's overall operational status and the limited staff available, Mei weren't allowed to use Overwatch's dropship/mobile command center, the MV-261 Orca, to transport themselves to Ecopoint Antarctica. However, Torbjorn and Reinhardt were able to find, refurbish, and modify a slightly outdated cargo VTOL aircraft, the CTV-362 Albatross. Torbjorn heavily modified the aircraft's hull with heat-sustaining electromagnetic coils, so the VTOL aircraft wouldn't get all coated in frost while in flight, as well as 2 extra fuel cells for those long distance flights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after almost an entire day of flying, Tracer and Mei had finally arrived at their intended destination, Ecopoint: Antarctica. Looking at the research complex from the air, both women could easily see that Ecopoint Antarctica has definitely seen better days. Snow had covered up a decent amount of space throughout the facility, including coating half of the landing pad in a thick sheet of snow and frost. But as Tracer maneuvered the Albatross over to the snow-covered landing pad, the updraft from the aircraft's four jet engines forcibly pushed away most of the snow on the landing pad's tarmac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go, Mei! We're finally 'ere.\" Tracer said, as she landed the Albatross upon the landing pad. From there, Mei looked back at the British woman and replied, \"Tracer, I, um... I just wanted to say: Thank you. For accompanying me here. You didn't have to come with me if you didn't want to.\" \"And yet, I did. You're family, Mei, and family stick together through thick and thin.\" Tracer replied, referencing the Overwatch team as a family, as Mei handed her a snowsuit to wear over her clothes, while she then spoke toward Mei and continued speaking as she said, \"And besides... I joined Overwatch to make a difference in the world for the better, even if it means hangin' out with ya in bloody Antarctica for who knows how long. Oh, and please, call me Lena. Afta all, we goin' to be spendin' a lot of time together, might as well call each other by our real names, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Of course...Lena.\" Mei replied, as she began to equip her snowsuit. Though, whilst she was donning her own snowsuit, Tracer then spoke toward Mei and asked, \"So, about that ice cream you were workin' on... What exactly was it supposed to do, anyway?\" \"...Well, according to my research, the ice cream I've developed is supposed to behave similar to MREs, only much more tasty. If my calculations are correct, the ice cream should be about as filling as a single full-course meal. But then again, I, um... I've never tested this on humans before, so I am unsure what the effects will be.\" Mei explained, as she calmly zipped up the front of her snowsuit overcoat, flexing her gloved fingers in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Tracer couldn't but get a bad feeling churning a little in her stomach upon hearing what Mei had said about the ice cream, but attempted to ignore that bad gut feeling, as she then spoke toward Mei and replied, \"...Well, here's hopin' that you've got more than just vanilla ice cream in those cartons.\" \"*chuckle* I figured you would say that, Lena.\" Mei answered, as she then approached her drone companion, Snowball, waking him up in the process with a sing-song tone as she said, \"Snowball, we're here~\" In response, the little drone opened it's blue digitized eyes, making bleeps and boops as it awoke from it's slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Snowball whirred to life, where he hovered upwards and floated towards a custom exosuit built specifically for Snowball in mind. Apparently, it was built by Torbjorn as an automated cargo loader, using parts from various different Omnics, including some decommissioned Bastion-model sentries. Once Snowball properly connected itself to the cargo loader,Mei pressed a nearby button on the wall, which caused the cargo bay door to open, as it lowered itself onto the landing pad, forming a ramp in the process. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But then, just as she was about to accompany Mei and Snowball into the Ecopoint Antarctica facility, Tracer suddenly heard her cell phone ringing, blaring out the ringtone she used when her girlfriend Emily would be calling her. So, in response, Tracer swiftly went for her pants pocket and grabbed out her phone. \"Lena, is everything alright?\" Mei asked, now aware of the persistent ringing of the Brit's cellular phone, just as Snowball used his loader arms to carry a few crates full of ionic batteries for Ecopoint Antarctica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's fine, love! Just Emily giving me a call to see if I'm alright. Don't worry, Mei. I'll catch up with ya and Snowball, just go on without me.\" Tracer answered, which Mei easily understood. After all, she had the privilege to meet Tracer's girlfriend Emily last Christmas, so of course the Chinese climatologist understood Emily's concern for Tracer. So in response, Mei nodded in understanding toward Tracer and replied, \"I understand, Lena. After all, we're most definitely a long way from King's Row. You go ahead and talk to Emily, Snowball and I will be heading inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mei!\" Tracer exclaimed, waving at the Chinese climatologist and her adorable robotic companion as they entered the facility through one of the research complex's main entrances. From there, Tracer proceeded to answer her girlfriend's call, as she placed the cell phone against her left ear and said, \"'Allo?\" \"*relieved sigh* Oh thank god! You had me worried, Lena. Why didn't you pick up sooner?\" Emily asked, relieved to hear the sound of her girlfriend's voice over the phone. But as she rubbed the back of her head with a bulky gloved hand, Tracer spoke back toward Emily and answered, \"*giggle* Sorry 'bout that, Emi. Mei and I just got 'ere when you called me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*semi-depressed sigh* ...You know, I'm really going to miss you, Lena. I mean, the apartment's going to become a bit more lonesome without you around to liven things up.\" Emily said, already missing her beloved Lena Oxton, especially since her girlfriend was now in the middle of Antarctica. However, knowing Tracer, she was the sort of person who would definitely brighten up someone's day, especially Emily's. So, in response to her girlfriend's lonely mood, Tracer spoke toward her with a tone of positive enthusiasm and a slight hint of romantic flirtation towards the redhead woman and replied, \"Aww! I miss ya too, love! But don't worry, what I'm doin' now isn't as life-threatening as goin' up against someone like, say, Reaper or Doomfist. Remember when I fought against that bloody Widowmaker to stop her from killin' Mondatta? You were sooo worried 'bout me I swear you were gonna 'ave a heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with good reason, Lena! That Widowmaker woman almost killed you back in King's Row.\" Emily retorted, where she then calmed downed some by taking a few deep breaths. Of course, she didn't blame her beloved Lena for being so reckless in the first place. After all, Lena is simply just doing her job as an agent of Overwatch: To protect the innocent and to avert any crises, whether they be natural or man-made. And as her girlfriend and lover, she had every right to be concerned for her safety. After taking a moment or two to calm her nerves, Emily then continued to speak toward Tracer and said, \"*sigh*...Look. Lena, I understand that your line of work will take you to many dangerous places, but... While you're there in Antarctica, far away from home, just... Promise me you'll stay safe out there. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Tracer thought that Emily was a little too overprotective, Lena understood that her girlfriend had a very good reason to be worried for her, where the British brunette exhaled a sigh and answered, \"*sigh*...Alright, Emily. I promise.\" \"Thank you, Lena. That means a lot coming from you.\" Emily said, reassured that Tracer solemnly swore to keep herself safe while she was in Antarctica. From there, Tracer fired back with a positive yet flirtatious remark toward her redhead girlfriend as she quipped, \"Anytime, love. And who knows? Maybe Mei and I will have you spend a week or two down 'ere durin' Christmas. Think about it: A snowy tundra in the background, you and me snuggling together on the couch, watching some Rom-Com Christmas movies. It'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily couldn't help but express a cheeky grin on her face upon hearing such a delicious prospect. After all, she was somewhat of a sucker for a Rom-Com movie or two, as she then spoke up and replied, \"*chuckle*  Yeah, definitely can't wait for that.\" From there, Tracer knew that Mei will probably need her help inside the research facility, so she then spoke toward her girlfriend and said, \"...Well, it sounds like I better get goin', love. Mei might need me to help her with some.... \"Science-y stuff\".\" \"*sigh* I understand, Lena. Just be sure to call me once in a while to let me know that you're okay. Alright?\" Emily retorted, just as Tracer then quipped, \"You betcha, Emi! And besides, if all goes well, I might be able to call ya on Skype. Ciao!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Tracer ended the call with her beloved Emily, as she placed her cell phone back in her snowsuit pants pocket, then proceeded to grab some of her luggage, and walked out of the Albatross, only to be greeted by the chilling antarctic weather. This caused her teeth to chatter instantaneously, as she quickly began to rub her gloved hands together while she walked towards the entrance to the Ecopoint Antarctica facility, speaking to herself as she muttered, \"B-Bloody hell! H-H-How does M-Mei even c-cope with these t-t-temperatures?\" Eventually, after struggling with the cold, Tracer finally made it inside Ecopoint Antarctica, as the large automated industrial doors slid and closed shut behind her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that she was inside Ecopoint Antarctica, Tracer couldn't help but stare in amazement and awe at how vast and spacious the research facility was. Long, clean pristine hallways around every corner, a comfy and spacious Recreation Room, and much more. In all honesty, it was a little overwhelming for Tracer, considering how this place was so big that there was a chance she could get lost in it's labyrinth-esque layout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her, she had someone who knew the research complex's every nook and cranny: Mei-Ling Zhou. So shortly after taking in everything the facility had to offer, Tracer figured that she might as well find Mei and see what's needed to be done first, as she shrugged some and said, \"...Well, looks like I better find Mei, considerin' how huge this place is.\" From there, Tracer proceeded to walk down the hallway to her left, noticing the wet spots on the floor in the shape of boot prints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that those wet boot prints might be Mei's, Tracer instinctively followed the trail of boot prints, hoping that it could lead her to Mei. However, as she made her way through the facility, the British brunette unzipped her snowsuit overcoat, giving her some much-needed air, since she was getting a little hot and sweaty now that she was inside a heat insulated research complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after almost 20 minutes of walking through the facility, Tracer managed to reach the end of the boot print trail, which stopped at a closed automated door. \"Hmm... Maybe Mei's in there.\" Tracer said to herself, as she then approached the door, knocked on the metallic door 3 times and said, \" Mei? Are ya in there? It's me, Lena!\" A moment or two of silence passed by, until Tracer heard Mei's voice, which sounded muffled due to the Chinese climatologist was on the other side of the door as she answered, \"I'm in here, Lena. The door's open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Tracer witnessed the steel door automatically slide open by itself with a loud hissing noise, which revealed both Mei and Snowball as they carefully loaded most of the ice cream cartons into several industrial-sized refrigerated containers. However, it was there that Tracer noticed that Mei was no longer wearing her blue snowsuit and white overcoat. Instead, she was now wearing a stretchy pair of sky blue pajama pants, which easily showed off Mei's plush curves, along with wearing a pair of fuzzy Yeti slippers on her feet. On her upper body, Mei was wearing a blue tanktop underneath a white fleece sweater with an emblem of the 2066 Summer Olympics brandished on the sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished storing the enormous supply of ice cream cartons, Mei then turned around to face Tracer and said, \"Lena, why don't you take off your snowsuit? You're looking a little...winded.\" Obviously agreeing with the pajama-wearing climatologist, Tracer then stripped herself of the snowsuit's insulated confines, breathing a sigh of relief in the process. However, instead of wearing the trademark Overwatch outfit she usually wears, Tracer was currently wearing a red and black, buttoned up plaid shirt, which had it's long sleeves rolled halfway up Tracer's arms. On her lower body, the British brunette was now wearing a loose fitting pair of dark orange fleece sweatpants, along with a pair of cotton white socks on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*pant* *pant* Sorry, luv. Its just that these were the only clothes I could find at the time that were \"climate-appropriate\".\" Tracer answered, doing an air quotation gesture with her hands when she said \"climate-appropriate\". After all, it was Mei who highly recommended that the British brunette bring some clothes that were suited towards colder climates. But unfortunately, due to Tracer's... \"Unique\" condition, as well as her work at Overwatch, she never exactly went out to do much shopping for wintertime clothes, so she had to make due with what she found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, I guess that makes sense, considering that we were mostly preoccupied with preparing for this trip. But anyway...\" Mei replied, as she then pulled out two of the cartons filled with her experimental ice cream, placing it on the table in front of Tracer and continued speaking as she said, \"...I've figured that since we haven't eaten anything in a while, we might as well try some of my experimental ice cream.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could even utter a single word, Tracer's flat stomach began to growl profusely, causing her to blush a little in the process. After all, she hasn't eaten anything since they took off to Antarctica, so of course she would be starving for something edible. So, in response to her stomach's explicit betrayal, Tracer took one of the two ice cream cartons, pried open the lid to make sure that it was her preferred ice cream flavor (which happened to be chocolate), then looked back at Mei, who held out an ice cream scooper in her hand towards Tracer. \"I figured you might want this.\" Mei retorted, where Tracer the grabbed the ice cream scooper out of Mei's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Tracer used the scooper to dig up a good enough scoop of Mei's experimental ice cream, then plopped the ice cream into her famished mouth. At first, she tasted nothing, but once the ice cream touched her tongue's taste buds, Tracer felt this sudden explosion of chocolate-y sweetness in her mouth. In her mind (as well as the blissful expression on her face), she almost felt like a kid in the candy store. But as the ice cream melted in her mouth, Tracer began to eat more of the experimental ice cream, whilst Mei used her tablet to monitor the microscopic Nanobots inside the ice cream, as a small collective of them now squirmed around inside Tracer's body, monitoring every minute detail, from her vitals, to her blood pressure, to even her metabolic rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Tracer WAS consuming some experimental ice cream, so of course there had to be some form of scientific protocol and watchful oversight in such matters, especially if they have the words \"EXPERIMENTAL\" written all over it. And besides, Tracer was no stranger to having experiments performed on her, since she was originally the pilot who was supposed to fly the experimental Slipstream Jet fighter that Overwatch created.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A wise man once said these words: \"Time flies by when you're busy.\" And those words of wisdom couldn't be farther from that truth, especially for the likes of Overwatch members Mei-Ling Zhou and Lena Oxton. For the first few days they've spent at Ecopoint Antarctica, both Mei and Tracer mostly prioritized on repairing some of the more damaged parts of the research facility, including replacing the broken windows at the Main Observatory with a brand new set of durable plexiglass windows, along with getting rid of any residue snow that laid there in the exposed parts of the complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when they were not busy fixing up and renovating parts of Ecopoint Antarctica, Mei and Tracer would usually spend some of their free time on numerous forms of entertainment, ranging from playing online co-op games on Mei's brand new PlayStation 10 video game console, to watching a few classic movies from the early 21st century on Demand, to even binge-watching some of their favorite television shows on both Netflix and YouTube Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, over the course of two slow weeks, there was a slow but noticeably drastic change to both Mei-Ling Zhou and Lena Oxton. Or rather, to be more specific: A drastic change to their waistlines. At first, the first couple of pounds weren't too noticeable. But when Tracer went onto a scale to check her weight halfway through the second week, the British brunette was shocked to see that her weight had skyrocketed from 143 pounds (Her original weight, since she had a good amount of muscle on her fame), to almost a whopping 200 pounds! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, Tracer had this lithe but somewhat voluptuous hourglass physique, which was the ideal body type that could make any man's head turn her way. But now, after almost 2 weeks of eating almost nothing but Mei's experimental ice cream, Tracer's body ballooned outwards from being thin but curvaceous, to becoming downright chubby, where it was slowly creeping it's way into Fat territory. In appearance, Tracer now sported a plump and small but noticeable paunch of a belly, along with subtle but clear signs of a muffin-top perched just above her waistline, both of which always made themselves noticeable underneath the British brunette's soon to be snug clothes. However, while Tracer's belly and muffin-top were noticeable, it was actually her lower half that stuck out like a sore thumb. Her hips had ballooned outwards significantly, easily becoming 2 feet wide in diameter, as they would often sway from left to right with a slight jiggle in their rhythm. Though out of all the different sections of her body that received a noticeable amount of cellulite and adipose, Tracer's butt and thighs were easily the most affected parts of her now plump body. Each of Tracer's buttcheeks were now easily the same size as a fully inflated basketball, whilst her thighs were now so thick with body fat she occasionally swore that the inner parts of her thighs were rubbing and touching one another. Fortunately for her, the only part of her body that was plumped up that Tracer considered a positive were her breasts, as they had grown from a D-Cup to a Triple D-Cup. Finally, the only part of her body that had the least amount of cellulite was her face, which became slightly fuller, while her neck slowly began to show signs of growing a small double chin. Overall, Tracer's now chubby physique had become pear-shaped, resulting in thicker thighs, wider hips, and a fatter butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that wasn't to say that Tracer was the only one packing on some blubber, for Mei was also gaining a fair bit of weight as well, only the fat that accumulated onto the Chinese climatologist's body primarily focused around her belly and breasts, with her hips, legs, butt, and head being secondary in that regard. Although, despite packing on some winter weight, both Mei and Tracer were still surprisingly healthy as they were in their previous sizes, possibly due to Mei's experimental ice cream (as well as the Nanobots inside said ice cream) having unique chemical and medical properties that allow one's body to remain healthy without the negative side effects that go hand-in-hand with obesity, such as higher blood pressure and cholesterol levels, Diabetes, and the increased chances of cardiac arrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Ellsworth Land Region, Antarctica--<br>\r\n--Ecopoint Antarctica--<br>\r\n-October 19th, 2076-<br>\r\n-11:45 am, CST-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright, so there we were, Mei and I were fightin' against this fatty Psychopath, Darlene. She tries to ram into Mei on a scooter, but BLAM! BOOM!! RATTA-TATTA TATTA!! I save her arse from gettin' skewered by that lady's bloody spork!\" Tracer exclaimed, as she divulged on what had transpired in her and Mei's latest co-op session on Dead Rising 3: Remastered Edition for the PlayStation 10, which involved the British brunette and the Chinese climatologist confronting the morbidly obese, scooter-riding, and gluttonous Psychopath, Darlene, by talking to her beloved redhead of a girlfriend, Emily, via Skype-V connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Well, it sounds like you were having quite a fun time over in Antarctica, honey.\" Emily answered, glad that her beloved Lena Oxton wasn't too bored during her stay in Ecopoint Antarctica. After all, knowing Tracer, Emily had hoped her beloved British brunette would find something to occupy her time with, which usually came in the form of video games. Of course, with a clear abundance of free time on their hands, this resulted in Mei and Tracer creating their own YouTube channel, known as \"Zhou &amp; Oxton Let's Play\", which consisted of mostly video games that have co-op in them, ranging from \"First Looks\" at different games that have been recently released, to even fully-fledged playthroughs of such games, like Dead Rising 3: Remastered Edition, for example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, Zhou &amp; Oxton Let's Play have been on YouTube for approximately an entire week now, and was noticeably gaining a growing fanbase as a result, especially since the online community is perfectly aware that they're members of Overwatch. Of course, the money Mei and Tracer have received from the hundreds of thousands to nearly a million of viewings their videos have gotten mostly went toward either buying the essential supplies to help refurbish and sustain Ecopoint Antarctica, or to support their comrades back at Overwatch HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is, but... *sigh* It feels a little lonely here without you, love. I mean, yeah, I have Mei here to give me company and all that jazz, but... I wish you were here as well, Emi.\" Tracer explained, wishing that Emily was right next to her so she could kiss her on the lips. So, in response, Emily displayed a tender caring smile on her face, where she spoke toward Tracer and said, \"I know you do, sweetie. I really miss you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even though she still deeply cared about the British brunette, Emily was already aware of Tracer's increased softness and girth. At first, the redhead tried to play ignorant and naive towards her lover's unintentional weight gain when she first saw it over their previous Skype-V session a week ago. But now, it was definitely too hard to ignore for Emily, as Tracer's plump paunch of a belly pooched out a tiny bit over the waistband of her dark orange sweatpants, which were now looking a little snug these days. So, shortly after exhaling a deep breath, Emily then spoke toward the now chubby Tracer and said, \"Lena, honey... I, um... I-I have a confession to make.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emi? Are ya alright? What's wrong? Wait... You're not seeing someone else... Are ya?\" Tracer asked, becoming increasingly worried about her beloved Emily, especially since the British redhead looked like she needed to get something off her shoulders. So, in an attempt not to get her girlfriend so worked up over such ridiculous accusations, Emily spoke back toward Tracer and replied, \"What?! No, No!! I'm not seeing anyone else, Lena! But, um... The truth is...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Note: This is my personal rendition of Tracer's girlfriend, Emily. However, this means there will be a high chance that some of Emily's backstory and personal life will most likely be considered non-canon. Anyway, Enjoy!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um...I-I'm actually into chubbier women, Lena. I'm what they would call a \"Chubby Chaser\".\" Emily hesitantly explained, clearly displaying a deep red blush of great embarrassment on both her freckled cheeks. After all, this was sort of Emily's biggest secret (no pun intended), and she just revealed it to her beloved Lena Oxton. So of course, in response to such a kinky revelation coming from her redhead girlfriend, Tracer couldn't help but open her eyes really wide in surprise, along with her slightly fuller cheeks becoming a little flustered in the process, as well as being somewhat speechless for a moment or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lena? LENA!!\" Emily exclaimed, which quickly snapped Tracer out of her speechless stupor, prompting the British brunette to respond back as she muttered, \"...Erm, wha? Sorry, Emi. What did ya say?\" \"*sigh* ...I said that I'm a Chubby Chaser, Lena Oxton.\" Emily bluntly replied, her tone mixed between slight annoyance and sternness, especially since she had to repeat what she just said towards Tracer to get her point across. Fortunately for the redhead, Tracer was able to comprehend what she had confessed, which caused Tracer to cock a left eyebrow in confusion, as she then spoke toward Emily and asked, \"...A Chubby...Chaser? Well, what the bloody hell is a Chubby Chaser?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstandably, Emily figured that her girlfriend had obviously never even heard of the words \"Chubby Chaser\" before until now. So, as she calmed herself down some, Emily then spoke toward Tracer and explained, \"...Lena, honey... A Chubby Chaser is someone who happens to be attracted towards, um... \"Larger\" women.\" \"...Sorry, love. Ya lost me.\" Tracer replied, becoming just a tad bit more confused, as she scratched the side of her head a little in response. However, the gears in the British brunette's mind began to turn, where she soon inevitably realized what Emily was talking, causing Tracer to bluntly exclaim, \"...Wait a minute: You're into fatties?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Emily gave the plump British brunette a firm nod in confirmation, while the redhead still had a blush on her freckled face. From there, Tracer began to bombard her beloved girlfriend with a question or two as she asked, \"...But why? Why keep this all a bloody secret from me, Emi? Ya know I would do anythin' to make ya happy.\" \"I know you would, Lena. It's just that... I didn't want my kinky fetish to get in the way of your job as a member of Overwatch. I mean, you travel around the world to keep it safe, and that doesn't leave much room for you to settle down and pack on the pounds for little ol' me.\" Emily explained, still displaying an adorably embarrassed blush on her freckled cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... No matter what my preference of women are, sweetie, I... I'm truly glad I fell in love with you, Lena Oxton.\" Emily confessed, where she pressed her right hand against the monitor screen, while Tracer did the same with her right hand, as if they were touching one another, despite the harsh reality that both lovers were thousands of miles apart. \"*depressed sigh* ...I really wish you were here, Emily McKnight.\" Tracer said, truly wishing that her redhead girlfriend was down here in Antarctica with her, just as Emily nodded in agreement with the plump British brunette and replied, \"...So do I, my dear Lena. So do I. Who knows? Maybe I'll be visiting you sooner than you might expect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in an attempt to lighten up the mood between her and Emily, Tracer decided to divert onto a different topic, where she spoke toward the redhead and asked, \"So, um... I heard that you were commissioned by D.Va to make her a Fursuit for a movie she's gonna star in. Any chance you can tell me what that's all about?\" Of course, Emily was well aware of what Tracer was talking about. After all, she's made a promising career as a Costume Designer, specializing in making custom-made Fursuits, especially since the trend of Furries have been gaining popularity and momentum since 2067. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response to her girlfriend's question, Emily calmly spoke toward the chubby Tracer and answered, \"Oh that? ...Well yes; I have been working on a custom Fursuit for D.Va. From what I remember, the Fursuit that D.Va will be wearing is for a Drama slash Comedy film she's starring in. I believe it's called \"Guys, I Turned Into A Furry!\" The Fursuit she'll be wearing will rely heavily on state-of-the-art animatronics, which will be enhanced slightly by some CGI for that added effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Well, I bet it sounds like it's gonna be a smash hit at the box office, Emi.\" Tracer replied, becoming somewhat intrigued with the movie's premise. However, while Tracer was talking with Emily...</span></div></div>",

Can you come over here for a moment I'm having...er...difficulties...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Mei!\" Tracer called out over her shoulder before turning back to Emily on the Skype call. \"Be right back love,\" Tracer said, blowing a kiss at the screen before turning around and strutting out of the room. Normally she would have blinked, but now that she knew Emily's 'preferences\", she experimented with a new form of flirting by giving Emily a view of her enlarged thighs and butt on the way out. A happy little sigh from the other end of the call indicated it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was out of the room Tracer blinked her way to Mei's location in the Ecopoint's communications lab. Spotting the speedy over-watch agent, Mei gave a friendly smile that accented her new double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Mei? Trouble with the relays again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, not quite,\" Mei said, placing a hand on her belly. \"I uh, tried to reach for one of the communicators hanging up and I...forgot how narrow the workbenches are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...\" Tracer realized, looking down at Mei's girth wedged in between the narrow workbenches. Like Tracer, Mei had not been spared the effects of that experimental ice cream, but unlike the speedster who arrived here skinny and was now on the cusp of being called fat, Mei-Ling Zhou was already plush when she showed up and was undeniably a tubster now, probably pushing around three hundred pounds of Chinese climatologist. Her comfy pajama bottoms were filled to the breaking point with the blubber on her thighs and butt and she was beginning to grow bingo wings on her flabby arms, but by far the greatest recipient was her enormous buddha belly, too big for any of her shirts to contain without exposing her belly button and bouncing up and down with every step she took. It hadn't been the first time Mei's belly had gotten her caught somewhere, and Tracer couldn't help but wonder if she'd have a similar issue with her hips somewhere down the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily because it was happening more often, Tracer and Mei knew how to handle getting stuck somewhere, and with a bit of squeezing and pressure Tracer managed to pop Mei out from between the shelves like a wobbly, overweight cork, one whose belly stopped jiggling long after the rest of her did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Lena...whew...\" Mei sighed. \"I need to pay more attention to where I'm trying to fit into,\" she added with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yeah,\" Tracer replied, sounding a little distant. Mei frowned, having picked up enough of the speedster's social cues after weeks of streaming  and working together that Mei could tell when she was unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter, Lena? Emily's not in any trouble, is she? I heard you were talking to her just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, we're fine,\" Tracer reassured her. \"It's just...well, Emily told me she liked me like this.\" Mei looked a little lost until Tracer patted her wide hips and pudgy tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily's a chubby chaser?\" Mei asked. \"Well, I guess that's fortunate the ice cream had this effect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but...\" Tracer sighed, warring with the new emotions inside her. \"I'm...glad I guess that Emily likes me as a big gal, and I don't mind getting bigger for her, but...\" She sighed again, unable to find the right words to say, as Mei reached over and put a comforting hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...really miss her,\" Tracer admitted at last. \"She means everything to me, and...if this is what she likes, I want to go all the way, but not without her, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I can offer a suggestion,\" Mei pondered. \"I was thinking of flying someone over for Thanksgiving dinner next month and staying until New Years. If Emily is up to it I'm sure Winston would be happy to write her a pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer's eyes widened with excitement as she started bouncing on her heels. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the experiments are running smoothly, so I don't see why we can't have company over,\" Mei confirmed, a smile crossing her face again and making that double chin even more apparent. \"It can be like a winter vacation double date, it'll be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer let out a high pitched squee and blinked into a hug with the flabby climatologist, thanking her profusely as she spoke at a rapid-fire pace about how much this would mean to her and Emily. Mei, for her part, gave her a pat on the back as Tracer pressed herself even deeper into her pillow-like blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better go tell Emily!\" Tracer suddenly realized, breaking off the hug and letting Mei's bulk fall back into place. \"Thank you again, Mei, so much!\" And with that, Tracer blinked out of the room and back to her Skype chat with her girlfriend to give the good news, but Mei had barely turned back to her workstation when Tracer reappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double date?\" Tracer asked with a hint of mischief delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double date, Mei,\" Tracer repeated herself. \"You said a winter vacation double date.\" Mei immediately broke out in a sweat as she realized what Tracer was talking about, who drew in closer upon realizing she said the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you inviting to Thanksgiving?\" Tracer demanded in a domineering but friendly way. Mei swallowed, turning red as a tomato and darting her eyes back and forth to find an escape route, but Tracer immediately blinked over and gave her a light shove, jamming her back in the narrow workstation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...Lena!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna get you out til you tell me,\" Tracer said with a grin worthy of a trickster god. \"Who's your new squeeze? Is it someone I know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei squeaked defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it Mei, I wanna knooooow!\" Tracer began spouting off names. \"Is it Morrison? Angela? Brigitte? That muscular Russian lady with the pink hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-her name is Zarya!\" Mei insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA!\" Tracer shouted in triumph. \"I knew it, you're always so shy when she gets brought up! You finally asked her out?\" Mei, defeated, nodded her head once and Tracer practically danced for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crikey, I'm so happy for you!\" Tracer said gleefully. \"You two are gonna be the cutest couple EVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't go telling everyone!\" Mei said, blushing like crazy at Tracer's infatuation with her love life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I at least tell Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph, spoilsport. I'm gonna go tell her you have a cute date to show her when she arrives here for Thanksgiving though!\" And with that, Tracer blinked her way out of the room. Composing herself, Mei took a deep breath and tried to leave the workstation, only for her belly fat to squeeze up against the narrow tables and stick fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena!!!\" Mei shouted. \"Y-you forgot to get me unstuck!\"</span></div></div>",

As their little gaming channel increased in popularity, a suggestion from D.Va encouraged the pair to try out a Mukbang, hanging out and chatting with their fans or catching up on news related to gaming and the Overwatch organization while eating increasingly larger and larger meals. After the massive success of this first session they began to have mukbangs almost as much as extended gameplay sessions, and of course as things escalated, there was an equal amount of eating in both of them. Fans were sending in recipes and foodstuffs for the pair to try out and comment on as well as donations for Overwatch and the Antarctica station. By the time Thanksgiving was a week away, the pair had practically been eating like it was Thanksgiving most days anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the effects were not unnoticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...anyway, that's our take on the latest Assassin's Creed game, everyone!\" Tracer announced to the stream, happily munching on a giant foreign candy bar. \"We'll be taking a break for the Thanksgiving holidays, but we'll be returning with our biggest mukbang ever when we get back, and we want YOU to decide what we have for that little session!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow the...<i>munch</i>... link below the video...<i>mmff</i>...to vote,\" Mei mumbled through mouthfuls of the greasy cheeseburger she was stuffing her face with at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as always, like and subscribe if you want to see more of us!\" Tracer said with a wave at the camera. \"Cheerio!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Z\u00e0i ji\u00e0n</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the stream went offline, Mei unleashed a belch that she had been holding in, a loud guttural expulsion that sounded nothing like the soft-spoken climatologist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you should have ended with that,\" Tracer joked. \"That was a beaut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll save it for the next mukbang,\" Mei said dryly, stifling a second smaller belch. \"Help me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, gimme a sec...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to get to her feet, Tracer extracted herself from the beanbag chair she inhabited during play sessions, enjoying the feeling of her body wobbling from the movement. Tracer was only gaining for Emily and not because she had any vested interest in getting fat, but she had to admit being so plush was pretty fun. She had to swap out her usual accelerator harness for one that mounted the device on her back because the old one was too constrictive of her brand new breasts and of course she was generally slower and less agile then before, but besides those small issues she was greatly enjoying this. In the time since she extended the Thanksgiving invitation to Emily, her form had blossomed considerably, with her wide face sporting two new chins draping over her thick neck and her paunch and muffin top blooming into a great round beach-ball that hung over the front of her short shorts. Those short shorts were necessary though because, as expected, her lower half bore the brunt of her new weight. Her hips had begun to struggle to fit through some of the doorways at the arctic station, and her thighs had grown to the size and thickness of tree trunks, perpetually rubbing together and jiggling with even the smallest movement, and of course her colossal butt, extending out behind her so far that she could set items on top of the shelf of her fat, a shelf that bounced wildly with every slow ponderous footstep Tracer took. All that blubber meant that Tracer's wardrobe consisted of tiny shorts and tank-tops and pretty much nothing else, though a fan had sent her an extra extra large button-down shirt and a tent-like pair of leggings for her to wear for the big Thanksgiving dinner with Emily after she split her shorts open on stream after a particularly excessive mukbang session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, up you get Mei!\" Tracer said, grabbing onto Mei's flabby forearms and, with herculean effort, helping to pull her weight out of the confines of her own plush beanbag chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...thanks Tracer,\" Mei said, licking the remains of her cheeseburger from her thick little fingers. Tracer's attempts to gain for her girlfriend may have pushed her to a heavier weight faster then usual, but Mei was still undeniably the fatter of the two. While not possessing Tracer's prodigious backside, she still carried enough weight in her hips and rear to test the limits of two chairs when she sat down, and the rest of her still dwarfed Tracer's weight in a lot of respects. A ring of flab joined her cascade of chins flowing down to her flabby chest, definitely bigger then the jumbo jugs Tracer carried nowadays, and her arm fat, when it wasn't tearing her sleeves from sheer girth, was threatening to swallow up her elbows, not unlike what Tracer's thighs were threatening to do to her knees. But the real star of the show, so to say, was Mei's mammoth of a gut. The thing was a monster that fell down in rolls out the front of her shirt, to the point that Mei had long since stopped trying to cover it up and just let it hang out just over her knees. It was so big and stuck out that Tracer often wondered (or perhaps fantasized) that the old, skinny Tracer could maybe have used it like the bean bag chairs they sat in during their streams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better get ready, actually,\" Tracer said with a huff. \"Zarya and Emily should be arriving any moment now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...right...\" Mei agreed, waddling off after the speedster and making sure to turn at the right angle to avoid getting stuck in a tight doorway. Again. By some miracle the pair managed to get themselves dressed and ready by the time they heard the Albatross engines roaring overhead. Making their way there at a steady pace, Tracer teased one of the buttons on her tightening shirt as she waited impatiently for her girlfriend, hoping she would like the new changes she went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never been this nervous in my life,\" Mei commented, letting out a soft burp thanks to her stomach being jostled by her bumping into it with her thick legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine, just be yourself and have fun,\" Tracer said, encouragingly patting Mei on the shoulder, who popped a seam in the sleeve closest to Tracer as Mei turned to give her a thankful smile. Suddenly aware of how tight her shirt and leggings were, Tracer put on a little bit of speed and made it to the hanger just in time to see...</span></div></div>",

Amazingly, there was a brief moment where Emily didn't spot her in turn, thanks to the animated conversation she was having with the Russian bodybuilder and war hero Aleksandra Zaryanova, bedecked in her usual winter gear and favorite ushanka to fight the cold temperatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mei-Ling! You are looking radiant!\" Zarya suddenly announced, bounding over to the obese climatologist, who was blushing like mad thanks to her long time crush complimenting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you,\" Mei said, stumbling over her words as her wide multiple-chinned face turned tomato red. \"I'm...so happy you could come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As am I!\" Zarya said, laughing mightily. \"I've always wanted to see what Overwatch's antarctic outpost was like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can show you around, if you'd like!\" Mei said eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e!</i> I would love that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer watched with satisfaction as Mei ponderously turned around and started to lead Zarya at a slow, lumbering pace out of the hanger, already going into great detail about the finer points of the architecture and engineering. The Russian bodybuilder looked genuinely interested in everything she had to say, only interrupting to take hold of Mei's tubby hand in her own before they wandered off together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*thunk*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer turned back to her girlfriend, whose suitcase had dropped from her hand after it remained limp for quite some time, the culprit being Emily's utter shock at Tracer's new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...whoah...\" she stammered her face flushed a bright pink. \"Y-you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A big girl now?\" Tracer suggested, giving a little giggle and turning on her heel to show off her massive rear end and the leggings just barely containing their incredible width. This was all too much for Emily, who threw aside her belongings and ran up to tackle her enormous girlfriend, sending her giant rump crashing to the ground as she began kissing and groping every inch of the Overwatch speedster's incredible bulk that she could reach. Tracer laughed as she wrapped her meaty arms around Emily, prompting a pleasurable gasp and giving Tracer an opening to plant a kiss on the side of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can't believe you did this for me Lena...\" Emily said, tears welling up in her eyes at the sheer emotional overload running through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you, love,\" Tracer cooed. \"I really missed you.\" Emily had no response other then to give her beloved girlfriend a deep, sensual kiss, which Tracer happily returned with gusto and kicked off another furious make-out session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how muchof a big beautiful woman are you, anyway?\" Emily asked, kneading her girlfriend's giant belly with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Mei's old scale sorta broke under us a while ago...\" Tracer remembered, causing her girlfriend to give another happy little sigh. \"There's a big industrial weighing thingy in the hanger though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, let's see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping her elephant-sized lover to her feet, Emily watched Tracer waddle over to where the industrial scale was set up, enjoying the sight of her tremendous rear end bounding up and down with every calculated footstep. With a metallic groan, the speedster ascended the scale and paused to get a reading. \"Blimey!\" she exclaimed. \"Two hundred fourteen kilos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wear it well,\" Emily said seductively, reaching around and gently continuing to knead the rolls of fat surrounding Tracer's expansive hips. \"This is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever, I just know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to be, love. You're here, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Thanksgiving itself rolled around and the two girlfriends were beginning to make themselves at home, it became clear that-</span></div></div>",

Pressing herself against the bathroom wall for as much leverage as she could get, she inhaled as deeply as she could and finally felt the button slip into place at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Still fits!\" Emily announced in triumph, running her fingers gingerly across the incredibly tight garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didja say something Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena, I-\" she began to say, but the moment she turned around to look at her massive girlfriend filling the doorframe, two of the buttons on her blouse pinged off, bouncing against the metal walls with a pair of soft *<i>klinks</i>*. \"BOLLOCKS!\" Emily swore, angrily tearing off the now ruined garment. \"That was my favorite blouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a spare that doesn't fit me anymore,\" Tracer suggested helpfully, waddling off towards the wardrobe. Emily sighed, looking towards the cracked bathroom scale in the corner of the room. She didn't need it to know she had put on a whole stone this past week, perhaps even a little more, and while next to Tracer and Mei this seemed laughably unimpressive, it was a sign that those two and their constant eating and fattening was starting to rub off on her. Why did that freaking ice cream have to be so delicious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go Em, I think this one's still good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Emily didn't bother to get a good look at it before taking it and putting it on. Far roomier then her last shirt, Emily looked at herself in the mirror with incredibly mixed feelings. The cream colored blouse did look good on her, but it did nothing to hide that new belly pooching out of her front. Kneading the roll of fat with one hand, Emily sighed as Tracer walked in behind her, taking up the entirety of the mirror as she rested her chins on Emily's shoulder, creating a tingling feeling of attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting fatter,\" Emily said in a deadpan tone, lifting up the small roll of fat and letting it drop an inch or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you're an absolute porker, you are,\" Tracer teased, wobbling her hips back and forth in her back end. \"Fattest person I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena, please,\" Emily pleaded, her cheeks turning pink from her girlfriend's seduction. \"I like seeing flab on other girls...I'm not so sure about myself.\" Tracer frowned slightly, then turned her head to give a soft kiss to the side of Emily's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing can change the way I feel about you, love\" Tracer cooed softly. \"You can be the size of a baby elephant and I will still love you with all my heart.\" Emily's heart soared at those words of reassurance, and she reached around to caress her girlfriend's flabby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, Lena...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really can still pick me up!\" Mei said excitably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Zarya said, gently lowering the massively obese climatologist onto the bed. \"You're still only halfway to my record after all. Though I admit carrying large woman is not same as carrying large weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei giggled, her chipmunk cheeks turning pink. It may have seemed odd to onlookers that the geeky Chinese scientist and the pro athlete and war hero Russian got along so well that they were girlfriends, but they really did go together like peanut butter and jelly at times. Mei adored hearing Zarya talk about her exploits of strength and heroism and in the same way Zarya was endlessly intrigued by Mei's research and what she did at the station. One thing they both loved talking about though was video games; Zarya was an early subscriber to Mei and Tracer's Lets Play channel and had only just started trying out some classic titles, with her personal favorite being the all time classic Dark Souls because of its intense challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mei sat on the bed in her voluminous white blouse and slacks, her belly hanging nearly to the floor as she watched Zarya finish putting her formal military uniform on, she couldn't help but compare her relationship to the long term one Lena had with her girlfriend Emily. Mei and Zarya weren't quite as sensual with each other as the two brits were, mostly limiting their PDA's to kissing and snuggling to share warmth but she still felt the two were incredibly close. When they held hands and talked about the things that they loved, Mei could feel herself falling in love with the athletic Russian superstar, and when they locked eyes Mei thought, and hoped, that Zarya felt the same way about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I need to visit the tailor!\" Zarya laughed. Mei looked over to see Zarya flattening out the front of the uniform and noticed a prominent bulge around the waist and the hips that looked far different from the muscle that was usually bulging through her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Mei said, realizing what the culprit must have been. \"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what, me putting on weight?\" Zarya smiled, going over to Mei and sitting on the small end of the bed that Mei didn't fill up. \"You said that your ice cream would keep us healthy, <i>da</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do not worry about it,\" Zarya said, smiling proudly. \"It is long vacation, I might as well enjoy myself, and if that means getting a little bigger, <i>\u0427\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you need to be...mobile, I mean?\" Mei said cautiously. \"For your work in Russia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can diet and exercise any time,\" Zarya said dismissively. \"I would rather spend my time here with you.\" Mei turned red as a tomato as her emotions went into overdrive at that statement of affection and immediately leaned forward to try and kiss her, struggled to move close enough through her fat. Zarya gave a warm smile and leaned forward to meet her halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crikey, what a spread!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the women converged on the table set up for Thanksgiving dinner (by a handful of helper robots, thank you very much Snowball and friends!), they realized it was indeed quite a spread. All the usual trappings were there, the turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce, with a few Russian and Chinese delicacies sprinkled into the mix, but the real head turner was the size. All the food here could feed a dozen people on a good day, and only four people were going to partake in this feast. It's no wonder that Tracer and Mei had ballooned to the size of hippos if they considered this a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the calm before the storm, Mei and Tracer lumbered over to their seats, forgoing chairs in favor of sturdy metal benches that would adequately support their weight as the gorging began in earnest, while Emily and Zarya took seats next to their girlfriends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you two could come,\" Mei announced as a preamble to what was to follow. \"It's been a wonderful week having you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy to be here,\" Zarya said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad we could come over,\" Emily said gratefully. \"I'm sure Christmas will be fun too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I hope so!\" Mei said brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we waiting for, loves?\" Tracer said, picking up her knife and fork with a look of intense delight on her face. \"Let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that they were off, and while Zarya and Emily started out a bit more modestly, the speed at which their girlfriends began their feasting revealed just how shameless they were about how big they got. Rather then scooping it out onto a plate, Tracer had tipped an entire container of stuffing and turkey onto her plate while Mei had cut out the middleman entirely and pulled over a pot of mashed potatoes to eat out of directly with the big ladle. Emily tried to focus on her own food as she was quite hungry, but she kept being torn from her own meal to watch the two big girls engage in increasingly wanton acts of gluttony, from her girlfriend sucking down a row of sausages to Mei taking a straight hit of gravy after biting off a massive chunk of Turkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you call that eating?\" Zarya said with a smirk, pushing her own plate aside and grabbing onto a whole bowl of sweet potatoes and beginning to stuff them into her face. \"This is how you go all out!\" The Russian's competitive nature had pushed her into gorging as blatantly as the two other girls were, leaving Emily alone as the sensible one, and her resolve to remain that way was deteriorating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stared at the delicious, delicate cooked turkey sitting within arms reach, just begging to be picked up and torn into like a wild animal. As the decision tempted her, the new pot belly she sported weighed heavily in her lap. Letting her mind wander, she pictured what would happen to her if she gave in like this. She pictured herself getting bigger, popping the buttons off her shirt as her belly surged into her lap. She imagined the feeling of splitting the backside of her pants as her thighs bloomed outward, the feeling of shattering chairs underneath her growing rear end. And at last she pictured the two of them together in a massively huge bed, her arms wrapped around as much of her beloved Lena as she could reach. She saw herself the same size as her girlfriend, overflowing with flab and rolls and multiple chins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and it looked so hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme that turkey!\" Emily shouted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Thanksgiving came to a close and the Christmas season began in earnest, fans of the \"Zhou &amp; Oxton Let's Play\" were treated to an early Christmas gift as their two favorite streamers returned to the online world with a gut-busting mukbang session that included two very special guests; the esteemed Russian hero Aleksandra Zaryanova herself and Emily <i>*convenient alarm noise blocking out the audio*</i>, prompting a spiffy rebranding to reflect the new roster after a successful first video; \"Ecopoint Gang Let's Play\". Some grumbled at this unwelcome change, fearing the chemistry between the two classic hosts would be overshadowed by this foreign superstar athlete and Tracer's adorkable main squeeze, but the worries quickly melted away as the fans got to know the two newcomers better. Zarya's presence even began to attract a sizeable foreign audience to the stream, meaning Overwatch and the Ecopoint mission were getting more donations then ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only change that followed, of course. Lena and Zarya's arrival meant that space needed to be made to make sure everyone had room, and the four of them decided that it was the perfect opportunity to overhaul their little living space deep in the antarctic wastes. Armed with an army of drones and robots, the four of them knocked down old walls and set up new ones in the spacious hanger/living area Mei and Tracer spent the better part of a month in, turning the whole place into a finely tuned complex, with areas like a new space for all the gaming and streaming stuff, a lab where Mei could perform research on her experimental ice cream, a crafting area where Emily could continue her work on fursuit commissions, and of course a large and incredibly well-stocked kitchen for the ever-increasing mukbang sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last section was notable of course because as the Christmas holiday went into full swing, more and more of the time spent by the four girls revolved around eating. Mukbangs became so frequent that fans started to complain about how there were more videos with them eating, so the four of them simply began eating copious amounts of food during the gameplay sessions, often integrating it into the challenges that were voted on by the fans. And all that eating, fueled by competition, love, and science to various members of the Ecopoint Gang, had a highly predictable effect, necessitating the installation of a brand new industrial scale, one that projected numbers on the wall and not on the scale itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer looked at the scale with a trembling excitement as she ran her hands all over her body, crammed into an ill-fitting tanktop to cover her breasts and little else and the stretchiest pair of shorts she could find. All of this began as something Tracer did for her girlfriend, sure, but as she got fatter and fatter Tracer found she was really starting to enjoy the sensation of eating and getting bigger. She liked that her breasts swelled to be larger then her head, she liked how her belly collapsed in rolls down her crotch, but most of all she couldn't get enough of her ridiculous rear end, which had quadrupled in size and had started to stick out behind her like a shelf, paired with an egregious set of thunder thighs and hips that would brush the sides of double doors. Slapping each cheek with both hands and sending them on a jiggling rampage, Tracer finally stepped up onto the big scale, imagining her fat feet spreading across the cold metal surface as it groaned to support the massively obese speedster. There was a small ping as a number was projected on the wall, making Tracer's eyes light up with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" she shouted, throwing big flabby arms busy overflowing her elbows into the air. \"Fifty one stone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knew you had it in you, Lena,\" Emily said proudly, handing over a salad bowl full of ice cream for Tracer to gorge herself on. \"You're getting bigger and hotter every day,\" she cooed, petting the side of her almighty rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not the only one, get on up and show me how big you're getting!\" The massive speedster waddled to the side to let Emily through, who looked at the scale with as much excitement as Tracer did a moment ago. Since that fateful Thanksgiving Emily became hooked on the idea of getting fat and while she wasn't the size of her incredibly sexy girlfriend just yet, she was on her way. Emily's gain was a mirror image of her girlfriend's, oddly enough, with much of her weight concentrated in her upper body, especially her breasts. Those melon-sized sweater puppies entered rooms before she did now, and were growing so fast that Emily resorted to stretchy Christmas sweaters instead of bras to keep modest. She'd started wearing her hair back to show how thick and wide her face and neck were getting and her meaty arms wobbled with every tiny movement she made and filled her shirt sleeves like sausage casings. Slipping off her comfy shoes, Emily took a ponderous step onto the scale and waited, experimentally pushing against her belly to find out if she could see anything below her belt past that colossal mound. Tracer let a low whistle as the display popped up, and Emily's face heated up when she looked up at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty three stone, wow!\" Tracer said admiringly. \"You sure know how to pack it in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I learned from the best and biggest fatass in the world, didn't I?\" Emily said seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you have anything to say about it,\" Tracer said, catching onto what she was up to. \"You're so fat now, I bet you'll start getting caught in doors and breaking chairs.\" Boy if that didn't get Emily all hot and bothered, nothing would. Almost on instinct, Emily pushed herself up against her girlfriend's bulk and reached out to start kneading Tracer's mountain of chins. The speedster moaned softly as Emily ran her meaty fingers all across her face and thick neck, tipping backwards and falling on her butt with a ground-shaking thud, Emily falling on top of her waterbed of a belly with a giggle.</span></div></div>",

As a large woman herself (admittedly in a different way then she was now), Zarya had always been a proponent of a confident self-image and being happy with one's own appearance and body, and it pleased her to see that the two Brits were embracing that idea fully, and in more ways then one. And seeing how Zarya was getting big all over nowadays, it was a message that she embraced as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still regularly lifted weights to maintain her incredible strength, but the muscles have long since been padded and covered up by layers of jiggling adipose, making her thick arms and legs even thicker and unable to fit into most shirts and pants, hence why Zarya was walking around nowadays in a tank top and shorts that were on the verge of splitting open at the thigh. There was no muscle in the jelly belly that hung out the front of her shirts and over her waistband nowadays or the ring of fat surrounding her wide face, but Zarya still had to admit there was something...alluring about the way her belly swayed back and forth at times. She loved the feeling of being big and powerful, and she was getting bigger and bigger every day. Who could complain about that? Mei certainly wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, did another flavor finish up?\" Mei asked as Zarya entered the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, some sort of berry flavor,\" Zarya said, lumbering over to a large mechanical pump in the center of the lab and slotting the barrel into the empty frame. \"I am glad your formula works on other foods. I was beginning to get slightly bored of the ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I figured since the formula was working as expected the next step would be to diversify the food selection. Milkshakes were the next logical step,\" Mei mused, typing away at her little workstation. \"Thanks for helping me out with this, I'm used to doing all workand building myself, but it's a little tough to move around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it was, at least for the Chinese climatologist. The whole Ecopoint Gang may have been fattening up, but she was still the reigning queen as far as weight was concerned. Sitting sprawled across her massive metal bench, Mei-Ling Zhou had morphed from a belly heavy fatso to an absolute blob, bearing a massive blubbery gut that dominated her figure and nearly touched the ground even in the rare instances where she was standing up. Enormous breasts the size of pumpkins fell to either side of her great belly, and down the center descended a ring of neckflab as big around as a large pizza, stacked with quite a few chins that dropped from Mei's incredibly wide face. Her joints had long since vanished, swallowed up by her thunder thighs and bingo wings, and her butt rivaled her massive chest in size and would have counterbalanced her if not for the great big belly cascading down her front. There was absolutely nothing about her that was thin and lithe anymore; even her feet were much too fat to wear her shoes and she needed a new keyboard with bigger keys that her sausage fingers and padded palms could use effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, test number one,\" Mei announced, picking up a long tube that fed into the device Zarya stuck the barrel into. Sticking the nozzle into her mouth, she released a level and the machine started pumping out milkshake, Mei happily guzzling down the dosage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, that's...working...\" Mei said, sounding distant. \"Might want to...try some...more...\" Putting the nozzle back in her mouth, Mei released the lever again and just kept drinking it, getting lost in the incredible flavor and the pleasure of eating. Zarya, smiling, sat her big butt down next to her and picked up the second tube to start drinking down the milkshake with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could gorge themselves again, one of Mei's consoles buzzed, shocking her out of her reverie. Her eyes widened with surprise at the notification, though she wasn't surprised enough to stop drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Zarya asked. Mei took a great big gulp of milkshake and pointed at an alert indicating...</span></div></div>",

How would they have even gotten here.\" There was a wet plop as Mei extracted the feeding tube from her mouth and tossed it over her thick shoulder before shifting her bulk and moving up to her screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me pull up the camera feeds....<i>h\u00f9nzh\u00e0ng</i>!\" Mei swore under her breath as her chubby fingers selected three options at once. Slowing down to precisely select the options, the screens in front of her suddenly filled with shots from the security cameras outside the base, with one noticeable exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to this one?\" Zarya asked, pointing out the one display that was made up of gray static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camera five...that's on the other end of the base,\" Mei realized, glancing down at her enormous belly hanging over her knees like an apron made of bread dough. \"Gonna be weeks before we can get over there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll head over there and investigate!\" the Russian war hero announced, triumphantly jumping to her feet so quickly it made her belly bounce and forced out a small little belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay, but be safe Alex,\" Zarya leaned over with some effort and gave her blob of a girlfriend a kiss on the cheek, both of which flushed red on contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, darling. I am still the strongest woman in the world, after all!\" Turning on her heel, Mei watched her girlfriend wobble out of the room, her heart fluttering with every heavy wobble of her monstrous rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly are,\" Mei swooned, pawing around her shoulder for the feeding tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go <i>chica</i>,\" someone behind her said, picking up the tube with her slender fingers and handing it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" the climatologist said thickly, suckling down on her berry milkshake again. It took a few seconds before her eyes shot open with surprise and she yanked the tube out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! ALEX!\" Mei tried to shout before something prodded her in the nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flicker of purple light as the cloaking field dropped, revealing the neon-purple garbed hacker Sombra grinning wickedly in her face, her usual jacket replaced with a thicker woolen coat in the same color scheme with an oversized hood. Perfect winter wear, more or less. It took may a second to notice the light-footed hacker was perched on top of her belly like a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hola gordita!</i>\" Sombra greeted her in a mockingly friendly tone. \"I've been following you and your buddy's streams, can I get an autograph?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" Mei demanded, wobbling back and forth helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I guess it's true what they say, don't meet your heroes.\" Sombra held out one hand and pressed a few hexagonal buttons in midair, broadcasting the stock sound effect of an audience going \"Awww!\" as she pretended to wipe away a tear. Mei heaved back and forth, her stubby arms reaching outward to try and grab at the Talon agent, only for Sombra to lean backwards out of her reach, stifling a large phony yawn. Giving one last lurch, there was a sudden snap as the bench Mei overflowed couldn't take any more punishment and broke cleanly in two. Both of the girls toppled over, Mei landing in a great wobbling heap that refused to quit jiggling for some time and Sombra bouncing away, laughing like a hyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You broke your bench!\" she nearly shouted, doubled over with gleeful howling laughter. \"You're such a fatass you broke a heavy duty bench! Oh my god, this is so freakin' funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei tried to move again, but the burst of energy and the fall took a lot out of her so she merely stood there as Sombra collected herself and got to her feet, prancing over to Mei's workstation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice little setup here,\" Sombra said. \"Almost as good as my setup. Makes things easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you even doing here?\" Mei demanded in between great heaving breaths and trying to get to her feet, an utterly impossible task at her size. \"What does Talon want with our fundraising operation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, if I wanted your charity funds I could have done it from home,\" Sombra said patronizingly as she started rooting through all of her files. \"I just want your data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What data, on the ice cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and everything else,\" Sombra continued, finishing up her searching and using her hacker suite to put the finishing touches. Turning to face Mei, Sombra leaned against the console and inserted a purple USB drive into the slot on the mainframe and pressed one last button that flashed a large purple loading bar on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're stealing all the data in the system!\" Mei exclaimed in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you realize just how valuable all of this data is, not just your Overwatch files but everything you and your little climate research team was working on,\" Sombra went on. \"I couldn't get to it when this place was abandoned, but now that everything's turned on again, <i>feliz navidad</i> to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd seriously risk breaking in here and stealing all our data with Overwatch agents running the place?\" Mei said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did make it easier by gorging yourself senseless,\" Sombra said, prodding the edge of the belly flowing across the ground with her big toe. \"I just had to wait til the Ecopoint Gang got too big to move and I could just walk out of here with your data, and I must say you played your part wonderfully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna get away with this!\" Mei said weakly, prompting another chuckle from the elite Talon hacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had a peso for every time I heard that I wouldn't need to be stealing your data,\" Sombra said, watching her download finish up and unplugging the flash drive, putting it in her front pocket for safekeeping. \"However, because I'm a nice girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-Mmph!\" Mei grumbled as Sombra leaned over to stick the tube back in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your little desert, chica,\" Sombra said with a light wave. \"<i>Adios</i>!\" As she turned away, leaving Mei as little more then a helpless blob sucking down her milkshake, a large figure suddenly appeared, filling up the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in here?\" said...</span></div></div>",

You're that hacker, Zamboni!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's....how do you even get that from...<i>madre dios</i> just move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to go through me to get out of here, hacker chick!\" Emily declared raising her fists defensively. Sombra gave a shout of laughter at the sight of the fatty looking for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, <i>chica</i>, you think a whale like you has a chance against an expert Talon agent like me? Why don't you go back to your fursuits like the good little creep you a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Wham!* *Pow!*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra was too busy being amused at the situation to defend against a hard punch to the gut, followed by a slap that sent her spinning. Coming to a stop and holding her jaw tenderly, the hacker stared at her opponent in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I started taking self-defense courses when I began dating Tracer years ago, so she wouldn't have to worry about me being kidnapped or hurt by bad guys like you!\" The heavily overweight brit revealed with pride. Enjoying the look of surprise on the hacker's face, Emily lowered herself into a sumo stance, stomping her foot and holding out her arms in preparation for a big fight. Sombra, flicking a strand of purple-dyed hair out of her face, reached into her pocket and revealed a small device like a remote control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't need to worry about getting hurt, then,\" the hacker sneered at her. \"I'll just translocate out of here first, and I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shrill whistle as something flew from the ceiling towards the pair of them. Sombra dodged to the side as Snowball the robot zoomed onto the scene, popping a little claw out the bottom of his chassis and snatching the remote from the hacker's unguarded hand, dropping it in Mei's padded palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Snowball!\" the blobby climatologist said, fist-bumping the robot's little claw with her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give that back you lardass!\" Sombra tried to dive on top of Mei's belly, but was smacked aside as Emily charged in like an out of shape rhino, the weight of each step making Mei's blubber wobble. The hacker leapt to her feet and aimed a kick right at Emily's monster boobs, which made her yelp and back off. Sombra tried to use the chance to run past her and escape but was clothes-lined by a very fat arm as Emily swung her bulk around and flung Sombra into her arms, restraining her in a headlock with her funbags resting on either side of the hacker's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so tough without your little toys, are you?\" Emily taunted, only to pause as she felt something cold and metal poking into her belly. Releasing her grip, Emily took a step back and raised her arms in surrender as Sombra, red-faced, and shaking in rage, pointed her SMG at Emily's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" she spat, snapping her view to the blobby climatologist. \"Give that device back or I'm gonna fill this fatty full of holes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIKE BLOODY HELL YOU WILL!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trademark electronic whoosh sound echoed after that shout as Tracer suddenly blinked into the room, the fat caked all around her form plopping down around her. Sombra barely had time to react before Tracer blinked again, colliding with the Hacker and launching her right into Mei's pillowy bean bag belly. Shell-shocked by the powerful blow, Sombra blinked and caught sight of the purple shade of the trans-locator, so tantalizing close, clutched in Mei's palm. With a feral yell the hacker launched herself onto the massively obese climatologist and tried to rip it from her, her chaotic shriek drowning out Zarya's returning footsteps. Mei, utterly shocked, held onto the device with a death grip as Tracer and Emily tried to pull the hacker off her, but Sombra was driven by desperation and was too much for even them to handle, even the mighty Zarya who was hampered by her bulk versus Sombra's lithe form. Emily barely managed to pull Sombra's fingers out of Mei's many layers of flab before she was kicked squarely in the double chin and knocked back into Mei's milkshake device, one of the feeding tubes plopping down on her shoulder. Having a sudden epiphany, Emily smiled, desperately clinging onto a sudden idea that was too crazy not to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET...OFF....ME...YOU...AAArumf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra's eyes widened in surprise when Emily launched herself around her neck, not to try to pull her off but to jam some sort of tube into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it on full blast!\" Emily shouted. \"HURRY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer dashed for the controls but Zarya had a more expedient solution, ripping off the flow regulator with brute strength. The milkshake container, still half full despite Mei's feasting, drained like a sieve, flowing down the pipe into Sombra's mouth. She relaxed her grip to try and get the tube out, letting Emily and Tracer pull her off Mei and toss her against the wall. The four of them watched as Sombra fidgeted to try and remove the tube, but her resistance quickly faded as the flavor of Mei's new and improved formula hit her, making her go cross-eyed and slide to the floor. As the Ecopoint gang caught their breath, they watched as Sombra's belly inflated before their eyes, snapping off her belt and beginning to droop over her waist. As the tank gave an airy hiss upon emptying, Sombra's face slackened, letting the tube fall out and clatter to the floor. She opened her mouth, probably to swear at the group, but the only thing that came out was a monstrous, window-rattling belch, followed by a seam splitting and her brown watermelon of a belly popping out of her jacket into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey...nice job gang,\" Tracer huffed. \"Anyone up for a snack before we call back home?\"</span></div></div>",

Things have been rather busy.\" Shivering slightly, Mercy drew her overcoat around herself a little tighter as she watched Soldier 76 personally lead away Sombra in handcuffs, flanked by a small squad of Overwatch foot soldiers. Her expression was a mixture of cool fury and nausea, not helped by that overstuffed gut of hers hanging down like a sack full of water from her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't....<i>*brraaaaap*</i>...hold me forever, Over-<i>*bwuuuurp*</i>-watch,\" Sombra insisted, her threatening tone undercut by her frequent belching. \"I'm gonna...<i>*uuurp*</i>...get....that data....someday! <i>*hrup*</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, get moving punk,\" Soldier 76 ordered, gruffly shoving her forward with the butt of his gun. The defeated hacker tottered slightly but kept on moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have known better then you send you two up here on your own,\" Mercy said, wringing her hands with concern. \"If Talon's agent had succeeded, or worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we handled things pretty well, all things considered,\" Mei pointed out. \"Plus having Alex and Emily along was pretty good protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex? Oh, right,\" Mercy said, noticing Zarya give her girlfriend's meaty hand a little squeeze. \"I take it your research has been successful then, Mei-Ling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, very!\" Mei said excitably. \"I've finally been able to work out all the bugs in the formula and apply it areas outside their intended use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides using it as a handy disabling weapon in a pinch,\" Tracer giggled, thinking of Sombra again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now that it's finished...I think it's time to put Antarctica to rest,\" Mei admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?!\" the other three girls chorused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we just finished setting things up, didn't we?\" Emily pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did, but....well, I've been working with my old team's research for so long. All my research has been trying to rebuild and reclaim what we lost...and my old friends,\" Mei admitted, a tear rolling down her fat cheek. Mercy placed a comforting hand on Mei's shoulder as the group gathered (slowly) around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll always miss my old friends and team...but I think I've been frozen in the past for too long Doctor,\" Mei continued, steeling herself. \"It's time I looked to the future and start to push forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very mature of you, Mei-Ling. I'm proud of you for coming this far,\" Mercy said, practically glowing with affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have gotten this far without my friends,\" Mei admitted, her big cheeks turning pink from the vulnerable confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me,\" Zarya said, wrapping her arms around the expanse of Mei's girth and kissing her on the neck folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and my wonderful girlfriend, the strongest woman in the world,\" Mei giggled, nuzzling into the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't forget us!\" Tracer interrupted. Not even waiting for an answer, the two Brits quickly wrapped themselves around Mei's form, Tracer struggling to wrap around her upper body while Emily threw herself onto Mei's belly directly. Tears were streaming down the faces of all four of them, their affection for one another was so great. Even the stoic Mercy couldn't help but shed a couple tears at the sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Crack!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment was ruined somewhat when the reinforced chair Mei perched herself on gave way, unable to handle the tonnage of all four members of the ecopoint gang. Ice cream scoopers and cartons went everywhere as the girls fell over themselves, with Mei falling straight down with a tremendous boom and the other three bouncing away, their clothes bursting at the seams from the sharp drop. As a chorus of belches rose from the Ecopoint gang, Mercy picked up one of the discarded cartons, dipping a finger into it and sampling the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, you were right, it is quite good,\" Mercy commented. \"Now, about we address the elephant in the room.

Tracer dashed out of the room at supersonic speed, returning a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did a quick lookabout, something just conked out in the generator room, luv,\" Tracer explained. \"Can't tell what but somethin' was smoking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, big circular beast, smack dab in the center.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei's eyes widened with worry at this revelation. \"That...that's the heating unit.\" Turning back to her notepad, she flicked through a couple pop-up menus before producing a hologram of the room Tracer just explored, the generator in the center of the room flashing emergency red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that's not good news,\" Tracer pointed out as Mei frantically searched through more readouts and menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's bad. Very bad,\" Mei said. \"The central heating unit is faulty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't we have backups?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei was interrupted by another shudder from above, followed by another mechanical wind-down. A second of the holographic generators turned red and flashing, and Tracer suddenly felt a distinct chill in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-but when the main unit collapsed, it dumped everything onto the backups before they were ready. It'd be like if I dropped a heavy weight into your arms without you expecting it. The same thing is happening here, and its shorting out the heating units.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey...but it's below zero out there!\" Tracer nearly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About fifty five below, to be exact,\" Mei calculated as a third generator shuddered to a halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we gotta hurry and get a flight out of here!\" Tracer stammered, already beginning to see her breath on the air. She regretted with every inch of her being that her last meal would be a nice cold helping of chocolate ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't be able to g-get on board and out of huh-here before we f-fur-reeze to d-death!\" Mei said, her teeth chattering out of fear and the chill of the room. \"W-we only have one o-option; sh-sh-shut the whole thing down, let Sn-snowball run the auto r-r-repair on the generators, g-g-get them up in f-f-few days, tuh-tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-g-great idea!\" Tracer shot back sarcastically. \"B-b-but what about us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-hurry, b-blink us to the backup c-cryochamber room!\" the climatologist demanded, gripping onto Tracer's arm with an ice-cold hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...C-cryochambers. Are you sure?\" Tracer asked, well aware of Mei's particular history involving that particular piece of technology. How bad was the situation that Mei was the one recommending this option?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sn-snowball can let us o-out when it finishes!\" Mei hurriedly explained. \"GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Tracer went, her blink's slowed somewhat by the unfamiliar weight tugged along at her arm. Poor Mei clutched at her chest when they appeared in the room, gasping for air as she hurriedly punched in some numbers on the keypad in front of the cylinders. Two of them hissed and shot open, one on either end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer didn't need telling twice, leaping into her own tube as Mei leapt into hers. As the chamber sealed around her, leaving only the sound of Tracer's frantic breathing and pounding heartbeat, she suddenly felt rather lightheaded. There was a tingling sensation in her arms and legs as her heart rate slowed dramatically; she tried to say something, but her words came out slurred and incomprehensible. She felt her arms go limp at her side as her head flopped against the comfortable headrest, feeling too heavy to move. Her last thought before her eyes drifted close was how yummy that ice cream was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of their frozen chambers, Snowball immediately set to work, scrambling a small fleet of robots from the cargo jet as well as his exoskeleton to help fix the heating. The obedient little robot worked diligently, unfettered by the hours rolling by as he organized the repair teams and occasionally checked on Mei and Tracer in the cryonic chamber. The little robot zoomed through the hallways, his sensors never picking up the occasional trails of black smoke snaking their way through the halls. The robot turned a corner, and one smoke trail congregated as the skull-like mask of the Talon agent Reaper ascended from the ground like a specter. Seemingly unaffected by the cold, he snarled at where the robot was, his hand drifting to the shotguns beneath his cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a STEALTH mission, Reyes,\" Moira chirped in over the headset, predicting his thoughts to a T. \"Don't cause any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to,\" Reaper growled, drifting towards the cryochamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. The date we're going to be stealing is invaluable to our efforts. I'd hate for you to explain to Doomfist how you lost it because of an icemaker. Now finish the mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaper groaned again, shrugging it off as he sunk into the ground, his smoke trail drifting under the doorway and re-materializing him on the other side, where a certain Mexican hacker was working the main controls, her slender form packed into a thick thermal suit and a devious smile curling her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got the data yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Una momenta,</i> Reyes,\" Sombra said, rolling her eyes. \"I'm taking care of these two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not here to kill them,\" Reaper growled, indicating he didn't like that idea much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not, I'm 'taking care of them'. Here, look at this.\" Sombra stepped aside, presenting the view-screen to her partner in crime. \"There's a whole slew of biotech and medical equipment built into these things to help maintain the health of whoever is inside. It's a bit hard to crack open, but it's easy to trick the computer into thinking someone else is in the tubes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaper did so, peering at the names indicated.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Pod 11: Lena Oxton</span> Con: Stable<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Pod 6: Mei-Ling Zhou</span> Con: Stable</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaand....\" Sombra announced, clicking a few times on the keypad. \"Voila!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Pod 11:</span> <span class=\"cviolet\">Aleksandra Zaryanova</span> Con: <span class=\"cred\">Dangerously Underweight, adm.

She dropped like a sack of potatoes, tumbling down the stairs that descended to the cryopods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's our loose end tied up,\" Moira said with an air of finality. \"I'm surprised you kept her on after she botched the Volskaya mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ingrate has her uses,\" Reaper grumbled. Punching in a couple numbers on the keyboard, he drifted over as the cryopod Sombra landed in front of opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not leave a corpse,\" the Talon agent explained, hoisting the hacker over his shoulder before chucking her roughly into the pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not worried that she'll give things away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The brat's paranoid to a fault, and we've been feeding her false info for weeks,\" Reaper revealed out, sealing the pod behind him. \"If Overwatch wants to deal with her, they're welcome to it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After what felt like a few minutes at most, a buzzing sounded in Tracer's ear. Mumbling slightly, she tried to reach for an imagined alarm clock before remembering where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, the pods,\" she mumbled. \"Ugh, I'm starved...\" Relieved when the pod finally opened up, Tracer stepped out, a little unsteady on her feet, stretching out her back. Perhaps because she was coming back into a warm environment after nearly freezing to death a few days ago, but she seemed to feel a little slower then usual. Hard to say why, maybe she just needed to get active again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Mei is still in her pod?\" Tracer said to herself, pondering the unopened pod waiting to emerge. \"I know, I'll prep some ice cream for her! Breakfast in bed sorta thing!\" Thoroughly pleased with herself for this idea, Tracer zipped down the corridor, giving Snowball in his exosuit a high-five mid-dash, and ended up back in the kitchen right where the two had left off. Licking her lips at the thought of more of that ice cream, she opened the fridge to dig around a bit. As she decided which flavor to break out, she leaned against the side of the fridge, feeling a bit tuckered out from her dashing earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, cryopod freezing ain't exactly a day at the spa,\" Tracer chuckled. \"Bet it'd be a good way to work off a few-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer smacked at what she thought would be a solid set of abdominal, but felt her hand bounce off something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-extra pounds?\" Tracer looked down and nearly shouted in shock at something pink and fleshy hanging out the bottom of her shirt. It took her a split second to realize the mass was her stomach, looking like she swallowed a deflated basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn disbelief, Tracer zipped down to the bathroom for a look in the mirror and almost doubled over in shock. A great big belly, pouring from her once slender frame was indeed there and very real. As she experimentally prodded it, Tracer became aware of other parts of her that were bigger as well. Her arms seemed to have more meat to them, and her chest seemed to be straining a shirt that was quite loose over her upper body before. Even her face looked thick and healthy, her once slender jawline melting into a round apple shape, complete with an extra chin if Tracer looked the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey,\" Tracer exclaimed, turning around to see her butt in the mirror, which had swollen to chair-overflowing proportions. \"I look like a mini-Roadhog!\" Running her hands up and down her thighs experimentally, Tracer gave an involuntary shudder at the sensation, but quickly brushed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder if this is some sort of cryopod freezing side effect,\" Tracer pondered. \"Maybe I can ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shriek sounded from down the hallway. Tracer clapped her hands to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer quickly dashed back to the cryochamber, noticing how sluggish she was compared to her old self now that the truth was revealed. Scared for her life as to what may have happened, Tracer burst into the cryroroom...and smacked right into something big, fleshy, and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lena!\" Mei said thickly. \"What...happened to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddaya.....BLIMEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Tracer was a mini-Roadhog, then Mei was clearly Roadhog proper. Tracer tested the limits of her comfy winter wear, but Mei had exploded out of hers, reducing her sweater to a bra and her pajama bottoms torn to ribbons by her new girth. And what a girth it was; a new buddha belly hung from her front, dropping downwards to knees that sunk into succulent layers of thigh and leg fat. Her arms were overinflated bingo wings that could barely reach all the way down her belly, and her voice was heavy and thick like pudding thanks to the ring of neck fat that added onto Mei's rather wide face and features. Said face was white with shock and confusion as she took heavy steps forward, her giant gut pitching with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-something happened to the cryochambers!\" Mei revealed. \"We're both too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should hope not,\" Tracer replied, failing to stop herself before she took a handful of Mei's adipose and jiggled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LENA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It looks squishy and fun to wiggle,\" Tracer said with a laugh in spite of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to...huff...focus!\" Mei said, already losing her breath as she waddled around the small room she had begun to fill.</span></div></div>",

In fact, why was she even gung-ho to step in and help with somebody else's work? It just seems like wasting time she could spend relaxing. Why did she get bored of that again? Tracer spun on her heel and made her way back to the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the elevator doors opened a loud hissing accompanied by thick purple smoke filled her lungs. Tracer coughed, gagging for air. The possibility of doing a Recall didn't occur to her until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Mmm. Mnn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena Oxton opened her eyes. The absence of her orange tinted visor tipped off that something was wrong. Well that and the unfamiliar surroundings. The atmosphere felt sinister and unfriendly unlike Overwatch HQ. The color scheme of this room is off-white like a hospital room. There is also a bed and a standing photo of a man beside the bed. Tracer\u2019s vision is a little too blurred to make out who it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally. My little Cherie is awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer shook. The cold, whispery voice blew ice in her ear. Thin cold fingers wrapped around her jaw and forced her eyes on the captor. \"Whe-where am I?\" Her vision cleared enough to make out the figure standing over her. Purple skin reflecting the low internal temperature, long legs wrapped in a suit fitted for combat, and soulless yellow eyes  piercing into Tracer\u2019s brown eyes, \"Amelie?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that name means nothing to me. It\u2019s Widowmaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny attempt to strike Widowmaker or at least escape are denied by all four of her limbs being tied to the chair. Recalling would do nothing, but keep Tracer in the position she's been at. The situation currently reads as Lena Oxton is bound to a chair at the mercy of Widowmaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you take me here?\u201d Tracer barked unable to disguise the panic in her tone, \u201cAre we in T.A.L.O.N.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidowmaker looked down at Tracer, her fingers still holding her jaw. The emotionless icy stare Widowmaker had sent shivers down Tracer\u2019s spine, \"Don't consider where you are T.A.L.O.N. headquarters, but rather my parlor, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as Overwatch knows I'm missing their going to bust down your door guns a blazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not worried about that. All your communication devices are jammed by the interference signals. Calling your little friends would be a waste of effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to sound like a compliment. Ever since you joined Overwatch you\u2019ve single handedly been the biggest pain in T.A.L.O.N.S. ass. Too many of our operations have gone off the rails because of your participation.\u201d In a rare moment of actual humanity, Widowmaker furrowed her brow, just slightly, incidentally making her look less scary. \u201cI\u2019m especially talking about the day at the museum.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWidow took her hand off Tracer\u2019s chin and walked out of view, \u201cSo, I\u2019m going to do all of T.A.L.O.N. of favor and get rid of you. However, simply killing you wouldn\u2019t bring me joy, I\u2019d rather see you suffer instead. By popping that Chronal Accelerator off of you. Seeing as I needed some kind of special device to remove it off of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! No! Please!\" Tracer rattled in her seat. Trying to tilt it over, but Widowmaker held it in place. \u201cI have a theory that if you become so large the damn thing will snap right off of you.\u201d With that Widowmaker shoved something inside of Tracer\u2019s mouth that started her experiment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to find out!\" She said with a blank face, \u201cI\u2019m practically giddy with excitement!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Widowmaker put in Tracer's mouth?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You almost knocked over my mum's picture of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLena winced slightly as she noticed said picture-frame much farther back from the edge of the table since she left this morning...Emily must've pushed it all the way back to avoid future incidents. She took two big steps over and slid it closer to it's original position, patting it gently on the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry! I always feel like I'm later than I am, chronal disdainment and all that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chronal <i>disassociation</i>, sweetie.\" Emily corrected, a slight smirk as she rested her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that.\" Tracer frowned a bit and lifted her orange goggles off her face, taking a closer look at the old photo--not even old, it was only about six months old. Emily's mother had taken it on their third anniversary date, but something felt a little off between then and now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot a quick and subtle glance at Emily, cherubic cheeked, thighs touching, warm-as-a-fireplace, and then looked back at the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds for the penny to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw, no, couldn't be...could it?</i> Tracer thought, taking another good look at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did look a little fuller around the edges, at a second glance. Her chin was definitely a little softer, with a more pronounced, sagging chest and the slightest hint of a potbelly...Lena was a little curious how her bum looked now too, but that was a question for later. The question for now was: did she really put on this much weight in just six months? Tracer used her generally scattershot memory to the best of her ability, thinking back to what had happened the last few months. Her promotion...Emily getting that job at the chocolatier shop...she had to work late on recon...Em talked about needing to order out more since Tracer hated eating leftovers, and cooking for one was no fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnecting all the dots together, it did kind of make sense that Emily would start to get a bit plump. Lena felt a bit bad almost, like she had a hand in it all, such as the inverse of a pet owner neglecting to feed them. But at the same time, did she really notice it at all? Not once did she remember seeing a diet magazine lying around, or Emily talk about needing to hit the gy--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lena? Lena? I was asking if you wanted me to order a pizza tonight since I have you home early.\" Emily smiled once more, hands now resting a bit on the top of her potbelly, seemingly in anticipation of her future meal with her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er, yeah! Half n' half mushroom and pepperoni, like the usual?\" She shook herself out of her Holmes-esque deduction on how her girlfriend packed on a few pounds to snap back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind an order of breadsticks too? I doubt you'll have the room for it since you eat like a bird, but they have a coupon deal that expires today...and a get 2-for-1 on pizza, which I assume you also don't want. So, can I get a pepperoni all to myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer gulped, thinking of just how much Emily would put away by tonight's end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, Em, go hog wild.\" She said, against her better judgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, c\u2019mon, dig in.\u201d The two began their meal. Tracer always known to be a real speed eater stabbed more than her girlfriend could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, however, didn't mind. In fact she fed Tracer a large portion of her own meat and bread. Every bit was rewarded with a mewl of happiness and delight, rewarding Emily of a job well done. A few swiping motion had covered the last chunk of meat in the remaining melted cheese, \"Open your mouth,\" instructed Emily who guided the stick towards Tracer's maw of meat, bread, and cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah. Ulp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracer leaned back and rubbed her taut stomach, \"Bloody hell, Em, that was down right tasty, but what's for dessert?\" Tracer suggestively poked the redhead's arm. Emily flipped her hair with a giggle, \"Hm. There is something I\u2019ve been meaning to try on for you, but first I did get you a baker's dozen of donuts from the downtown bakery you like so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Geez, how much food did Emily get me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, okay! That's grea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're a good girl and finish everything then I'll happily serve you the surprise second course,\u201d Without hesitation, Tracer sat herself longways in Emily\u2019s lap with her girlfriend dragging over the box of fresh donuts. Emily held on in her hand and had the other hand caress Tracer\u2019s freckled cheek. The time jumper opened her mouth to have her girlfriend shove in bite after bite, \"This is new, Em. I kinda like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would.\" The two shared an open mouth kiss for a minute, Emily pulled away to hand another donut to Tracer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, the formerly filled box of donuts is nothing more now than a mess of crumbs. Tracer licked the remaining frosting from her lips, \"That was amazing, Em! I-\" Tracer huffed, the fullness finally hitting the pit of her stomach, \"I may need some helping moving to the bedroom though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead chortled and offered the brunette a helping hand, \"Oh, alright. C'mon, luv.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are considered the world's hope for peace, whether they fended of attacks during the infamous Omnic Crisis, to hunting down members of the terrorist organization known only as \"T.A.L.O.N\". Their members come from various different backgrounds and ethnicities, ranging from the speedy lass from King's Row, Lena Oxton, codenamed: \"Tracer\". To the cybernetic ninja known as \"Genji\". To even old veterans from the original Overwatch team, such as the enigmatic \"Soldier 76\" to the Armor-clad \"Reinhardt\". Overall, Overwatch has welcomed numerous members from all walks of life. And there is no exception for one of Overwatch's youngest members, South Korean native, Hana Song. However, to the rest of the world, she is best known by her now iconic username: D.Va!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her rise to fame as a mech pilot, Hana Song went by her username \"D.Va\", representing her home country of South Korea in multiple international StarCraft gaming tournaments. At the youthful age of 16, she swiftly rose through the ranks, and became the top StarCraft player in the world, where she went undefeated for three consecutive years. But while D.Va gained notoriety in the world of gaming, the Omnic Crisis was very much active in South Korea. You see, twenty years ago, South Korea was attacked by a colossal Omnic monstrosity, which rose from the depths of the East China Sea, causing catastrophic damage to coastal cities before it was driven back beneath the waves, only to return every few years, similar to how Godzilla would often rise from the sea and attack Tokyo, Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response to such a destructive entity, the South Korean government developed a mechanized armored unit, known as the \"Mobile Exo-Force of the Korean Army\", or \"M.E.K.A\" for short, to combat the Omnic threat on South Korea and it's neighboring countries. However, with each encounter, the Omnic learned from it's battles with M.E.K.A, often reconfiguring itself with a different form, as well as appearing with new weapons and capabilities. As a result, each incident with this colossal Omnic ends with a stalemate, with the monstrosity being defeated...but not destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as the Omnic continued to adapt, it was eventually able to disrupt M.E.K.A's drone-control networks, thus leaving South Korea vulnerable to attack, which left the military with only one viable option: To use pilots to control the mechs. Scrambling to find the most suitable candidates, the government turned to the country's least expected minority of people: South Korea's community of professional gamers, who happen to possess the necessary reflexes and instincts to operate the mechs and their advanced weapons systems. The top stars were drafted, including D.Va herself. Famous for her elite gaming skills, D.Va was known to be a fierce competitor who played to win at all costs, which earned her a well-earned reputation for showing absolutely no mercy to her opponents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite seeing her new mission as a game, D.Va fearlessly charges into battle alongside her fellow M.E.K.A unit, ready to spring to her homeland's defense at a moment's notice. Though recently, she began to stream the combat operations she participates in to her adoring fans, and her growing following turning her into a global icon, which included having her starring in the Goldshire Pictures movie, \"Hero Of My Storm\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis...is her story.</span></div></div>",

Once a decent-sized city, Busan had exploded into a sprawling metropolis over the course of 20 long years. To the normal onlooker, it was your average sprawling metropolis. But to many people who have the Internet, this city was the home and Base of Operations for Overwatch member and M.E.K.A operative known throughout the world...as \"D.Va\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tonight, however...her life was going to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo elaborate, our story begins with D.Va participating in another mission from Overwatch, using her Mech to zip and bolt across the numerous rooftops of her home city of Busan. However, as she made her way across the Busan skyline, Winston, Overwatch's resident scientist and hyper-intelligent gorilla, was talking to her via earpiece communicator, where he spoke toward her and said, \"Alright, D.Va. Here's what we know so far: The terrorist organization, T.A.L.O.N, has been moving 2 platoons of soldiers into Busan over the course of 72 hours. Judging from their communications, they appear to be searching either for something, or possibly someone, of great importance to them. Your mission is to discover what or who T.A.L.O.N is searching for, and retrieve the target before they do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Winston. I play to win!\" D.Va quipped, her South Korean accent being noticeable as she spoke toward the hyper-intelligent ape with a sense of eager anticipation and enthusiasm, much to Winston's concern for the girl's fearlessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, D.Va had finally arrived at the designated location of her mission: The Busan Wharf. Viewing the area from a nearby rooftop, she could easily see approximately 3 squads of T.A.L.O.N soldiers, armed with assault rifles, entering inside the large warehouse single-file. However, just as she was about to rush headlong into the warehouse, she saw one of T.A.L.O.N's elite operatives, Reaper, enter the warehouse moments later. Obviously seeing the infamous Reaper as a great way to prove herself to Overwatch, as well as give her adoring fans some high-octane action, D.Va launched her Mech at high speeds, racing toward the warehouse, ready to give Reaper and T.A.L.O.N a bit of a nasty surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she rammed into the warehouse wall, smashing through solid steel with ease, giving the T.A.L.O.N operatives a nasty surprise as she exclaimed, \"Hello, boys! Let's play!\" From there, she quickly began to open fire upon the T.A.L.O.N soldiers, firing off her Mech's Fusion Cannons in separate directions. However,in response to the ambush, Reaper began to fire his Dual Shotguns at D.Va's Mech , damaging it slightly. This left Reaper with little to no choice but to temporarily retreat until he could find an opening to take out D.Va without having to confront her Mech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce most to all of the T.A.L.O.N soldiers lied dead before her, D.Va eventually looked around the section of the warehouse she was in, where she then saw...</span></div></div>",

And out of the numerous hired killers and military combatants on TALON's payroll, there was none other, no equal, than the cold-hearted and pale blue-skinned beauty that was now known only... as Widowmaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite being the terrorist organization's most covert assassin and deadliest sniper, Widowmaker wasn't always TALON's prized but cold-hearted killer that she is known for today. In fact, for those who've dug deep enough... They would come face to face with a shocking but tragic truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she ever became one of TALON's most prized field agents, Widowmaker was once a beautiful and talented ballet dancer named Am\u00e9lie LaCroix. Now, one must ask: Why would TALON want to transform this specific woman into who she is now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Well, the true reason for such an atrocity was not in Am\u00e9lie and her raw talent for ballet. Instead, it was because she was avidly connected to someone of great interest but disdain to the terrorist organization. To elaborate, during the Golden Age of Overwatch, Am\u00e9lie was happily married to a man named G\u00e9rard LaCroix. But in reality, G\u00e9rard LaCroix was actually an agent of Overwatch, who was spearheading the operations against TALON and their artwork operations. Of course, TALON retaliated numerous times by attempting to assassinate G\u00e9rard LaCroix. Time and time again, the terrorist organization failed repeatedly to kill him, whether it was from LaCroix's competency in combat, Overwatch's protection, or even TALON's ineffectiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, TALON switched gears. Instead of going after G\u00e9rard directly, they went after someone who was very close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that someone... was his wife, Am\u00e9lie LaCroix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they captured her, TALON operatives involuntarily subjected her to an intense yet painful program of neural reconditioning. After a single week, Am\u00e9lie had become psychologically damaged. Her compassionate personality became suppressed. Her will...broken. And when they were finally done with her, Am\u00e9lie had been reprogrammed as a TALON Sleeper Agent. Eventually, Overwatch managed to find and rescue Am\u00e9lie, where they returned her to a normal life with her husband G\u00e9rard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, like any noteworthy tragedy, there was always someone getting killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after two weeks had passed since she was rescued, Am\u00e9lie killed G\u00e9rard in his sleep, then vanished without a trace. Initially, Overwatch seemed to have believed that Am\u00e9lie had been kidnapped once more by TALON, but the truth...is far different from mere speculation. With her mission complete, she returned to TALON, where they completed the process of transforming the ballet dancer...into a living weapon. After extensive covert tactics and combat training, TALON subjected Am\u00e9lie to some form of medical procedure. In turn, this altered her physiology and drastically slowed her heart rate, which turned her skin cold with a sickly blue pigment, along with numbing her ability to experience any form of human emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the process was complete, Am\u00e9lie LaCroix had died that very moment. And in her place...was Widowmaker.</span></div></div>",

But for the fractured and reconditioned mind of someone such as Am\u00e9lie LaCroix,  better known as \"Widowmaker\"...Sometimes dreaming mostly brings back haunting memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her current attire, Am\u00e9lie was currently wearing a green tanktop over a purple bra and panties, as she subconsciously tossed and turned underneath the covers of her bed, her body thrashing about lividly. But within her subconscious, she was experiencing something...haunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her dream, she awoke in her old apartment with her husband, G\u00e9rard LaCroix, as she lovingly stroke her sleeping husband's black hair. She spoke sweetly toward his sleeping form as she said, \"G\u00e9rard? R\u00e9veillez-vous. Vous avez du travail aujourd'hui (G\u00e9rard? Wake up. You have work today).\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently nudged him once or twice, but there was no response from him. In turn, Am\u00e9lie became more concerned, turning over her husband as she worriedly asked, \"...G\u00e9rard?\" However, instead of seeing her sleeping husband, she only saw G\u00e9rard with his throat slit open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Am\u00e9lie quickly leapt out of her bed in complete shock and horror, screaming at the top of her lungs as she shrieked, \"G\u00e9rard !! NON!!! Non Non Non Non!!!! Cela ne peut pas \u00eatre r\u00e9el !!! (G\u00e9rard!! NO!!! No, no, no, NO!!!! This can't be real!!!)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Et pourtant ... C'est Am\u00e9lie. (And yet... It is, Am\u00e9lie.)\" A voice coldly rang out, which unnerved the traumatised woman just a tad further, her eyes darting all over the room upon hearing the almost inhuman voice. From there, Am\u00e9lie then heard the sharp clacking of metal heels against the hardwood floor, which only got louder as the noise got closer to her, only to reveal a woman in a slick lavender one-piece leotard with futuristic fishnet leggings, whose skin was a cold blue hue, whilst wearing a visor over her face, which seemed akin to a spider's many eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"POURQUOI!?! Pourquoi as-tu fait cela?! (WHY!?! Why did you do this?!)\" Am\u00e9lie shrieked, screaming at her husband's murderer, who still retained such a stone cold expression on her lithe form. But then, the blue-skinned assassin then cokkd spoke and answered, \"Parce que je suis toi. et toi... (Because... I am you. And you...)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the assassin spoke, the woman casually tore off the spider-like visor from her head and face, revealing something horrific to Am\u00e9lie: The blue-skinned femme fatale before her was...actually herself. The blue-skinned Am\u00e9lie then glared back at her frightened counterpart, staring at her with a set of piercing yet heartless golden yellow eyes as she continued, \"... c'est moi. (...Are me.)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, before Am\u00e9lie could even utter a single word, her blue-skinned counterpart swiftly wrapped her fingers around Am\u00e9lie's throat with almost inhuman speed, beginning to strangle her, as the blue-skinned Am\u00e9lie's voice became more distorted and inhuman as Am\u00e9lie felt her life slipping through each desperate breath, coldly speaking toward Am\u00e9lie with contempt and malice as she said, \"Je suis le veuf Et vous ... \u00eates entr\u00e9 dans mon salon. (I am the Widowmaker. And you...have stepped into my parlor.)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her last gasp of air, Am\u00e9lie unleashed a most harrowing of screams, as if futilely lashing out a final desperate act of rebellion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, back in the real world, this caused Widowmaker to suddenly jolt up from her bed, her eyes wide and full of a familiar yet thought long abandoned feeling: Fear. Her golden yellow eyes darted from left to right, as she attempted to slow down her heartbeat, inhaling and exhaling several deep breaths in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Merde. Ce m\u00eame r\u00eave maudit encore. (...Fuck. That same damned dream again.)\" Widowmaker muttered under her own breath, where she then violently unfurled the bedsheets from her lithe form, standing up from the bed as she did so. She stretched her arms from left to right, making sure she was properly flexible, obviously out of habit considering her current line of work these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Widowmaker then casually walked her way over toward...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From there, Widowmaker then casually walked her over toward the kitchen, most likely to get something cold and refreshing to drink in order to calm her nerves. She opened the refrigerator door, carefully examining the edible contents within the fridge, where she then spot one of those D.Va-sponsored Nano-Cola canisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot feeling the mood for some champagne, Widowmaker reluctantly grabbed the Nano-Cola can, popped it open, which caused it to blur out a brief auditory advertisement. Suffice to say, it mildly annoyed the hardened femme fatale. And yet, as she calmly reclined against a nearby sofa, Widowmaker couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy towards the 19 year old South Korean pilot of MEKA, especially when D.Va still had a semblance of youthful optimism and playful demeanor, despite the smack talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u00c7a doit \u00eatre agr\u00e9able de ne pas s'inqui\u00e9ter de ce que tes sup\u00e9rieurs soient si ... \u00e9puisants. Dommage que tu sois encore si jeune, D.Va. (...Must be nice not to worry about your superiors being so...strenuous. A shame you are still so young, D.Va.)\" Widowmaker muttered to herself, contemplating on how contrasting D.Va's current state of life was compared to her own, what things might have been if she wasn't kidnapped and brainwashed by TALON, taking another sip from the Nano-Cola canister in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as she was about to take another sip, something fell from the bottom of the canister, dropping onto Widowmaker's lap. Of course, the cold-hearted assassin soon took notice of this, as she calmly picked up the object with her free hand as she queried, \"...Que se passe-t-il? (...What the hell?)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, shortly after placing the Nano-Cola upon the nearby coffee table, Widowmaker then proceeded to examine the object before her, which appeared to be a folded up sheet of paper, which puzzled the femme fatale, especially since everything was mostly digital these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, curiosity got the better of her, as Widowmaker soon unfolded the sheet of paper, which inevitably was revealed to be a written letter specifically for her. From there, Widowmaker soon began to read what was written on the letter, which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Widowmaker, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr...should I say, Am\u00e9lie,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure if you will receive this letter. But if you do, I want to help you. I know what T.A.L.O.N did to you thanks to Winston and Tracer. Normally, M.E.K.A doesn't deal with terrorist organizations unless the Omnics happen to be involved, but I pulled a few strings to allow me and several others to help you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can refuse if you want to. However, if you do want our help to free you from T.A.L.O.N, meet me over at M.E.K.A Headquarters in Busan. I know some people who can help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood Luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-D.Va\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Widowmaker was honestly wasn't expecting something like this coming from someone like D.Va, who she had very little to absolutely no connections with aside from attending a few ops together across different parts of the world, especially if M.E.K.A and T.A.L.O.N's goals happen to align with one another, which so happened to be a rare occasion considering T.A.L.O.N was a notorious terrorist organization wanted in numerous countries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still... Why would D.Va go out of her way just to let her know that she wants to help her? Widowmaker thought to herself, clearly confused as to what D.Va's motives were. And yet, in the dark recesses of her mostly indoctrinated subconscious, the remnants of what little remained of Am\u00e9lie LaCroix began to crawl it's way back into the forefront of Widowmaker's thoughts, becoming akin to the femme fatale's own Jiminy Cricket, speaking to her as the voice said, \"... Vous devriez accepter son offre. (...You should accept her offer.)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Que savez-vous, Am\u00e9lie? (What would you know, Am\u00e9lie?)\" Widowmaker scolded, her voice seething with distrust toward what little remained of who she used to be. Of course, that only embolden this newfound yet unwanted conscience within Widowmaker's mind, as it then retorted, \"... Pensez-y, Widowmaker: Que se passera-t-il si T.A.L.O.N vous consid\u00e8re obsol\u00e8te? Hm? (...Think about it, Widowmaker: What will happen if T.A.L.O.N considers you obsol\u00e8te? Hm?)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought never crossed Widowmaker's mind until the voice of Am\u00e9lie brought that up. Suffice to say, it certainly unnerved the cold-hearted assassin somewhat. Then again, she wouldn't put it past them, considering their history of terminating defective operatives should they become compromised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after much contemplation and consideration, Widowmaker inevitably decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One target popped out from cover to be greeted with a rocket to the face. Every few hundred feet a new target hopped out only to be blown to pieces by a expertly aimed rocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crew of training bots scattered and secured the payload. Grinning widely, Pharah knew what time it is, \u201cAllow me to tell you the forecast.\u201d The blue Raptora armor hovered around the payload and opened its many cavities to reveal the robots doom, \u201cJUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE!\u201d The robots screamed and attempted to scatter, but all were caught in the blast radius and subsequently destroyed, \u201cTargets down.\u201d Pharah descended to the ground and nodded to herself for a job well done, \u201cThat\u2019s all for today, boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robots reassembled themselves and went back to their resting pods. In the distance, Captain Ana Amari watched with a worried look in her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to base, Pharah couldn't let go of the exhilarating feeling; being with Overwatch and protecting the innocent. Pharah took off her helmet and enjoyed the breeze of the night wind, from behind her mother offered her a tired smile and a hug, \"Allow me to tell you the forecast, huh?\u201d Pharah rubbed the back of her head, \u201cI needed a cool opener to my catchphrase.\u201d Ana shook her head, \u201cYou did a fantastic job out there. Just don't lose yourself to this life, as I did, child.\" Pharah shook her head, \u201cDo not worry, mother. Let\u2019s focus on creating peace and harmony between human and omnic.\u201d She stated making her way towards Overwatch HQ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna sighed heavily at the sight. She wasn't going to lose her daughter, not to the joys of battle or a sense of misplaced martyrdom. To make that so, she made her exit, to Angela Ziegler's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig dinner tonight, huh?\u201d Tracer questioned, picking at her pasta. She eyed the massive feast Pharah brought to the table. Toppling with cheeseburgers, fried chicken, a few vegetables, and a little desert of a few slices of cake, \u201cNot to be rude, but I think you got as much as Zarya usually gets!\u201d Pharah chuckled, \u201cThat\u2019s has to be impossible.\u201d Pharah grabbed a cheeseburger and took a massive bite from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsing the Raptora suit take a lot of energy, y\u2019know.\u201d Pharah said sinking her teeth into a fried chicken leg, \u201cI didn\u2019t take it easy at the training grounds either.\u201d Few minutes had passed for Pharah to finish her entire meal, she licked her fingers clean of what food remained. Her mouth still watered from what she tasted. As much as people always talked down militant food courts the rations at Overwatch HQ is always hailed as top notch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, you finished that quick, Pharah!\u201d said Tracer, being one to be easily impressed, \u201cNo doubt. I\u2019ll be seeing you around, Tracer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pharah exited the mess hall, her wrist watch blipped to the sound of a notification. An email displayed in the form of an holographic projection:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>To Fareeha (Pharah), From Symmetra<br>\r\nI request your assistance with a creation of mine. Report to my quarters when you have the time.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharah cringed at the thought, Symmetra isn\u2019t the most ideal member of the Overwatch roster to work with, often off offhandedly cold and aloof giving heavy air of pretentiousness in her voice, but it is a pretty special honor to be specifically requested by her, \u201c\u2026I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Pharah is still feeling peckish after her large dinner. Nothing is worse than going to bed feeling hungry, so getting more food is an option and a pretty good excuse to get out of helping Sym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Pharah do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ana knew that the effects would not take place that quickly as Pharah did not have any extra calories that could stored as blubber, yet. Pharah then disappeared into the cafeteria waiting line which was empty due to it being so early in the morning.  Pharah then grabbed her usual breakfast consiting of sunny-side up eggs, toast and a few pieces of bacon after which she took a seat next to her mother. Ana greeted her daughter with a smile and said \"Good morning, Fareeha.\" Pharah replied with a similar response. A fee moments of awkawrd silence passed as Pharah began to dig into her meal. Ana excused herself, saying that she had to use the restroom; when in fact her had returned to her quarters to spy on her daughter via hidden cameras she had set up beforehand to spy on her daughter and to assure that her presence did not affect her daughter's eating. By the time she had started to watch the camera feed she had noticed that Pharah had already eaten a large portion of her food, which was unsual as she normal eats her food at a slower pace, Ana grinned as she knew the nano bots had began to take effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n/Pharah's POV/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to dig into her food her mother had stood up from the table that they were sitting at and said \"Excuse me Fareeha, I need to go to the restroom.\" She simply nodded as her had a mouthful of toast and was unable to reply. Pharah wolfed down the toast and bacon and began digging into the eggs; as she was eating she thought about why she was so hungry today. She woke up 30 minutes ahead of her usual schedule because her stomach rumbled her awake, she reasoned that it was because she had a very intense battle the day before and her body was just recovering the energy it had spent during the fight. Snapping back to reality she realized she had eaten all of her food, but still her tummy urged her to get more, which she obliged. Getting 3 chocolate glazed doughnuts instead. Pharah gobbled down the first two and began to finally have the feeling of fullness set on, she ate the last pastry a bit slower but finished it all the same. Pharah then looked down at her now bloated stomach and began to rub it m, to aid in the slow and slightly painful digestion of the food packed inside. She then stands up from the table  and stretched her arms high into the air and began to walk back her quarters to sleep this belly off; lightly poking it in the proccess,  after all this was her day off. Unbeknownst to her the nano bots in her system began to rapidly convert the excess food into fat and her hard stomach began to grow softer and less full and began to jiggle slightly as she continued her walk back to her quarters.</span></div></div>",

Their auroma awakened a small rumble from the depths of her pudgy tummy, but thankfuly it wasn't loud enough for Ana to hear. \"Ah, Fareeha, I was wondering when you would wake up.\" Pharah replied \"Y-yes, I had went to bed after eating my breakfast.\" It was getting harder by the second to keep her belly sucked in. Ana raised the tray to Pharah's arm level and said \"These are for you, I was going to give it to the kids (Tracer, Lucio and D.Va) but I can't seem to find them so I suppose I will give them to you.\" Of course this was all part of her plot  to fatten up her daughter. Pharah normaly would decline the cookies on most occasions saying that she wanted to stay fit or that she wasn't hungry, but this time she knew her belly couldn't be contained for long as her adominal muscles quivered and her belly began to fill up her shirt once more and the last thing she wanted now was to show her mother how chunky she had gotten.  Pharah quickly grabbed the tray and with haste replied  \"Okay, thank you mother but I have to go!\"  before closing the door and dissappearing into her room. Ana waked down the long corrided  and smirked, soon Fareeha would be too out of shape to participate in front action, only then will her daughter  truly be safe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the coast was clear Pharah released her tummy, With her hands on her knees Pharah huffed and puffed, thinking to herself that she hadn't been this exhausted since that time on Oasis. Pharah now fully clothed returned to the mirror she had examined her self in previously, but now she is fully awake she sees the full damage done to her body. Fat wasn't the term to describe her not yet at least, but she was very chubby with a visible muffintop, thick thighs, a padded rear and slightly larger breasts. This wasn't a body of a combat hardened war veteran, but of a high schooler that just experienced the freshman 15. Or freshman 35 in her case.  She patted her tummy and thought how could she have gotten this big after just one (albiet quite large) meal, this couldn't be natural; her body had alaways had a high metabolis and any excess calories that she didn't burn up to fuel her normal bodily functions, were surely burned when she went into the battlefield. Her belly rumbled again for food and that is when she remembered the cookies her mother had brought her. She returned to where she had but them down, and pondered... should she eat these cookies and get even fatter, but satisfy her noisy belly. Or go to the Overwatch gym and attempt to lose all of this dreadful pudge and make her body combat ready.</span></div></div>",

She checked around the large structure filled with fitness equipment and sighed in relief that there was little people present. After changing to her gym clothes consisting of a black sport bra and similarly colored gym shorts. If she had the choice she would be in something that comcealed her more, but that was not an option. Her clothes revealed her pudgy tummy and legs to the world and made her feel extremely self-conscious, constantly readjusting her shorts to make sure she didn't have a muffintop.

It felt like all she did nowadays was work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei sat up straight from her computer, moaning as she stretched out the tightness in her back. Reaching past Snowball lying asleep on her desk, she grabbed her thermos and took a long drink, looking out at the rain dripping down the window at Overwatch HQ. Things had been uncharacteristically quiet around here, and a decade or so ago she would have relished the chance to stay inside and do her research. Now that she was an Overwatch agent and had a taste of action, so to say, it was harder for her to stay still and keep busy doing the same thing over and over again. Not while there was more she could do then ever before. Sometimes she envied the villains like Junkrat who never had to worry about this sort of drudgery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese climatologist sighed to herself. Maybe she just needed a little bit of a break to clear her head. Then she could get on track and really continue her research. The planet depended on it after all. Putting aside the mountains of data readouts, Mei opened up her e-mail server first and two messages popped up. Recognizing the Chinese lettering in the first one, Mei opened it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mei-Mei,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm being sent on a really dull public relations tour to Spain next month, if you're still in Gibraltar do you want to meet up for dinner sometime? Been really missing you, lemme know if you can make it work! <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHui-fang Hu</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei smiled, immediately typing a response accepting the dinner invitation. Mei had spent a lot of time tracking down her old friends and family after she was unfrozen, and Hui had been someone she was especially glad was still around. You wouldn't think a ditzy popular girl would want anything to do with a chubby geek working on her second degree and vice versa, but the two had really got along together, becoming the kind of inseparable friends that got confused for family at every party and event they went to. And to think it all started with a trade; Mei would help Hui with her studies and teach her some good educational habits, and in turn Hui would help her with a diet sabotaged by the stresses of high education and help to keep her weight down. Idly, Mei poked at her belly and wondered; what would life had been like if she didn't ever meet Hui-fang and get her diet under control?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting that thought out of mind, Mei turned to the other email, this one far more official and less meaningful then the one from her friend. It turned out it was another invitation; Volskaya Industries was hosting a seminar on the climate sciences, and they invited her to be a keynote speaker! Mei was surprised and grateful for such an opportunity, though she couldn't help but wonder why Volskaya of all companies was hosting this event, since they were usually the ones burying this sort of research. Whatever the circumstances, maybe this could be a great opportunity to mingle with other scientific minds in her field. And hey, maybe that cute weightlifter would be there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer bored, and with at least two trains of thought, Mei decided to...</span></div></div>",

This pleased Symmetra to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat alone in her room, as she did every day for hours on end. The architect spent that time roaming around in her own mind. Thinking of the many ways to make the world a better place. Not a soul dared to bother her for they were specially instructed that the consequences would be severe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer position at Overwatch HQ served as a abroad program so to speak. The higher ups at Vishkar believed that traveling to America would give Symmetra a fresh perspective on the world. So far, she been utterly disappointed. Especially with her open disliking of the members of Overwatch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in her own mind she took a walk through a garden. One created from beautiful light. Giving plants the energy to grow and blossom into eye-pleasing floral attractions. Other plants grew to produce fruits and vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRUUUMBLE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the time she spent thinking and kept herself sheltered from the others, Symmetra hadn't thought about lunch. That was it. A pang of hunger. Hunger! That is something the world struggles with! Food has always picked at Symmetra's curiosity for sustainability. One minute you have it, then BAM it's gone in a second, \"If light can give plants the energy to produce vegetables and substance for insects then perhaps, I can manipulate the energy from light to create a substance and cut out the middleman. No eating or plant growing necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra didn't need things such as drafting board, pencils, or paper, all that she needed was her imaginative mind and the mechanical prosthetic that allowed her to bring her brain to life.<br>\r\nShe whirled her arms in a fantastical fashion letting the energy flow with her to direct to her fingertips. Just when everything aligned,Symmetra brought her hands forth and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOORAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distraction! Damnit! Symmetra grumbled, the sudden derailing of thought always pissed her off more than anything. The energy within her distorted back into wherever it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of her mechanical arm created a monitor linked to the cameras outside of her room. One camera gave her a view of the nearby break room. \u201cIt looks like someone is celebrating their birthday,\u201d Sym mumbled eyeing the sliced cake on the table, \"Great! There should be enough for everyone...who wants to bring Symmetra a piece?\" Jack Morrison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked away, a few rubbed the back of their heads. McCree was the only one to speak up, \"Oh, she probably doesn't like cake anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra shut everything off. For a while, she sat herself in the lonely light room and tapped her foot. She wasn\u2019t angry about missing out on cake, but rather angry at herself, the way she...went about things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should just focus on my creations,\" on the computer she kept in the corner an email notification from Mei popped up asking for help, \"Or maybe start small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymmetra goes about...</span></div></div>",

Female gains only. I'm sure there is a way you can make a male focused Overwatch story if you want, but here female weight gain only. However, males are allowed to encourage the weight gain and feed the women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No toilet stuff. Period Peeing/Pooping/Gas (Except belching is A-OK) allowed in this interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Other types of expansion (blueberry, inflation, water inflation, GTS, etc) are allowed, but cannot be the main focus. If it has to come to that then just write your own story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Any weight gain involving magic isn't allowed within reason. If it takes place within a fictional landscape further than Overwatch (i.e. Junkenstein's Revenge) then its okay. Alternatively, weight gain involving ray guns are allowed. This does take place in the future with freeze guns and healing staffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No one under the age of 18 is allowed to gain weight. However under 18 is allowed to feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Quality. I'm sure you all are very capable writers and enjoy doing what you do. It's the reason why you're here. That said, I would like for the characters to be in character (i.e. Tracer and Widowmaker cannot be depicted as friends), motives for gaining weight or causing weight gain to somewhat make sense (i.e. Ana fattens Pharah to keep her out of duty), and please keep chapters above a 600 word count. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Have fun with what you're doing and enjoy yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
