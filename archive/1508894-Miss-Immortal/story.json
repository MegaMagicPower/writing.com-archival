I am a private person and am recording this only for posterity and the belief that noone would ever believe the story anyway, because my alter ego Beverly isn't very theatrical either(she always wipes away peoples memory of her). Before I found the tiara, I actually always had fantasies of what it would be like to be female. Now I get to live out those fantasies anytime I want. I wonder if I am part of some experiment held against my will, it seems utterly bizarre what I am capable of and the source of where this comes from(Goddess) seems to be maddingly inconsistent. Am I just her plaything, a human pawn in the pasttime of the well meaning but narcissistic Goddess, or is this some sort of reward? I'm not a particulary good person, I am human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was last year, a week before Christmas. The University where I was studying had a lovely wooded area that I liked to walk around in. The usual you would find here; pines, willows and oaks among a few others. I often take long solitary walks wherever I happen to be, and this was my second time around this area. It wasn't far from the freeway, but this wood was well preserved, inhabited by a lot of animals and was gorgeous with the heavy snowfall. I was looking for something, but I didn't know what. I saw something glittering in the snow beside one oak. I lifted it up, and it was a tiara. Not the kind that the Pope wears, but a feminine tiara somewhat like Wonder Womans. I don't know why, people might have even seen me, but I put it on.</span></div></div>",

I transformed from an average 18 year old male into a living goddess, not only losing all traces of my male nature, but also my physical humanity. I might as well have been an alien from Krypton, and in a way I was. Except that I wasn't mortal, I was totally intangible and  invulnerable to harm. I was an avatar of unlimited power. The tiara that sat atop my head was now surrounded by a curtain of wavy brunette hair that reached my waist. My head was smaller, my arms lost all muscle tone and were slender, my waist had contracted and hips grew out, I grew a bosem and I became tall and leggy.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly walked back to the main campus. After I was transformed, I felt a surge of energy, as if my body was reminding me of my new powers, though I wasn't quite aware of them yet. What I was aware of was my new enhanced intellect. Whether as Ben I was moderately gifted(At least that's what my folks and the IQ exam told me. 137 if you are interested), as a girl**, I was a total genius. I didn't realize that I was attracting stares until I felt the wind touching my ass. Oops. For some reason I was wearing a red roman tunic that made it all the way to the middle of it, and I giggled when I saw how large and perfectly proportioned it was. I wasn't wearing shoes or any kind of winter gear, and I'm sure my tiara attracted attention. Or maybe it was my face, or my boobs most likely. I felt no chill or need to cover up, as I felt totally normal and comfortable. I walked over to the nearest entrance, trying to find a bathroom where I could mug another girl for spare clothes that fit, but I didn't need to. When I reached the door, I inadvertently transmuted my snug red tunic into clothing more suitable for this time of year, and a pair of boots. A pair of golden boots actually that were thigh high. They felt magical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting progressively  more stares from my fellow coeds, I had to regroup. So I went to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I did now have  female sexual organs, but I didn't really need them. More of a flourish than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**I has assumed I was stuck this way permanently, the optimist that I am, and renamed myself \"Beverly McClane\" as a cover.</span></div></div>",

I left it back near the tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's right there\", pointed out a black haired man coming through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", I said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally such a mundane complement would be tucked away into the memory bank or otherwise forgotten, but for some reason I had smiled and the man was attracted by it. He looked conflicted on whether to leave or not, but then he finally decided to head to his next class a split moment later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was also conflicted. Was I flirting, even unconsciously? I didn't feel any sexual attraction towards guys now*. Even weirder, where did my backpack come from? It just appeared. I stepped into a stall in the girls bathroom just to be sure. I entered a stall, set my backpack down, took off my jacket and layed it on the pack. I stepped outside the stall and looked at myself. I took off the tiara that I presumed was causing all of this, and  indeed I transformed \"back\" into my old self. I ran back to the stall and locked the door. I put the tiara back on, half expecting to be back in my roman tunic, but I again transformed back into the girl with the  t shirt and crinkle pants on I had before. I took it off again, same result. Put it back on again, same form as previously mentioned. Then I decided to morph my t shirt into a long sleeve shirt. It did so instantly. I turned it back, and then changed my hair color to golden red. I could see through the stall and see how beautiful I was.** I had to find out more about what I could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sorry, this is neither a slash fiction nor a sex romp.<br>\r\n**I later found out that I could control the entire electromagnetic spectrum and had powers similar to the Marvel character Erik Lensherr!</span></div></div>",

I morphed back into me while still wearing the tiara, but I soon discovered that shape shifting required willpower and was not instantaneous. Now I looked like a cross dresser, which I most assuredly was not. I morphed back into my old clothes and tried to see how long I could stay like this without reverting. I looked in the mirror, tried to make the tiara invisible(Successful transformation yet again), and willed myself to be in the mens bathroom. I then left that bathroom, which was a little ways from my previous occupancy, and I wandered down the learned hallways and out the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to be sure, I walked back to where I was when I found that special tiara, not being lost at all with an already strong memory being enhanced by the magic, or whatever it was stemming from the invisible tiara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so I don't really have to be a girl to wear this thing\", lying to myself because I knew I really wanted to. It's a fetish I've had for a while now, starting with a dream I had at age 12 I think to drown out the noise of my parents fighting. I enjoyed my male self, but got progressively more active in this interest, after a while putting myself in place of the made up protagonist who had turned into a female, and I was dreaming lucidly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall be my next feat? Turn myself invisible?\" I did so instantaneously, then reverted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about flying, and who am I talking to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stretched out my arms and legs, and then launched into the air on my own free will.</span></div></div>",

She looked to be in her late twenties and was wearing a white evening gown. I suspected something supernatutal about her, and was scared yes, but I kept my composure. Something was going on that let me know all of this, as I would usually look  for a more sane answer(later I found out the tiara itself granted me intuition on a universal scale)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my tiara you are wearing Ben. I know you like that sort of thing, and I know you do not the usual formalities in situations like this. You are too bright for that.\" She smiled sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I suppose you led me to this, or compelled me to put this on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was somewhat concerned, but also interested in this. After all, wouldn't you be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman spoke again. \"That tiara was crafted by me a long time ago, and I endowed it with powers. I left it in my villa for a long time because I am...a drinker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but are you a goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have omniscience and omnipotence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, yes I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have an answer to how that could exist, but you have to play games with people. I'm sorry, I'm sorry for bothering you, but two more questions if I may.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may\". The goddess arched one of her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly, there are no limits on how many questions I can ask, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all Ben.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, are you the God of the desert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In some manifestations, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do certain things that He can, but I can say that He exists and that certain questions are unanswerable with logic alone. You've read Aquinas, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a cop out\", thought Ben. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you are just hiding your true identity, but I won't push it. OK, if you are omniscient and omnipotent, than what's the point of putting this tiara out here, or what's the point of anything really? Shouldn't you spend all of your time helping others with your powers? Or do you just ignore your abilities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The latter, son. I'm a lot older than you think, so don't worry, we're not related. I do want to help people, but like I said, I'm a party girl and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would alcohol even affect you if you were a goddess? Or is it ambrosia, or nectar? We never figured out which one is the food and what is the drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, and sometimes I don't know what it is either. Just in case you are wondering, the Greek Gods don't exist anymore, I never met them though that theory about the faith of the mortals determining the strength of the gods powers may have something. But how would you explain me? Noone has ever heard of me, I don't even have a real name. I eat and drink just like you do, and enjoy its effects because I choose to. I feel anything I want to, and I can handle that because I have a moral compass. The thing that seperates the gods(and God) from you mortals is that we are totally self sufficient yet still desire eachother for comfort. You mortals are interdependent and also need eachother for comfort, as well as for survival. I didn't create any of you, but I know everything about you. Well, not everything, I respect your privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen thought all of this over quickly. \"So what is this tiara for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a big fan of superheroes. Just you wait until Ironman and The Dark Knight come out, they are excellent. I want a superhero in real life, so I dropped it off here for you to find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've wished for this, Ben. Think of yourself like a combination of Captain Marvel, Batman, Galactus, Superman, Green Lantern, Luke Skywalker and others. Most especially though, Wonder Woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen transformed right away into an amazonian female. He grew several inches in height, his skin went down several notches on the von Luschan scale to a pale white, his hair grew even more curly than it was before while it grew to his back, and his body reconfigured itself into the prettiest, most curvacious female he ever met, himself. Then his clothes changed into a blouse, skirt and golden boots. It was 19 degrees out, but he felt perfectly fine in the cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am granting this tiara for you to have. Whenever you put it on, you will transform into this. You can call her whatever you want, but if I may, Miss Immortal has a good ring to it. Noone can ever remove it from your head but yourself, and when you do, you will return to your regular self, with no powers. As Miss Immortal, you can do absolutly anything you want. You are capable of anything. How do you feel?\" She smiled really hard at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel great!\" And you did, but you were a little shocked by your sweet as honey voice. You felt like a million bucks, like you really could do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really immortal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Immortal is, not Ben McGregor. Ben will stay alive as long as you choose him to. He will age just like a normal person,  but you will stay young, or however old you wish to be, forever. Ben won't age when you are Miss Immortal.\"</span></div></div>",

What is the first thing I should do? Well as much as I dug my Miss Immortal digs, I wanted to see if I had to be a girl or not. Now I can't explain why, I don't think gods and goddesses have sexual organs or even bodies, but I was totally aroused by my new form, and if I wasn't endowed with superstrength and enhanced will power, I would have keeled over to the sexual tension going on in my vag(sorry, I find the idea kind of disgusting as well). I decided to see if I could shapeshift, and I immeadiatly transformed right back to my old self. I still had all my superpowers, I felt it. Just for the hell of it, I levitated off the ground and shot an electrical blast out of my hand(which I dissipated  right away). I glided around the forest and began to spin around a tree. I put my index finger on the tip of one tree, and I bored a hole into it with no effort at all! Forget Miss Immortal, I can be Mister Immortal! I actually felt kind of bad because I always respected Batman more that Superman for working at everything he could do. He was a mere mortal, who trained himself to become the smartest, most capable human in all of all time. Here I was, in the real world having everything handed to me. I don't even have an interesting origin story! I'm a college kid who was picked at random by a nameless goddess to become a ripoff of Wonder Woman. As intrigued as I was by the idea of being a chick, I liked being a guy more. But as I was gliding around the woods, I realized that I could switch on and off between these identities. I could roleplay at being whatever I wanted. I morphed into a whole bunch of different shapes. I turned myself into Indiana Jones, a pretty fat girl, random celebrities and people I knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I thought, \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI transformed into my Miss Immortal form, and for some reason this felt more natural. You might think, \"Isn't this just a plot device?\" It may be, on a cosmic scale, but my Miss Immortal form felt most natural. It was like this was my natural form. Except for these clothes, no flair to them at all.  I needed a coat, just so I could fit in, and it appeared right on me. I hoped that I could just will everyone into remembering my pretty eyes and adorable smile, and I found out that for the most part, I did. I led myself out of the woods and over a few snowy hills towards a parking area. \"What should I call myself? Hmm?\" A guy who I met a few times walked past me in the parking area and called me Beverly. Beverly, a nice name. Time for my 1:30 class.</span></div></div>",

I hurried to the front door, then climbed several flights of stairs and through a long corridor to my  class. Usually I am on time for this class, but I was distracted by something today, and for good reason! I noticed that I wasn't out of breath, nor did I feel even the tiniest bit of exhaustion. What I didn't realize until then was that I now had superspeed, and I was actually still two minutes early! Now I worried about whether anyone saw me run through the school like The Flash. And the tiara! I wished for it to be invisible and thank goodness, it did(though I could still feel it on my head, it vanished from my window reflection).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was typical. We were going over famous partial differential equations. I was a very good student in elementary school, but gradually my grades dropped off in later years due to laziness and allowing my mind to wander off into tangents. I eventually concentrated my curiosities into academic studies, otherwise what else would I be but an underqualified lecturer who doesn't get paid? This was one of several classes I took, all of which are in varied areas. I'll make my own way. I won't be apart of the growing establishment. I'll be an ubermensch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could do these problems anyway, but now that I was a goddess, I had superhuman intelligence and was the head of the class. I could now solve problems and process information at an unheard of rate. I could even read peoples minds! I read the instructors mind, which helped, but I felt bad because he was more concerned with going back home to his family. The second I heard my call my name(\"...Beverly McGregor\"), I could also tell that he was attracted to me. I don't blame him, I was too! Not to brag, but gods and goddesses do tend to get away with that, and I was probably the hottest girl in the room. I sensed that I wasn't everyones taste, maybe my image was too squeeky clean? I later found out though that I could bend peoples minds and make anyone, male or female, attracted to me. The class ended on time, and a bunch of people left the room. Oh no! I'm a red blooded male, but Miss Immortal was attracted to every guy I saw! Every girl too! A bisexual goddess huh?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was walking past everyone in the hall while everyone looked at me, and you can believe how self conscious I was. I could sense their awe. I'm getting ahead of myself aren't I? I walked towards the wood again, wondering \"Why was it me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI levitated off the ground again in my golden boots. I wished myself to be invisible, and so I was, yet I could sense every part of me. I was brimming with the kind of joy that even my artistic adept mind has trouble putting into words. The visual nuances  were not poetic or reflective, but naturalistic, like in the best film are visual in nature, but I don't want to give away my secret identity with a visual reference(I morphed back into my old self and my old clothes and jacket reappeared). I accelerated  through the trees, and  then relied only on my superhuman senses and navigation to fly. I lounged in the sky and rested my head on a pillow until I reached the (        ) river. Imagine Peter Pan. That is a good way to describe it. Imagine the greatest high you've ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I allowed my mind to wander enough to let my powers get the best of me. My music tastes are eclectic, but the best I could come up with in that giant hammock called the sky was Dusty Springfield. I was humming one of her songs to myself when suddenly that songs reverberated through the sky, making everyone on Earth hear it. Like I was the longest reaching radio wave in the world. I shut it off, and wondered what else I could do? I swam down to one of the cars on the freeway and read some dudes mind. Actually, he wasn't thinking about anything, but digging deeper allowed me to grasp this mans entire life, including his inner most thoughts. I felt horrible and swam away.

In my dream I woke up to find that I had transformed into a woman. I looked into my mirror and found the woman of my dreams. The kind of perfect woman I had always dreamed about. She was tall, blonde, very busty, and possessed an almost supernatural sex appeal. Before I could examine myself I heard the sound of a fire truck siren in the distance. Usually I would simply ignore this, but this time I felt compelled to investigate. This was why I assumed this was a dream because it seemed that I was not fully in control. It was like I was along for the ride. I could only seem to affect some minor control. A few head turns and an occasional hand gestures was all I could do. I raced out of my dorm room not through the door but the window three stories up. The amazing part was I did not hit the ground, I flew. I watched as the tops of the trees passed underneath me. My head then looked up and found the reason for the fire trucks. A fire had broken out in one of the college labs. Somehow I knew that a young man was trapped on the second floor and would soon be killed by the flames. I crashed through the roof of the lab as if it were paper and landed in the room with the young man. After quickly snatching him up I leapt back out of the hole in the ceiling from which I entered and came to a landing outside beside the fire trucks. Several fire men looked at me at shock and I looked at them with what felt like the pent up lust of a thousand years. Before I realized it I snatched one of them up and kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the dream ended.

Ben, you missed something absolutely incredible. There was this hot girl here at the school...just look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hands me his computer, and I read the article. Apparently there was a chemical fire caused by misuse of ammonium nitrate in one of the research labs not too far from here earlier yesterday. Some idiot trying to make explosives. Firefighters rushed to the scene, which had spread within minutes, and as they were putting out the fire, a woman flying at around 60 MPH crashed into the top of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my god</i> thought Ben. <i>Was the dream real?

Putting him on top of a pile of blankets, she stared for a moment at all the firefighters with her hands on her hips before grabbing one of them and kissing them on the lips. Then she flew straight in the sky and was seen heading east. Rewinding the video and pausing on her standing before the firefighters, Ben appraised her looks. She was had long golden blonde hair was very tall, around 6'3. A brief glimpse of her face showed piercing eyes and a gorgeous, flawless face. Her breasts were huge without looking fake on her amazonian body, and her clothing consisted of brass chest armor protecting a simple pink mid sleeve shirt, a pair of long pink and white striped tights that showed off her curvy ass, a belt with a sheath carrying a blade of some kind, and tan thigh high boots. And a gold tiara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian saw Ben's reaction and said \"Pretty cool, huh?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYeah, cool...\u201d I replied uneasily as Brian went back to salivating over the preposterously beautiful Amazon on the screen. I used this as an opportunity to rifle through my bag-pack; yep, I was right, the same golden tiara that the superheroine had worn was the same one that I\u2019d discovered that fateful winter morning. I remember myself thinking <i>\u2019Was that dream real? It can\u2019t be real! But what if it is? Was that woman, that hero, ME?! Did I just save those people?!\u2019</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts swirled round my head, countless questions and possibilities that I couldn\u2019t possibly answer now. I slung my bag back round my shoulders as I pulled on a grimy old hoodie, my favourite lard of faded jeans and a pair of beaten up Converse Allstars. \u201cYo, where the hell are you going, bro?\u201d Brian asked, his eyes still firmly glued onto the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a walk, you pervy little bastard.\u201d I pulled the chain across and pushed open the door handle only to find myself face to face with a stranger with her hand raised to knock on the door. The woman was unsettling with his pastel white face, pressed black suit and opaque spectacles that concealed his true expressions. I gulped and quickly tried to close the door but the woman stuck a polished shoe in the doorway before she let herself and her associate, who I hadn\u2019t seen before, into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you guys out?\u201d I whimpered as they scanned the entirety of my crap heap of a dormitory. The second man, a burly African American male, pulled out a brown wallet from his blazer pocket and displayed an official looking badge with <b><i>\u2019DEPARTMENT OF UNUSUAL ARTEFACTS\u2019</i></b> emblazoned on its golden surface. The woman spoke clearly and monotonously as she addressed me, saying, \u201cI\u2019m Agent Black, this is my colleague, Agent White, and we\u2019re from the government-sanctioned Department of Unusual Artefacts. We have reason to believe that someone in this establishment has come into possession of a seriously powerful weapon. It looks like this:\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a picture of the tiara and I clutched my bag strap even tighter. My mouth went dry as she asked me whether I\u2019d seen it or not. Luckily for me, Brian never had the same problem and bluntly said, \u201cWell you guys are wasting your time- me and Ben have never seen that thing before in our lives. I mean, how many 18-year-olds do you know play with tiaras? Come on.\u201d I nodded eagerly, silently thanking Ben for covering for us both. I was beginning to feel slightly more comfortable until the ape-like brute that was Agent White stomped towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes unintentionally darted to my rucksack, an action that White instantly recognised as suspicious behaviour. He held out his grizzly paw as he grunted, \u201cPass the bag, squirt. <i>NOW</i>.\u201d I remember quickly hiding my bag pack behind my back, slowly unzipping the top and feeling the cold metal of the tiara as I mouthed a silent <i>\u2019Sorry\u2019</i> to Brian. I saw White\u2019s lips curl into an angry sneer while I heard the telltale noise of a gun being cocked behind my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPass the artefact over peacefully, son. You don\u2019t want to make this worse than it already is...\u201d Black said emotionlessly as she aimed her silenced pistol at the base of my neck. Brian was terrified, screaming, \u201cOh God, what the HELL is happening?! Ben, what have you done?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it: I was surrounded by two adults from some unknown agency who were obviously packing heat and not afraid to use it. I gulped deeply as I dropped the bag. \u201cKick it over.\u201d I pushed the bag away from myself and into White\u2019s expectant hands. He scanned through silently, his face moving from deadpan excitement to obvious confusion. A mischievous grin spread across my face as I pulled out the golden relic from my dusty hoodie pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking for this?\u201d I laughed. White and Black both suddenly lunged at me desperately but alas, it was too late- I\u2019d already placed that godforsaken tiara onto my head.</span></div></div>",

It said 11:34 PM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I sleep this late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly got out of my sleeping position and remembered the tiara, laying in my backpack. I immediately became suspicious. I stared at my pack in the dark. I wondered where my two roommates were. Their names are Eddie and Kitty. At least one of them was almost always around when I came to the dorm. They could be out somewhere, maybe even together. Oh great, and I could potentially be cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still fully clothed. I've probably only done that one other time. I've never slept this much either. I always made it a point to get the bare minimum of needed sleep and to get up as fast as possible if I wasn't enjoying any dream that day. This dream tonight was very intriguing, but it left me worried. Despite my analytical and skeptical nature, I kept an open mind and was worried that the tiara was somehow trying to coerce me into something. I've NEVER felt dizzy before, at least not intentionally so. It felt almost like a \"Dr Strange\" comic or an episode of \"Buffy\". Despite my apprehension, I walked slowly towards my pack, which was laying on the  chair near my desk, and unzipped the bag for the tiara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled it out, and it was glistening in the darkness of the room. That didn't bother me as much as the fact that the light scattering on the walls, and the rooms layout was an exact replica of my dream. I was also shaking somewhat with the pleasure of being a female in the dream. Not that I didn't enjoy my maleness, but I always found something exhilerating about being the opposite sex. So much new sensory experience to enjoy. So much new perspective. And I supposed that in a  small way, females could speak more freely about things. If I told some people about my enjoyment of \"Project Runway\", they would say I was gay! At least with a woman liking more traditionally manly things, there was usually a sort of admiration among their peers for bravery or competence. But this was a generalization...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. If I put the tiara on, I might become the woman of my dreams, but potentially be unable to come back. There also a number of potential worries that popped up in my mind if this happened. What if this tiara was magical, and was the product of some malicious entity? Usually in these scenarios, the potentially dangerous ones, I keep the cautious route. For some reason though, I swallowed my worries, said a prayer, and put the tiara back on my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my hands, my clothes, touched my hair, and everything was fine. I didn't feel any different. Could be a red herring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the full length mirror on the other side of the room, and stared at my reflection. It was now 11:38, as it said on Kitty's clock. I sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wearing the tiara though, I started looking into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second, it was all clear to me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a war among the unknown gods of their version of Paradise. You see, there are tons of gods, all living in their own dimension of reality. The Christian God was jealous of everyone else, and demanded that no human beings knew about the other ones. Which human beings were close to doing through mysticism all these years. It wasn't that these gods were evil, in fact some of them were benign and wanted to be left alone, but they also have human frailties and fallacys. They're ultimately just more evolved humans, though they were created as gods through belief by humans. Narrativium, just like in the Discworld. The ones that humans don't know about were born from the ones that were believed in, but didn't always follow the same mythic trajectory that we thought they did. Oh My Lord, this planet was the Roundworld! And I, this tiara belonged to a princess goddess. She was murdered, drained of power by a jealous god by rewriting history. Before she evaporated, she put as much of her power as she could into this tiara that I'm wearing right now. For me to find. She wants to come back...through me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mirror reflection flickered between my own wearing the tiara, and the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Magic flowed over me, and standing in my spot was the blond bombshell from my dreams. I was wearing a silver evening gown and tan sandels, and nothing else. Unlike my dream, I could make decisions. I was assuming that since I was conscious, I had more control over the power of this tiara. I raised my left lower arm, and it went up with no trouble. I lifted my now dainty right foot, and it went up no differently than it's ever had before. The sirens were getting louder, I had to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out the window. I thought, \"Can I actually fly?\" I tried to levitate in the room, and I suddenly lifted a few inches off the ground. My now longer hair drafted upwards for a second and then landed back in place.

I was going slower than my full potential I felt, but I reached the lab in less than 10 seconds by crashing headfirst through the roof. Ow? No, I didn't feel anything but grief at the situation and that I missed the window enterance. I missed because I still was nervous about my newfound powers and bond with a being that I had never known about beforehand. \"What a spaz\", I was thinking to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know how you or someone you know complained about superheroes causing more collateral damage than they were worth? I was thinking the same thing as I went through the roof and into the lab where I intuitively knew the fire had been started. Why did I have to miss the window? *Laughs* There he was, a physics student who I was only passably familar with. I've seen him because we take some of the same classes in the same rooms, but on different schedules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Russell!\" I shouted, as the smoke enveloped the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind that\", I said. \"Why didn't you just leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I passed out from the smoke just before I grabbed a mask. Are you a superheroine or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", I said lamely. \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you who I really am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you all\" said Russell dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran over to Russell in the smoke, which hadn't affected my breathing nor my eyesight in the least. I grabbed on to Russell, who was still wearing a mask over his nose and mouth, and carried both of us out through the roof, and onto the ground of the campus. \"Whoops, forgot your jacket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flew back in, retrieved his coat, and flew back down on the ground when the firemen burst through the door to the labroom, and cops were on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who are you, lady?\" asked one cliched cop with powedered doughnut partially on his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...am Miss Immortal!\", and gave him a long, ironic kiss.  What a dumb name, in hindsight. The goddess wasn't immortal since she almost died, so neither was I probably. I rocketed into the sky, and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was strange to walk around as an attractive woman let alone a super heroine attempting to hide her true identity.

When you don\u2019t have the energy to stand up straight?  Because that is what I like that first day.  Making my way across campus to the dorm, I just hoped that I wouldn\u2019t collapse in the snow.  My senses swirling around me, I eventually made it to my room, and plopped headfirst into my pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that sleep was Nirvana.  A pleasant squeeze simultaneously wrapped every inch of me, as I succumbed to the warmth of my mattress.  I opened my eyes in what seemed to be just a moment later, and realized much more time had passed.  The sky was now dark, the moon glowing bright, and my legs felt like jelly.  Trying to stand up straight took some effort, by my mind told me that I was completely relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hobbled my way over to the bathroom, and looked in the mirror.  I was still the same Ben I had been when I fell asleep.  I touched my chin, and could feel the stubble starting to sprout. I took a good look to make sure that nothing was wrong.  There was no pain when I changed my facial expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won\u2019t bore you with listing the rest of my wake up routine.  Needless to say it involved the toilet, getting some snacks and drinks from the fridge and texting my classmates, begging them to let me borrow their notes from my missed classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter replenishing my energy, I sat down at my desk, and contemplated what happened that day.   Why did I wear that tiara?  Sure I was curious, but it was a compulsion to try it on after touching it.  That\u2019s not something anyone does in public.  NO ONE looks sane in a tiara.  Not even princesses and pageant winners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my bag and looked at it again.  There were no strange markings on it.  No \u2018made in China\u2019 notice, no ancient ruins, no symbol.  It was a silvery gold colour, if that makes sense.  It almost seemed to change metals depending on how I was holding it.  Maybe it was worth something.  I spent the next hour hoping that I had obtained a rare artifact that I could sell to pay for my tuition.  The results were non-existent.  I couldn\u2019t find anything online that remotely resembled what I had.  And on top of everything, I was now wide awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRestless, and my mind too full of questions to focus on my essays, I put the tiara under my bed and went for a nighttime walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moonlit snow, I made my way across the fields to the bar just on the other side of campus.  My roommate Brian would be drinking there.  He owed me a beer, and I intended to collect.  Brian was in his usual spirits, chatting with his friends, as they bragged about their many conquests.  He was more than eager to pay back my beer.  We chatted, and everything was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when Fred, started talking that I became glad I made it there.  Fred started describing this beautiful girl that he thought was a nutjob.  She was over six feet tall, very well built, and looked like a Swedish supermodel.  She had long flowing hair, and was standing over an unconscious body.  She was scantily dressed, but wore a tiara.  When Fred asked if she needed help, she just laughed and said that Justice was done, and then flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a Superhero?  Like Wonder Woman?  Were you on drugs?\u201d the guys asked him. \u201cYes, yes, no.\u201d Fred answered.  From then on, the questions started getting cruder.  \u201cDid you fuck her? What were her breasts like?  Was she naked?\u201d etc.  From then on, the night became less and less memorable and everyone\u2019s blood alcohol levels increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the discussion moved to other things, I pulled Fred aside.  \u201cFred, this woman, she her tiara didn\u2019t happen to be silver did it?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cSilver, but sometimes when she turned her head, it looked like gold.\u201d he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind started racing, and walking back through the snow alone, I started making the connections.  This woman must have lost her tiara and would probably be looking for it.  As the wind howled, I felt a pressure from a metal\u2019s edge in my winter coat pocket.  Placing my glove inside, I pulled out the tiara.  It was the strangest thing, I am absolutely sure that I didn\u2019t take it to the bar with me.  This time I actually fought the urge to wear it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day I smartened up a bit and did some research.  The internet is a wonderful thing, and I wanted to use it to find out the mysterious woman\u2019s identity.  I started typing in all the key words I could think of, \u2018superwoman\u2019 \u2018blond\u2019 \u2018real\u2019 \u2018tiara\u2019 \u2018gold and silver\u2019 \u2018forced to wear\u2019 hoping that something would pop up.  But the results were only porn and erotic fan fiction about fictional characters.  There were so many Wonder Woman bondage sites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why the compulsion to try on the tiara?  I swear I am not like that.  I never looked at my girlfriends\u2019 dresses and became envious.  I mean sure I wanted to be royalty, but I never wanted to be a queen or princess.  That part was still bugging me.   The tiara just appearing in my coat pocket meant one of two things, either I was having gaps in my memory, or it automatically teleported there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to the bathroom and closed the door, in case Brian came back unexpectedly.  In my hands was the tiara.  I was going to see if this thing caused me to become sick.  I turned off the light and hide it behind the shower curtain, making sure it was pitch black, if the tiara wasn\u2019t glowing, than I knew there was no radiation involved.  Thankfully I couldn\u2019t see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interesting part is when I turned on the lights and found that it had disappeared.  Or at least it moved.  I was about to look around until saw my reflection in the mirror.  The tiara had appeared.  But there was no clock in there.  I still didn\u2019t know if it teleported, or if it was causing gaps in my memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a good look in the mirror.  I still looked the same.  I was just wearing a feminine looking headwear.  I leaned closer to the light.  Maybe if I caught the proper reflection, I could see some secret engravings like in Lord of the Rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a strange thought hit me.  If the tiara could teleport, why didn\u2019t it just appear on the woman that Fred saw?  Was it merely decoration?  Too many questions were going unanswered.  I needed to conduct my scientific experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I couldn\u2019t at the moment.  The strange part was that I couldn\u2019t physically take it off.  It wasn\u2019t a huge deal, I had a few hours before my only class that day, so I had time to solve this.  But it was disconcerting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked around my dorm room, ate some food, looked at some porn, you know the usual.  It was only around noon, when I realized that I had sat down to pee.  Which any guy will tell you is an oddity.  I wanted to head to the gym and work out, but I didn\u2019t want all the jocks to see me wearing this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about two in the afternoon when I felt the same dizziness as the previous day.  My room began to spin, and I felt queasy again.  I managed to make it to my bed, but to my horror, I didn\u2019t wake up there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Next thing I remember, there is intense heat, an unconscious man being carried over my left shoulder, and a little girl.  There was smoke everywhere.  \u201cThis way.\u201d the little girl said as flames consumed the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I noticed about myself was the height, I felt significantly taller than usual.  The second was the strength; the guy on my shoulder wasn\u2019t giving me any stress.  It was like balancing a box of Kleenex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry.\u201d The little girl said.  \u201cWhat wrong?\u201d she asked me.<br>\r\nMoving the fingers on my right hands back and force, I realized that I had control over this body.  I also notice that the fingers seemed slimmer than I was used to, and their nails were painted.   Looking down I noticed two large mounds sticking out of my chest.  Barely held in by a breast plate that seemed more for decoration than practicality.  There was a short dress of some kind around my waste.  I\u2019m not an expert in woman\u2019s fashion, and never intend to be one.  The fabric was thick, but short.  I was wearing knee high boots, with four inch heels in them.  The first few steps almost caused me to trip and break my ankles.   My blond hair was barely touching my shoulders, but I didn\u2019t have time at that moment to examine it too much.  The hall in front of us gave way to the fire, collapsing the roof and blocking the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instinctively, I picked up the little girl.<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to be brave, okay?\u201d I told her as I held her in my right arm.  I squeezed to towards my body.<br>\r\n\u201cHold tight.\u201d I told her in a surprisingly maternal voice.  Her arms squeezed me as tight as they could, and I gave a run towards the burning debris.   About five steps, and I tripped on the stupid heels, but instead of falling face first, I was floating just above the floor, as my momentum torpedoed me towards the flames.  Passing through them, I could feel the pain as the fire touched my skin, but it wasn\u2019t excruciating, if felt more like sunburn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pain was my first indication that it wasn\u2019t a dream.  This was happening outside of my head.  Knocking the debris away with my flying body felt like nothing.  I could hear the wood go flying after the impact as I burst through the door, and landed my two passengers into a snowbank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, I could hear sirens wailing, as the deep horn of a fire truck made itself known.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked the girl, looking over her skin to see if there were any serious burns.  Thankfully she seemed unharmed.  \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d the girl said with an overly sweet lisp.<br>\r\nI checked the pulse on the man I had carried.  It was still good, and he started breathing.  Finally, I checked myself, making sure that I hadn\u2019t received any significant injuries during the rescue.  Surprisingly, I didn\u2019t even find a bruise on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the girl again.  \u201cThank you.\u201d she said as she ran up and hugged me.<br>\r\n\u201cI have to leave now.\u201d I told her.  \u201cBut I need you to look after your\u2026dad?\u201d I guessed as I pointed to the man lying unconscious in the snow.  The girl nodded.<br>\r\nI stood up, and imagined myself levitating.  It took a bit of energy, but I figured flying out of this place would be better than trying to run anywhere in the heels.  Thankfully, it worked, and I was off the ground.  Actually flying though took some time.  I tried to flap my way over the trees back to the campus, and felt like a complete loser doing so.  How did Wonder Woman manage to change directions in mid-air?   I put my fist out like Superman, but failed to navigate myself that way. About two hundred yards away from the fire, I landed on some newly plowed pavement, and walked on the side of the road towards campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly wanted to call a taxi, but I had no phone on me, or anyplace on my costume to carry cash.  Maybe if I hid some in my cleavage.   Strange enough, the cold didn\u2019t seem to bother me, until the wind came, that caused some Goosebumps, and erect nipples, and they felt mighty uncomfortable against the steel breastplate pushing against my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around that moment that I slipped on a patch of ice and landed right on my back.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, I wasn\u2019t hurt.  My head wasn\u2019t dizzy, but I used this moment of peace to contemplate my situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you might be wondering why I didn\u2019t stay when the firemen arrived.  Well, the simple answer is that I didn\u2019t want to put up with any questions.  Who are you miss?  Why are you dressed like that?  Did the man pay you to dress like that? Why are you here?  The little girl says you have superpowers, did you drug her?  Oh you do have superpowers, the government will dissect you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing no white night would help me up off the ground, I struggled to gain my footing, and made my way back to the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Stupid heels.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In retrospect, it seemed obvious that my mind wasn\u2019t working at its best in that moment, but at the time, it seemed like a good idea to get out of the cold.  Just a five minute break to rest and relax, and warm up for a bit before going back to my bed.  The closet open establishment was the bar right outside of campus, and I just needed to pop in for a second to get my bearings, and build up the energy to make it back.  The odds against Brian and Fred being there were pretty good, so it seemed like a small risk to get in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the door, walked a few yards in and then realized my mistake.  I could feel everyone\u2019s eyes examining me as I walked in.  Some pretended to continue talking and used their peripheral vision, but many didn\u2019t even bother turning their heads away from me.  And in all honesty, I don\u2019t blame them.  It\u2019s winter, and a woman walks into the bar with a mini-skirt, a metal breast plate, what I can only assume were fetish boots, and obviously, a gold, sometimes silver tiara.  I\u2019d stare.   Some assholes even took out their cellphones and started snapping pictures, or video.  The first videos online about her came from the bar.   But at that point no one knew I had powers.  They probably just assumed that I was some fake geek girl dressing up like this for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst better judgement, I kept walking, and quickly turned into the restroom.  It was only once I saw my reflection in the mirror that I realized my mistake.  Her face wasn\u2019t like mine.  She didn\u2019t look like my female twin, at least I was pretty sure she didn\u2019t.   For one thing, her nose was longer than mine, it wasn\u2019t larger, and it didn\u2019t shove out more.  It was a perfectly straight Greek nose, much daintier than mine.  My cheeks were flushed, with what I assumed to be blush or rouge.  A dark red lipstick covered my lips.  It was definitely a colour that demanded sexual stimulation.   The eyes were a piercing blue, very different from my natural colour.  The eyelashes curved upwards, and were a raven\u2019s black, definite use of some sort of mascara on them.  Eyeliner demanded attention to be brought to the white in my eyes, outlining it.  A glossy eye shadow made itself known when I blinked.  The eyebrows dyed black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder everyone was staring at me.  I was entranced myself, and didn\u2019t even realize that some guy opened the bathroom door behind me until his phone flashed, indicating a picture was taken.    It turned to scold him, until I was the urinal out of the corner of my eye and realized that I was in the men\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey babe, anyone ever tell you that good girls don\u2019t use the men\u2019s bathroom?\u201d he sneered.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Honest mistake.\u201d I said.  Embarrassed, and panicking a bit, I tried to run past him and head towards the woman\u2019s but just no clue how to move quickly in heels.  The size difference didn\u2019t help much either, and I fell flat against the guy, knocking him to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy woman, let me buy dinner first.\u201d he joked.<br>\r\nAt this point, I was really panicking, used my force against the wall to push myself up, and ran out of the men\u2019s room and into the woman\u2019s before anyone else could hopefully take a picture of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo woman where doing their makeup and gossiping as I stumbled in.  The stopped to look at me, and I instantly tucked into an open stall.  It felt so unnatural being there that my mind told me that I was about to get arrested.  Falling back on the toilet seat, I waited for the girls to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they finally left, I went to the mirror and got a better look at myself.  The lighting was better here, and I could actually see that my midriff was exposed under the breastplate.  This somehow made my breasts look even bigger.  They seemed designed for getting attention, but didn\u2019t look practical in any way.  I was almost shocked that I could move as well as I did without use of a bra.  I assume that the breastplate had some sort of magic to that effect, or that the power that let me fly was always holding my breasts up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around to make sure I was alone, I also lifted the skirt to find a silk thong underneath.  At least it wasn\u2019t lacy or embroidered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hard as I tried, I couldn\u2019t get the boots to come off.  The almost seemed glued to my feet.  Even the tiara seemed magnetically attached to my head.  Once back in the stall, I realized I was able to drop the panties and skirt down to use the toilet, but couldn\u2019t get them past my ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also gave me amble time to check out my new equipment.  Much to my dismay, my outdoor plumbing had been remodelled to the indoor variety.  The area around it was clean and shaven.  I looked at the armpits.  Those seemed to have been shaved as well, same thing with my legs.  The body had come pre-waxed.  If I was stuck as a female, at least whatever was doing it for me was nice enough to make sure my hygiene was taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed to be twenty minutes, I decided that most people would have forgotten about me and left.  When I got outside and stepped in the snow, I realized something.  The faster I ran, the lighter my steps became.  It turned out that this was my flight power activating.  With some practice, I realized that I could hover a millimetre over the ground, and not have to worry about my heels slipping.  If I put my hands next to my waste, and pointed my palms towards the ground, I was able stay in the air, even if it was only a millimetre. I could even go forward by mimicking the motion at walking.  The problem was moving like this seemed to extend my ass out more and exaggerated its sway, but if that was the trade-off for not tripping on heels that it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made it all the way up to my room that night without further incident.  As long as Brian was asleep, I could hide under my covers until morning.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My regular body had returned.  Almost in disbelief, I felt my torso and chest, and sprinted to the bathroom to check out the mirror.  It was my unmolested face, with my hair at its regular length.   My clothes looked like they did when I crashed onto my bed earlier.

Fred said that the woman beat up a man in an isolated part of the campus, probably right after I blacked out the first time.  The second time I blacked out, there was a fire with people who needed to be rescued.  Whenever something significantly bad or dangerous happened in the area, I blacked out, and was replaced by the woman.  So she only appeared when someone needed saving, and to do that, she either had to transform me, or replace me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was safe to say that the man who had been beaten up was trying to rob or hurt someone, or worse.  The girl and her dad were alive because of the tiara wearing heroine.  But even with all that information, there were still too many questions.  Why me?  How did I wake up as her in the fire?  How was the tiara able to teleport, or at very least block my memory?  How could it not only alter by body, but clothes as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the tiara, I knew that it was in my best interests to find out more about it before any more episodes happened.  But the transformations had taken their toll, and I felt exhausted.  I thought that it would probably be best to get some sleep now and research the tiara the next day. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This day was the exception to that rule.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning.\u201d she said beside me, as her fingers ran through my hair.<br>\r\nMy response, past the initial gasp of disbelief, was to fall out of my bed.<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d asked Brian as he headed out the door to his exam.<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d I replied, my eyes never moving from the strange woman.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in four hours.\u201d Brian said as he shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t see you.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed not.

I have yet to taste its fashions.  However, a young lady\u2019s birthday suit never falls from style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie.  She was gorgeous.  A two breasted Amazon, perfectly toned before my eyes, although her blonde hair made her look more like a Valkyrie than an Amazon.  Of course I gave her a good look over.  What red blooded man wouldn\u2019t?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we can continue our conversation now?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYes.

Makers of money?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, all that and more, heads of the household in some families, even.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating.\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you let me get dressed, I can show you around the campus.

To keep warm.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou. Woman. What fur is that?\u201d she yelled to a passerby.<br>\r\n\u201cShe can\u2019t hear you.  And it\u2019s a winter coat, not made with any animal fur or skin.  Just synthetic\u2026 uh\u2026 fake wool.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the woman learns the same scrolls as you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not that one.  She isn\u2019t in my classes.

Her gloves pointing to herself, asking for clarity.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you, miss.  I wanted to talk to you about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbout her goals!\u201d Lenexa said.<br>\r\n\u201cAbout your classes.\u201d I said.  \u201cAre you in any of mine?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d she said. <br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind if I ask you a few questions?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s cold, and I need to go to an exam.\u201d she said as she turned around and continued her walk.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d I said, but before I could turn around, the naked woman beside me kicked the back of my heel, and I went flying backwards onto the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! Are you okay?\u201d asked the girl.<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d I said, with surprisingly little pain.  A fall like that could have split my skull open.  Lenexa looked down on me, smiling.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me help you up.\u201d said the girl, offering me her hand.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I replied as she pulled me to my feet.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to go to the medical center?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay, get to your exam.\u201d I insisted.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a geography exam.  I\u2019m going to ace it.\u201d she promised.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s a bit sudden, but what time is your exam over?  We can get some coffee to celebrate.  I\u2019ll buy you a cup as a thank you for helping me off the ice.\u201d<br>\r\nThe girl smiled.  \u201cMy name is Rachel.  I\u2019ll be done in two hours.\u201d she said. \u201cMeet me at the bar then.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Ben.\u201d I smiled, like an idiot as she turned around and kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she what you call sexy?\u201d Lenexa asked.<br>\r\n\u201cHard to say. Maybe. It was only one conversation, and I can\u2019t tell what she looks like under her clothes.\u201d I explained.<br>\r\n\u201cWould she not bed you?\u201d Would you not bed her?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot before getting to know each other. And there are many diseases involved with sex now.  Not just babies.\u201d I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d asked a student that snuck up on me.<br>\r\n\u201cNo one.\u201d I lied.<br>\r\n\u201cYou hit your head.  Are you okay?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I insisted, starting to get annoyed by the attention I was getting.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, cool man.  I was just checking.  I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d He said as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he a friend?\u201d Lenexa asked.  I looked around before responding.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know him.  He is just a concerned student.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStrangers help out their rivals now?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cRival?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYou seek wealth from the same pool of resources, do you not?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere are more than enough \u2018resources\u2019 to go around.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n\u201cHe shows more concern for you than the woman did.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s a doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he would lay with you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t ancient Greece Lenexa, most men do not copulate now.\u201d I told her sternly.</span></div></div>",

A few study groups huddled together for their exams.  Some loners sat with their laptops, hiding in plain sight from the world around them.   The walls were plastered with posters and advertisements.  Some teenybopper superstar hung on the largest one.  Melissa Redwood;  a woman who just turned 18, whose music was auto-tuned to ridiculous levels, and used her skimpy outfits, and over-sized breasts to get sales.  The poster had her in some ridiculous outfit, with her mouth over the microphone in a position that looked like she was going to start sucking it.

Like you\u2019re in a smooth ride and you hit a dip too fast.  Because the change was instantaneous.  I immediately lost a foot of my height, and my weight completely shifted.  I had long curly hair, and glasses, and suddenly felt very exposed.  Looking down at myself showed two large mounds popping out over my ribcage, and a dress that looked like the one from the Melissa Redwood poster.<br>\r\nI immediately lifted my hands up for balance.

Walking in sensible shoes, which I was honestly shocked weren\u2019t heels, I sat down across from the lonely nerd.<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d I said in the sweetest voice I could muster.

But it\u2019s strange, not even a minute before you got here, so guy came up and asked about her too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged and gave and forced smile. <br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026uh\u2026Heather.\u201d I said after looking at the posters and signs around us for some name to use.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a lovely name Heather.  I\u2019m Mike. Please to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d I said as I reached out my dainty hand to shake his.  His hand shake was just as awkward as mine.  Clearly not a lot of people made physical contact with him.  He also hadn\u2019t showed that day.  My nostrals seemed to be a bit more powerful since my transformation to Heather.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sorry to waste your time.\u201d I told him as I stood up.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.  I enjoyed it.  I learned something.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMe too\u2026um\u2026bye.\u201d I said as I turned around and kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenexa squeezed my ass, causing me to let out a feminine yelp, as a quickly strode away from Mike. <br>\r\n\u201cSee, I told you that was a waste of time.\u201d I told her.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I learned something.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat you are adorable.\u201d<br>\r\nI raised my middle finger and stuck it out at her.  She didn\u2019t get the meaning of it.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I change back now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d she said, and with a bit of a shock, I felt myself instantly grow larger as my proportions returned to normal.<br>\r\n\u201cI learned that someone erased me from existence.\u201d she blurted out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I had collapsed into my bed with my clothes and shoes on. I awoke the next morning and felt different,more powerful. I stared at myself and didn't seem different, but I was. I looked out the window and my frame of view took in every little detail of detail straight from my window to miles away, all at once. I stared into the sky, and holy shit! I could literally see different galaxies. Every little detail of every one, simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my head and of course, found the tiara.

I rushed over to a mirror to see that I was growing half an inch a second, from a quite average 5'8 to a very respectable 6'3. I was also growing more muscular and powerful looking, but that subsided and I in short time became softer in appearence. I  started to look rather feminine really, as my skin became lighter and I lost all my body hair. My face was changing too, and it took on a distorted shape until it decided what \"it\" wanted to be. It was clearly the face of a young woman, a beautiful one at that. My hair sprouted down in soft curls until it reached my stomach.  Then I looked down and noticed that my body had transformed into a female shape as well, one that was stunning and beautiful, and also very fit and athletic. I was the most gorgeous woman I ever saw, and it was me. I was the very definition of how an Amazon would look like. Well, not really, the idealized kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost shrieked, but I didn't because I had developed other senses as well, and knew the very powerful Goddess was behind me. She was as old as time, and she decided not to \"mince appearences\" and took the form of an older woman, which she was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I started to have strange memories about living in the countryside with a large extended family. I was flying above meadows and streams in my female form totally naked. I remember this lady in front of me as my mother. I had countless dinners with her and with others, and I had joyous memories of games and leisurely activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, my real mom, nodded her head. \"Now you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, what's my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't really have names, but I know you always liked the name Drusilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drusilla?\" The rest of my memories came back, and I recalled that the meadows and streams were only illusions, for we had no material realm to live in. We are luminious beings living on an astral plane, but it wasn't even that. We were totally corporal, but yet omnipotent. We were above material and matter, but also a part of it. Maybe because we chose to. I still remember my life as Ben, but now it seems less important. I'm no mortal being but a goddess.All human feelings and emotions remain, but are transcended by omniscience.  I chose to be the daughter of this goddess who chose to be my mother.  I chose to be younger and carefree, while she chose to be a matriarch. She chose to study philosophy and science, while I didn't care at all. We were both the same age and body, but of  different temperment. So what happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can answer that. You were banished here by Zeus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But he's not real, and besides, I am more powerful than him. I could take his lightning and shove it up his ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy real \"mom\" began to laugh. \"Not that Zeus darling. Our neighbor. He saw you smooching with your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I remember that. How long ago was it?\" I began to ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, about 300 years ago. Your soul was banished here and you lost all your powers. You've been reincarnated several times. One as a painter, once as a pedophile, and once as Burber? Baber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babur,mom. The founder of the Mughul Empire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was I was born as a male?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason, practical joke really. Zeus is paying for it right now. He's in one of those Ghostbuster boxes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly recall him and begin to laugh. He was always staring at my ass. \"So what about this tiara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"I made it, imbuing it with godly power and your memories. I made it so I knew you would find it, and you did.\" She smiled sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about my earthly parents? I really want to go home, but they are going to miss their son.\" I immediately sensed what she would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunatly you can't come back. He took your power from you forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tiara is your only link to home, but you can't live there. You've been tainted.\" She began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe embraced with a hug, and I began to cry as well as all of my memories began to finally settle in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to stay here?\" I said through tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you can protect these people. You can be their champion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a superhero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You can do anything you want, anything. You're a goddess and can do anything. But you have to learn responsibility.\" She said  this through tears as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will mom. Can I ever take it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it will always be by your side. Noone can take it from you.\"</span></div></div>",
