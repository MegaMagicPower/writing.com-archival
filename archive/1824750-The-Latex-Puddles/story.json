After nearly an hour of tossing and turning, you decide to go for a walk to lose some of that excess energy that's keeping you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you travel down the dark and empty streets, breathing in the crisp night air and gazing at the brilliant tapestry of stars above you, you suddenly hear a scream. Quickly, you rush to the spot where you heard the commotion, and as you near it you pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral meters ahead stands a man beneath a streetlight, his back turned but his body visibly shaking. Just a few feet beyond him stands his assailant - a snarling shadow obscured by the darkness, with the silhouette of a massive dog (or rather, that would be its silhouette were it not standing upright on two legs). While the beast is certainly terrifying, even from your limited view of it, you can't help but be curious as the slightest bits of it seem to shine, almost as though its flesh was reflective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happens. Without warning, the dog-like creature pounces at the man, entering the streetlight's glow and giving you a good look at it. You hear a strange noise as the beast, some sort of wolf with some very human features (perhaps the other way around; it's such a blend of the two that it's hard to tell), decends on this poor sap, teeth bared and skin... purple? You blink, too amazed to even think of helping the person now pinned by this monster. It's skin shines in the light, and the sound it had made earlier is now unmistakable to you as the sound of latex squeaking against latex. This thing is made of rubber?</span></div></div>",

The latex coats your body in it's entirety, making it blue and shiny. Your body starts to morph into the form of a small blue bird. You'd expect it would be painful but it isn't. It is quite pleasurable. You want everyone to experience this overwhelming pleasure. But as soon as it started, it ended. You crawl out of the puddle and look over to your left, seeing a huge dragon craw out of the multi color puddle. It is large and black in color. With neon green spikes running down it's back and tail. It's eyes are the same green color. Judging it's height against the trees around it, it is about 25 feet tall. Using the same points of reference, you are about 6 inches tall. You are a small blue bird with tiny black eyes. You look around and can't see the anthro dog anywhere. The dragon looks like it is doing the same but unlike you, he doesn't seem to notice you. He starts to check out his new body a bit. Since you are in the same predicament, you might as well try to make friends with the dragon. He could protect you and help you with turning others.</span></div></div>",

It's only when you've gotten mere feet from his face when he finally notices you. He doesn't react, only follows you with his eyes as you land on his muzzle. The latex under your feet molds around your talons, allowing you to grip onto the dragon easier. He stares at you, watching your every movement. You open your beak to speak, but realize that you don't even know if you can in this form. You hear strange noises come out of your beak but you can understand yourself just fine, and it looks like the dragon can as well. You introduce yourself to the dragon and tell it about your plan with sticking together and turning everyone into latex. The dragon seems to listen to the whole thing, but never says a word on the matter. Just as you finish up, you see movement out of the corner of your eye. The dragon's tongue slips out of his mouth and starts to move up towards you. Are you able to get out of the way in time?</span></div></div>",

You stay still while he does this, maybe moving a bit to give him better access to different parts of your body, but other than that you lay limp and submissive. You hope that your submissive attitude will make the dragon more willing to let you live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing up with your underside, he flips you over and starts to lick your back, massaging the latex that makes it up.

The tongue on top of you seems to grow in front of your eyes, but no, you are actually shrinking. You don't care about any of this though, you are in pure bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon smothers you with his tongue, you squirm underneath it, hugging it with your wings. It doesn't take long for you to shrink down and regain your senses. You crawl out from underneath the dragon's tongue and stand up again, the dragon nudging you playfully with his tongue. Judging by how much bigger everything is now, you must've shrunk down to at most an inch, maybe even down to half an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon opens it's mouth, allowing you to see outside for the first time in what felt like forever. The dragon is flying along at a high altitude but you aren't bothered by the thin air, more of the cold than anything else. You try to make your way forward to the edge of the dragon's mouth, the dragon's teeth forming enough of a wind barrier to allow you to walk forward without much difficulty. The only problem is that the tooth you are behind is blocking your view, fortunately, the dragon has a a solution for that. He uses his tongue to shift you over so that you can see outside, while keeping his tongue behind you to make it so that you are able to stay in one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in awe of the sight you are beholding. You and the dragon are flying high above the clouds, allowing you to see a clear blue sky and a white expanse below you, spreading as far as your eyes can see. The dragon then uses it's tongue to move you up to his head, placing you on top of his muzzle. The latex that he is made of molds around you and holds you firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you fly around like this for about an hour before you notice that the dragon is flying down to the ground. He is going at a shallow angle so it takes some time for the dragon to finally touch down. When he finally does, the latex that holds you in place releases you. You move onto the dragons head and he starts walking. What is his plan?</span></div></div>",

This delay is just enough for the dragon's tongue to grab onto you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue seems to have a liquid on it that feels similar to saliva. The dragon's tongue wraps around the lower part of your body and drags it into his mouth. Only your head and upper body are sticking out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle but you are unable to escape. You feel the dragon lick your body, coating it in that strange saliva like substance. After getting completely coated by the liquid, even your head, you feel something enter your cloaca. It is the tip of the dragon's tongue. You thrash around, trying to resist, but the dragon's grip on you tightens. You start to feel the same pleasure that you felt when you first transformed, you start to pant and try to get more of the tongue inside of your vent. The dragon obliges and you rock your head back in bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of this, you look down and see your upper chest start to turn black, just like the dragon. You were unable to see your tail and wings but if you were able to, you would've seen them turn black with neon green undersides. It doesn't take long for your color change to be complete, finishing with your eyes and the inside of your beak turning a brilliant neon green color. If you were able to see your insides, you would've seen them turn neon green as well. Your new color reflects the dragon's color scheme. The changes come to a close when the dragon bites down on you with one tooth penetrating you dead center in the middle of your chest. You scream out in pain but as soon as the pain had come, it was gone. In place of your puncture wound, was a profile of a dragon's head, glowing neon green. This marked you as the dragon's property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are exhausted after the whole ordeal and the dragon seems to know that as it tilts it's head back, opening it's mouth to let you slide down it's tongue into the glowing green abyss that is it's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide down it's throat with ease due to all of the saliva like liquid on you. You come to a stop in the dragon's crop. It is pretty roomy for a creature of your size. You can easily move around in it, even stretch your wings without touching the sides. But you can hardly think about moving. You are so exhausted. The walls around you pulsate and glow with a dim green light. You hear soft noises around you, you link those to the dragon's body. It sounds like a normal body would sound, not like you had ever been in one, but what you would imagine a normal flesh and blood body would sound like. The latex the walls of the crop are made of is incredibly soft. All of these minor details combine to make what is possibly the most comfortable sleeping situation you've ever been in. Your eyes start to close as you drift off to sleep, your exhaustion finally getting to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon smiles, knowing that your transformation was successful. It will have a lot of fun with you in the future. The question is, what will it do with you anyways?</span></div></div>",

The lioness turned to the other two goo creatures and started making some strange noises to the other two. You could not understand what they were saying perhaps they were communicating with each other or fighting over territory. You could tell which one was 'speaking' because they all sounded wildly different. You assumed the snake was the one that had all the hissing and extra s's. The hawk sounded a little screeches/chrips and the loin was the voice that sounded strangely feminine but guttural roars. You had a bad feeling about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the other side of the door the goo creatures continued their standoff. They all wanted to eat/transform you the door and each other getting in the way. They argued among themselves until the lioness had and idea. The lioness told them on that alone none of them would get the human but together, together they were stronger. They looked at each other and hissed/chirped in agreement. The lioness walked up to the anthro hawk and pounced on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness humming happily as she opened her mouth and began to slowly swallow him whole. As much as she relished his taste she knew the human would taste much better as she filled her greatly distended belly to the point where her paws barely touched the floor. She rubbed her belly and began to concentrate. Her belly started to shrink, she grew in size, a pair of brown wings spouted from her back her breasts grew to a massive size, new set of balls, she grew a cock, and her fur became slightly darker. She then strutted up to the snake towering over it, stroked its chin with is paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she just had to try out her new appendage she grabbed the serpent with her paw and forced it down her new cock. The feeling she had as inch after inch slid into her body was nothing short of orgasmic bliss. The feeling of its latex scales, the girth of it body widening as she continued, the fullness of its balls as they filled with serpent made her unbearable horny. Once inside the lioness tail sank into her body the serpent head burst forth from the hole alongside with most of its body that wasn't absorbed. Her serpent tail reached around her body to give her a kiss and she admired her new figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown to about 8 feet tall, 25 feet long (15 feet was her tail), hyper size breasts bigger then a beanbag chair, large avian cock, volleyball sized nuts, a cream colored belly, tan colored fur, huge brown wings, a gigantic ass to boot, with a snatch to match and last but not least her new snake tail. The lioness had thought herself to be the peak of perfection but her new form blew her old one out of the water. She was no longer just a lowly lioness she was something much greater, smarter even, she had become a sphinx. She turned her attention back to the door and the human hiding behind it. She snickered to herself maybe she should thank you because thanks to you she has become a sphinx but daring to refuse your mistress was unforgivable to her. That a lowly human managed to get one up on her plus refuse to become something infinitely better got her mad. She was going to teach you the proper respect and then and maybe then she might uplift you from you decrepit humanity by turning you a goo creature. Only then will the humans learn their rightful place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with this one she slammed her head into the door this time the metal door started to buckle. This door will not deny her and neither will this human! You were felt a wave of panic wash over you as she renewed her assault on the door, it was like a nightmare.
