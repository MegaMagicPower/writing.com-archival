An unknown amount of time passes by however as you begin to dream.  You dream of being outside, you try to speak but find that difficult, instead hearing the coarse cries of an animal as you trot naked through the woods outside this house, feeling the dirt beneath your hardened feet.  Your body feels strange.. and yet.. natural, somehow, you think as you look down your rubbery snout, reaching a cloven like hand up to touch it, squealing in shock.  It is dark out and you're lost in the woods.  Somewhere in the distance you can hear the maid, Missy calling out for you, \"here, Piggy Piggy\" she says, accentuating the \"Piggy\" part, hitting home that you're no longer human, you turn to look, seeing her somehow way off in the distance, \"come swine! come get your slop! hahaha!\" She laughs splashing some nasty brown water into a trough, complete with half eaten apples and carrots on top, floating about.  You wake with a start.  It is dark out.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie! Dinners ready\" You hear distantly from down below, groggily turning over and looking at the LCD clock on your bed rest, the only source of illumination besides the golden setting sun in the distance, not giving much light as it sinks below the distant horizon.  \"Jamie! I wont say it again, dinners ready, come on down or you don't get anything to eat\" you hear from your mum although she sounds not too serious, more joking really.  With a stretch you stumble out of bed, for a moment thinking about how good that slop will be shaking the dream from your head as you tidy your clothes and head down the hallway, socks tapping and flopping quietly against the hard inlaid wood floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There you are Jamie, I was just about to head upstairs for you, come sit down, Missy has prepared us a meal, isn't it wonderful?\"   your mum says as you take a seat at the table, Missy speaking up, \"Oh, I'm sure you'll just love living here, I'll make sure there's always.. plenty to eat\" She says, shooting a warm, if not cryptic look your way.  The table has an amazing amount of food, almost like a set out of a movie, steaming corn on the cob, cornbread! Jello, some cranberry sauce, fried chicken as well as a few slices of steak, warm potatoes with butter melted on them and some fancy rolls off to the side, and oh yes.. one cannot forget the casserole.   \"I thought i'd warm you up with some of my very own home cooking\" Missy says, not actually eating too much herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the veritable smorgasbord of food laid out before you.  Everyone has already begun to dig in, consuming a rather large amount of food.  You family seems to be acting slightly off, eating hungrily, as if starved.  You shrug and look at the tasty vittles.  You..</span></div></div>",
