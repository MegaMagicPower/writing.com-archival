It was the same instrument that he had before he banished you to this animal infested realm.

Obviously your facade of strength fails to impress the mysterious figure as he speaks leaving both you and the twin tailed tinkerer speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now. No need to get in a fit. After all, it's not as if you have the means to challenge me anyway. You'd best remain silent while I speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that and in one swift motion, the male flipped the cane in his hand as if he was holding some sort of bludgeoning weapon decorated with a diamond hilt. Swinging it, only one arc had enough force to knock both you and the fox to the ground. The odd thing was that aside from one arm, his body didn't move. One arm seemed to have enough power to slam you and Tails against the ground. Smirking under his masquerade the male chuckled darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I have your attention, I will tell you something. I am an advisor of sorts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost immediately upon entering the infirmary under gun point, the girl named Rico hit me in the back of the head, rendering me unconscious. I woke up hours later but did not dare open my eyes, not just yet. Unknown to me, inside a darkened room, opposite of a mirror window, camera and sound equipment caught every move and sound inside the room I was in. A woman worked at a computer station, giving me an occasional, curious, glance.  The door opened and she turned to see the man, Jon casually enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cIs he still asleep, Crystal?\u201d he asked, easing the door closed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The woman, Crystal nodded.  \u201cIt\u2019s probably the first good night\u2019s sleep the poor kid\u2019s had in a while.\u201d  she turned to him. \u201cDid the medical staff find anything interesting in their examination?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cHis cybernetic design his very similar to the girl\u2019s, only, his nanite production unit is slightly larger and it seems to be taking in a lot more bio electric power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cThat explains a lot.\u201c pondered Crystal. \"He kept muttering something about the hard line. I'm guessing they are who were controlling him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon nodded. \"They are a new group of extremists, out to take over the former Soviet countries.\" Darkly, he said. \u201cWe found that the nanites never altered his mind, which confirms the fact that this Hard Line was only able to get their hands on the first phase of nanite injections which we used to improve upon the girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cOnce they figure that out, they will try to obtain the second phase.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jon nodded. \u201cWhich is why we need to work fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Crystal turned back to the mirror window, at me, still 'sleeping' in the bed. \u201cDo you think we should wake him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cNo.  Let him wake up on his own.  We\u2019ll see how he reacts to his new surroundings before we approach him.\u201d he paused, thinking. \u201cThe drugs we pumped him with should keep him fairly calm but, after that chase in town, I\u2019m willing to bet he\u2019s going to be very hungry.  Contact Tom the moment he wakes up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jon then left the room, quietly closing the door behind him. I was both curious and afraid, having heard the entire conversation. What were their plans for me? I thought of this Hard Line and suddenly gained all information about them including their future plans. Was that what the G-Man had in mind for me? To help these cyborg girls defeat this new terror threat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pondered over what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt like your life was going nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just wanted to curl up in your bed and just watch your favorite anime, Fairy Tail. You were fascinated by the magic and action it presented every Episode. All of the comedy, drama, romance, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that it was getting dark and starting to rain. You looked toward the forest that was right next to the road. Deciding it'd be faster that's just going around it, you stepped into the woods. The trees provided some cover from the downpour, but you still managed to get wet. \"This sucks,\" you said to yourself. \"This whole reality sucks! I wish I could go to a new world like Fairy Tail! Where there's action! Where I can learn something unique and finally be somebody! Maybe fall in love...\" You rambled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearing a waterfall, you heard the lighting strike a nearby tree. You could hear the word cracking and noticed it was moving. It then started to fall in your direction. You panicked and moved to dodge it, barely. It crashes right next to you, but the impact launched you in the air, off the cliff of the waterfall. You dream as you fall thirty feet into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way down, you noticed that the water was glowing, though you were too terrified of dying to notice. You splashed into the water and lost consciousness. While you were out, your body disappeared into the glowing water. You were being transported into another dimension, one that you wished to be in for so long. The world of Fairy Tail.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
