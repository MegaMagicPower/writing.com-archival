Alright not so filling. At least not anymore. It now took Logan four large omelettes to fill what had previously been easily filled by one.<br>\r\nLogan fell asleep after quietly flicking through the channels on the t.v. and finding nothing that caught his interest. It had been half an hour since he woke up but it was already noon. None of the shows that entertained him were on at noon.<br>\r\nWhen he woke up Logan headed for the kitchen and ate his way through nineteen tacos, loaded with sour cream, lettuce, meat, cheese, and tomatoes. dessert consisted simply of a pint of ice cream.<br>\r\nHe returned to the television with four bags of potatoe chips and a can of dip. He sat there for a few hours before finishing the chips (and a few other snacks he found) and heading for dinner.

He was walking to the tv when Wade asked him to help him move the futon. Wade was a slim fellow, for a mutant anyway and often need help moving stuff. Logan was more than happy to oblige. He went to the end of the futon and lifted it, well he would have if he was normal, as it were her grunted and his flabby arms were jiggling and shaking trying to lift the end of the futon.

Halfway through the gorging he realizes he can't reach as far as he used to and looks down to see his belly had grown to a full beer belly, thanks in part to the special brand of beer Wade had set out for him, but also because of all the food he ate. However, he didn't feel any pain from overeating. In fact he was still hungry, he felt hungrier then when he had started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he begins to dig in again Wade comes back up with more more food and sees Logan's belly.

His pecs, which had once stood firm, forming a crest in his chest, were now soft and squishy. His legs had thickened and his rear had gained form. Since he had finally shaved his growing beard, the double chin he had been sporting had become more noticeable.<br>\r\nDespite all this, the main thought in his mind was merely how hungry he was despite having eaten breakfast only about half an hour earlier.<br>\r\nHe knew his muscles were slowly morphing into more flab from his neglect and that his eating binges are not helping but he just couldn't stop himself. Every meal Asterth had prepared so far was unique with new savory mouth-watering delicacies. Once he took a single bite his hunger would take over and he would become a mindless, feeding beast.<br>\r\nYet despite all the time he had spent with Asterth the boy still wouldn't tell him about his mutation, his ability.<br>\r\nFinally giving up his struggle Logan dropped the jeans and put on a pair of sweat pants.

'A long time, and about fifty pounds,' Logan mused internally, idly scratching at his stomach as he peered up at the ceiling. There was quite a bit more stomach than there had once been, a good four inches worth was his own estimate, but he wouldn't know for sure for a couple 'months, just like he wouldn't know his weight. That was part of the deal: after the first weigh-in and measuring, they were flying (or eating) blind until the time was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kayla had first mentioned this \"feeding\" thing, he had agreed to try it for six months. If by the end of that time he wasn't happy with it, then he'd lose the weight and Kayla would never mention it again. But if he liked it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was probably a much bigger stomach in his future, because only four months in and he was already addicted to this. After the first few weeks he grew to like the feel of eating until he was achingly stuffed, his stomach distended and sore from the meal he had consumed. It made him feel like a man, like he could provide for his woman. If he could afford enough food to grow fat, then he could take care of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also helped that Kayla practically worshiped every ounce of flab he had added to his frame; she routinely caressed his soft mound of belly flab, cupped the softening flesh of his pecs and nibbled at his fleshier chin when they kissed. Kayla had been responsible for many a night's bellyache, lovingly feeding him midnight snacks that were practically meals themselves, until he felt like he'd pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of feeding...</span></div></div>",

The only ones left at the X-mansion besides Wolverine were Charles Xiaver, Hank McCoy, his clone and adopted daughter, Laura Kinney, and some of the new students that enrolled a month ago. Logan quickly showered and changed into a clean set of clothes. With nothing happening he might as well relax before he trains some more. Just as Logan was heading to the kitchen for some food he noticed one of the new students reading a book. The student was a ten year old girl named Nora Spectrum. She was recently taken in last month when her powers developed. She was an orphaned girl whose parents had died in a terrible car crash. Left with no immediate family to take her in she was promptly placed in a foster home. Her last foster home decided somewhere that could deal with her \"condition\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since her parents passed Nora started see people's auras.That coupled with her enigmatic nature turned away many potential families.

He prepares a couple of burgers and a bowl of chips. As he eats Logan enjoys some television. He quickly scarfed up his food and headed back to the kitchen.

I think I ate more than I usually do. Nothing like a good workout can fix.\" Logan said as he patted his bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan then goes to his room and passes out on his bed.

With this in mind Logan secretly devised an operation to capture the duplicates and interrogate them, but the thing that alluded his mind was his growing problem. Sure he'll get himself tested for the Fat Virus, but right now the mission was the only thing on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo being the best at what he does Logan decided to play along with the duplicates, but now the day has come to put Operation Stakeout into full force. Yet Wolverine was currently struggling to button his pants due to his weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! I know I put on some weight due to whatever that crazy doc injected me with, but I should have burned this flab off by now.

Little did they realize was their son had a huge future ahead of him. Eleven years later tragedy struck as a band of thieves murdered Logan's parents in front of his eyes. The trauma caused the poor boy to mutate. With a blood curdling scream Logan's claws emerged. Driven by grief and despair the boy avenged his fallen parents. Still reeling from the trauma Logan fled home with a girl around his age who actually helped tutor him in a variety of subjects. James Logan Howlett would not experience his secondary mutation until ten years later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan and his friend, Rose, fled as an intimidating man walked out of the burning mansion. This man would later be a thorn in Logan's side many years from now. The two fled as far as a mining village. It was there they would spend the next ten years before tragedy would strike again. As time went on the boy grew into a strong powerful man. Standing at 5'8\" and donning a strong stocky build Logan made a decent living as a miner. Then one fateful day tragedy struck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right after his marriage to his new wife, Rose, that Logan blacked out. When he came to he was horrified to find his beloved wife laying dead in front of him. It was then he fled and as he fled his secondary mutation became active. However, not all was as it seemed for a certain villain watched as Rose came back to life. Unknown to Rose she had latent mutant abilities such as psychokinesis and the ability to resurrect herself from the dead with out a single scratch on her. Shocked that she was still alive she tried to find her husband, unfortunately Rose found no sign of Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismayed at what had just occurred and realizing that she had abilities she couldn't understand Rose wept. As she was weeping the villain known as Romulus made his move. Seeing that the young woman was ripe for manipulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong lass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose raises her head to acknowledge the giant stranger that stood before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M... My husband... I can't find him! For whatever bizarre he went berserk. I even died because of it! But seeing as I some how came back to life he's gone. Knowing Logan he's probably freaking out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomulus knowing that the woman was a mutant decided to mold her as a weapon against Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely child he must of left because you were dead. He has no reason to care for you anymore. If you were to waltz up to him out of the blue he'll never believe it would be you. By then he would have moved on and found someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRomulus grinned wickedly as he saw the young woman before him boil with anger. Objects around her began to levitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case I'll make sure no one can have him! I'll make him rue the day he left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good lass. Focus your anger on revenge. If you come with me I'll teach you all you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Rose left with Romulus to eventually create the Weapon X Program. Now as the years passed Logan gradually piled on the pounds. The turmoil of the accidental death of his wife had turned Logan into a bingeing machine. Sure Logan still worked out, but his thoughts were turned towards eating. It was through overindulging that James Logan Howlett found solace. Despite his hefty frame Logan served in the military for two World Wars!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during his time in service that Logan became known as the Blob. Equipped with an organic admantium coating that would cover his claws when they were exposed and gravity manipulation powers Blob was a deadly force to deal with. Now in the present and after being freed from the Weapon X program for several years Logan was now a full fledged superhero and world renowned chef and wrestler.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As for his weight Logan weighed a whopping 600 lbs. The Blob truly lived up to his codename. Whether in the wrestling ring or out fighting crime no one could truly make James Logan Howlett budge an. Appearance wise Logan had a very fat and stocky appearance with wide shoulders, bulky arms and legs that were somewhat coated with his massive muscles, a large rear that could easily break someone's bones if Logan jumped high enough, a rugged fat face that donned a thick beard, and to top it all off an enormous belly. All these features plus abundant body hair are what usually defined Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone didn't know better they would assume that Logan always enjoyed being a fat man, but the opposite was true. During World War I Logan was almost 300 lbs. No matter how hard he tried to shed weight it only stuck to his figure. By the end of the war Logan's heft helped saved a lot of lives. From that time onward Logan became proud of his size and decided to keep gaining at a steady pace. Currently Logan was working in one of the restaurants he owned. Another advantage to being a big man was having a refined palette. This allowed Logan to cook a variety of dishes. It was also a hobby of his that he pursued during the off season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis job as a wrestler and chef made the Blob one of the wealthiest men in the United States and Canada. Despite his wealth Blob was still victim of size discrimination from critics and the very few mutant haters that exist. Blob however just ignored the critics and kept on going. One day as Logan was working in the restaurant he was visited by a few of his pals who were also Avengers. The Avengers who came to visit were Captain America, Wasp, Iron Woman, and his good buddy Beast. It wasn't until he was bring out there order that he stopped to chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ain't the Avengers. What brings ya here to my restaurant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just decided to grab a bite and to check on our big pal.\" Captain America said before she took a bite out of her burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just like your father. I'm sure he's told you that we fought in World War II together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has. Yet stopping here for a bite isn't our only business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ain't? What else do you intend on doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our scanners picked up some strange activity in an abandoned research facility.\" Iron Woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you need my help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. We suspect it could be Weapon X. For some reason they started there experiments again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? I can definitely lend a hand. My restaurant will be closing early today so it shouldn't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic! Yet you might need a new suit. It looks like you outgrew your last one.\" Wasp said before he took a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong about that Jeremiah. You sure do take after your cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro. It was her noble sacrifice that encouraged me to become the Wasp in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours Logan had closed up for the night and met with the Avengers. They then proceeded to Avengers Tower. After arriving at Avengers Tower Wasp gave Blob his new costume. It was primarily black with yellow trim. The costume also included a cowl that he would put on like his other costumes. After putting on the costume Blob was relieved that Wasp had thought ahead by making the costume stretchy in case Logan decided to pack on more weight, which in his case was inevitible since his manager insisted that getting bigger would attract more viewers and more viewers meant a larger paycheck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to check out first?\" Logan asked as he crossed his huge meaty arms across his equally meaty chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question Logan. Natalie, where was that signal coming from again?\" Captain America asked Iron Woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Woman then states that the plan is to...</span></div></div>",

The only proof of her existence is a digitized recording of her voice. However I can't dedigitize her voice to see what she really sounds like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the great Natalie Stark is struggling with something like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Logan! I have been up all night. I even asked my dad to help me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you act exactly like Tony. No need to admit that you're not always right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you too Sharon! You always think you're better than me because your the original Captain America's daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies! Knock it out! We have a mission to complete and already you two are bickering.\" Beast yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but as long as I can get this mission done I will be fine.\" Natalie retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan rolls his eyes at the whole situation. It was no doubt Iron Woman and Captain America acted like their fathers. But now was the time to act and Logan didn't want some woman to keep Weapon X running. He would rather intimidate her with his claws and lock her up then to let others suffer the torture he has received all those years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go! The longer we spend here the harder it would be to track her down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avengers agree with Blob's statement and take a Quinjet to the lab. The lab was located in the middle of nowhere, in the state of Texas. Nothing except cacti and sand could be found near the building. When the Avengers arrived Blob used his organic ademantium claws to open the door. From there the Avengers split up to find Midnight Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan was walking down a long and narrow corridor. The corridor was so narrow that he had to use his gravity powers to allow him enough room to walk comfortably. As Logan walk towards the main lab he started to get flashes of his past. The flashes came quickly, but he remembered a telepath that worked with Romulus. He couldn't properly sense the telepath but he knew the telepath was responsible for screwing with his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the door the sight he saw astonished him. Before him stood a woman with red hair dressed in a black and red cloak. Her back was turned towards Logan, but the strangest thing was that she smelled familiar to Blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... You're supposed to be dead! Is that really you?\" Logan questioned the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it isn't my ex-husband who killed me and left me alone. I can sense that you found a way to satisfy your sorrows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan looked on in confusion as the woman he knew was no longer the same woman. Instead she sounded more vile and wicked than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell has happened to you? It was you who encouraged me to become a hero despite my methods not being nice. It's like your a different woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a different woman thanks to you. If it wasn't for you I wouldn't have discovered my powers. Yet I'm surprised you don't remember me using them on you. That's right I wiped your memories and turned you into Weapon X!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan cringes as Rose uses her powers to unlock memories that he lost long ago. Painful memories of Rose wiping his mind and cackling wickedly. Logan wondered if this was real. How could the woman he loved have become a supervillain? As the memories came back Logan entered into a berserker rage. Rose cackles evilly as Logan loses control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right my dear James. Lose control! hehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight Rose picks up a flash drive and teleports out of the lab while Blob goes on a rampage.

All mutants and pretty much the whole world was fat. Being fat had been socially acceptable since anyone last remembered. That's because this is Plus Earth, an alternate universe where everybody is fat even the women. Yet when it comes to gaining weight it is mainly a male pastime since many women already viewed themselves as the pinnacle of beauty. Now Plus Earth isn't without its own set of problems. Villains still try to take over the world, but with heroes like the X-men and Avengers they don't stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow one mutant was striving to be the best at what he does. That mutant is known as Wolverine aka James Logan Howlett. Born in 1856, James or as most call him Logan, is a mutant with a regenerative healing factor, claws that transform into adamantium upon exposure to air via a liquid metal coating. Unlike the Wolverines from the other universes, Logan lives an exciting life filled with many pleasantries coupled with obstacles. Born to a well to do family this Wolverine was indulged from the crib onward. As a child Logan was heavier than his peers. He was tutored in every subject and lived quite a good life. His life changed when his parents were murdered. Upon seeing his parents murdered his mutation manifested. In a fit of anger he got his revenge on his parents' killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then fled with his best friend Rosanne. After several years Logan had grown into a huge man. At 6'3\" and weighing at least 600 lbs. He finally married his childhood sweetheart who weighed half as much as he did. They had plans to move out of Canada and to the States, but that plan was put on hold when his wife had been kidnapped one night. Wolverine tired searching for his missing wife, but ran into deadends. Without his loving wife his weight plateaued at 625 lbs. and he has stayed that weight ever since that incident. Logan, as a result of endless searching, has lived and fought in many wars and traveled the earth. It wasn't until 30 years has passed that he accepted that his wife is probably long gone. It would take the same weird cause and kidnapper to reveal if his wife was truly alive after 100 years or so of being missing from the face of the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Wolverine enjoyed his time as a superhero, but couldn't shake the feeling that he had to know if Rosanne is truly gone from his life. Despite that he's not going to let the other X-men outweigh him any longer. Wolverine is determined not to only prove that he's the best at what he does, but if he can get closure to the question plaguing  his mind then he can finally move on with his love life.

Normally he would only eat huge meals, but if he wanted to get past his 625 lb. plateau he'll have to eat around the clock and after every training session. A few other X-men were relaxing in the oversized pool, such as Blob, Phoenix, Colossus, Storm, and Iceman. Unlike Prime Earth these versions were different from their mainline universe counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blob, aka Fred Dukes, for instance is the world's fattest superhero, man, and athlete. As a young adult he quickly moved up in the world of sumo wrestling and became the world's youngest Yokuzuna. Like Wolverine he has a regenerative healing factor, but he can also control gravity. The Phoenix, aka Jean Grey, is more open about being a polygamist than her mainline universe counterpart. She has attempted to persuade Wolverine to become one of her many boyfriends, but she knows from reading his mind that Wolverine would only consider it if his estranged wife who vanished one night was long dead. Iceman, aka Bobby Drake, Admitted on day that he was into sologamy, in other words in love with himself. Ever since he came out of the closet he had been going out on many dates with himself and is currently self-engaged and plans to marry himself soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the life.

Their base of operations is Genosha, a U.S. Territory founded by Senator Erik Lensherr, aka Magneto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that madman again.

Having gained a total of 25 lbs. or 2 lbs. a day Wolverine now tips the scales at 650 lbs. When Logan finally decided to gain more weight two weeks ago he sought out fellow X-Man Fred for ideas of good diets, Blob had suggested a diet where Wolverine would exponentially gain weight each month. The name of the diet is called the Mountain Man Diet. The basics of the Mountain Man Diet includes strenuous workout sessions to boost hunger followed by huge meals and several snacks at key parts of the day. The way the Mountain Man Diet is designed is that all men who start the diet start off by gaining two pounds a day for a month. With each consecutive month pounds gained per day go up by one. within a year those on the Mountain Man Diet gain at least twelve pounds per day due to the body's nonexistent metabolism and a gradual increase in complicity. Usually by that time most men's weights would plateau unless genetics and mutations come into play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now Logan was currently eating a post-workout meal.

A modest space about the size of a three-car garage (with a few adjacent rooms to hold the larger and more elaborate pieces of equipment) the lab under the X-Manor had been key in unlocking many of the universe's greatest secrets and was Hank's second home, as evidenced by the organized mess he often left on the counters, and a few empty Twinkie wrappers here and there. When he wasn't gallivanting halfway across the world, universe or some alternate dimension with the rest of the X-Men, the majority of his spare time was spent here, furthering his experiments in the name of science! Or just plain curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBroad-shouldered, blue-furred, and gifted with hands and feet the size of Christmas hams, Hank was not your typical genius-level scientist. But while his physical features were all a result of his particular X-gene mutation, he had learned to use them rather than let them impede him. Currently hanging upside down from an overhead bar by his opposable toes (he felt that the inverted blood flow helped him think more clearly), the bestial-featured mutant carefully metered out a few drops of chemical to the solution in his large, dexterous fingers. \"Easy does it now,\" he murmured to himself. \"Just a few drops, nothing to excite the chemical reaction before we're ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne drop.

You're not gonna believe this!\" Now, while Hank was known for his agility,  Bobby's sudden outbursts always managed to render him a klutz. Shouting in surprise, he fumbled the beaker in his hand and it dropped to the floor, smashing and spilling the solution and bits of glass over the tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lean teenager stood in the doorway, frost clinging to his skinny frame from his temperature-driven mutant power. Blinking at the mess, now underneath the upside-down Beast, bobby broke into a grin. \"Gee, Hank, if you're experimenting with how big a mess you can make, I'd say you were pretty successful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank sighed in resignation and carefully flipped himself onto a nearby counter, perching on the edge to avoid stepping in the mess on the floor. \"Yes, Bobby, thank you. I'll make sure to note that in my journal. Now, to what do I owe your exuberant entrance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby grinned, leaning against the door frame and inspecting his fingernails. \"Oh, not much, only that the <i>Blob</i> showed up on the front lawn and started tearing up the place while you were down here playing with your chemistry set. No big deal, though. That whole \"no one moves the Blob\" thing? Myth busted. His fat ass is totally in the holding cells right now, thanks in part to yours truly. Just thought you should know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank arched a furry blue eyebrow, hopping over to the door in one graceful leap. \"Fredrick Dukes just walked up to the school and attacked without provocation? By himself? What about the other Brotherhood mutants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby shrugged, not one to really think too deeply on bad-guy motives. \"I dunno. Maybe he was on his lunch break? Oh! And speaking of which, he's huge! And not like his usual huge-huge, but <i>super-sized</i> huge-huge! Dude's gotta weigh twice what he used to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank's brow furrowed further. Something was certainly strange about all of this. \"I think we ought to pay Mr. Dukes a visit, Bobby. You can help me clean up this mess later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the holding cell block, Hank discovered that Bobby hadn't been exaggerating. Normally a staggering half-ton in weight, the Blob seemed to have ballooned to twice that size as well as add an extra foot or so to his height, making his holding cell look awfully cramped. Smothering the small cot provided with his enormous rear end, the Brotherhood mutant seemed resigned to his current situation, smiling smugly. Hank was baffled, something that didn't happen often. \"Good lord, Dukes, and here I thought it wasn't possible for you to get any larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlob laughed, causing his huge, round, spandex-covered belly to bounce between his tree-trunk thighs. \"Ha! You wanna squeeze in here and make that comment, fuzzball? I'll sit on ya so hard it'll squeeze the blue out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank sighed, pushing his spectacles up along the bridge of his nose. \"Charming. And just what possessed you to lay siege to the Xavier school single-handedly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlob shrugged his massive shoulders. Every movement made his body wobble and shake, which seemed to fascinate Bobby. \"My mutant power developed, or hadn't ya noticed? Got bigger, stronger, figured I'd see what I could do, and what better way to test it out than on you X-Geeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank shook his head. \"And here I thought you could be smarter than that, Fredrick. I'm sure we've told you before that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. well, I suppose you'll have plenty of time to think it over while we figure out what to do with you. Bobby, stop staring. it's rude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlob watched the two X-Men walk away, his grin growing larger, speaking under his breath so they wouldn't hear. <i>\"The bigger they are, huh? Let's see how hard</i> you <i>fall, fuzzball...\"</i> He'd been telling the truth, after all. Most of it, anyway. His new mega-heavyweight size <i>was</i> because of a new change in his mutation, but it hadn't been the <i>only</i> change. He'd let himself get captured by the X-men so he could have a little fun with his powers, and his first target was going to be the Beast himself.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hank found himself still deep in thought over the strangeness of Blob's attack on the school as they headed for the elevators. \"It just doesn't make sense, Bobby. Perhaps it might have when Dukes was alone, but he's a part of the Brotherhood. When have we ever seen them on their own without someone to back them up? Are you sure Toad or Pyro wasn't lurking about? Mystique could have snuck in during the chaos...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby smiled amiably and shook his head. \"Logan sniffed around. He didn't catch a whiff of her or anyone else.\" Shrugging, he rested a hand on Hank's broad shoulder. \"Sometimes, a duck is just a duck, Blue. Or in this case, a one-ton fat dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank was about to respond on how the Blob hadn't even looked upset that he'd been captured, but was interrupted by a sudden growl from his stomach that filled the elevator before dying down to a gentle gurgle. both he and Bobby looked stunned before the smaller X-Man laughed. \"Oh man, that had to be at least a 6.0 on the Richter scale! Are you forgetting to eat when you're down in the lab, Hank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting a hand on his quieted stomach, Hank frowned. \"I... thought I'd eaten breakfast this morning. I'm almost certain of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby chuckled, patting his friend's shoulder. \"Well, I know Scott and jean just restocked the fridge yesterday. I'm sure you'll find something! Anyway, I'll catch you later! I gotta go gloat to Remy!\" the doors parted, and Bobby took off down the hall, making Hank chuckle. After all these years, Bobby still hadn't completely grown-up. However, another growl from his stomach diverted his train of thought. Maybe he <i>hadn't</i> eaten breakfast? Best to remedy that immediately, then, before he turned back to more pressing matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumbering to the kitchen, Hank opened up the refrigerator, considering his options. The usual assortment was there, of course. Ororo's Tupperware was neatly labeled. Tomato soup? Hmn, only a cup's worth. Who honestly considered a cup of anything a full serving in this modern America? Salad? No amount of dressing could make that a filling meal. No, he needed something with substance! Something with flavor! Something like... \"Ah, pastrami. we meet again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect! Taking out the entire package of the shredded meat, Hank also nabbed the hoagie rolls and mustard. But no... what was a pastrami sandwich without Swiss cheese? he grabbed that too, and then found himself sauntering into the walk-in cooler to add to the assortment in his arms. Lettuce! Tomatoes! Dill pickles! Olives! His stomach growled eagerly now, as if to encourage him. why stop there, after all? Pastrami wasn't the only thing he could use! Roast beef! Turkey! Bologna! Best to use that mayo, too. And what sandwich was complete without potato chips? Ah, the party bag would do nicely! And potato salad, yes! Was that macaroni salad? He hadn't had that in ages. Expertly balancing his trove of condiments, Hank set to work at the kitchen counter, making his sandwich. No, creating a culinary masterpiece that would make angels weep at the mere sight! he absently licking his lip, belly continuing to growl insistently as he piled on more meat, more cheese, more toppings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he was done, Hank's sandwich had to stand at least a foot tall, bursting at the seams with savory goodness. Seating himself, the blue-furred Beast opened his jaws as wide as he could, and took that first, big bite. Absolute heaven. His jaws ached as he took another bite, chewing, savoring, swallowing. Grabbing a serving spoon, he heaped the potato and macaroni salad onto his plate, and then tore open the bag of chips and dumped a full quarter of its contents on the remaining section. He helped himself to those in between bites of sandwich, eating as if possessed. Time and reason no longer held meaning. There was only sandwich. Was the potato salad gone already? A shame! This called for more potato chips, certainly. No more potato chips? This called for something sweet! Ah, that half-gallon of ice cream would go splendidly with that bottle of caramel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Hank was feeling full and sated, he'd left quite a mess of empty packaging on the counter top. He smiled and leaned back in his seat, the action causing a deep rumble of a belch to escape his belly. Ah, his belly; so full of food now, so content. He slowly rubbed over it with a hand, feeling the bloated curve of it pushing out over his belt line, listening to the stifled gurgle of digestion in the calm after the storm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Hank woke and stretched out the sleep from his limbs. Scratching at his soft gut, he couldn't remember the last time he'd slept so... heavily! Admittedly, he'd eaten quite a bit the previous night. After his enormous lunch, he'd managed to hold off any lingering hunger-pangs until dinner with the others, where he'd actually managed to kill several conversations with his enthusiastic glutting of Jean's amazing beef stew and mashed potatoes. By the time he'd finished off his fifth helping, quite a few of his friends were openly staring, their own first servings forgotten. Scott even absently passed Hank his bowl when asked if he was going to finish it. After a satisfied but stifled belch, Hank left the table visibly thicker around the middle than when he'd sat down, belly pushing down against his waistband, sides and rump bulging under the blue fur. But even that hadn't completely sated him, and just a few hours later he'd snuck back to the kitchen for a midnight snack. The empty gallon of ice cream lay on his floor, now, and he stooped down to pick it up, barely registering how his stomach rolled over his waistband with added weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regarded himself in his full-length mirror for a bit as he brushed out his fur, and smiled. He felt... good! It was difficult to explain why, even as the brush passed over his soft blue gut. Maybe he'd had a particularly nice dream? He vaguely recalled something about a gingerbread house, and a kindly old woman... or maybe it had been about discovering the world's largest Twinkie? Either way, he felt eager to start the day, and the only way to do that was with a hearty breakfast! Perhaps Kitty would be making waffles again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days went on, each meal Hank ate was just as large, if not larger, than the last. Something deep inside him had decided it could not be satisfied until his belly was achingly full, and so he stuffed himself on three or four large meals a day, and even though he would snack in between and sneak a large midnight morsel, he <i>still</i> felt hungry. The growling of his stomach distracted him from his work, until most of his time in the lab was spent indulging on his hidden stockpile of Twinkies while making excuses about why he'd have to skip the latest training session, or else daydreaming about his next meal. It was only every now and then during an increasingly rare moment of sated lucidity that he recognized how ridiculously tight his clothes were getting, how laughably large his stomach was growing, our how embarassingly snug his chair was becoming. And along with these alarming realizations, he would again grow concerned about Dukes' oddly docile captivity down in the holding cells. The Brotherhood hadn't even attempted a rescue as far as he knew. Maybe once the Professor returned from his visit to the Shi-ar Empire, they would get some real answers... but these concerns would always quickly pass as soon as his stomach growled again, and he'd return once more to his ever greater indulgences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was after a very full week of glutting on a truly epic scale that Hank found himself lumbering to the kitchen for his next meal. His clothes had finally decided that they were much too small (likely just a mishap with the washing machine) and he was forced to wear his snug modesty briefs, with his labcoat pulling tight over his thick arms and across his broad backside. His bared belly bounced and wobbled with every lumbering step, his gait dangerously close to becoming an outright waddle, causing his softened chest and double chin to jiggle a bit as well. His teammates stepped aside, stunned by how large Hank had become in just a week. Was this some sort of new mutation? He certainly didn't seem concerned about it... How could he not notice how he'd practically doubled his weight in so little time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hank didn't seem to care, or even notice for that matter that his new size caused his coat to bust like that. He just blamed it on the washer and drying. They must of shrunk his clothes, it certainly could be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hank walked down the halls, his soft belly bouncing with each step and peeking from his lab coat, he saw Logan. He saw the burly man round the corner, surprised at what he saw. Wolverine was naturally a strong man, but this man before him had a nice layer of pudge on him.

He kept looking at his newly fat body, feeling lost and confused before it finally hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've become fat!\" He said in shock, pushing his hands into the soft fat. \"I...

He turned around swiftly, almost throwing himself off balance and approached Logan, placing a large furry blue hand on his shoulder. \"Logan, my dear friend! You look simply famished,\" began Hank. \"Why don't we head to the cafeteria and sate that absolutely monstrous hunger you have?\" Hank smiled, placing his other hand on Logan's rather bulbous midsection. It felt pretty soft, so it wasn't as new as he thought, but it was still recent. It had to have been. Logan smiled back, emphasizing his now chubby cheeks. \"I'd be delighted, bud,\" he replied. He placed one of his own hands on Hank's big blue belly and they seemed to stop walking and just stand there, feeling each others bellies. They looked each other in the eyes and there was a sort of mutual understanding that they wanted to feel more. Logan started talking after a few moments, \"How about, er, some take-out?

As one their bellies let out rumbles of hunger, and they wasted no time in getting to the buffet-like layout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, this is a most satisfying circumstance!\" Hank said as he piled a plate high with pasta before carefully placing three large pieces of sauce-covered chicken breast on another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me,\" Logan replied, his own plate(s) much the same. \"You were right, bub, I couldn't have waited long enough for takeout!\" He shoved a roll into his mouth, chewing greedily as though he hadn't eaten in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sat down at a nearby table and quickly began to eat, their mouths only ever empty for mere seconds before being filled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan was the first to finish, leaning back in his chair and rubbing his belly, which lightly strained the buttons of his flannel shirt. \"Oh, man, that's better,\" he sighed, giving the round protrusion a satisfied pat. Hank looked up from his own meal in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend, surely you aren't finished?\" He reached over and poked Logan's belly, his eyebrows furrowed with concern. \"You look as though you're getting thinner by the second, Logan! You've got to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan grinned, squeezing his round belly in both hands. \"Well, bub, it's a good thing I ain't finished then!\" He rose to his feet and, one hand on his belly, walked back to the buffet for a refill. Hank nodded in approval as he finished his own food, giving his own belly a satisfied rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not quite satisfied. His stomach had been rather well-fed of late, and had no desire to discontinue the trend. With a grunt, the buttons of his lab coat straining lightly, Hank rose to his feet and followed Logan back to the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they sat down again, it was with each of them carrying a tray stacked with four plates each: a plate piled high with pasta, two plates with five large chicken breasts each, and a plate filled with options from the dessert bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men fell on their meals as though they were victims of famine (which the plumpness of their new bellies most definitely showed they weren't), eating with single-minded devotion as they worked to further fill their already full stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan, having been an experienced trenchman longer than Hank, again finished first, leaning back with a grunt as he rubbed his swollen belly. The buttons of his flannel shirt were straining to hold in his bulbous middle, little bits of hairy flesh showing through. Logan gave a grunt as he massaged his rounded sides. \"Man, oh man, that's some good grub, bub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank, still occupied with his own meal (and the pleasant feeling of being absolutely stuffed) chuckled lightly at the rhyme. \"Indeed. Just what the doctor ordered for a pair of growing boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing boys, indeed. The two men's bellies were noticeably rounder than when they had come in, stuffed with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" Hank continued, \"don't you think you should eat a little more? Your poor belly looks as though you haven't eaten in weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan, whose belly actually looked as though he hadn't <i>stopped</i> eating in weeks, let out a bark of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, bub!

Tufts of blue fur poked through his lab coat, the white material struggling to hold back their stuffed load. \"I believe I shall partake of more myself; I've had quite the appetite as of late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ain't the only one,\" Logan laughed, drumming his belly pointedly. \"I've been eatin' like a hog at a trough, lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hardly think you're big enough to be a hog,\" Hank said slyly, leaning over (with some difficulty, his stretched stomach protesting the action) and placing a hand on Logan's belly, gently pressing in and testing for give. He found a little, but only a little. \"If anything you're just a piglet, and a far too skinny one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A piglet, huh?\" Logan asked, reaching one hand under his belly and surreptitiously unbuttoning his jeans. That done he leaned over, grunting as his strained sides groaned at the effort, and poked a hand at Hank's own gut, which had actually popped one of his lab coat buttons as he leaned over. \"That what you are, bub? A piglet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, friend,\" Hank said, leaning back and caressing his bulging gut with one large hand. \"I'm afraid I'm a Beast.\" The two laughed at the joke, grimacing slightly as their overstuffed bellies protested the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Beast, huh,\" Logan said once he'd stopped laughing. \"Well, what if this piglet wants to be a Beast, too? What would you suggest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would suggest,\" Hank said, \"that the piglet go back to the table for more dinner. He's got a lot more fattening up to do if he wants to be like his beastly friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And would his friend be willing to help with that?\" Logan asked in a low, serious voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most assuredly,\" Hank replied, in the same tone. Logan grinned and rose to his feet, pressing one hand on his belly, testing for space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, back to the trough for piglet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank smiled as Logan walked away, enjoying the fullness of his belly. He was surprised at how easily he had brushed off the realization of his weight gain, but he supposed Logan's new heft had helped. Certainly his assertions as to Logan's \"skin and bones\" and \"thinner by the moment\" comments were as far from the mark as possible, and yet there had been something...exciting about encouraging his friend to eat, something mesmerizing in seeing that round belly expand further as Logan greedily stuffed it with food. And Logan's hog comment, and his own terms of piglet and beast for them both...and Logan's remark about helping him fatten up...he hadn't been this excited in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan returned from the food bar laden down with a full five plates, each piled as high as possible. \"My, my,\" Hank commented, \"Piglet's certainly ambitious, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan grinned as he sat down and immediately stuffed a roll dripping in butter into his mouth, chewing and swallowing as though literally starving. \"Does Beast have a problem with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most certainly not,\" Hank said, eyes riveted as his new Piglet crammed a forkful of mashed potatoes into his mouth, eyes slowly moving down to his friends bulging belly just in time to see a button fly off into space. He smiled as Logan continued to stuff himself. \"Piglets a growing boy, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink, oink.\" Logan said as he chewed and swallowed, ignoring how achingly full his stomach was as he continued to eat.</span></div></div>",

Every so he would give his own overstuffed belly an absentminded rub as it gurgled and groaned, working to digest its heavy load. He had a vague notion that his role as Beast would be best served by increasing that load, but there'd be time for that later. Right now was about Logan, his little Piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man,\" his Piglet groaned, pausing in his eating and leaning back, massaging his bulging sides, his belly hard like a rock in his lap. Two of his five plates had been cleared, but there were three more to go. \"I'm so fuckin' full. I think I'm gonna pop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank smiled and switched to the other side of the table, his gut heavy in front of him as he sat down and placed a hand on Logan's belly, caressing gently. \"Come now, Piglet,\" Logan's breath hitched slightly at the endearment, \"surely you can fit in a little more. Isn't your tummy begging for it?\" His Piglet nodded, still groaning, his belly heavy with food. Hank smiled, using his claws to lightly scritch at Logan's swollen sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so thin, Piglet,\" he said in an undertone. \"Why, if you took that shirt off, I bet I could count your ribs.\" Most unlikely, actually; Logan's chest was beefier than ever, the powerful muscle padded with a light covering of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your face...why, it's positively sunken!\" In point of fact, Logan's face had filled out a little. Not overmuch; he still possessed his rugged attractiveness, but his jaw was softer, the faintest sign of a double chin appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know what concerns me most, Piglet?\" Logan shook his head and Hank smiled, holding a roll up to Logan's mouth. His Piglet obediently opened up and took it whole, chewing slowly, eyes closed and head tilted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What concerns me most, my little Piglet,\" Hank continued, \"is your poor, poor tummy. It's so small, so underfed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tummy in question was currently holding enough food for four, and had grown remarkably plump in recent days. Not so plump as his own belly, of course, but he was the Beast, wasn't he? And it was his job to encourage his Piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you eat a little more for me, Piglet? Can you do that? Can you eat the way a fat little piggy should?\" Logan gave another moan, but then nodded, opening his eyes and leaning forward, placing a large bite of chicken in his mouth. \"Good Piggy,\" Hank said, and Logan gave him a grin as he chewed and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink, oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank gave a hearty laugh before handing his Piglet another roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal continued in this vain for another thirty minutes. Every so often his Logan would stop eating, claiming he could eat no more. And each time Hank would rub his Piglet's belly, bemoaning how woefully thin he was getting, and so his Piglet would eat some more. And finally, three popped buttons later, all five plates had been consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just in time, too. Hank honestly wasn't sure how much more his Piglet could eat; the skin of his belly was stretched tight, and Hank believed that only Logan's healing factor would prevent the formation of stretch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good piggy,\" he told his friend, caressing the obscenely stuffed belly and finding it hard as a rock. \"Good, good piggy.\" His Piglet gave him a tired oink in response, lips quirked in a pained smile, his breaths shallow. Hank stood and helped Logan to his feet, throwing one arm around the smaller man's shoulder for support and possessively cupping his Piglet's bulging, overfed tummy with the other.</span></div></div>",

By the time they reached the room Logan was leaning heavily against his Beast, his eyes heavily lidded as he fought off sleep. Hank smiled as they stepped inside, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sleep here tonight, Logan. That is, if you don't mind?\" His Piglet gave a tired grunt of affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind at all, Beast. I'da passed out in the hall if it weren't for you.\" Hank shuddered slightly at his own pet name. It occurred to him that he should maybe find another; it would hardly do for him to react like that during a mission. But he'd ponder that later; right now, he was going to enjoy having his little Piglet all to himself. Gently he guided Logan over to the bed, letting the man lay down on his back as he pulled off his boots for him. That done he slid off the unbuttoned jeans before undoing the remaining buttons and collecting the shirt. That done, he shucked his own clothes and sat down on the bed, the king size mattress groaning under his greater weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now,\" he said with a slow smile. \"you've certainly been a greedy little piggy, haven't you?\" His Piglet's belly was so stuffed with food that it was bowed out into a half sphere even with the other man on his back. He leaned over, planting a gentle kiss to the slightly hairy flesh. \"Would you say that's right, Piglet?\" His Piglet nodded in response. Hank's grin widened. \"Tell me what you are, Piglet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little piggy,\" Logan said, then gave a grunt of surprised pain as Hank pressed down hard on his swollen stomach, tutting in disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you are, Piglet? I think you've forgotten something. Tell me what you are, Piglet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan took a moment to answer, his face twisting in discomfort as Hank slowly pressed down on his aching belly, the pressure making him feel as though he would pop. Then then answer came to him just as the discomfort started to become actual pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>your</i> little piggy, Beast.\" The pressure released instantaneously, his Beast smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are, Piglet. You're my little piggy, and I'm going to fatten you up into a prize hog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you were going to make me into a Beast?\" His Piglet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you've got a long way to go before you reach Beast,\" Hank answered, flexing his biceps (still larger than Logan's own impressive ones), still visible under their thickening layer of fat. \"A long way, indeed.\" He caressed his own belly, which even now that it was empty was still bigger than Logan's gorged one. \"But don't worry, I'll help you get there eventually. But before you can become a Beast, you have to become a Hog.\" He slowly turned his Piglet onto his side and pulled him close, one arm wrapped around his chest, the other possessively cuddling the overfull tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to get so fat, Piglet,\" he whispered, idly stroking the stuffed sphere. \"I'm going to make you so plump, keep you so well-fed that your belly forgets what it feels like to be empty. Would you like that, Piglet?\" Logan nodded slowly, eyes closed and almost asleep. Hank smiled, nuzzling his Piglet's hair. \"I'd like that too, Piglet.\" Logan didn't answer this time, sleep having claimed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank lay awake for a few more minutes, enjoying holding his brand new Piglet in his arms as he planned the best ways to fatten him up. And of course he wouldn't be neglecting his own belly in this. The soft, flabby slab of furry flesh was currently squished up against his Piglet's back, pressing further against him with each slow, contented breath. It had long since finished digesting its meal, and he mentally told it to prepare for more such meals as it was now his personal goal to out-eat his little piggy at every turn; it wouldn't do to let his Piglet catch up to him, after all. What would Logan...what would <i>Piglet</i>...strive toward then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank McCoy fell asleep, a contented smile on his face.</span></div></div>",

One of the carts was a little overfull, actually, and he was looking forward to filling his belly with every last crumb of it. And part of his Piglet's, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan was awake when he entered the room this time, sitting up and rubbing his belly hungrily as he stared at the breakfast carts. \"One a those for me?\" He asked? Hank smiled, closing the door and walking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It most certainly is,\" he said, chuckling when his Piglet licked his lips. \"But first, stand up.\" Logan did so and Hank tsked, easily slipping back into the role of the concerned Beast. \"My poor, poor Piglet,\" he said, shaking his head sadly. \"Look at you.\" He cupped Logan's bulging belly in both hands, bouncing it gently up and down. \"Last night's feeding didn't do you any good at all, did it?\" Logan shook his head, cottoning on to the game as he looked down in mock sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry, Piglet?\" Hank asked, still gently bouncing the ball of fat in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How hungry, Piglet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" Hank replied. \"Why, your tummy is shrinking by the second! I can feel it getting smaller right now!\" His Piglet gave an alarmed oink, though his eyes were mischevious. \"Well, there's a solution for that, isn't there Piglet?\" Logan nodded, his belly rumbling with hunger. Hank smiled and stepped away, motioning towards the smaller of the two carts. \"Have at it, then.\" His Piglet fell on the food, not even bothering with silverware as he tore into a stack of pancakes, shoving them two at a time into his greedy mouth. Hank watched for a moment, enjoying the sight of his Piglet stuffing himself again, before he turned towards his own cart, licking his lips and rubbing his large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding his Piglet had the right idea, Hank forewent silverware, simply using his fingers. The first thing he did was take a gravy boat and tip it towards his mouth, consuming the delicious liquid in a mere few seconds. Wiping his mouth, he turned his attention towards a dish of scrambled eggs. A few minutes later he set the now empty dish down, patting his belly as he reached for a plate overflowing with bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal went on like this for sometime, Hank slowly and methodically working his way through the massive cart of food, his middle steadily swelling larger. About halfway through, though, he heard a pained grunt and a sad oink. Pausing in his eating, he turned towards the source of the sound and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis precous little Piglet was laying back against the bed, clutching his belly in both hands. It had resumed the strained, swollen appearance of last night, and only three quarters of the cart was gone. His Piglet gave another grunt, looking at him and making a plaintive oink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Piglet?\" He asked, knowing full well the problem. \"Does your tummy hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...like I'm gonna....pop!\" His Piglet gasped, breathing shallowly from the magnitude of the meal stuffed into his stomach. Hank chuckled and moved closer, prodding the bloated belly and prompting a surprised oink (the oinking surprised him; he would have thought that Logan would see such a thing as below his dignity. He was pleased that it wasn't, though; it was very fitting affectation for a man whose pet name was \"Piglet\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, Piglet, it seems as though you've stuffed yourself silly!\" He gently massaged the stuffed ball. \"Good piggy. Good, good piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...what about...the rest?\" Logan asked. Hank smiled benevolently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. I know just the place for it.\" He patted his belly meaningfully, and his Piglet grinned. Rising, he returned to his own cart and resumed eating. Logan watched him intently, and Hank smiled as he finished off his pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like watching Beast eat, Piglet? Like watching his belly swell with food?\" His Piglet nodded, eyes rapt with attention. \"Well, then keep watching. Because Beast is going to eat all of his own food, and yours, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of him was tempted to tear into the meal with rabid frenzy, but he had no desire to share his Piglet's stomachache. Instead he continued his slow, methodical approach. He ignored the protesting of his stomach as he forced piece after piece of toast and bite after bite of sausage and egg down his throat, taking pleasure in the aching sides of his belly. He ignored his belly's pained gurgling as it struggled to digest the ever-increasing amount of food stuffed in it. By the time he finished off his own cart his stomach stood out in front of him like a beach ball, the sides bowed out with plenty. He chuckled as his Piglet stared in awe, his own breathing shallow. \"Do you think you can move, Piglet?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan tentatively shifted position, then gave an affirmative nod. Hank smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Take the food from the cart and put it on the floor.\" His expression confused, Logan did as commanded, setting the dishes still to be eaten on the soft carpet. Hank smiled slyly, gently rubbing his stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as his Piglet's eyes widened in delight, he got down on all fours. His stomach hanging heavily (and was that the faintest brush of carpet he felt?), he looked up at Logan. \"Watch and learn, little Piglet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he buried his face in the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he did eat as though frenzied, his hungry mouth chomping and gobbling away at every scrap. He even licked a dish once he'd consumed its contents, determined to get every bit of food possible into his aching stomach. He even echoed his Piglet's oinks, suffusing them with an underlying growl to affirm his role as the Beast. Finally, after several minutes of rutting like a pig, every bite of food had been eaten and with a sigh Hank rolled over onto his back. His belly, stuffed and swollen and gorged with more food than ever before, jutted up like a mountain as he lay there panting shallowly. From the corner of his eye he saw his Piglet staring at him, eyes wide, his own overfed stomach forgotten. Laughing, Hank idly patted the drum-tight sphere on his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like what you see, Piglet?\" Logan nodded, gaze transfixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go on, then.\" His Piglet looked at him, confused, and so he clarified. \"You can rub it, if you'd like.\" His Piglet was at his side in an instant and oh, even the slightest pressure on his stomach made him feel as though he'd explode, but it felt so good, and he sighed in contentment as his Piglet gave him a well-deserved belly rub. Folding his arms behind his head, Hank fell asleep to the gurgling sounds of his digesting meal and the loving caresses of his Piglet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His belly, huge and more plump than ever, pressed against his thighs and onto the cool metal surface he rested on. His belly was stuffed like never before, and he felt as though he might pop with each labored breath. There was some sort of gag in his mouth preventing him from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, from beyond the darkness he heard familiar voice give a cry of delight. \"Suckling pig, my favorite!\" The cry was shortly followed by what sounded like muffled squeals of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness abruptly lifted, and horror flooded his mind as he stared into the grinning face of Fred Dukes, otherwise known as The Blob. It was not Blob that so frightened him, though, it was what he could see beyond him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan, his beloved Piglet, was bound hands and knees onto a giant silver platter, an apple stuffed into his mouth. His belly hung fat and bloated below him (though nowhere near as large as his Beast's),his  sides heaving as he hyperventilated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen his side was suddenly poked, and his huff of indignation was cut off as he realized that he was in the same position, bound to a platter with an apple stuck in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-mm,\" Fred Dukes, said, setting aside the lid to the silver platter. \"And roast beast, my favorite!\" His belly was poked again as Blob licked his lips. \"Nicely fattened, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank awoke with a gasp, breathing heavily as he took in his surroundings. He was in his own room, not on a dinner tray for an appalling human being. More importantly, his Piglet was safe as well, cuddled up and holding his Beast's form like a teddy bear. Hank chuckled quietly and fondly stroked his Piglet's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a dream,\" he told himself quietly. \"Only a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced idly towards where the breakfast carts (and the dishes from his feeding frenzy) had rested, pleasantly surprised to see them gone. Logan must have taken care of them while he slept. He would have to do something nice to show his appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was for later. Right now his stomach was still achingly (though not so achingly as before) stuffed full of food, his plump little Piglet was sleeping beside him, and it was a good three hours until lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank McCoy fell back into the arms of sleep. And this time, dreamed only pleasant dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Eyes blinking blearily, he tilted his head up to see Logan sitting on his midsection, legs spread to straddle Hank's enormous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Beast have a good nap?\" Logan asked playfully, patting the plump surface of his improvised cushion and sending ripples through the other man's fleshy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He most certainly did,\" Hank said, now fully awake. Grinning, he flexed his stomach muscles (which were very impressive even buried under a small ocean of blubber) and pushed his stomach out/up as hard as he could, successfully dislodging Logan with a startled yelp. Hank chuckled as the other man slid to the floor, the action setting his enormous belly wobbling like a giant jello mold. Come to think of it, the rest of him jiggled quite a bit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan laughed as well, sitting up and climbing back on top of Hank's stomach, which jutted up from his frame like a small mountain. \"Very funny, big guy. Just wait'll I put on a few more pounds,\" here Logan rubbed his own plump stomach, now about the size of a smallish beach ball. \"I'll be so heavy you won't be able to knock me off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have quite a ways to go, if you wish to catch up with me, my friend.\" Hank said playfully, breathing somewhat shallow from the weight on his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Logan said mildly, bouncing up and down again. \"Beast is looking awfully underfed lately. You must be on a diet or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank nodded pitifully, easily falling into the game he could see beginning. \"Yes, I have been trying to lose a few pounds. I'Ve eaten nothing but celery and carrots for two weeks now; I'm certain I'Ve lost at least twenty pounds.\" Logan shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you do that to yourself, bud? Don't you know a man's gotta eat?\" As if on cue, Hank's belly let out a terrifyingly loud rumble, whining for food. \"See? Little Hank here agrees with me,\" Logan said, giving Hank's belly a consoling pat. \"Don't worry little guy; I'm gonna fill you up good and stuffed. Gonna put so much food in you Beast'll be pinned downfor a whole day!\" Hank's stomached growled again, rumbling in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Logan do?</span></div></div>",

It will take considerable effort to, as you say 'fill me up good and stuffed.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that,\" Logan said with a sly smirk. \"I've got just the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you, now?\" Hank said, licking his lips as his stomach let out another demanding growl. \"And what might that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that's no well-fed man should do without,\" Logan replied. \"I'm not just gonna make Beast nice and full, I'm gonna plump you right back up nice and fat. I'm gonna undo the damage that diet did to your poor tummy,\" he patted the tummy in question, sending waves rippling through the blubbery flesh. \"I'm gonna put that twenty pounds right back on you, and give you a few extra to go along with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you plan to do that?\" Hank asked, heart pounding and belly rumbling with anticipation. Logan grinned and, from behind the visual block of Hank's middle, produced a good-sized funnel with one hand and a large white tub with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice cream should put some meat on Beast's bones, don'tcha think?\" And without further ado Logan leaned over, plugged Hank's mouth with the funnel, and began the careful process of feeding his buddy melted ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank didn't have the right words to describe what he was feeling at the moment; he had always preferred his ice cream after it had had time to soften a bit, and this was just more of the same. The delicious vanilla flavor slid across his tongue like slightly thick milk as he just laid back and swallowed, sending every last extraordinarily fattening mouthful straight down into his eagerly-awaiting tummy. After about two minutes the stream of flavor stepped, and he couldn't resist a demanding whine around the funnel. He heard his Piglet let out a bark of laughter and felt the consoling pat on his belly. \"Don't worry, Little Hank. There's plenty more where that came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough a stream of chocolate began to pour through the funnel, and Hank contentedly resumed his greedy suckling, feeling his belly beginning to fill, then overfill with the high-calorie fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chocolate was followed by strawberry, then neapolitan, then cookies and cream, then more vanilla, then two rounds of chocolate. By that point Hank had the worst belly ache of his life; he felt like an overfull water balloon, but still Piglet continued to poor more flavors down his Beast's mouth. He counted at least three more flavors that he couldn't identify through the haze of his gluttony, and the more Hank's belly cried out for relief, the more greedily he swallowed. He wanted more! More! MORE!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, finally, the stream of ice cream ended. Hank's stomach, even flat on his back, jutted up a full foot from his torso. Every tiny little motion set the obscenely bloated sphere to swaying majestically back and forth, and even the shallowest of breaths made Hank want to weep, feeling as though he would bust. But still, he wanted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" he whispered, lips slick with overflow from the last few swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't anymore,\" Logan told him, voice quiet with awe at such supreme gluttony. \"You ate all twelve gallons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Twelve gallons,' Hanks mind whispered. A part of him told him that shouldn't be physically possible, but the irrefutable evidence bulged up from his chubby torso, gurgling away in the slow process of digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Twelve gallons of ice cream,' his inner mathematician whispered as Piglet tentatively patted Hank's belly, rightfully afraid that too much pressure would pop his buddy. 'Average 4,320 calories per gallon, multiplied by twelve makes....51,840 calories!' Hank chuckled painfully, belly rolling like the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were...right on...both counts...Piglet.\" He wheezed. Logan cocked his head at him in confusion. Hank clarified with a pained smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly...won't be....moving for...the rest of the day. And this will...most assuredly...\" He let his head fall back and closed his eyes, whispering the last bit with a delighted smile. \"Plump me up.\"</span></div></div>",

The do-gooders didn't suspect a thing, and everything was going according to plan. One would wonder how the Blob, while trapped in a prison unable to see what was going on in the mansion, would know any plan, even his own was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blob knew because of his guards. Each day, a different member of the X-Men stood guard over him, and each time he saw them, they looked a little chubbier. Scott Summers could generously described as \"husky\" at this point, and Nightcrawler was outright stout. They were coming along nicely, but they were secondary concerns. The real prizes were Wolverine and Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd seen the Wolverine most often out of all Xavier's little pets, and the Canadian was really plumping up. His flat abs had morphed into a potbelly that would make a Santa-In-Training proud, and he'd softened up in all the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was focusing his real efforts on Beast, though. As much as he hated Wolverine, at least the short mutant didn't go around acting like he was better than Blob just 'cause he was smarter. No, that was all Beast. His smug, condescending attitude had grated on Fred since the first time he met the fuzzball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he was going to have the last laugh. He had only seen the Beast a few times, and not for a few days now, but when last he saw the furball was fattening up nicely, with a belly approaching enormous proportions and a general level of chunkiness all over. Blob was glad he'd focused on Wolverine and the Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were going to be delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Wolverine's metal skeleton might be a problem, but Blob was pretty sure his new and improved digestive system could handle it. It had handled his jerk-ass teammates, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why no one had come to rescue them; he'd eaten them when his mutation had evolved. Swallowed them whole as soon as he realized he could. They'd deserved it for always making fun of him. Well, he'd showed them, just like he was going to show the X-Men, every last one. Blob was more than dumb muscle now: Blob was a predator. A predator who could even fatten up his oblivious prey beforehand so it would feed him longer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly rumbled, but he ignored it for now. Soon his patience would pay off. In a few more days, maybe a couple more weeks, <i>then</i> it would be time to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Blob was planning to eat <i>well.</i></span></div></div>",

When the X-Men had received their first call to battle in weeks, Hank had initially been concerned that his added weight (his Piglet's as well, though of the two he had by far gained the most) would be a hindrance, and received a pleasant surprise. While neither of them were as fast as they once were, they weren't experiencing loss of stamina or any of the other symptoms he would expect from their newly hefty middles. They were no more short of breath than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of Logan, the answer was easy: his healing factor (the most powerful every encountered) was obviously taking care of any potential problems before they could arise. As for himself...well, it must be his own natural strength compensating. He had an extraordinarily powerful immune system, perhaps that extended to overall internal health? He had a mild healing factor of his own as well, perhaps between the two his health was assured?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, pleased at the thought as he idly stroked the mound of flab at his middle. If that were the case, than the only limit on his future growth (and that of his Piglet) was that of mobility. And he would put a stop to things long before they became immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, permanently immobile. Sleeping off a truly satisfying gorge didn't count. On that note, he thought he heard Logan returning with lunch. Sure enough, the door open as the burly Canadian pushed through two carts as heavily laden as the ones from this morning, and Hank smiled, licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, Piglet, that's an awful lot of food.\" Logan grinned, giving an affirmative nod around his cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, and you're gonna eat first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank raised an eyebrow; this was the first time Logan had taken control, and he was curious as to wear it would lead. \"Oh? And why is that?\" Logan left the carts and walked over, placing a possessive hand on Hank's great ball of stomach, jutting up slightly even as he lay flat on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cause you're gonna eat off the floor again,\" he said quietly, leaning closer, eyes intent. \"Tell ya what, Bub, that thing you did this morning? That was a damn fine sight, and I aim to see it again. Seein' you on your hands and knees, stuffing yourself like a great fat hog--like a <i>Beast</i>--ain't never seen nothin' like that. It was amazing, and I wanna see it again.\" Hank smiled toothily, sitting up and rubbing his eager stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, perhaps you'd best prepare the...table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments, but soon Logan had laid out a sumptuous feast on the carpet, much of the food still hot and steaming. Hank, stripping down to his briefs, lowered himself to the floor and assumed the feeding position. He let a startled cry as his Piglet gave him a firm smack on his plump rear. \"Well, what are ya waitin' for, Beast? Eat up!\" Hank ginned slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink,\" he growled, before burying his face in the plate in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was different from this morning; this morning he had already been stuffed, his belly swollen and gorged with the morning's bounty. Now his stomach hunk beneath him like a sack of lard, soft to the touch and rippling as he moved. This morning he had had to ignore its pained protests, now it was crying out for more, more more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank happily obliged, greedily devouring every bite in front of him and licking the plates, making sure to never use his hands, only his mouth. Every time one of his hands would start to move his buttocks would receive a sharp slap, the padded posterior providing an ample target for the correction. Every time he finished a dish it was removed in a flash and another slid closer. He was aware, through the frenzy of his eating, of his filling, then swelling, then bulging belly being caressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Beast, you're a hungry, greedy fucker, ain't ya?\" The words were punctuated by another slap to the rear. \"That's right, Beast, eat like the King Hog you are. Stuff that fat ol' belly a yours; make it scream for relief.\" Beast doubled his feeding efforts, distantly aware of his own grunts and growling oinks as his Piglet continued to feed him, eagerly gobbling up every bite, sending it sliding down his hungry gullet into his swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long Hank gorged he didn't know. He was distantly aware of actual, physical pain from how full his belly had become, but he resolutely ignored it. Piglet wanted Beast to eat, and Beast would oblige until Piglet said otherwise, because Piglet was in charge right now. And so Hank ate and ate and ate, the bowed out sides of his belly giving him the look of a pregnant horse. Finally there were no more dishes slid towards him and Hank collapsed, moaning at the pressure the act put on his belly. The huge ball of lard was so full of food, so stuffed with plenty that it was impossible for him to lie flat on the ground, his obscenely overfed belly holding him up at a slight angle. From above him there came a chuckle and he oinked in distress as his straining stomach was none-too-gently prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Beast, you're so full you can't even move, can you? Know how much you ate?\" He shook his head faintly, and he heard another chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both carts, Beast. You ate both carts of food you fat fuckin' pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank didn't respond, wanting to disbelieve but knowing it to be true; he'd never been so bloated in his life. Hands pressed his sides and he was slowly, gently rolled over onto his back and he sighed as the pressure on his overinflated belly eased. He looked up at his Piglet, injecting a little smugness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both...carts,...Piglet? Well,...I....most certainly...AM the...Beast,...aren't I?\" His Piglet grinned, picking up the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, you sure are, but what am I gonna eat?\" Logan asked, rubbing his belly woefully. \"There's no more food, and Piglet's soooo hungry. I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank smiled, breathing shallowly from the fullness of his stomach. \"I...suppose...you'll have...to get...more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Piglet grinned. \"Looks like it, since Beast has been such a fat fuckin' pig.\" He gently patted Beast's belly, prompting a pained oink as he grinned. \"You stay here--not that you could go anywhere. I'll be back soon.\" And with one last pat, Logan left, going in search of food and leaving Hank to stare dazedly at his towering mountain of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Still, there was documented evidence of the placebo effect, and he supposed that simply knowing what was to come was working similar magic on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip had come as something of a surprise; he had no idea who had sent him the trip, but when the background check on the supposed \u201cmutant-friendly\u201d resort had been run, and nothing amiss found, the others had urged him to accept. \u201cYou deserve this,\u201d they had said, and \u201cnothing bad will happen just because you\u2019re not here.\u201d Finally, Hank had been persuaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only downside was that his Piglet had been unable to come.

This is a place for our clients to get away from it all, to feel good about themselves. Because of this, a strict \u2018undergarments only\u2019 rule is enforced upon check-in. Will this be a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank was mildly startled by the rule, but recovered quickly. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t foresee any difficulties.\u201d The attendant smiled brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, then! Let\u2019s just get you checked in, and then I\u2019ll show you to your room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe check-in room bore a surprising resemblance to a doctor\u2019s office; the walls were plain white (with an open bag for a person to place his clothes) and there was a scale on one wall. The attendant walked over and picked up a clipboard, and Hank had a moment to glimpse his name across the top before it was tilted up out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Mr. McCoy, just a couple of things before we get started. While this is a place for mutants like yourself to relax and cut loose, to the general public at large we\u2019re a health spa, and we have to maintain that fa\u00e7ade. At least on paper. To that end, once you\u2019ve taken off your clothes I\u2019m going to need you to step up on this scale so I can weight you, and then I need you to hold still so I can take a few measurements. Alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBemused, Hank complied and stepped up onto the scale. After a few moments of sliding the bars, the attendant gave an admiring whistle as the scale revealed Hank\u2019s weight. \u201c425 pounds! My, my, you are a big boy, aren\u2019t you? He gave Hank\u2019s belly, jutting out in front of him like a particularly large whistle, an impressed pat. \u201cAlright then, just step over here,\u201d he said, producing a white tape measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes were spent with Hank\u2019s arms, chest, thighs, and height being measured. However, when the young man went to measure Hank\u2019s waistline, the tape (which extended fifty inches) proved too short, the ends unable to meet after circling Hank\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve put on a bit of weight recently,\u201d Hank explained, giving his belly a fond pat. The man smiled, unconcerned. \u201cIt\u2019s no matter, just one more test.\u201d Producing small, handheld device, he pressed it to Hank, who felt a brief electric shock before a percentage flashed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c33.6% body fat,\u201d the man commented, making a note of it. \u201cIn layman\u2019s terms, this bad boy here,\u201d he gave Hank\u2019s belly a playful poke, \u201cis 142.8 pounds of pure, overfed fat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,  I\u2019m afraid it can\u2019t take all the credit,\u201d Hank replied, thinking of his plump rear, his tree-trunk thighs and his chubby pectorals. The attendant smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose so. Now, I\u2019ll deliver your baggage to your room, but it occurs to me that it\u2019s close to lunch time. Would you like a meal brought to you?\u201d Hank\u2019s belly let out a loud rumble at the mention of food and the other man laughed again. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in his room (which was the height of luxury), Hank sat down on his bed to await his meal. It didn\u2019t take long; the door opened and the attendant from earlier entered, along with four others, each of the pushing a tri-layer cart creaking with strain from the sheer amount of food placed on it. Even though he was alarmed at the sight of so much food, Hank couldn\u2019t help but lick his lips as his greedy belly let out a hungry growl. He gave it a soothing rub, allowing a measure of his concern to cross his face. The attendant, correctly gauging the situation, gave another reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sir. Whatever you don\u2019t eat is taken down to the local soup kitchen; none of it will go to waste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the assurance Hank needed. Without further ado he approached the first cart, and groaned as he took the first bite; the food was absolutely delicious! He\u2019d never had such good food in his life! His concern forgotten, he tore into the meal as though he would never eat again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ate, the attendants stayed with him, smiling. Whenever his progress slowed one of them would offer a soothing belly rub. Whenever his belly was not being rubbed, one of them would routinely poke it with their finger, testing for give. At first there was plenty, but as Hank continued his gluttony there came to be less and less. Before Hank knew it he had consumed two carts and his stomach was crying out with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now, sir,\u201d the attendant said, voice infused with a persuasive lilt, \u201csurely that\u2019s not enough? A big man like you, with a stomach like yours, surely you need more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank didn\u2019t need more; he felt as though he would burst, but the food smelled so good, and the employee was right: Hank was a big man. He could handle more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore\u201d turned itself into another cart. And then another. Hank\u2019s belly was in agony, and when a smiling woman offered him a cookie, he ate it in one bite and collapsed back on the bed, his stuffed stomach screaming in protest. Distantly, through the haze of gluttony and the moans of his overfed belly, he heard the attendants talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s enough? The client said he wanted the \u2018stuffing\u2019 option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see how much this pig ate? I\u2019ve never seen anyone but the client eat like that!\u201d His belly was roughly patted, rubbed and jostled from side to side. \u201cLook at that, solid like a rock! And this guy was already a prize porker to begin with! He\u2019s fuckin\u2019 huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut do you think it\u2019ll be enough? You know what happens when the clients don\u2019t get what they want, especially this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, it\u2019ll be enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more conversation that Hank couldn\u2019t make out, and then suddenly he was aware that he was moving; it appeared that the bed was on wheels. He wanted to ask where they were going, but his belly was in too much pain for him to muster the energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after several moments, he was wheeled into a long, open room before he came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are, sir,\u201d he heard the attendant saying to someone out of sight. \u201cNice and stuffed, just like you wanted. He\u2019s a real plump one, too; an absolute hog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew he would be,\u201d he heard a familiar voice say. \u201cHow did he measure up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c His belly was too big for the measuring tape,\u201d the attendant answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich would make it just the right size for mine, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d The familiar voice replied with a sinister chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, sir. We at Hannibal\u2019s Paradise value your patronage, and hope to see more of you in the future, in every sense of the word. And might I say, sir, that with this fuckin\u2019 hog on the menu, we\u2019ll definitely be seeing more of you.\u201d There was the sound of footsteps, and then Hank was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not quite alone. The ground shuddered with immensely heavy footsteps, and the obscenely fat face of Fred Duke\u2019s came into view. He was wearing a bib entirely too tiny for him, and drool was literally running out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, do-gooder, you are a fat one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d His belly was roughly punched, and Hank cried out in pain. \u201cYou\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 tub o\u2019 lard, ain\u2019t ya? Look at this gut!\u201d His stomach was punched again. \u201cDamn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026what\u2026\u201d Hank wheezed, forcing the words out, straining to get enough air through the pressure of his bloated midsection. \u201cWh\u2026what are\u2026you go\u2026going\u2026to\u2026do\u2026to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blob smiled evilly, rubbing his massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna eat you, Beast! I\u2019m gonna swallow you whole, you fat fucker! Yummy yummy yummy in my tummy!\u201d And Blob lunged, his jaw stretching impossibly wide\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hank jerked awake with a terrified gasp, heart pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Hank react?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It actually took rolling onto his belly and then rising to his knees; his midsection had become far too prominent of late to allow him to perform the sit-up like motion he used to indulge in. He briefly considered putting on more clothing, but a quick glance at the blue globe of his abdomen convinced him any effort at bending over was far too much trouble. Besides, it wasn't as though the mansion hadn't seen him in his briefs before. As quietly as he could manage, Hank left the room and headed for the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was, barring a necessary stop at the bathroom, relatively brief, and soon Hank found himself standing on the hyper-accurate scientific scale embedded in the floor.

He also became abruptly aware of how wide his posterior had become, straining his poor briefs to the very edge of tolerance.

He idly stuck a candy bar into his mouth as he reflected on the recent weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since he had eaten off the floor like a true pig for Logan, the smaller man had requested (re: ordered) that he eat at least one meal a day in that fashion. Something about seeing him eating like a hog being fattened for slaughter gave Logan all sorts of excitement, and Beast was more than happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And it's certainly showing,' he thought to himself, stroking his fattened stomach reflectively. 'I'm up at least twenty pounds, if not more. Those pig-meals are absolutely huge. He didn't mind the extra weight, though. Truthfully, he was just as healthy as he had always been, and the added mass made him feel powerful. He was proud of his belly, which bulged over whatever leg covering he wore, huge and round and fat and, more often than not, filled with food. Beast had even taken to perpetual snacking in-between meals, so as to increase his caloric intake and ensure his capacity didn't shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't been neglecting his Piglet, either. While most of the weight gained rested in HIS tummy, Logan was a growing boy as well. For every pig-meal he ate for Logan, there was another meal where he teased and bullied his Piglet as the other man ate and ate and ate until his stomach was heavy and bloated, it's circumference increased at least two inches. And the results were showing: Logan's stomach had, previously, been comparable to a basketball in size. Now it was more like a beach ball in girth. The man's chest had not become man-boobs as Beast's own, had, because the man maintained a stricter work-out regimen than Hank (Hank relying on his natural strength, which exceeded that of most men with no effort), but the added flab made his pecs look puffier, the muscles still large but not so defined. His face was plumper as well, it's sharp planes softened and more human. he had even begun to cultivate a goatee to match his sideburns in part, Hank suspected, to conceal a double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank popped another candy bar into his mouth, rubbing the sides of his belly as he looked forward to tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens tonight?</span></div></div>",

He had eaten a meal alone for the first time in weeks, and though he had filled his ever-growing stomach with all he could, it just wasn't the same without Logan there egging him on, delighting in how fat and heavy, how round and plump his Beast was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was finally time. Logan had told him to meet him at their room at 7:00, and now Hank stood outside the door, hand on the knob. He was certain Piglet's surprise was something food related, and his monstrous belly let out a hungry whine of anticipation as he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart almost stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan lay stretched out on the bed, clad only in boxers, arms behind his head and a smile on his newly-goateed face as he watched the door. Every space of the enormous bed not occupied by Logan's husky form was piled high with as much food as could be made to fit. What caused Beast to freeze in shock, though, was his Piglet's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's stomach was stretched tight, rising up from his chubby frame in an obscenely overfed half-sphere, and even from here Hank could hear the steady gurgles as it struggled to digest the no-doubt massive meal stuffed within it. More than that, though, the succulent ball of blubber was covered in steak sauce, three large cuts of meat balanced precariously on the fleshy orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, bub,\" Logan said, putting a cigar between his teeth. \"Thought you deserved something better than the floor to eat off of, tonight.\" He gave his stomach a gentle pat, careful not to dislodge the meat. The bedstand next to him was covered in other various sauces which Hank now recognized as intended to accompany the myriad dishes. When a few moments passed and Hank still didn't answer, Logan chuckled lightly and gave his belly another pat. \"Well, what are you waiting for, big guy? Eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank needed no other encouragement. Carefully crawling onto the bed in the space between Logan's legs, he picked knelt down and licked a long trail around his Piglet's bloated tummy, his own stomach groaning in renewed hunger at the taste of the delicious sauce. Carefully, so as not to hurt his companion, he began to eat the steaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not his usual feeding frenzy; there was no way to do that without ruining the precious gift Logan had given him, and so Beast took his time, periodically licking more sauce off his Piglet's deliciously plump flesh, nipping at it as he slowly but steadily devoured the steaks and refilled his \"plate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, Beast,\" Logan said breathlessly as Hank devoured a massive helping of mashed potatoes and roast chicken, giggling occasionally as his swollen tummy was tickled by a greedy mouth and questing tongue. \"Come on, big guy, I stuffed myself all nice and fat for you to have something to eat off of. I've never been so full in my life, and I did it all for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gettin' so fuckin' fat, Beast. Look at us!\" Logan slapped his belly, dislodging two of the seven dinner rolls perched atop it and further smearing the butter Beast had lathered him up with. \"Look at my fuckin' stomach! So fucking round and plump; I'm gettin' fuckin' moobs, man!\" Logan squeezed his softening chest to demonstrate the point. \"And you, Beast,\" Logan fisted his hand in Hank's hair, forcing him to eat faster. \"You look like a pregnant horse! You've gotta be twice the man you used to be! I hear the floorboards creaking when you walk; you're so fuckin' huge and fat! I bet you won't even be able to reach around your stomach much longer!\" Hanks stomach was, in fact, hanging heavy and full and plump beneath him, filled well past the point of hunger, a monument to its owner's gluttony. Logan grinned, releasing Beast and putting his hands behind his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuckin' love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank didn't spare energy to reply, continuing to eat and eat as he always did, eagerly devouring the desserts (cookies, cake, cookie dough, and cake icing) Logan had provided. Logan groaned in pleasure at the myriad sensations, his own gut never ceasing its digestive gurgling. Reaching onto the bedstand, he took a can of whipped cream and lathered up his meaty chest, moaning as Beast's mouth automatically followed the trail, delicately suckling at the sensitive nipples of the plump pectorals before returning to the belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was no more. Beast, stomach aching, crawled up to his Piglet and cuddle as close as his swollen stomach would allow, breathing shallowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are...indeed...getting rather...fat...my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan only laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You're quite right, and I do believe I shall partake of more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get it for you,\" Logan said, rising to his feet with a little difficulty, leaning back to balance the weight of his bloated gut. \"Maybe I can work some of this off,\" he gave his swollen stomach another thump, prompting another belch before heading to the buffet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank watched his friend go, smiling as he worked up a burp or two of his own. A part of him knew he really should stop eating, but it was drowned out by the part of him that loved making a pig of himself. Even feeling quite frankly overfull, he simply wanted more.

Understood?\" Blob asked while getting the workout of his life, &amp; now he had a craving for ice cream &amp; frozen yogurt. Also, when I say \"Control\" your old commands will be reinforced, or you get new instructions. Has everything I've been saying clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Of course dude.\" Iceman slurred in a hypnotic trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Then now I say 'Ice'\". At the mention of the codeword, Iceman stood at attention while Blob slowed down his jiggling fat motions. then bobby started using his power to chill all the buttered, cheesy, and creamy foods in the X-Mansion into food for the Blob. As the Blob ate, he was barely making a dent in his pile of frozen treats, as Bobby kept replenishing them, &amp; keeping them cold just enough for Blob to chew up or swallow whole.

Wallflower to amplify the lawn's genetics into snares and traps, to tangle up or slow down the Blob's progress. Using his hypnotic dance, he completely incapacitated the entire active roster of X-Men. However, Blob knew this opportunity wouldn't last forever. So the Blob took to implanting several post hypnotic suggestions to the entirety of the team to ignore his doings at the mansion no matter what anything or anybody says otherwise. He had to be especially strong with the local telepaths, like the Professor, Emma Frost, &amp; Jean Grey, yet he still left them with enough intelligence &amp; free will so as not to arouse suspicion from their subconscious selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back to Elixir. Elixir has the power to alter the genetic coding of anything organic, from humans, animals, plants, &amp; even mutants themselves. He can heal or hurt them, &amp; in essence activate the X-Gene or a Secondary Mutation to further evolve their powers. His powers only work on Humans, Mutants, &amp; any other earthborn, carbon-based lifeforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joshua was attempting to subdue the Blob, the Blob came up with an idea to make himself stronger. \u201cFocus on the jiggling of my body &amp; the sound of my voice Elixir. When you hear the phrase \u2018XXXL\u2019, you will fatten yourself up on any food product you can without arousing suspicion. &amp; when I say the phrase \u2018X-Amplify\u2019, you will amplify the powers of a current X-men (yourself included), so long as you leave a \u2018Failsafe Gene\u2019 that I can activate to ensure continued loyalty or death-by-fattening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Blob. What should I call you when I\u2019m in this state? &amp; how shall you activate the \u2018Failsafe Gene\u2019 that I place in other mutants?\u201d Elixir asks hazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will activate the failsafe Gene with two steps. First, my voice will reverberate through their ears &amp; bring them to control them to touch my fattened flesh (whether they consciously want it at the time or not). Second, when I am in control of their body, they will replicate fat at a faster level until immobilized while also feeling hornier &amp; unable to release until I give the order, leaving them either dead from strain on the body, or weakened in resolve. Third, call me Lord Blob, &amp; that goes for you too Wallflower. Ya\u2019 got that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lord Blob\u201d Both Wallflower &amp; Elixir responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuestion. How can I help? I can\u2019t alter genetic codes like Joshua can.\u201d Wallflower responded unsure of herself while still in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou Wallflower shall be one of my mind enforcers using your pheromones to enthrall others humans, &amp; inorganic mutants into my sway whenever I say \u2018Blossom\u2019 to you &amp; only you.\u201d Blob commanded onward. \u201cNow Elixir, Wallflower, two more commands for you both. One, when I am speaking to both of you, &amp; you are both in my control, then when I say the code phrase \u2018Aphrodisiac Bloom\u2019, you will each fal asleep &amp; dream about serving me to enhance your loyalty, &amp;/or receive new orders. Two, when I am speaking to both of you, &amp; you are both in my control, then when I say the code phrase \u2018Venomous Wilt\u2019, you will both return to your normal lives without any memory of what happened while under my control, chalking up any lingering memories of servitude to bad dreams. Now I say to Elixir, \u2018XXXL\u2019, &amp; to you Wallflower, I say \u2018Blossom\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after careful thinking &amp; releasing his two victims to continue their missions, the Blob saw first-hand just what Elixir &amp; Wallflower could do. With Wallflower growing plants in X-mansions\u2019 contained vegetable garden &amp; fruit tree orchard at a phenomenal fast rate while Elixir further enhanced her mutation to make them extra addicting, the Blob could have more food than he ever imagined. As Joshua ate almost every fruit in the orchard &amp; the vegetables down to the scraps &amp; leaving only the seeds behind, he was certainly a bit fatter after altering his genetic code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElixir was once a slim, average-sized young teenager with one problem giving away his mutation. He literally had golden skin &amp; hair, that had a few black spots on his hands &amp; feet that could use his power even through clothing. Now however, Elixir was definitely putting on some pudge, like a baby belly. That\u2019s when the Blob got an idea for what Elixir &amp; Wallflower to do next...</span></div></div>",

Fred has pulled the man into a kiss, but not just any. The fat man had his tongue into Hank's mouth, exploring the warm cheeks and wrapping around the smaller tongue.

The liquid made him feel pleasant and even a little hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred reached between his belly and Hank, opening the man's lab coat as using his fat finger to rub the blue stomach. After a few moments, he pulled away and smiled brightly, touching over the blue belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What...

Coughing and trying to wave off the smoke, he flipped off of the overhead bar and hurried to the ventilation vent switch, turning on the fans and sucking the thick smoke out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill tasting the smoke on his tongue, Hank sighed. \u201cBack to the drawing board, I suppose\u2026\u201d And then he noticed his own wet footprints leading from the puddle he\u2019d made on the floor, having stepped through it in his haste. At least the glass bits hadn\u2019t punctured the thick soles of his bare feet! Cleaning up the mess with the hazardous waste mop, Hank mulled over what could have gone wrong. But just then\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the mess cleaned up and the failure noted in his computer journals, Hank returned to his research. Of course, there were other projects to work on, machines to design or fix, theories to ponder, training sessions in the Danger Room to attend, missions in which to participate, a world to save on a weekly basis\u2026 Oh, yes, and eating and sleeping went in there, somewhere, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe life of an X-Man was so distracting, Hank didn't even notice his uniform and harness had grown snug until over a month later. He was getting dressed in his room when he noticed the difference in fit, and a glance down revealed that his abdomen was no longer quite as defined as it had been, now more of a soft slab of shaggy blue fur. He poked at it with a finger, and could still feel the muscle underneath. \u201cA simple fluctuation in weight,\u201d he commented to himself. \u201cNothing to be concerned about. I\u2019ll just be sure to do another set of overhead crunches every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next month, Hank would sometimes actually remember to do those extra crunches, but with all the other issues needing to be dealt with, that little bit of softness practically fell right out his memory. It wasn't until he was walking by Logan in the hallway that it was brought to the forefront again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLettin\u2019 yerself go a bit there, aren't ya Hank? Oughta lay off the Twinkies, bub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank stopped for a moment and blinked down, looking himself over. Stars and garters, he <i>did</i> have a belly, didn\u2019t he? Practically a paunch! He pinched a thick inch of it, making a face. He was naturally overweight by frame alone, but he\u2019d never let himself go quite this far...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hank nodded resolutely to himself. Perhaps it was time to put aside the desk-work for a while and do something a little more active. There were training simulations in the Danger Room he hadn't tried yet, and he'd been neglectful of the free weights tucked under his bed somewhere. And... perhaps he <i>would</i> have to cut down on the Twinkie consumption, painful as it was to consider. Already he was starting to salivate at the thought of another of the yellow snack cakes\u2026 but no! He had to stand firm if he was going to get firm! But first he ought to know the damage beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping onto the scale in his bathroom, Hank watched the digital display calculating... before putting him at 445, forty-five pounds over his average weight! His big furry hand went back to the bulge of softness at his center, pressing down into it a little. \"Hm. Sorry, extraneous adipose, but the free ride is over. You can kiss your adipocytes goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next three weeks, Hank stuck to his workouts, lifting weights, running on the treadmill, and going through his acrobatic routines on the uneven bars and pommel horse. The Danger Room programs, while obviously dangerous, certainly provided him a healthily increased heart rate and excellent exercise as well. As good as he was about cutting down on his beloved Twinkies though, he still found himself sneaking one every now and then, only to slap himself on the wrist for it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of those three weeks, Hank stepped back onto his scale with confidence\u2026 and then felt that same confidence melt, pooling around his middle. The adipose had not only resisted his exercise, it had brought friends! '460' flashed up at him from the digital read-out. Hank's genius mind whirled, frowning down at the number. He stepped off the scale and stepped back on, and yet there the impossible number remained. What had he done wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, obviously he hadn't tried hard enough! He'd have to dedicate more of his free time to burning the calories swamping his belly, and make more dietary sacrifices! He was not about to give up so easily! And so another three weeks were spent pushing himself even further. Even Scott had to admit that Hank had that edge of awe-inspiring determination whenever he bested another Danger Room program. Or maybe it was how hungry he felt, stomach craving something sweet, only sustained on fish, eggs, wheat-toast, and carrot sticks. The very thought of eating another celery stalk made Hank shudder in revulsion as he stepped on the scale again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then another different kind of shudder went through him. According to the scale, he now weighed 475 pounds. He was... officially tubby! He stared at himself in the mirror, resting both hands on his belly, shaking it. He pinched a good little bit more than an inch, growling with frustration and embarrassment. Was his chest and jaw line softening? That had to be his imagination... didn't it? It was impossible, he should've been shedding pounds like winter fur! He frowned at his reflection. \"Something is wrong...\"</span></div></div>",

He could feel his belly shaking ponderously with every step he took, which only made him even more self-conscious about it. When Ororo passed him in the hallway, he instinctively held a hand against his belly, as if to hide how big it had gotten (as though one hand--even as big as his were--could cover up nearly 100 extra pounds of him!). She said nothing, but Hank was sure she had cast a disapproving glance downward. At least it hadn't been Logan, who'd been teasing him mercilessly for weeks now.  And if this particularly disturbing trend continued...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Hank entered his lab, only to be suddenly confronted by a typically-exuberant Bobby. Despite being 23 years old now and having saved the world several times, Bobby still acted like he did back when he'd first joined the X-Men. \"Hey, there you are! So, what are we gonna do tonight, Brain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank couldn't help but smile and reply in kind to the one of many in-jokes he and Bobby shared. \"The same thing we do every night, Pinky. ...but if you'll excuse me for a moment, Robert, I have some pressing matters to attend to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby shrugged and backed up a step to let Hank pass. \"What's up? Gonna program another Danger Room scenario? Man, you've been at those things like a fat kid on cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Robert, don't mention cake right now...\" Hank walked over to the electro-Newtonian scale he'd designed himself, normally used for measuring precise amounts of liquids, but now he diverted the program to the floor scale, and stepped on. Sure enough, it read 475. Bobby whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Hank. I thought you'd been eating celery? You're getting soft, big guy!\" He laughed and reached over, patting that blue-furred gut and making Hank grunt in embarrassment. \"Bobby, please. Computer, show me a more accurate measurement, by power of ten.\u201d A decimal point and new digit had been placed, but still nothing changed. \"Again, please. Power of ten. Again. Again...\" Silent calculations were whirling through Hank's mind, trying to confirm his wild theory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with the reading stretched out to measure to the nearest millionth of a pound, Hank's eyes widened. The numbers were slowly, but steadily increasing! Bobby stood by Hank, watching the scale curiously. \"So... what's that mean...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank stepped away from the scale and sighed. \"It means, Bobby, that I'm gaining weight at a constant rate... of approximately two millionths of a pound every second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Wait, so? That's no huge deal, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little under a pound every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank sat down in a chair, hearing it creak under his added girth. \"I was a fool to think that this was just a normal occurrence. I have to reverse it, somehow, before it's too late.\"</span></div></div>",

Was it not entirely his fault? His belly shook with every step, and he was almost sure his backside was beginning to do the same. He was so deep in thought that he didn't even realize he was walking straight into Remy. Or had Remy walked straight into him? Either way, the cajun staggered back a step, then broke into a sly grin. \"Whoa, Hank, where's de fire, eh? Or maybe you left de oven on? What you got cookin' dis time, mon ami?\" To emphasize the joke, Remy patted Hank's soft stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank huffed in embarrassment, attempting to suck his belly in before side-stepping the cajun. \"Not now, Remy. I have something in the lab I need to see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy's grin never left, a deft hand reaching around Hank's furry shoulders and guiding him into a perfect about-face before his friend could react. \"Hank, I'm t'inkin' dat you been spendin' too much time workin'. You gotta relax, mon ami, have some fun! Enjoy some of de better t'ings...\" A quick sleight of hand, and there was a two-pack of Hank's favorite snack cakes held by Remy, immediately capturing his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... What? No, I can't Remy. I've been trying to lose weight recently and those certainly won't...

T'ink of it as an invitation to stop worryin' so much, to enjoy yourself 'n let it all hang out, eh?\" Again, the cajun's hand went to Hank's belly, patting the soft paunch with a much gentler touch.

His enhanced mutant senses could practically <i>smell</i> the Twinkies right through the wrapper, and as he walked back to Remy's room and popped one into his mouth... he practically melted into a blue furry puddle. For months now, he'd been dieting and exercising himself to exhaustion, but the perfect taste of that processed confection with its gooey white filling made him forget all that. After all, he'd gone to all that trouble, and he'd <i>still</i> put on weight. He deserved a little bit of indulgence, didn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Twinkies were nothing but an empty wrapper and a fond memory by the time Remy shut and locked his bedroom door, but Hank's keen senses were already sniffing out the cache of snack cakes piled up to overflowing in their brown paper grocery-bag prison on Remy's desk, silently begging to be liberated. He started in their direction, but the cajun again stopped him, turning him to face the big king-size bed instead. The red-eyed rogue's nimble hands rested on the thick lovehandles at Hank's sides, holding him gently in place. \"Not yet, <i>mon ami potel\u00e9</i>. You gonn' lay down, first, <i>non</i>? After all, you gotta be relaxed to properly enjoy 'em...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the taste of the Twinkies still on his lips, Hank silently agreed, and crawled onto Gambit's bed before laying back on top of the soft silk sheets. The simple movement caused his belly to quiver, and he rested a hand on it to steady it. He'd gotten so big... but how had it happened? Before he could contemplate further, Remy was sitting next to him, unwrapping another package and offering him the spongy treats inside. Hank happily accepted, stuffing an entire Twinkie into his mouth and chewing slowly, groaning in caloric pleasure while Remy's gentle hand rested itself on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good, <i>non</i>?\" Hank nodded, helping himself to the other Twinkie while the cajun unwrapped another package. \"It's about time, Hank. You been practically killin' yaself tryin' to lose dat belly. You been lookin' so miserable , workin' yaself to da bone, but Remy's been watchin'. He knows you ain't been losin' weight, <i>j'ai raison</i>?\" Hank blushed under the blue fur, stalling a response by stuffing another Twinkie into his maw. \"To be tellin' de truth, I'm t'inkin' you don' look bad at all with a belly. Gives ya presence, <i>oui</i>? Some heft. <i>Plus \u00e0 aimer</i>.\" That hand rubbed over the soft dome of Hank's stomach, cupping it just under the navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank grunted, finally speaking up, though it was between bites. \"Remy, <i>-mmph-</i> while I appreciate the support, I can't just <i>-mmh-</i> let myself continue to get larger. My effectiveness as an <i>-omph-</i> X-Man is going to become questionable, and--\" He was stopped, Remy's finger pressing to his cream-smeared lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, <i>mon ami</i>, you here ta relax and stop worryin'. Remy's room, Remy's rules, <i>comprenez</i>?\" Again, Hank nodded, and returned to opening his mouth only for the remaining Twinkies. By the time the bag was empty, he felt full and sluggish, mind whirling from so much sugar consumed in one sitting. The cajun offered him one last pat on the gut and an invitation to come back the next night before Hank swaggered back out into the hallway, cradling his stomach with one hand.

With this, he'd be able to further enhance his mutant power, increasing in size and strength... He sighed a bit, taking a seat as he looked over the beaker. Too often in the past few months, the X-Men had found themselves in tight spot after tight spot; even moreso than usual. And while they had always managed to find a way out of those scrapes and close calls generally intact, he couldn't help but think more and more on how if he'd just been a bit stronger, a bit larger, a bit faster, he could've made a crucial difference, maybe even preventing said predicaments in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled the beaker thoughtfully in his hand, letting the red fluid swish about. The last time he'd experimented with his mutant power, it had turned him furry, blue, and downright beastly. What if he was wrong again, and this turned him into something even worse, like a purple slug? No, he was older now. Smarter. He'd gone over all the calculations a dozen times, and having just watched the formula stabilize itself in his hand, it had confirmed his predictions to the letter. And since it was catered to his specific X-gene, there was no way to test it any further except... \"Well,\" he said aloud to no one, \"for the betterment of the team, and for the furtherance of science...\" He drank. And as the gene-enhancing formula rolled down his throat, he couldn't help but notice it tasted faintly of cranberries...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the formula hit his belly, it began to spread a warmth throughout his entire body, rising to his chest, reaching out through his limbs, making his mind a bit fuzzy. The warmth built up into a heat that made him pant, supporting himself against the counter as his mind swam. He shuddered, or was that just his muscles spasming as the formula took hold? His large hand clenched, gouging the counter with his nails as his entire body seemed to flex all at once, every muscle suddenly taut and straining! He gritted his teeth as his whole body flexed even harder, bulging under his fur, making him groan. His body felt as if it were on fire, as if he'd spontaneously combust at any moment. His muscles bugled, pressing against each other and stretching his lab coat--that ever-present logical clinical part of his brain chided him for not having thought to take it off beforehand--fighting for a little more space with every passing second. It was hard for Hank to notice his body responding to the crowding by pulling him taller, wider, larger... He slid to his knees, arms limp before him, flexing helplessly again and again. He could feel his shoulders broadening, his neck thickening, his stomach... softening? How strange, while the rest of him bulged with muscle, his belly seemed to be pressing out into a decidedly rounder shape... not that he could focus on that for long! Bones creaked and stretched, finally causing him to howl and fall to the ground, dazed as the warmth finally started to recede...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally recovered--minutes or hours, he had no idea--Hank slowly pulled himself up to his feet and peered down... to find that his feet were now a good thirteen inches further away than before! That, and he had to look past the significantly larger shelf of pectoral muscle that now bulged from his chest. He looked himself over slowly, feeling his thick neck flex with every movement. His lab coat's shoulder seams had split against his broader shoulders, so he simply reached up and tore off the sleeves. all the better to admire his bigger arms, flexing biceps that looked like they'd been replaced by medicine balls! Everything about him felt... big! Powerful! A grin spread across his face. \"Initial results of the test seem to have been a rousing success...\" His voice rumbled, a little deeper than before. \"Now to see how the physical testing goes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaulting himself over the lab counters and landing with enough of a heavier thud than usual to nearly stumble him off-balance, Hank was paying close attention to the many differences in his overall weight distribution as he raced down the subterranian hallways to the Danger Room. He greeted Cyclops in passing, grinning a bit as the team leader's nonchalant response was choked off by a stunned look. Well, he'd have to expect to be getting a lot of those, now, wouldn't he? Locking himself into the Danger Room, Hank turned to the empty space. \"Danger Room, activate training program Beta-Five, expert mode...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compliance,\" called the gentle female voice from nowhere and everywhere. \"Activating training program Beta-Five, expert mode in three, two, one...\" That was as much warning as Hank got before the room suddenly leapt to life in an attempt to pound him into oblivion. Focused sound waves, pressurized air, and even entire sections of wall and ceiling buffetted him, attempting to knock him down and keep him down, but Hank could already feel the difference in how much more punishment his enhanced frame could take, the shockwaves barely budging him, the giant bludgeons unable to get close before he just punched them out of the way! Inside the Danger Room's viewing chamber, some of Hank's fellow X-Men watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, or does Hank seem... bigger, to you guys?\" Cyclops was a bit unsure of this new development. While he trusted Hank's judgment, he could have at least discussed this with the rest of the team...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow, guys! He just punched a hole in that reinforced wall! A <i>hole</i>! Haha! Go Hank!\" Bobby danced about, nose practically pressed against the viewing chamber's windows as he watched the one-man-army pummel his way through a program that was designed to exhaust a whole team of participants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it, Cyke.  Somethin' smells off about this. Since when do the X-men need performance enhancers, huh?\" It was hard to tell whether Logan actually disapproved of the situation, or was maybe just jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, the training program finally had to give up, gears groaning and grinding as the Danger Room pulled itself back together. Hank stood in the middle of it, breathing hard, but not exhausted. Quite the opposite, this was a thrill! Adrenaline! The strength! The power! But just to ensure his comrades he was still himself, he turned to the viewing chamber and bowed gracefully. \"It's all yours, gentlemen. But I'd give the room's auto-repair a little more time to recover, hm?\" He strode out with a grin, heading for his room for some well-deserved rest. Oh yes, he could get used to this...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Hank woke up sprawled over his bed. With a grunt, he yawned and stretched, part of him admiring how small the bed felt now, feet hanging over the edge of the mattress. Sitting up and scratching at the soft gut the increased size had given him, he stood up and stretched some more, hands planting themselves on the ceiling above him. Ha! Even Colossus couldn't do that. He lumbered past the floor-length mirror and smiled at his hulking reflection. Before he'd gone to bed, he'd stripped down and posed naked in front of that mirror for a full hour... Quite an impressive, even attractive, sight. He couldn't help but flex his arms again, enjoying the private moment of narcissism. But now... something was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, regarding himself in the mirror, turning this way and that before he realized he looked.. larger. Of course he was larger thanks to the formula, but now he looked <i>larger</i>. He frowned at the unexpected development, and grabbed his modesty shorts, pulling them on and wincing at how snugly they fit over his hips and... everything else. He'd have to upgrade his wardrobe; spandex only stretched so far, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing through his bedroom door and into the hallway, Hank was met with even more surprised looks. Ororo fell back against the wall in surprise as he passed, and he could have sworn he saw Jean blush when she stepped aside to his friendly rumble of a greeting. The surprise in his teammates' eyes was alone worth the entire experiment! It was... thrilling! A rush of adrenaline, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his lab, Hank submitted himself to a computer-aided physical scan, head to toe, and then used that to compare with footage of himself from the previous day's Danger Room training. No doubt about it, at 7'3\" and 818 pounds, he was a full quarter-foot taller than yesterday as well as heavier, proportionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he knew what to look for, he could see the subtle changes more clearly. His muscles seemed even more pumped than before, bulging hugely with every casual movement under an even shaggier coat of blue fur. He rested a hand on his larger belly and felt just a bit more give and softness. Everything around him seemed just a little smaller, more delicate and toy-like than it did even the day before\u2026 he felt a stirring below his belly, his already-strained shorts straining just a bit further at the mere thought of his sheer towering height and muscular power... But no, time enough to dwell on that aspect later. He shook his big head a couple times to clear it and help him refocus on the task at hand. While being larger was still a thrill, he would obviously have to find out the cause of this unexpected growth before it got out of hand... if it hadn't already.</span></div></div>",

Professor Xavier had a plan where if a veteran x man who could not fight or was injured then they would become teachers to the students. While there are several x men who both balance the role of x men and teacher like Jean grey who teaches English and who is a field agent or Beast who teaches sciences and gets called to fight on missions.  The professor offered Remy the role of French language teacher as he is fluent in French.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It also worked in the favor of the Professor that Gambit injury himself on the last mission. Charging up a moving car was not the best of ideas. He charged up the car to ram into a sentinel, but Gambit was hurt in the explode casing his femur to brake in three pieces and his tibia facture in several places. He passed out due to the pain and when he came to. Beast was help Remy\u2019s legs into a leg brace like device. Beast said that the device will allow Remy to walk, but also heal the bones. Beast also said the device is not meant or exercise so no stupid stunts. Beast said that the device converts your body\u2019s calories into the energy need to heal your legs. Beast estimated that at least several months until the device is done, but after that take care of your legs with great care to no hard stress on your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGambit took up the teaching role of being the French teacher and many students wanted to have a class with an easy going teacher who tell about his field missions. Currently he is grading papers from his class who could chose on any French related subject. He heard a knock at the door and turned to see Rouge with a platter of food. Rouge recently came back from a trip from the south and got several cookbooks. Rouge wanted to catch up on her cooking baking. With an injured Remy at her disposal Rouge seized the opportunity.  Rouge is another veteran member who teaches American History and goes on missions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sug, How\u2019s the papers going? \u201csaid Rouge as she placed the platter of food on the desk next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Just long.\u201d said Remy as he looked his lover who is wearing skin tight blue jeans with socks and green sweater. Rouge mention that it has been a cold lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell keep it up. I am you a snack to help you fuel up your brain. Don\u2019t forget that we have lunch tomorrow. \u201csaid Rouge as she smiled and left his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy noticed that plate of food is a combination Hushpuppies, Fried green tomatoes, fried pickles. He picked one up and bit into it. It was like taste of Heaven. <br>\r\nRemy went back to reading the papers and grading them while subconsciously eating the food from the plate. Two hours later he finally graded the last of the papers and his stomach was bloated and the feeling of being stuffed and sleepiness came to him. He looked out of his window and noticed it was a few hours after noon and he remember that he has no more class for the rest of the day. He moved a recliner chair and quietly submitted to sleeps\u2019 embrace. When he woke he noticed <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He got a several slices of pizza, a few pieces of fried chicken and two tacos and fried rice and couple of egg rolls and orange chicken. He then went to sit down next to rouge. Some of the x men looked at his plate as it was filled past its brim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you can eat all of that dude.\u201d Said Iceman with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so. Beside I\u2019m need to keep up a good around energy for me as I seemed to regain my future see ability through my cards and that I have been working on my energy charge power. I so far have found out that I can charge up a large tree in five seconds, but a large take ten seconds. I also can stop the energy and not make objects explode. \u201csaid Remy as he told his teammates of his discover about his powers and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting your powers seem to protect you from itself just like how the weather protects our friend storm from itself. I would like study this if you have free time. That way we can have some knowledge about how to help further master your abilities.\u201d said Beast as he ate from his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rouge how is your mental battle going?\u201d asked Remy as he was a bit curiosity about his girlfriend. From what he understands Professor X, Jean Grey, Emma Frost, Psylocke, and M, and Sage went into rouge\u2019s mind to help her fight the mental imprints of all the people rough touched in the past. Together rough found out that if she beat an imprint in mental combat then she will gain that imprint\u2019s powers and knowledge and skills.  That was several months ago and Rouge found out that the powers she gains are weaker and watered down from the original as the imprint is a small fraction of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, so far all the mincer imprints joined me without a fight and I have trying to fight some of nastier imprints and I have noticed that with each imprint absorbed my will gets stronger and my mind feels clear and less voices in my head. The powers that I gained are starting to get a bit stronger after I start practice them in exercise. \u201csaid Rouge as she went into details about her fights and training. Some of the x men feel that she might be one of the powerhouses like Storm, Jean Grey, Iceman and Kid Omega. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGambit sat there eating and listening to his girlfriend only for Professor Xavier to come with a mission. The professor explained that a splinter cell of the morlocks are attacking the several cities and that the rest of morlocks don\u2019t have any knowledge and cut off all connection from these extremists. He calls from Jean Grey, Psylocke, Storm, Wolverine, M, Nightcrawler and Cyclopes to lead the team, while Emma Frost will provide psychic backup and rest of the x men to stay at the mansion should it be under attack and protect the students.  The field members got up and ran to change into uniform and got to the Blackbird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGambit notice in all this excitement he finished his plate and saw Rouge helping to clean up the kitchen and putting away the leftovers. He got up and started to help her and clean the dining table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the help sug. I hope these sewer mutants don\u2019t attack the mansion. \u201csaid rouge as she prefers not to fight, but will fight to protect herself and the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, we have a lot of combat trained and experience x men members and several veteran students who know how to fight. \u201csaid Gambit as he cleans the last clean and put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a treat for helping me clean up the kitchen I will make you a small peach pie. Just give me an hour and go sit on the couch and watch some T.V. \u201csaid Rouge as she got the ingredients and shooed Remy out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemy sat on the couch and turned on the big T.V. and watch some action movie after a while he heard a voice and some footsteps coming towards him.

He also heard from Jean that the young girl has shown evidence of strong psychic based powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. LeBeau?

Your reward for helping me clean up the kitchen and putting a former scared student to sleep. Now will you excuse while I take a nice hot shower and got ready for bed.

He was so happy to not have the fear that his horsemen person will influence Warren into doing some horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren went to Charles Xavier to help him gain control over his horseman personality. Charles went to get Jean Grey, Emma Frost, and Elizabeth Braddock.  All four telepaths went into Warren\u2019s mind and helped him beat his malevolent person. After Warren bested his other persona he gained complete control over his horseman mutant powers. Charles then told him to slowly practice his powers and that another telepath should monitor his recovering journey.  Both Jean and Emma back out as they had their duties as full time teachers and x men. Elizabeth volunteer the role. Charles ordered Warren not to engage into any combat, but to find something to pass the time until Warren\u2019s recovery period is down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren found that running his company helped distract him from trying to help out the x men. It has been over a year and Elizabeth would check on him weekly to monitor his recover state. Elizabeth mention to him that he could help the x men by regularly donating money to Charles\u2019 schools for scholarships or to mutant support groups. Since that mention Warren worked very hard and his status as a wealth business rose from top 500 to the top 100 wealthy business men. He also gained the title as \u201cThe Billionaire Mutant Bachelor\u201d His company profited as it grew and became a larger and more powerful company. Warren also started to benefit that any child of an employee would get a scholarship the Charles\u2019s school. Charles happy to get more students to help and teach. Using the money, he expanded his school and hired former x men to teach and be field agents on missions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock Warren out of his business thinking mode. He hoped it wasn\u2019t his secretary as she would often bring in large loads of paperwork. Being the CEO of his company he knows he would deal with paperwork, but since improving his company and his wealth status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d said Warren as he crossed his fingers hoping it was no more paperwork. The door open and a beautiful woman with purple hair and dressed in a purple female business suit. It is Elizabeth. Over the year they reconnected their love and it grew brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Warren.\u201d said the purple haired telepath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Betsy\u201d said Warren as he knows that Elizabeth prefers to go by Betsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to get a bite to eat? I just off the plane and I\u2019m feeling a bit puckish.\u201d said Betsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I had a small lunch, doing lots of paper work. \u201csaid Warren as he walked over and closed down his office and he noticed it was around dinner time. He noticed that all the employee finished their day shift and left. They went to a high end restaurant. They got a seat right away and got a private room with their own balcony overlooking the city at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetsy ordered a seafood salad with a glass of red wine. Warren ordered a large ribeye steak and side order of onion rings and buttery mashed potatoes and a large beer. They talked about each other life. Warren talked about trying to lead his company up the ladder and the mutant support groups his company supports. Betsy talked about her brother leading Britain after it was discovered that dozens high government officials were killed by mutants for mutant slavery and many British mutants lead a rebellion and Captain Britain managed to bring peace after the rebellion and the British citizens wanted him as their king so he was crowned as king and Betsy as a princess who serves as diplomat and part time agent. She told Warren that Charles build a school in Brittan to cater to the mutants there.  In the middle of the story they finished their dinner and Warren ordered the chocolate lava cake and three large scoops of vanilla ice cream. The couple again talked about their life. Betsy making so many appearances at events and showing the world that mutants aren\u2019t evil. Warren talking about the endless paper work. By the time dinner and dessert was over both Warren and Betsy full mainly Warren as his stomach was stuffed to the brim and was making gurgling noises of satisfaction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren paid for the meal and invited Betsy back to his place. Betsy agreed and together flew off from the balcony to Warren\u2019s penthouse. Warren fly by his wings and Betsy flew by her telekinesis. Warren led them to his penthouse which had a great view of the city. Warren had Forge built him a customized high level security to protect his penthouse when Warren is away or inside the penthouse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple landed on the patio balcony and Warren disarmed the security system and turned it back one after the couple entered Warren\u2019s penthouse. Warren led the Betsy to his bedroom. Betsy wanted to wash up and used his shower. Warren also washed up after the flight and day\u2019s work. Both of them encountered each other in Warren\u2019s bedroom.

He was distantly aware of Kitty putting another forkful to his mouth, too relieved at the sensation of something, <i>anything</i> filling the black hole in his middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the feeling of emptiness subsided, but he just couldn't bear the thought of letting Kitty's efforts go to waste. Besides, he wasn't empty, but he certainly wasn't full anymore either, and so he continued to eat as Kitty fed him with what had to be two rashers of bacon and over a dozen sausages and an entire plate of biscuits and gravy and what had to be half a pound of scrambled eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the fork did not return and Peter opened his eyes to see Kitty smiling at him as she collected the empty plates. Only then did he become aware of the heavy fullness of his belly, so full that he felt as though he would pop, his stomach a visibly distended bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my guy,\" Kitty whispered, stroking his bulging stomach with one hand, pressing slightly and finding no give as he let out a moan of surprise. \"Why don't you take a nap and sleep it off? It looks like you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't Peter's way to stay in bed past waking, but neither was it his way to eat a breakfast for three or four all by himself. And he was so full that he was actually tired. Surely a little nap wouldn't hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty left the room with a faint smile on her lips, he stuffed boyfriend snoring softly behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He shook of the grogginess of sleep and he saw there was Kitty smiling with a tray with three large cakes. He looked down and saw that his belly went down and his abs. He got out of bed and went to the floor length mirror in the bedroom. He saw that he still had his musclebound bodybuilder like physique. He then squinted his eyes and notices that he lost some of his ab definition. Kitty joined him and hugged him from behind and started to move her hands up and down his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did my big man sleep?\u201d said Kitty as looked up to her future husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I just noticed that some of muscle definition is gone. I must be on the right path. \u201csaid Peter he felt his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great. Your sister took me to the local bakery and I bought you some cakes to fill up till lunch as it is just over an hour since I last stuffed you. She told me that we have a near limitless money as she said that the realm she rules over Limbo has lots of precious gems that she can pawn. Well let\u2019s get you in bed so I can start feeding you. Your sister will back around dinner time as she has some magical duties to fulfill. \u201csaid Kitty as she felt that Peter\u2019s abs felt a tiny bit less hard and firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when she said that Peter\u2019s stomach let out a roar of hunger as it demanded to get feed. Peter blushed with embarrassed as she got settled in bed, but Kitty giggle and hug him when she got into bed. She picked up a fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I was in the bakery there some many baked good I had a hard time to choose and I just picked three random cakes. The first one a triple layer coffee chocolate fudge cake, the second one is strawberry villain triple layer cake and the last one is a triple layer apple caramel spice cake with buttercream frosting No open wide. \u201csaid Kitty as she brought a forkful of cake to Peter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter grinned as he just wanted something to fill the gnarling sensation in his gut. He opened his mouth and fill in a bliss like trace as he opened and ate the forkful of cake each time Kitty place the fork to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling hunger slowly disappeared only to be filled with the sensation of full, stuffed and heavy. Time seem to go by fast for both until Peter opened his mouth and he felt no fork and he opened his eyes. He saw the tray of cakes gone and his belly looked round and it looked like he is going to pop. He moved his hand and felt that his belly is firm and taut. He started to feel a bit tired as he ate three large cakes. He let out a large belch and Kitty giggled as he went red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that must a good sign that you liked the cakes. At least I know what cake you don\u2019t mind if I go back to the bakery. Why don\u2019t you come out into the living room? You can lie down on the couch and relax, watch some T.V.  and I can rub your belly.\u201d said Kitty as she got the tray and left the room to go wash the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter got out of bed and put on some super stretchy sweat pants. He went out of the bedroom and lied down on the couch relaxed and turned on the T.V.  Kitty returned and sat next to him and started to ruby his belly. Peter\u2019s belly let out of gargle noise as some pain left due to her rubbing the belly. Peter fell into a comforting trace as he watches T.V. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I don\u2019t end up the size of Blob and Juggernaut combined. \u201csaid Peter to Kitty during a commercial break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about even if you become bigger than them combine. I will always love. Beside you could always sit of people who makes jokes about your weight. You would make a nice teddy bear to cuddle. \u201csaid Kitty light heartily as she leaned to him while rubbing his belly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The feast includes like pirozhki and symiki and some meat dishes for desserts many baked goods. Illyana joined them a few hours before dinner and help Kitty with the cooking and baking. The mutant teleporter talked about ruling the realm of Limbo and dealing demons trying to rebel and how she would fight and put down the upstarts. She also talked about find some new spell books to learn from and some new masters to further learn magic from, but there were not many masters that would help as she knew what they knew. Just as they set the table if plates and the food Peter walked in and he looked at the food in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can eat all of this. I\u2019m hunger, but not that hunger to polish off this meal. \u201csaid Peter in a shocked voice as he thought his sister and his fianc\u00e9e seemed to cook up a bit too much food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about just eat what you can. \u201csaid Kitty as she started to herself to some of the fish and then she went back into the kitchen to get some soda for her and Illyana. While she got Peter a bottle of Vodka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started eating Illyana talked about her duties as the ruler of Limbo and some are boring as she has to listen to demons while Kitty talked superhero gossip and fashion. Peter started eating and helping himself to the meat and fish.  Both women talked about fellow x men members and what is new in the superhero community. They would glance over to Peter who looked like he was get drunk and started eat and acting a bit tipsy. Kitty grinned and wanted to try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter your slowing down, I guess Wolverine was right. He told me that you would never finished what every food dish I make. I told me that my lover can eat and finish what every I can cook up. \u201csaid Kitty sweetly as she saw Peter looked shock about what Wolverine said and then saw she got angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat my did my fellow x men say that ? \u201cSaid Peter confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Wolverine he is always looking for some excitement, don\u2019t you remember all the times where Wolverine would sneak off the mansion ground and go look for a bar or some bad guys to beat up. Some of the veteran x men like cyclops, storm, nightcrawler and others are at their wit\u2019s ends on what to do with him. \u201csaid Illyana as she sipped from her soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis reason was that my cooking has been pretty bad in the past, but I have taken cooking lessons and read over a dozen books on cooking. So are you\u2019re going to let Wolverine\u2019s insult about my cooking slide or are you going to eat all my food that I and Illyana made for you. \u201csaid kitty with a bit of a grin as she felt a bit sad about manipulation her fianc\u00e9e, but she really wanted to him to finish the feast. She remembered that a few years ago that some of the x men were on vacation at there was a fair going in the local town. Bobby, Kurt and Remy entered Peter in a pie eating contest as they figured that a big guy needs a lot of food. Peter was shock, but took up the challenge. He finished first place after eating eight pies with Kitty cheering him on. She rewarded him that night with a sleeping inducing belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked insult his eyes seemed to glow with flames of prides as he grew up with the lesson always defend your lover. He started to eat fast and soon started to reach the rest of the dishes on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty inwardly smiling she tapped Illyana on her shoulder and the sorceress snapped her fingers as he eyes briefly glowed pink and she knew her spell on her brother was places. The spell was to help reduce the pain from his stomach and to help with the digestion. <br>\r\nKitty picker her dishes and the same with Illyana and they went into the kitchen to clean their plates and they started exchanging ideas about the future wedding like wedding themes locations, food and what wedding dress she should get.  They talked for about an hour and they decide to get back into the dining room and they were shocked on what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Peter slumped against his chair with food stains around his mouth and the plates of food were gone and his belly bloated, he looked like he swallowed a medicine ball.  Peter burped and Kitty went over tom him and helped to his feet and guides him to their room to shower and get ready for bed. She looked at the plates and Illyana snapped her fingers at the plates started to clean themselves and then went over to the plate cabinets. Kitty mouthed \u201cThank you\u201d the sorceress just waved it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fianc\u00e9s both went into their room and after both showered and get ready for bed in their pajamas. Peter just slept in a pajama pants and Kitty just wore one of Peter over sized shirts. Peter got into bed and surrendered to sleep\u2019s embrace. While kitty also surrendered to sleep, but put a hand on Peter\u2019s stuffed gut. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He got up and opened his eyes and saw that Kitty was not there. He heard the nose coming from the kitchen and decided to take a quick shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he took his shower he noticed that some his cloths were a little tight. He saw in the mirror that his abs lost more definition. He estimated that another week or two of mass eating and his abs will disappear. He left the bedroom and headed towards the kitchen. He saw his sister and Kitty sitting at the kitchen table drink coffee. He saw their uneasy look on their faces and noticed there were a few other people who joined them. He saw Jean Grey, Storm, Beast, and Rouge sitting at the table talking to both women. Kitty saw him and beckon him to come over and join their conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter so nice to join us. We are trying to convince you three to come back to the x mansion and rejoin the x men.\u201d Said Jean as she sipped on her tea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? My powers got messed up after the phoenix incident and what about Emma, Scoot, Namor, and my sister\u2019s powers. Also, the fact that my sister is not liked among the younger mutants. \u201csaid Peter as he pulled up a chair to sit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have found a way for the mutants who has their powers disrupted by the phoenix and to slow regain control over them. Emma regained control over her powers very quickly and Scoot is almost done regaining control over his. \u201csaid Beast as he explained his methods of devices he created to help the inflicted mutants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeside we need a strongman like yourself Peter and you can give class on art. Kitty skills are need from some field missions and she does make a great teacher. I remember some students who took her dance classes loved it as well as your computer class and Illyana skills as a teleporter and a sorceress would help in case we come across any supernatural threats. Some of the younger mutants are still your friends while a few other are starting to forget about your past actions.  \u201csaid Rouge in her southern accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, as I know you three wanted some time alone, but we miss your presence and I noticed a rise in anti-mutant crimes and activity. I know you can take care our yourself, but the students need more mentors and protectors against this wave of mutant hate. \u201csaid Storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you heard about Russia\u2019s stance on mutants. How they would be heavily monitored and arrested should they step out of line. \u201csaid Beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe tried to find you using Cerebro, but it didn\u2019t pick your sister\u2019s mind only Kitty and Peter\u2019s mind. We were worried that the three of you were missing or arrested. May we know what you three did when you left the team. \u201csaid Jean as she remembered that she used Cerebro trying to find the three mutants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, while being away from the team. I decided focus on my art and education. I enrolled at the local college and soon earned a bachelor degree in art and spent time regaining control over my powers. I met my sister one day while I was a bakery getting some pastries to eat. \u201csaid Peter as he pointed towards his framed diploma on the wall. The guest looked over and noticed it. \u201cI have some thoughts about going for a master\u2019s degree soon. \u201csaid Peter as he got himself a beer and some pastries to munch on. Peter wanted time to focus on himself and help his artistic passion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI spent my time focus on my dancing so I took several classes to further my understanding and learn new dancing steps and types. I also spent some time with the guardian of the galaxy. Star lord grew some affection, but I turned him down and left the team.  Some of my dancing class were in Russia for their ballet. After one class I ran into Illyana and she led me to Peter and we rekindle our relationship. \u201csaid Kitty and she had flashback of adventures with the guardians and learning from dance instruction from all over the world and finally reuniting with her old flame and resuming their love for each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI spent some time to regain control over my teleportation powers. I teleported and felt drained after using my mutant powers. I realized that I unintentional teleported myself in the wilderness of Russia. I rested and soon a woman came across to me. \u201csaid Illyana as she conjured up a small magical hologram projection that help show her story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt turned out my magical reputation spread through the mystical realms. One of the realms is the home to the Slavic gods. They heard of me and offered to help me with mutant powers and my magic. Their reason is that our ancestor who was the sorcerer supreme was adopted by the Slavic gods and the gods have watched over our bloodline. The time I spent with time has helped me regain control over my mutant powers and increased my magical skills and knowledge. I spent a year away from earth, but time over faster in the god\u2019s realm. A thousand years past in the gods\u2019 realms.  I also managed to destroy my bloodstones but retained their black magic. After I finished my training with the gods, the gods gave me a gift by blessing me with a bit of their powers.\u201d Said Illyana as her magical projection show her training with the gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat are some incredible stories and I am sure that later you would each explain your stories in finer detail to the other X-Men later at the mansion. \u201csaid Beast as Jean, Rouge and Storm nod along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, Kitty, and Illyana glanced at each other and then motioned for Kitty to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would love to be back at the X mansion and teach the younger generations of mutants, but there is something you have to know about me and Peter.  We are engaged and Peter has a curse on him that can\u2019t be broken or lifted. \u201csaid Kitty as she looked to Peter and Illyana for understanding. Both siblings explained Peter\u2019s situation to the other X-men. How Illyana altered the curse on Peter and what he needs to do for the curse to nullify it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulation to your engagement, but the curse is a bigger problem. \u201csaid Beast as he smiled to the happy couple.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is possible to call in other mystics like Doctor Strange, Shaman, Scarlet Witch and others to help life the curse. \u201csaid Storm trying to think of a magic user to help her Russian friend from his curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the curse that was cast was very complex and was woven into our bloodline. Curse has very small time periods in which it can be lifted, our family one was a mixture of dark and lost magic which is very hard to even tackle. I told the gods of the curse and they could only alter it not lift it as they wanted to. \u201csaid Illyana explain how she search through various spell books to find a way to lift the cure, but couldn\u2019t find any help her brother free himself from his heavy burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t forget our offer to come back to the manor, we won\u2019t force you to go back, but beware that Russian mutants local see Illyana and Peters are heroes, but the Russian government sees you two as potential threats. \u201csaid Jean to Peter and Illyana. Both siblings looked confused and Jean explained in further detail.  \u201cEmma, Psylocke, and I have been scanning the minds of Russia through our telepathy and we found what the people of Russia think of you. The government is starting to put plans to stop you if you two step out of lines. \u201cexplained Jean herfind with the other two telepaths<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, Kitty, and Illyana looked at each other and then whisper to each other. Kitty looked at the other X-men and spoke.\u201d We have decided to\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that the other would be more sensitive and not say anything about Peter\u2019s new weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that settles it.

Kitty then made a list of furniture and other stuff that would be moved over and what stuff can be hand carried over when the Blackbird jet comes and helps them move in the next few weeks. After making the list she noticed her lover was sleeping on the couch after he ate the large snack. With his belly bloated and light snoring Peter looked like he would take a long nap. Kitty smiled and brought over a large blanket and put it on him, she went into the kitchen to wash the dishes from her lover\u2019s large snack and when the other X-men were here.  Afterwards she then went to her and Peter\u2019s rooms and turned on the T.V., turned the channel to a cooking show about high calorie dishes and sat down on the bed watch the show to learn more about cooking high calorie meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
