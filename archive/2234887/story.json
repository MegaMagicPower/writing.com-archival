You have every power you need to go out there. so, WHAT ARE YOU DOING SITTING THERE WHINING AT ME?!\" Ran angrily shouts from the next room in Yuyuko's settlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari gaps to the clouds of gensokyo and thinks,'Ran, such a jerk sometimes. Meh, couldn't blame her. But I've explored every place possible on this planet. I'm 1400 years old. With that time I did absolutely everything I can. Hmmm... It's pretty rare I explore other universes though. Why don't I go there? Or send and watch someone there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quite some time thinking, she then wants to send someone to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looks around, it looks like she is in a deep hole-like cave with some pillars rising around her. She also sees the exit on top, so she flies up. She was almost halfway when there's- *THUMP* \"Oof!\" -an invisible barrier trapping her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Yukari, can't let me get out of your ways, huh? Wherever you're watching, mark my words, you will regret your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy!\" shouts a rather silly-sounding voice that echoed through the cave.

Now lead the way, Flower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT YOUR SLAVE YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SH--AACK\", a fireball came out of nowhere, hitting Flowey off-guard by the side. You look to where he went with it, but he already disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My child! Are you ok?\" said a voice behind where Flowey was. It was a humanoid Goat with 2 horns and a purple dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'll be watching the whole way)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules to this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Send someone that actually plays a role in the game. (No just one random fairy or spirit. If you send a fairy, it has to be someone like Cirno or Clownpiece)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No vore, gore, or excessive/detailed explanation of blood/death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No sexual content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Choice chapters are only allowed whenever necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Keep the characters' personality the same as in the video game/manga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. It is recommended at some point(if you choose someone else than her) to change POV to Yukari checking on them cuz the story is she wants to see the other's reaction to the new place but don't want to kill them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. THE GAP HAG RULES. Ohh and if Reimu finds out about this mischief of Yukari's, she'll try to beat her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Battles between characters are allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. The person sent cannot die and the story only could be ended when the person comes back or if you don't want to end it at all, give choices on what adventure does that same person will get again to another verse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHAVE FUN WITH THE CROSSOVER STUFF Y'ALL. Anything is allowed, from Disney movies, video games, books, even other stories in WdC, Deviantart, Wattpad etc, just remember to provide the link to the original story first.
