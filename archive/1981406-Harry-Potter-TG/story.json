Since Hogwarts itself moved the beds the beds with her students, something Harry found out his second year, he began to store some things that he had nicked from several other students in his bed and always stored them before he was going to be going home for the summer. He opened up the secret compartment and pulled out one of the pairs of panties he had and slipped them onto his nearly hairless body. They felt so soft and comfortable around his waist. He picked up a potion that was also stored, an experiment he had made, and downed the entire bottle. His body began to shift and change and he started to grow breasts again. He had done this numerous times and all it took was a sample of his DNA and an object that had his parents in it. In a way the Amish where right on how a photograph took part of the soul with it as just a magical picture was more than enough for the potion to work. He let out a moan as his penis shrunk and it was replaced by a vagina. He, well more like she, smiled and looked down at her body and how much of a change had happened over the summer. He conjured up a mirror and smiled as he looked like</span></div></div>",

Harriet's long red hair now flowed down past her mid back and she already had a firm set of C cups. She smiled to herself and brought out one of the transfigured and resizeable bras and hooked it in the front before turning it around and putting the straps on. Of course there where rumors of a gorgeous red head around the Hogsmed village yet no student had any idea who it was. Many just assumed she was a foreign student that was visiting the previous year yet she had never shown up for any of the meals, feasts, or tasks. Many though she was an almost corporeal ghost and yet no one knew for sure. Harriet got up and just after her transformation she was a bit wobbly on her feet due to the size and weight difference.

Transforming back into Harriet, she went to the corridor behind the 3 eyed witch statue where her date outfit was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the carriages Draco was worried.  What if Umbridge caught Harry, or if someone followed them.  On the outside he was perfectly calm, but inside his mind was a war zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, all done.\"  Harriet said as she put on her left boot.  With about a foot of snow on the ground she had to dress warmer than she liked but for Draco it was worth it.  She started following the path she had taken so many zones before, being extra careful this time exiting the path.  Her close friends knew that was how Harry got to Hogsmede when he was unallowed, so they might have connected the dots if they saw Harriet.  She walked outside and saw no stunts.  Perfect!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco left his fellow Slytheriins to torment whatever younger kids they found and headed towards the Three Broomsticks.  Out front was Harriet.  In a knee length fluffy white coat, with green snow boots, and black tights being able to be seen at the time.  She also had a matching pair of gloves and earmuffs that went with her coat.  Her red hair was down to her mid back in layers of curls, and no glasses or scar in sight.  Yes this Potter was much more appealing to the eye.  Draco thought as he casually walked towards Harriet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet turned to see Draco coming her way, she ran towards him and spun around in his arms acting like a girlfriend who hadn't seen him in months, not a Gryffindor who sees him daily.  The two hastily went towards the three broomsticks for shelter from the cold December air.  Taking off her coat Harriet was wearing a sparkly green turtleneck dress about the same length as her coat. Draco sat down next to her and pulled out an envelope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's from my parents, it's addressed to both of us so I wanted to open it with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Drco and Red,<br>\r\nDraco and Harriet chuckled that the malfoys called her that simply for not being able to remember the name she gave them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much consideration, we have decided to join the _________ side in the war.  We wish to have the two of you at the mansion to go over further details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius and Narcissa Malfoy</span></div></div>",

Draco said just as their food arrived.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the end of the day the two had to say goodbye, and act as if they wouldn't see each other for a while.  The kiss lasted longer than normal, and when they finally broke Harriet was in tears saying she'd miss Draco.  Once the carriages pulled away, she ducked back into the tunnels to return back to Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks passed and it was time for the holidays.  Hermione and her family were going to Italy, while the Weasleys left to visit Charlie in Romania.  As soon as both of his friends had left, Harry took the potion once again.  Underneath his robes was a pair a skinny jeans and a low cut blouse.  A simple displacement spell put her male clothes back in her trunk in Gryffindor tower.  While the trunk she had with her was full of clothes that fit Harriet quite nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh Draco, it's so good to see you, and.. I'm sorry I can never remember your name dear.\"  Narcissa said to Harriet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Jade Mrs. Malfoy.\"  Harriet said with a small curtesy.  \"Well come along Dracos father and I have big news for the two of you.\"  Narcissa said pulling out a port key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home dear.\"  Lucius said as he kissed his wife.  \"Ahh, Draco and Miss..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade.\"  Harriet piped in.<br>\r\n\"Ahh yes, well before we all get settled in, Jade I understand you said you were living in a small apartment in Diagonal alley, is that correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"  Harriet replied sticking with her cover story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as it seems our Draco is quite smitten with you, we decided that we would like you to move in with us.  We will have you take the tests to get you out in Dracos year, and come next fall you will be going to shool with him at Hogwarts.\"  Lucious said with a tone that showed this was thought over a fair amount.</span></div></div>",

A momentary, memory of how girly she'd been, a vague strain in her lower back from her hips, the memory of the swaying steps, the fullness of her fundament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran a hand over her rear, smoothing away imaginary creases in the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was informative.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione scanned Harriet's words for any sign of ... of inappropriate sentiment. But found nothing, as a girl, Harriet was clearly not even remotely interested in girls... in <i>that </i>way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled her approval, perhaps she could now relax and enjoy this little experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that spell won't wear off for at least another hour.\"</span></div></div>",

After all, this year's exams would be crucial in deciding whether he possessed the skill, power, and dedication to become an Auror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked the library first, always a safe bet for Hermione, but this time she wasn't there. She wasn't in the common room, either, and Harry was about to give up, when he recalled the Marauder's Map. Finding an empty table he laid it out, and set about scanning it for Hermione's name and location. Magic came a poor second to Google Maps in some respects Harry thought. The flexible nature of the castle architecture made the task even harder. But he finally spotted her, in alone in an isolated part of the castle. Watching for a short while he confirmed it was her. The marker wasn't moving, and he guessed she was lost in a good book... a good text book, probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take ten minutes to walk that far, but 'Mischief Managed', he refolded the map and tucked it away. He spotted Draco as he made his way through the castle, but Draco didn't spot him, so he avoided him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he climbed the last set of stairs, Harry was short of breath, as he approached his friend. His shoes made no noise as he spotted her. She was sitting with her back to the door, in the middle of the floor and from her gestures stirring a cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that she didn't know he was there. She was talking quietly to herself, he was very tempted to listen, but afraid that she'd say something she didn't want overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Harry weighed up his options, and decided to startle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping about two feet from her back, he could smell the shampoo in her hair, and hear her humming a tune as she mixed the pink liquid in her cauldron. She carefully dipped a tiny potion phial into the mix and took a sample.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione.\" he said loudly, but without shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped out of her skin. Hermione thrashed about until she got her feet under her, then she whirled about to face Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cauldron rang, as her shoes clanged against it, her face was furious. Harry put on his best, 'It was only a joke' face, and raised his hands to signal his surrender.</span></div></div>",

Any students except her close friends were to be diverted from her area at all costs. \"I only hope that we find the cure.\" He sighed warily. He had heard reports that the Dark Lord was on the move again, and that it was only Harry Potter who could defeat him. Back at the hospital wing, Hermione was watching her body double eat dinner. It was the third plate, and by the time that the plate was nearly licked clean, she grabbed it and put it just outside the cordoned off area. \"Ok, just stop it, it's like watching a pug eat slop! You need to cut that out before you start getting fat!\" For emphasis, she poked her fingers into her double's belly, which had already grown soft. \"Don't...\" Harry began, but it was too late. A blast of air out her rear brought the conversation to a brief halt. \"This is not over. We will get you in shape at some point!\" Hermione bid Harry goodbye, which was fortunate, as Harry decided to break out some dessert after she left, falling asleep to the vision of Hermione telling her off in the morning.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s rather unfortunate what happened to you. How do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike... absolute garbage. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, everyone thinks I\u2019m stuck with some horrible ailment, my concentration is shot, and above all else I\u2019m... I\u2019m getting fat!\u201d  Har\u2019minone whisper fiercely, shaking her pudgy gut for emphasis.<br>\r\n\u201cYou poor thing. That must be terrible for you. Here, let me see what I can do with you.\u201d<br>\r\nThe odd phrasing suddenly registered with Har\u2019minone. With her? That was an awfully weird way to say that.<br>\r\n\u201cGinny, what exactly-\u201d Any words that could have expressed Har\u2019mione\u2019s confusion were quickly silenced as Ginny crawled onto her bed, holding down her arms with her surprisingly muscled arms and vice-like grip. Har\u2019minone attempted to move, (Making her soft chest and belly jiggle like mad in the process.)<br>\r\n\u201cGinny! What the hell? Why are you doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve always had a thing for chubbier girls. I wanted to be with Hermione, but she... she wasn't interested. But now you look like Hermione, and you just look too adorable to pass up. Don\u2019t worry, no one going to interrupt this...\u201d<br>\r\nGinny placed a hand on Har\u2019minone\u2019s chest, tearing the fabric of her blouse in the process. Her soft, flabby tits shook even harder, causing Har\u2019minone to moan softly. She always liked Ginny, ad if Ginny liked fatter girls, and she was now a fatter girl, who was he to argue with her? By this point, her robe had been taken off as well, leaving her in a far too tight pair of bra and panties than would normally be deemed respectable. Har\u2019minone doubted anything about her would be left to the imagination after Ginny was finished.<br>\r\nGinny seemed to only breathe in deeply. \u201cThis is so great. Maybe you make a better girl, Harry.\u201d Bending down, Ginny began to lift up the band on Har\u2019minone underwear when...<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

The nurse was diligent, and despite the first few days, and the sneaking attempts to find something embarrassing, the true nature of the accident was unknown to the general school population. With curtains blocking the innocent casual observer, and more active defences against the more determined. It meant Har'mione's only visitors were Ron and Hermione herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was getting bored, and starting to worry about other Hermione'ish changes that she was imagining. The books were becoming more of a distraction, and even a visit to the library felt like an exciting escape. She snorted in disappointment, the library visit was entirely in her own imagination. She wanted to just leave the infirmary, go anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer restlessness worsened, as she found more comfort in food, and less exercise meant she quickly piled on the weight. Ron visited as often as possible, and tried to keep her spirits up. There was an accusation in Hermione's eyes, every time the two girls caught each others attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house-elves kept the secret like any loyal retainer, and when Dobby found out about Har'mione's enhanced appetite, he was happy to sneak some snacks in. It even brought Winky out of her shell, a chance to help, another invalid, another prisoner to look after like Master Crouch. Har'mione scuffed her shoes angrily along the stone floor. She missed the freedom, she missed her broom, she hated being confined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about a week later, and Harry knew that he had another week, (at least) in this curvy body. Another week, until Professor Sprout's herbs were sufficiently developed to be brewed into an antidote. Har'mione squirmed her plump arse deeper into the seat, torturing herself with the imagined response of the Potion Master, with the delight that'd light up Professor Snape's face, if they'd had to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teeth ground together nervously, a sliver of apple peel working loose. She wasn't sure whether or not he knew, but she had her suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least now she wasn't confined to bed anymore, wasn't confined to those .... nighties .... she shuddered at the recollection. Even this... Even wearing the Girls' uniform was at least more clothes. She felt the chaffing of the straps over her shoulders, the constant awareness of her bust. The relentless weight of the girls. The swish of the hem of her skirt a constant reminder, as if the near-constant jiggling that accompanied every step, every shrug, every damned movement served to remind her, that not only was she female, but abundantly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to imagine how this was for Hermione, how it'd feel to look at a friend, and see a fun-house reflection looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a duelling pose. Pointing her wand at the empty air, in salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://orig10.deviantart.net/f652/f/2016/230/4/a/chubby_hermione_by_jinglevellrock-daed3oy.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://orig10.deviantart.net/f652/f/2016...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, her shoulders collapsed, she wanted a challenge, a real challenge. She needed to take control, to avoid this passivity. The bed springs creaked, as she sat down heavily. The roll of her bust, oddly comforting, now almost familiar. She thought of some simple things to do, some nearby places to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Dumbledore knew he had an invisibility cloak. He hadn't told her not to... so that's practically the same as allowing her to explore. It certainly felt like consent after staring at the same walls for the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just take a walk with Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisit the greenhouse, and check on the progress in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisit the kitchens, and thank Dobby and Winky properly in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust stretch her legs, and take a walk. Surely with the Marauder's Map, she could avoid accidental encounters.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mischievous side surfaced, now she could visit the Girls Dorm in the Gryffindor Tower.</span></div></div>",

As a Head of House, she had a great deal of freedom and power to exercise it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny knew which flowers were about to blossom, and had encouraged Harry to come and enjoy them as they bloomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe semper-omni berries were also bursting with flavour, and an open-secret as the main ingredient for Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were even stronger when freshly plucked, and the two students fed them to each other. As they took turns, they tried to guess which flavour their partner had just eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half a dozen, they stopped when Ginny got a Vomit flavoured one.

Her usual dour self. Her eyes disapproving, as if she could see who was reading the notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's when Hermione, Ron and I get together to work on our potions.\" Harry explained. \"We don't want to give Professor Snape the chance to take points from Gryffindor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was Wednesday.\" Ginny objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped Harry didn't press her about how she knew his timetable in such detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Wednesday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Professor McGonagall would be a great teacher, as an animagus, she has experience of other bodies... at least one... as a cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had already told Ginny about his and Ron's experiment with polyjuice.

Changing into a more casual outfit, Harry headed down to the dungeon, taking a circuitous route. An easy task given the school's natural tendency to change and shift around, Harry was soon overhearing a smattering of conversations from the students that were assembling for the club. He managed to avoid being seen, keeping just around the corner or sufficiently into the shadows to avoid detection. He recognised many of the names, but with a school the size of Hogwarts there were a significant number he didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a close call with a young Slytherin girl, while Harry was scanning the Map for Ginny's arrival. But he made it into cover before being spotted. He had left the cloak back in the dorm room, happy that he wouldn't need it for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few minutes to six o'clock, when Ginny's trace appeared on the Dungeon floor. The rest of the students had filed into the class in preparation for the club, an excited buzz clear in their chatter and on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny arrived with three Gryffindor friends, but sensing Harry's nearness she held back. Feigning an untied shoelace she shooed her friends onwards, allowing Harry to approach and kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responded happily, taking his hand as she melted into the moment, when they broke apart Harry found a small phial in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyebrow quirked up with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you trust me?\" Ginny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you trust me?\" she repeated seeing more questions coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod she directed his gaze back to the tiny potion bottle in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An answering squeak drew her attention, and with an effort she turned her head just enough to make out the violently angry eyes of a furious Ginny Weasley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a dam breaking, the memories came flooding back. She truly was Harry Potter, and that was her..<i>. no, damn it..</i>. and that was his girlfriend. He wrenched and heaved, desperate to save her from this humiliation, this ordeal. He at least was used to enforced helplessness, a lifetime at the Dursley's gave her the insight to transcend this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother realisation hit him just a moment later. One thing he was sure that Ginny didn't know, one extra barrier she was unaware of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">- - -</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn incident from Harry's last trip home. Even with the warnings, even knowing the rules, Harry felt more comfortable when he had his wand near to hand. When the Dursley's were being worse than even their own abysmal normal. Washing the dinner dishes, the pile almost complete, sitting on the draining board. His wand rested on the window sill, with the view across the garden, to the sparrows playing in the pampas grass. He remember whirling round at the creak of the kitchen floorboard, to see Dudley, scissors in hand ready to take a thick chunk of Harry's wild hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a pace or so away, he froze scissor hand already outstretched. Harry's breath flaring his nostrils. He didn't make the most intimidating sight. Though hopefully enough to make Dudley think twice. Hell, enough to make him stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAware of the law, he focused his attention, summoning magic. Just to make his wand tip glisten, not enough to cast a spell, not enough to trigger a howler from the ministry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyes narrowed, soapy water dripping from his rubber gloves. He had to convince Dudley he was about to regain his piggy little tail. Stubbornly Harry's wand refused to even light. The wand felt odd, unresponsive in his grip. Adjusting his grip, it still felt wrong, like it wasn't a wand, that this was simply a dead piece of wood, with no life, no magic, nothing. The chill in his veins flooded every part of him, and a shudder raced down his spine. He gritted his teeth, snarling at him, until Dudley shrieked and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry drew the wand closer, looking for damage, for some reason his wand hadn't worked. Was this a pre-emptive punishment, was the ministry intervening before he inflated a family member, or levitated another cake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands trembling uncontrollably he only just managed to put it back on the sill. A faint hollow rattling as the wand came to rest. It had never felt more like an impotent, little stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back the tears he felt in the corner of his eyes, he finished the dishes and fled back to his room. Once the bedroom door was shut behind him, he slumped to the floor, his back resting against the cheap pine. Hope was hard to find, but with some experimentation, he found his wand was still working. He found also that it was the damned rubber gloves that were the problem. A quiet conversation with Hermione confirmed his suspicions. That the unnatural material, it's inherent muggle nature meant it interfered with magic. Much like trying to get a mobile phone to work at Hogwarts. Or the need for Rita Skeeter to be an animagus, rather than plant an electronic bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">- - -</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, with them both bound head to toe in latex, especially their hands in latex gloves, they might as well be muggles.

Other parts felt like they were deflating and withering away. Her arms thinned, and she felt the cuffs brush over her fingers. There was a swelling as she felt her breasts come into place. Their unfamiliar weight pulling at her shoulders. The wall scrapped over her ass, as her legs lost a few inches, and she shrank downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it done?\" she asked uncertainly. Her voice now softer, sweeter, and undeniably girlish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all the answer she needed. \"Don't worry about Minerva either... I gave her a version of the Confundus charm...

Her voice strained, but not unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls don't do that.\" Ginny snapped, as she watched Harry pulling and plucking at her uniform. The boys Gryffindor uniform not fitting her for a number of reasons. However, the disapproval, as the slender fingers tried to tug the uniform into proper alignment. A task entirely beyond the possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vestiti Femininio</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny tapped the new girl on the nose, and watched the uniform shifted to fit <i>Roberta Ravenclaw</i>. She was the Great, great, great ...<i>etc</i>... Grand-daughter of one of the school's founders. The bearer of a Proud witching name, and not a girl who checked out her own cleavage, and plucked at the waist of her trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's jumper shifted, taking on a more generous shape. It was unsettling to watch as his trousers merged, becoming a long skirt. Which in it's turn retreated up her legs... Far too far in her opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a surreptitious glance confirmed it was longer than Ginny's. It was unsettling to watch as the Gryffindor Lion unstitched itself. She had to restrain her slim hand from covering the emblem. Even as she watched, it began restitching itself into the familiar blue and bronze of her new house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe failed to stop her startled gasp, as she felt something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her first bra forming. It lifted the girls, cradling and supporting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny had to slap away<i> Roberta</i>'s hands as she reached for her bosom, and shoulders. Trying impotently to make it fit without pulling unnecessarily. It was a fruitless task, even as Roberta's mouth quirked to the side in submission to the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Ginny's face, suggested that she knew Roberta name was rather different among half of the students. For the boys she was 'Busty Berta'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's discomfort was clear. Ginny pulled her shoulders back, but even with the best will and support in the world she was never going to be competing in that department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta thought the spell was finished, but Ginny's spell was just completing. With a waver, she rose up a few inches as her shoes gained a heel. While she was still tottering forward and back, and before she could resist Ginny guided across the threshold and into the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we are finally all here, we can begin.\" her Scottish brogue familiar and unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a silent spell and a flick of her wand. The door closed behind them, and the heavy lock clicked as the key turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now separate into pairs.\"</span></div></div>",

Twenty points for the girl who first successfully performs the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slytherin girls immediately went into a huddle, casting malicious glances at the other girls as they clustered into house groups. There were four Slytherins, four Gryffindors, two Hufflepuff, and six Ravenclaws (including Roberta).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta felt a hand on her arm drawing her away from Ginny. She didn't want to go... But didn't want to attract undue attention to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ravenclaws agreed to work together, and were eager to win the points. Roberta felt a little side-lined, as the others largely ignored her when she agreed, and disagreed. Nothing nasty was said, but ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cast a glance over her shoulder to see Ginny deep in conversation with her three friends. Noticing the look, she sent a sly wink in Roberta's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall slowly went through the wand movements. She refused to share the incantation until she was satisfied that everyone was sufficiently good enough to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Roberta was sure everyone was a fifth year or older. It settled her nerves, presumably an incantation on the poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliberately she placed her wand down, and went over the pronunciation of the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Verto Permuto.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone was chanting it in time. Working to synchronise their breathing... their timing... their emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the unfamiliar clothes... or the distraction of wearing satin and silk. But you found your breathing to be ... distracting. You didn't expect to be so aware of your breasts. The merest shift of your shoulders, the simplest of brush of the fabric as your nipples moved was a source of ... -<i>er</i>- ... loss of focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Now, girls I want you to pick a partner. And focus your attention on them... Ignore everyone else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Slytherin pairs were instantly casting the spell. Their wand flicks just a little too eager, and their chants just a little too angry. There were slightly pained gasps from each girl whenever the magic failed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word being said you pair up with Maria Glossop. You know her name, and that's about it. Despite the decision being made silently, you still feel you were last to be selected... and least desired in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Verto Permuto</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wand a little uneven in the swoosh. But you still feel a vague pull... As if you leaned forwards a few inches... As if the world ... no ... As if Maria jumped closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the sensation vanishes, and is replaced by a clenching pain in your chest. Powerless to resist, you clench your fist, and slam it into your chest instinctively. There's a brief answering ripple as your tits shift in response to the blow. There's an equally pained look on Maria's face. Although, you see her gaze is fixed rather lower than your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a moment to work out Maria's expression. But... But... it's reluctance... She doesn't really want the spell to work, and if you're right. She's not envious of your body, she doesn't want to have... (you can't believe it), she doesn't want to have your incredible tits. Looking down, you try to appreciate them from a female perspective. But it's hard to dislike the girls. They are so full, so pert... so perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the incantation being repeated all around you. In various tones, and at various paces, while Professor McGonagall wander around the room. Whenever a girl glances in her direction, the look is brief, and discouraged with a silent scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Verto Permuto</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you feel the pull coming from elsewhere... Your face snaps around, and you take in Maria... She almost managed the spell. You can see the frustration on her face. The Ravenclaw desire... need to be first ... to be best. At their worst Ravenclaws could be just as selfish, as driven as Slytherins. Harry remembered that confession, that Cho had shared under the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were drawn to Maria. He looked her over as a guy... and as a girl.... she assessed her as a rival... as competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was about the same height as Roberta... With longer, silkier hair, and an enchanting innocent look to her face. Taking in her body, Harry saw that she wasn't as 'endowed' as Roberta... None of the girls were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, she had curves. Maria had a deliciously waspish waist, her bust swelling, and her hips wide and fertile. Roberta felt a degree of jealousy, as she looked a lot more ... more balanced.</span></div></div>",

With a grunt, she was wrenched from her body. Her gaze locked deep into Maria's eyes. As she soared towards her, she felt an odd feeling of dislocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a grunt again as she felt the familiar pain in her chest, it burst over her and she closed her eyes. But this time... this time it was different. It was more, more jagged... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened them she saw her opposite number... No... It was Busty Berta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry couldn't resist looking down. It was a more modest figure, but she couldn't resist cupping and cradling her soft bosom. Berta was doing the same too, so she knew Ginny couldn't complain. From the outside, it was odd to see the way her hands sank into that copious bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's fingers dug away at the pain she still felt. Despite the inherent Roberta-ish-ness of her face, the expression was triumphant, and held the smugness of Maria Glossop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mouthed two words to Harry, \"Underwire bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pain explained, Harry tried to take a mental check-list of difference. Clearly Maria was wearing a different bra. The material felt like satin, although she couldn't say she liked the fit. Wiggling her hips confirmed that her panties were equally made of satin. There was an odd feeling of compression on her legs, that she had to put down to wearing tights. Her hands itched to explore themselves, rather than just mentally. But she resisted, the smooth embrace of the material made her wish that boys underwear could be made of such fine items. Except the bra... The bra she just wanted to unclasp and throw it to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking her head to the side, Harry turned her attention to her former body, and gave her a respectful nod, with a humourous smile. In answer, Maria gave herself a playful squeeze, enjoying the extra heft of her girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty points to Ravenclaw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sour look from the Slytherins, as they weighed up complaining this was unfair, there were more Ravenclaws. The Hufflepuffs looked a little deflated, and as he took in Ginny she was switching between amused and disappointed. Professor McGonagall, clasped Roberta on each shoulder, \"Well done, girl...\" and with a glance that suggested after thought, \"and you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as a question forms on Roberta's face. It makes her look rather bimbonic. Or perhaps that's just your own prejudice, judging a girl from how busty she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers were reaching for her shoulders, and the straps that were cutting into her flesh. At least she wasn't making such a display of showing off Roberta's generous nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you reverse it?\" Minerva repeated the words before Maria could say them.</span></div></div>",

But he felt that discretion was the better part of valour, and this was definitely something he could bring up later... when he wanted to get his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last look at her scrumptious ass, he turned and stormed away down the passageway. If he was stuck as Roberta for another hour or so, then he didn't have to be around Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also rather dismayed to fail to pick up a new spell. He didn't have Hermione's studious streak, but he did seem to have a natural affinity to magic, and picked up spells easily enough. A skill that made Hermione grind her teeth, and inspired a degree of laziness in Ron, too. There was a niggling thought at the back of her mind, was Roberta a bimbo... was she a bimbo... relying on charm, and luck to get on in life. Her failure to learn the spell taunted her, but she felt no closer to mastering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her low heels, she click-clacked away.

She ran despite the rhythmic shimmy of her bust, only stopping when her bust leaped out of their cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking downwards, she was clearly much larger, already a DD-cup, and as her nipples pressed passionately against her satin blouse, she could see they were wider too.

But given the geography of the castle she found herself at time walking down corridors with more than a few students on them. Wherever she went, she felt the centre of attention, just as if she still had that damned scar on her forehead.... <b><i>Damn it!</i></b>.... his forehead. She focused on the way ahead, and ignoring the weight shifting on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta truly was a bimbo, unable to concentrate. Harry blamed it on the constant distraction coming from her bust and bra. Even with the spell, she felt it change and shift, a satin snake slithering over her sensitive flesh, as it struggled to contain her bosom. Finally she spotted an unfamiliar door, and went through. She closed the door behind her and rested her back against it. She took a moment to catch her breath, closing her eyes she concentrated on her breathing... and as she listened, it was the only sound she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could have punched the air, it seemed she'd found the Room of Requirement, when she needed peace and quiet. She slid the bolt across, ensuring that she would be left alone. It felt a little redundant, but good psych... psychologigo... it made her feel secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a mirror oppose she took the chance to appreciate her body with a degree of privacy. She sashayed forward, putting as girly a trawl and bounce into her strut. She had to tone it down, when she threatened to topple as her bust found it's natural rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with a shock, that she looked down, to properly appreciate her new figure. The enchanted bra had done a good job of keeping her jiggling to a minimum. But now she had to cradle the girls to fully appreciate their enormity. Each was bigger than her head, and had a real heft to it. She really didn't think they came naturally in this size... as if enchanted titties ever came ... naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad the boys had done nothing worse than look on in awe and appreciation, and the girls with contempt or pity, depending on their nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely Ginny hadn't intended her to reach this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching inside her jumper, she examined the bra. A small tag identified it as LL-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wanted Ginny to experience this body for herself, the attention it drew... the judgement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that damned spell seemed to be beyond her. Looking around Harry took in the other things the room had provided. The room was filled with lingerie... assortments of clothes... (underwear)... most she recognised: bras, panties, thongs (ouch), and teddies. All cut to accomodate her figure. But there were items she wasn't sure what they were called, or how they were meant to be worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost lost in her cavernous cleavage, she felt the chill of the potion bottle. Fishing it out, she spotted there was still one last dose left in it. She almost snatched it and smashed it to the ground. The idea of continuing this charade for longer was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it struck her. The version of Berta...<u><b>damn it.</b></u>.. or Roberta wasn't afflicted by Ginny's curse.... so if she drank it, then she'd become Roberta Ravenclaw, back to her usual self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at her cleverness.

Besides this was a Room of Requirement, so she went for a little wander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explored with her hands as she walked, allowing them to run over the silken delicacies as she passed them. She ran her thumb over the inside of the generous satin cups, appreciating the stitching, the cute details the little flowers, the cutesy hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant motion made her think... perhaps there was another style... another cut... another .... another <i>something </i>that would keep the girls more under control.

Her bust was magnificent and so nice to touch... She felt a little uneven...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wicked giggle, she realised what the problem was. She didn't want to undo Ginny's spell, the girls just felt so good, the caress of the air, and her thumbs brushing back and forth over her nipples already had her breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily, she glanced guiltily at the door.

But only a little, the girls were still rather cumbersome, for all their fun compensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the changes in the mirror, she saw her hips widen, and she felt the weight increase behind her. Running a hand over her rump, it already felt fuller, rounder, more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes progressed, Harry's figure approached more of an hourglass. Her waist supplying the flesh for her other expansions. Standing there in her panties, she got to see them shift and change too as her curves enhanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her the assorted clothing also writhed like snakes, fitting her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gasped, her eyes drawn back to the mirror. Her panties had shifted and become painfully tight. She worried about the spell going wrong, and turned to get a different angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave her a whole new appreciation of the question,<i> 'Does my bum look big in this?</i>'. She knew the answer,<i> 'Hell Yes!'</i>, her bum would look big in everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for the pain was now clear too. As the panties had transformed into a thong. It was barely a string at the back, a thong itself, disappearing between the generous hills of her ass. So full and complete, Harry smiled as she admired it's perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunching the air, she gave a little rabbit hop in her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rippled.... Dear God, It rippled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was delighted at the outcome, her generous ass, and her bounteous bust made her look like a Goddess. She posed and pouted, admiring her gorgeous body, and wishing to show it off to an appreciative audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only downside was her beautiful face, the elegant proportions were looking rather simple, lacking even the most basic of make-up. Harry remembered the one time in the library when Hermione had slammed a book closed on his arrival. Later on, when he'd returned and found it. He'd seen it was a book of beauty enhancements, and spells for make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry recalled idly flicking through it. As a guy, he'd not needed a spell to keep a gloss on lipstick... although now, if she could recall some of those spells, then she might perfect her Goddesshood.</span></div></div>",

She was now blessed with some glossy red lips. She pursed a couple of times, her mind already picturing those lips surrounding her old cock. She blushed, when the image of the cock being between <b>her </b>lips intruded. She shook her head, before she could picture an appropriate male to complete the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the beauty spells, frankly she wasn't sure what they did. Only finding them in the back of one of Hermione's notebooks, when he'd <i>borrowed </i>it. Most spells came only with a single sentence for explanation, while towards the bottom of the page, there were no explanations. It was an unusual omission for 'Mione, who was normally very thorough with all her endeavours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Occhi Azzurri</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blinked, as she cast this spell, uncertain what it did.

So she continued onto the less trepidation, she was also happy to confirm all those spells were for simple glamours. A wicked smile flashed on her face, as she tried to remember the next spell. It was one of those without even a single sentence for explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Capezzolo Allargare</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was soon panting, her breathing deep and sensual. As she fought to control her arousal, she found her nipples had jumped erect, and were now twice as wide. A shudder raced down her spine,... and at least twice as sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hands flapping, an inch away from her nips, as they screamed for attention. Her palm brushed against one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cried out, and came to a climax. Her cheeks flushed, and a look of embarrassed ecstasy on face she muttered the next spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Capezzolo Reductio</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith relief, and a degree of disappointment, she watched as they shrank back to their original size and sensitivity. Even now though, brushing her thumb over the still needy nipple, she felt glad that she wasn't back with her dull, insensible male nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo reduce the temptation, Harry looked around at the assorted underwear, and picked the set nearest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satin cups of the bra cradling and separating the girls, she slipped the panties on to complete the ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panties were a deep, daring red, and accented with a golden lace trim. She assumed to signify Gryffindor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood, her fingers brushed against the glass of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rippled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a little, but she tapped it again experimentally, sending ripples racing outward to the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Harry wondered if she should be suspicious of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if breaking a trance, she looked down to her side. There was a significant pile of underwear, that she didn't recall trying on. Out the window she spied how far the Sun had moved across the sky. A long time had passed, certainly more than an hour. She should have been restored to her Harry form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger shook, as she traced the words carved into the frame of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In Vitro Veritas</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran down her spine once more, this time it brought a cold chill to the pit of her stomach.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't great at translating those words... but she knew a girl who was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly the mirror was magical, she felt her heart in her throat, as she looked in horror at her bimbo reflection. Seeing it with a girls eyes, the huge tits the massive arse, .... her whole body ... a male fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what the mirror did, or even if it was down to the mirror. She wondered if it was Ginny's fault for gulping down that second polyjuice before the first had worn off.... or if it was down to the body swap magic, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she knew she needed help, and she knew who to go to for that help, and knew where she'd try to find that help (the library).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTugging her blouse and jumper back into place, she found it more of a fight, as a boy, it was a simple matter. Now, though it needed more patience and effort. Her bust shook and shifted as if it had a mind of it's own, fighting against further confinement. But eventually, she tugged the hem down the last few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her skirt, she saw the magic was still at work. It was tailored to fit her new rounded fundament. Stepping into it, she looked back over her shoulder. Bent at the waist, it looked like she was posing for a racy picture. A slightly worried look on her face, in the foreground, her huge ass cheeks, and the tiny thong disappearing between her cheeks like an invitation to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the tailoring, the skirt was tight, as it reached her thighs. Wiggling her hips from side to side, she dragged it the last few inches, to reach the base of her ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill raced up her spine, like the touch of an icy hand, and an involuntary 'Eeeek' burst from her lips, high, shrill and very girlish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head whipped around, and she saw the mirror tottering back and forth on it's frame, rocking from the impact with her arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she tried to turn and catch it. But with her thighs confined by the half-raised skirt, her fingers flailed futilely inches short. With a doomed slowness, the mirror fell backwards, to crash on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass shattered into tiny fragments. The fragments bounced free from the frame, and tinkled back downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Harry cursed softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the fragments, landed and shattered a second time, becoming dust... a low lying cloud, whirling like a slow vortex. Then shooting up from the centre, a funnel formed. It raced towards Harry's face, and as she shielded her face, the dust crashed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe braced for death, expecting the glass to tear her to shreds. But as she felt the impact, she also felt her body absorb the impact, and fill her with a eldritch warmth. As the assault tailed off and ended, she lowered her hands, and looked down at the empty frame of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked entirely mundane, a dark mahogany frame, but no trace of magic brightened its dark wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cursed again, but with a grunt, she pulled the skirt the rest of the way up. Her fingers and the longer fingernails meant it was a real effort to button it closed. Her ass was gorgeous in that tight skirt, and while Harry wasn't happy with how impressive it looked, but it was time to make the best of a bad lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused at the door, knowing the Room would vanish once she left. It felt like surrendering her protection, her privacy. She slid the bolt aside and swung the door open, ready to face the school, as she was....</span></div></div>",

There was also the disconcerting feeling of how much her arse was moving too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she descended it also became clear that she needed to glide down the numerous staircases of the castle. The jolting pace otherwise threatening to propel the girls free from their satin prison, and also the painful impact on her shoulders. It was as much for comfort and discretion that she slowed. The boys would always watch whenever a curvy girl passed, and Harry knew she was curvy, but she didn't need to attract any more attention with her eye-drawing shimmying and shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she reached the library, and a degree of sanctuary. Like all libraries, even muggle ones, there was repressed air to it. A higher chance of a teacher being present, and less chance of bullies, and such hanging around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school library was like the school in miniature, with bookcases shifting between visits, and whole sections vanishing seemingly at random. So Harry explored slowly and carefully. She headed towards the centre, where the study tables usually were located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had barely emerged from behind the books, when a friendly wave from Ginny drew her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beckoned Harry over, opposite Ginny was a scowling Hermione.

But, perhaps Ginny thought she might have been 'experimenting' and didn't probe too deeply about what could quickly become a very uncomfortable topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ginny told you what happened?\" she whispered urgently to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be over an hour, and I've not changed back...\" she asked in a more frantic hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned, \"Ginny?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore turning to face across the table, \"Harry, you said you'd swapped back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table, Ginny gave a shrug, \"It's my brothers that are the jokers.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harriet Jessica Potter, I do not find this funny.\" Hermione hissed rather stiffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was about to answer, and felt herself flooded with questions, each more urgent than the last. Her mouth flapped silently a couple of times, before she closed it with a click of her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, 'Mione.\" she finally answered. \"But what do you know about magic mirrors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione sighed a little sadly, before she answered, \"You're not looking for the mirror or Erised, again are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Harry choked on her answer, the memory of her parents just too painful. \"No.. I came across another in the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep telling you to read, 'A History of Hogwarts'.\" she grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's face must have shown her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's an appendix at the back, with the school's major enchanted objects, just look under mirrors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione gripped the edge of her parchment deliberately, signalling the end of the conversation. It wasn't the first time that a conversation with Hermione had left her more confused than enlightened. But she took the hint, and went to fetch Hermione's favourite book. On a whim, she also picked down the Hogwarts yearbook for the previous year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled down with her two books back at the table, Hermione spared her a smile as she settled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy your swap?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny instantly lifted her attention from her notes, \"Yes. It was very different.\" she answered enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.... it was interesting.\" she answered more cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione misunderstood her tone, \"Don't worry, I'm sure with practice, you'll be able to cast the spell yourself too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded her agreement and smiled before she opened the yearbook. She had a niggling suspicion that she wanted to dismiss. She flicked through the book until she found the Gryffindor student pictures. It took her breath away, smiling back up from the page was her face, her eyes fluttered enchantingly, and her lips were teasing without being overtly sexual. As the picture flicked her long mane of hair back over one shoulder, she read the name underneath <b><i>Harriet Jessica Potter 'Call me Harry'</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to swallow a couple of times, as she took it in. Looking to dismiss this, she flicked rapidly to the Ravenclaw pages. There she found the picture of Roberta Ravenclaw, Busty Berta, looked back up at her. There was a large degree of similarity there. Both were very attractive, but Harry felt a chill enter her heart, as it sank in that everyone at the table was a girl... and always had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dove into her memories, to find that she recalled sharing his dorm room with Ron and two other boys. Their names escaped her at the moment, but she also recalled sharing her room with Ginny and Hermione. Her head pounded as she tried to fit the two discordant memories together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like her heart was beating out of her chest, as she closed the yearbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was stuck in a rut, repeating the same words again and again....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh shit... Oh shit... Oh shit... </i></span></div></div>",

His hands on Harriet's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Harriet got her rhythm, her fingers worked it too, and Gerry's gasping mixed in some moans, each coming in time with Harriet's bobbing head, and gulping throat. It didn't take long for Gerry to cum. Hips thrusting in time, hands gripping tightly holding her head in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tight grip wasn't needed, as Harriet swallowed eagerly, excess spilling briefly from her lips, only for her tongue to chase it like the sweetest nectar.</span></div></div>",

Come here!\" The imperious voice of a teacher called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Pomona Sprout.

In a daze of confusion, she merely nodded to the people she knew as she passed. Although used to drawing stares of attention. This felt odder, this felt more predatory, more sexual. These weren't students noticing the 'Chosen One' as she walked, these were appreciative glances. Brushing her hand over her temple she checked that her scar was still there. It was certain none of the boys were noticing... or at least not looking as high as her scar. Ha! Not as high as her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept her waves polite and her own glances brief. Finally she managed to reach the library, without really bumping into anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione had a favourite desk, well-lit, and off the main corridor. Harriet headed straight there, rounding the last set of shelves, she skipped to a stop. Taken aback by the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Hermione sitting there, surrounded by mountains of scrolls, parchments and books. The odd dash of ink decorating her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather it would have been, apart from the squarer chin, the shorter hair, and the flatter chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite, was Ginny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought, until the girl turned to face Harriet. Just as clearly, this was Ron Weasley... or rather Ron as she would be as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood pounded in her head, as she tried to adjust... to accept this. Even thinking back on her brief walk, she realised with a suppressed gasp the oddities. When she'd passed Nigella Longbottom, and Lionel Lovegood, giving both the slightest of nodded heads, and cursory of smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world spun dizzily around Harriet's vision, darkening, sparkling and closing in. Somehow she'd crossed from one Hogwarts to another. One where all the students were the opposite sex.</span></div></div>",

She admired the full, lush curves, and the impossible firmness of her bust. Her appreciation of how voluptuous her body was, still being viewed through male eyes. It made her rather uncomfortable, as excitement, pride, and modesty battled across her face. The heat she felt in her belly, a warm needy sensation, an absence, that made her blush when she recognised it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room had furnished her with rack after rack of clothes. All tailored to fit her physique. Slipping on a loose-knit woolen top, and a pair of jeans, turned this way and that admiring her reflection. The silhouette, her body cast, and how her curves were displayed. Then the thoughts of Hermione and Ginny intruded.

But at other weaker, lower moments, she knew these were down to sheer dumb luck, or the help of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now she heard the words 'sheer dumb luck', in that thick Scottish brogue of Professor McGonagall. She owed both girls an apology, and she felt tears well up, and trickle down her cheeks, burning with hot shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all that would have to wait, she needed this curse... this spell of Ginny's to vanish.

Either as Busty Berta, to the max. Or swapped back but still stuck as a witch rather than a wizard. Her breaths came thin and fast, as she imagined first Ron knowing her fate, then Draco, and all those Slytherins, the death eaters.

I think you'd also appreciate this.\" her words weren't nasty, but tinged with a hint of playful smut. She was terrified that Ginny was about to return the spanking. She certainly appeared invigorated by the experience. Harry swallowed at the idea. A confusing deluge of emotions made her nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny's fingers trembled as she drew out her wand. But Harry was already suspicious, already so far beyond her comfort zone, that she grabbed for Ginny's darting wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fondo Engorgio.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe/She didn't need to know what Ginny was intending, and as the spell erupted, she'd managed to twist the wand enough, that it shot directly into Ginny's startled face.

The smile on Harry's face, on Berta's face widening as Ginny's hips gave two loud cracks, and her full rear, grew and grew. Apparently the spell had other side-effects, as she listened to Ginny's breathing, coming in heaving gasps, as her arousal spiked. She half expected a tail to sprout, as Ginny's arse reached equine proportions. \"Wow... just wow!\" she muttered in a low whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own hands running over her hips, assuring herself that she was unaffected by the spell, a shiver of sympathy, with a twist of envy.

As she went to snap at Ginny, she too recognised the voices. Specifically, the voice of Draco Malfoy and his thuggish friends: Crabbe and Goyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her ears still burning at being considered a bimbo. She wondered, how Draco would react to that. Snorting softly at Draco's arrogance, and superiority. Ginny tried to tug her along into hiding, but it just send a ripple racing across her bust. Though, it snapped her back to the moment. With a gesture, she directed Ginny into the shadows, and slipped the invisibility cloak around her. With a shimmer, the world danced and then took on the soft patterning of the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked backwards for Ginny, but she was already hidden. Just in time, as Draco appeared around the corner. Along with about the only two fellow students he could impress. Despite his family name, Draco lacked the strength and intelligence of his father cruising by, on the threat of his family name and reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Slytherins were laden down with food. Crabbe having a slice of cake in each hand, and a smear of rich, thick cream all around his lips. Goyle clutched two doughnuts in one hand, and the remains of a third in his other. A waterfall of sugar cascading from his chin to to decorate his jumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the goblet in Draco's hand that inspired Harry to act now. The temptation was just too near, especially, as Draco dismissed his 'friends'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Draconis Ascendant'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the heavy grinding of stones, Harry watched as the bricks twisted and turned, until an archway formed. She took an involuntary step backwards, unaware she was that close to the Slytherin common room. The scent of mixing potions spilling into the dark corridor, along with the low chatter of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet scraped over the uneven floor. Draco pulled his wand, 'Lumos', and the tip lit. He peered into the darkness looking for the source of the noise. Harry held her breath, and stood as still as she could. Either Crabbe or Goyle hadn't heard the noise, or were just uninterested, but they walked into the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Draco walked closer, his eyes alert darting for any signs of movement, they passed over Harry's position time and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was only a pace or two from Harry's position, Draco realised he was alone in the corridor, without either Crabbe or Goyle to back him up. Beneath the cloak, Harry worked silently to slip the vial of polyjuice into his free hand. So slowly, he slipped the cap off, alert to the least pop or squeak. A smile spreading across her face, as she managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's open goblet was just within reach, though she'd have to slip her hands out of the cloak to add the potion to the cup. Draco's attention was further away, looking right through Harry and not closer to hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick darting gesture, Harry's hand slipped out. With the quietest splash, she added the polyjuice to Draco's drink. Then retreated carefully away. Draco wasn't eager to stay there without either of his thugs.</span></div></div>",

At the last moment, resisting the idea of physically holding them in place. \"So would you prefer this?\" she posed with Berta's body, a silhouette in the flickering lamp light accentuating her curves. That too heavy bust, and those too full hips. Pouting, preening, and posing. She was distracting, blowing kisses to herself, Ginny was indulging some deep insecurities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiring of her joke, \"Okay, Harry... turn us back now.\" she asked. \"The girls are heavy, and awkward.\" her expression, telling of the annoyance of sore shoulders, and a sore back... or at least that budding twinge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerta's face took on a uncomfortable look. Uncertainty on her features, but it was the gurgle from her stomach that told Harry what was about to happen. Through Ginny's eyes, he watched as her bust deflated, shrinking back to flatness.

Inside the body, Ginny felt her clothes constrict, tailored for Roberta Ravenclaw, they just weren't going to fit the Harry Potter she was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeak of protest, bursting out as her blouse pulled free from the skirt.

Now, back to the same height the kiss came naturally, though their bodies responded as naturally, neither was comforted by the sensation. Ginny squirmed in Harry's embrace, an awkward stiffening that refused her mental commands, pressed insistently forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt a warmth, an itch, an aching need swelling within her. She broke free, as she felt his excitement with her supple flesh. Both took a step backward, keeping to the shadows, to hide their blushes, and their bodies reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Eeeh</i>.... Yes.\" Harry's voice sounded more insecure, and uncertain than every Ginny had. She made out the nodding agreement in the murk. It was odd seeing her old face looking back at her. Despite her best intentions, her eyes still hunted for it... <i>the scar</i>, was impossible to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes lowered in embarrassment, both knew what was needed. Harry felt more aware of her bust, now than when it was several cup sizes bigger, and heavier. The binding tightness of the straps around her chest too obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Verto Permuto.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wand gestures were a little stiff, and the spell sputtered and failed. Taking a deep breath, Harry blushed and tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Verto Permuto.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wand traced the same path through the air. But it wasn't the same brilliant glow as before. The light spat and flared as if resisting. With a snort, her eyes met. Agreement clear between them. The spell should've worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You try it.\" Harry suggested softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny nodded biting his lip in a way that absolutely didn't look like Harry Potter despite the face, the body... everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Verto Permuto.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wand traced the familiar path through the air, the pale white glow steady in their shrouded alcove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck....\" Harry swore under her breath. As Ginny wasn't the original spell caster, the reversal spell wasn't going to work. Across from her, the look was reflected in Ginny's expression. The frown making his scar look even more jagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, the realisation dawned. \"We can't swap Roberta Ravenclaw and Ginny Weasley back without a Busty Berta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do have more polyjuice, don't you?\" Harry asked, his Ginny Weasley voice quavering with fear.</span></div></div>",

Her thighs clamping tight together, she still felt Ginny's touch slide inwards tickling her inner thigh. His fingers brushing aside the hem of the skirt, lifting it, a mere inch, or two higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head tautly, silently begging Ginny to stop. Harry tried restraining his former hands. Their touch too familiar, the effect too strong. Obviously, Ginny knew exactly what turned her on.... turned on her body. Squirming in her seat, she shifted to avoid the caressing brushing of those teasing fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't Harry's defences that stopped her.

His hands retreating instantly from her lap to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the heat, and agitation easing from her body, Harry felt her arousal sink, a slow gasp of release slipping from her lips. Still excited, she guessed the reason. Ginny's crimson cheeks, stiff posture told her exactly what had happened. Ginny's enjoyment had backfired. She was trying to hide the erection stiffening in his trousers, the bulge obscene and unmistakable. Subconsciously, Harry licked her lips, and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione badgers Ron, until the pair leave blushing. Ron doesn't take much convincing either. Both friends exchange looks, Ron wanting to defend his sister's honour.

Her hated bra disappeared, pitching her forward a bit as her chest fell with a slapping bounce. Her legs pricked with goosebumps in the comparatively cold air that the disappearance of her skirt left her in. For a few seconds, all she was left in was her white cotton panties and slightly heeled shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second wave of changes was heralded by a lifting in her heels, a sensation that would've sent her falling flat on her face if she didn't have the steadying arms of Ginny behind her. A second layer of clothing stitched itself over her panties, hugging the curves of her rear  as if it was a second skin, finishing off as a pair of bright blue short-shorts, at a length of boxer briefs that Harry had worn before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sports bra conjured itself around Harry's cleavage, serving only to lift and accentuate her chest \u2014 something that it barely needed, given their firmness, Ginny thought wryly to herself. Harry watched her breasts almost spill out of it with a sense of resigned acceptance. Maybe the underwire bra was better after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second tap of the wand against her clothes, and a <b>Vestiti Affixio</b>, and Ginny was done, placing herself in front of Roberta again, her hands behind her back and a grin so wide it almost seemed innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stepped forward, an accusing point levied at Ginny, but before she could speak, her newly unsupported 'girls' shifted around so much that she clasped her arms against them to keep them from moving. All the while, Ginny was practically doubled over laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like the new outfit?

A faint blush tinged her cheeks as she thought of what the girls might get up to in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny snapped her fingers, jolting Harry to attention again, a slight ripple moving through his more motile parts. \u201cThose aren\u2019t going to change anytime soon with the Affixio charm on them, so you probably should probably find a way before you turn back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny lightly placed the vial of Polyjuice on the floor, presenting it as a second option \u2014 an idea that made Harry squirm with discomfort. She hadn\u2019t seen this version of Ginny before \u2014 maybe some time in a Slytherin form had rubbed off a little too much on her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a word in edgewise, Harry spoke: \u201cCan\u2019t we just sneak back to the Common room, Gin? Use the cloak?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny smirked again. \u201cSorry, Roberta, but Ravenclaw students can\u2019t go to Gryffindor. Anyways, if you see Harry, tell him I\u2019m waiting for him.\u201d She ran her hands up her body, sending a prickle of heat through Harry despite his frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick motion, Ginny whirled a familiar fabric around herself \u2014 Harry\u2019s Invisibility Cloak! She must have taken it from his bag earlier! Moving as quickly as she could, Harry reached out in panic - but it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny\u2019s laughs echoed through the hall as Harry looked at what was left: A vial of polyjuice and the cloakless school bag.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Revert back to Harry, and have students laughing behind his back for months to come, and have pictures handed around by Slytherin students in the Great Hall? Or have Roberta become a laughingstock for a week or two? It wasn't even the most offensive outfit she had worn \u2014 a smattering of pink coated Harry's cheeks as she remembered her Yule ball outfit from a few years back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer decision made, Harry set her face in a stern expression. Picking up the bottle \u2014 Harry learned that bending at the waist was something witches only did for show and certainly not comfort, especially one as... <i>blessed</i> as Roberta \u2014 Harry set her face in a stern expression and downed the remainder of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar sweet taste filled Harry's mouth \u2014 but there was no enjoying it this time. Harry could swear that her breasts and rear gave a sharp jolt on the ingestion of the potion, reasserting themselves, but she couldn't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she could be sure of was a small sense of static in her head. She had noticed it a bit while in class, but it was certainly more prominent now. Roberta didn't have her 'reputation' simply for being nice to look at. She was poor at general spellwork, an amateur at Potions, and Magical History was right out the window. She scratched by on general Poors and the occasional Acceptable on her O.W.L.s, but her baseline laid more around Dreadfuls, if you asked her fellow Ravenclaws. Harry exercised a bit of her Legilimens skill internally, probing the recesses of her mind. To her relief, there were no memories of Roberta's escapades, except for the accounts heard secondhand, and some (luckily, some whispered) seen firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the uncomfortable fuzz still remained. Harry tried a few charms, but the results were worrying. <b>Lumos</b> only sputtered at the end of her wand, only managing a full light when remembering to <i>flick</i> the wand instead of merely jabbing. <b>Accio</b> worked as well as it did before \u2014 but focusing on the school bag required a mite more brainpower than she was used to. Things just came a little slower, but the fact that Harry  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry chalked it mostly up to stress, and walked on to her next destination, more than a flicker of doubt plaguing her.</span></div></div>",

The light shooting from the wand tips, instead of crashing together. They danced in a tight sphere of magic between the pair, before continuing on to land on the opposite wand.

Raising a hand to their heads, the wide eyed look on both their faces telling everyone present the spell had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked... It worked, Harry.\" Zacharias' tone was pure Neville Longbottom, sounding surprised at his own success. While opposite, Neville's body looked concerned, and glanced towards some fellow Ravenclaw students for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done! Well Done!\" Professor Binns looked the most animated he'd ever been seen. \"Twenty points to Ravenclaw and Gryffindor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled back at Neville, and Ron added a weak smile in support too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZacharias already had his wand drawn and was ready to repeat the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reversal is the exact same spell as for the initial swap...\" the professor said, \"and can only be used to restore the parties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville was immediately nervous about repeating the spell, and the possibility of getting it wrong, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Verto Permuto.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell restored them to their original bodies, as professor Binns invited the club members to experiment in pairs.</span></div></div>",

Slytherin and Hufflepuff were already breaking into pairs, and Ron gestured for Harry to follow him to an empty space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Harry didn't respond.

Inside, he was a little upset, assuming Harry was being kind to Neville. But he needed to concentrate on his end of the spell. Facing off against Lee, they both silently practised the incantation, and the wand moves until they felt they were synchronised.

He saw Neville/Ginny's lips move as she silently mouthed the spell. Meeting her eyes, he saw a twinkle of mischief that was pure Weasley, as she was ready to attempt the swap for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry saw the hesitation, as Ginny dismissed giving Harry a kiss. The excitement making her want to embrace the situation, but it'd be hard to explain as Neville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharing a nod of the head, The pair cast the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Verto Permuto</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was startled as it worked the first time.

Harry was looking at himself, a startled Ginny smirking with his face, his hands exploring the body. Oddly, Ginny checked for the lack of bust, and the reduced male rump, before recalling she was meant to be Neville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutomatically, Harry was copying those same gestures. As he checked for a bust before stopping himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked...\" Harry exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again...\" Neville agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe urge to hug was hard to resist, as their eyes met. But taking in both their bodies, quickly passed. Behind them a flash announced, the successful swap of Lee and Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few scattered chants around the room were mostly met with groans of frustration.

Turning back to the smirking Ron. \"How did you know that?\" he spat the words angrily in Ron's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear to all three, that Ron was more casual about this attack than normal. Neville wasn't the scariest of students at the best of time, but rage contorted his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville's level of intimidation dropped radically, as a look of queasiness crossed his face. Fighting the urge to throw up, his skin started to ripple. His face rolling like boiling water, even his grip bubbled as it was knotted at Ron's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the polyjuice wore off, Neville's eyeline dropped, and he felt the strength wane from his body. Too soon, Ginny stood in the oversized clothes of Neville Longbottom, with her tiny fist knotted in her brother's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shimmering half-reflection in the window's glass revealed her new body to Ron.

Gaining pleats, and losing the legs it was a knee length skirt, as Ron tried to tug it lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp burst from her lips, and she straightened up with a horrified look on her face. Hands going to her chest, she was mortified as she felt a bra from. The too tight item made her new gender more obvious to herself, and impossible for Harry to ignore.

Harry stepped back, to avoid any accidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Verto Permuto.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth wands lit with a brilliant glow, shooting forward. Instead of forming a boiling knot of magic, they simply ricocheted off each other, and shot back to their caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again.\" Ron squeaked from Ginny's body. The fear in her voice was clear, the spell hadn't failed...

Hermione insisted in helping him clean up a bit as a girl, and gave him laundry on a regular basis. He had started to wonder if this was out of kindness, or something else. After all, the clothes he received were often more than a little tight. He had also noticed an uptick in the amount of gas he expelled on a daily basis. Maybe it had something to do with his slug like habits as of late, but he really did not want to think about that as he slowly drifted off to sleep, gently touching his belly and breasts as he did so.</span></div></div>",

The wizarding world coming together to rebuilt it after the destruction of the battle of Hogwarts. Now in his early twenties Harry was ready to see the old place again. The painful memories now somewhat softened, and the happy ones renewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle threw open it's doors for everyone. A celebration, a week long extravaganza to bring people together heel old wounds and tell old stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn hearing that Luna wasn't coming, he'd decided to visit the castle in disguise. They'd exchanged owls, as he'd tried to convince her to come. Another friendly face would always be welcome, and he wanted her there for himself and for her too. But her answer was resolute, she wasn't coming. She just didn't feel up to the attention, the memories for her weren't entirely pleasant and she wanted to move on. Harry understood, and sadly accepted. He certainly knew what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe public attention after his <i>first </i>vanquishing of Lord Voldemort was still to annoying to bear all day. He knew that his attendance was necessary, and he'd have to attend the Grand Hall, and the feast as himself. But Harry wanted to enjoy himself, to have some peace for quiet exploration. To visit the kitchens, to talk to the ghosts, to the portraits, offer them his thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna had felt like the perfect choice for a disguise, the airy blonde was known for being other worldly and any missteps could just be ignored as Luna being Luna. Her replies clearly joyous, as Harry suggested his plan. Confiding in her, his desire for a disguise, and her as the person to provide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the very next owl that Harry received, that came with a curl of blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning his gaze from the window to his room in Hogsmeade, Harry double-checked his supply of polyjuice. Enough vials for him to maintain the disguise for almost the entire week. His pocket enchanted to be as big inside as the Weasley tent, or Hermione's handbag.<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, he steadied his nerves. His attendance would be necessary, his arrival an event. The stairs creaked as Harry descended. The idea once inside, he could swallow the polyjuice and have the freedom of anonymity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bag hanging from his shoulder slapped against his thigh as he walked. The invisibility cloak, and Marauder's Map inside it.</span></div></div>",

In short, Harry felt incredibly on display, as she emerged from the shadows of the alcove. Her new centre of balance, took her a little time to adjust, as she walked out into the surrounding fields.

The whole carefree attitude was beyond him, with every step, every jiggle reminding him of his new gender. Hell, even those wider hips seemed to sway on their own. His rump feeling as if it had a life of it's own... it's own inertia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow understanding soul-deep, how women worried about having a big ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, she tried to calm herself and turned back to the door to the castle.

It had been too painful a memory for a long time, that he'd put it at the bottom of his trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven finding it now, brought back the loss of Cedric, and the end of his friendship with Cho. Opening the locket, he saw her smiling face, and on the opposite side a cutting of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was serendipity, he was preparing to experiment with a new version of polyjuice potion. It had fewer exotic ingredients, and didn't need to brew for as long. He'd even been allowed to leave it to stew overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust one night, he was going to be so happy to show it to Hermione. She thought that it would still take over a week to make polyjuice potion. Harry did respect her skills as a witch. But... he did think she was overly fond of the text books, and lacked the insight... or intuition to mix the things that just ...well... just felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry fished the key from the bottom of his trunk. That's what he'd been searching for when the locket was discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would allow him a little anonymity, besides there might be side effects that he didn't want to risk embarrassing himself with a failed potion. There was a very real possibility that the potion would do nothing... or make him throw up... or not work quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it ... it felt right. Harry was sure that this blend would be more powerful, faster, stronger... better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clenched his fist around the key and locket with determination, sweeping his bag up as he left the dormitory. There were several students that greeted him as he made his way through the school. He didn't notice all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag contained clothes. Women's clothing, the thought that soon he'd be wearing it... and filling it out rather well made Harry feel a range of conflicting emotions. He wasn't sure of the size he'd be afterwards, so had made the uniform self-adjusting. That was one thing that he was particularly happy about. Cho wasn't overly endowed with curves, either busty or bootylicious. She had incredible legs, and loved to show them off in the shortest of skirts when relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to distract himself, by thinking of all the times he'd been forced to accept Dudley's ill-fitting hand-me-downs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry reached the class sooner than he planned, one of the advantages of not paying attention to your surroundings. He slipped inside the class and opened up the locked cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small cauldron was bubbling away quite happily, and as Harry sniffed the rising fumes. It smelt ... promising. He gave it a stir, and the contents sloshed slowly around, almost like gel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry took the hair from the locket and thought back over his preparatory work. He'd left a note on Ron's bed, for him to come and check up on Harry. That was his safety net. Ron and Hermione were at Hogsmeade just now, and would be back in a few hours towards the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf everything went well, he could return to the common room and destroy the note as unneeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf something humiliating happened, there should hopefully be time for the effects to vanish, allowing him to keep a modicum of dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as this was entirely untested....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note was just a precaution he told himself....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped the hairs into the cauldron. The mix changed from emerald green, taking on an azure blue colour. As it did, it let off a slowly pulsing light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the potion was changing colour, Harry stripped off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp he realised the classroom door was unlocked. He darted over, and slid the bolt into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, he walked back to the pile of clothes and his bag of women's clothing. They looked a lot more feminine as he held them up, the magic allowed them to fit his scrawny male body. They were almost luminous pink, in the light of the class, and he felt the need to hurry the experiment along to it's natural conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in, he was happy to see the potion was not shimmering or pulsing any longer. It was a deep azure, with only the merest of sparkles to indicate it's magical power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipping a glass phial into the mix, the liquid flowed into the container. It was slow and deliberate as it entered the tiny bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Harry was satisfied he had enough to work with, he raised it in silent salute and swallowed it before he could lose his nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly his fingers spasmed. He nearly crushed the tiny phial, instead it fell to the floor and shattered. Seconds later, Harry's shoulders pulled in closer, losing their masculine width. As he watched, his arms lost what little muscle he had built up, becoming slender... then positively skinny and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran his hands down the arms and over his exposed tummy. The simple brushing of his fingers dislodged what hair there was. Running his hands wider, he didn't want to think of -that-, he felt a widening of his hips. That was new. He bent to allow himself to run his hands over his legs.... HER legs... again the simple caress of his fingers was enough for all the hairs to fall out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scissored her legs back and forth enjoying the smooth thighs brushing against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry turned his attention to his face. It didn't help... he wasn't sure how his face felt or... if it was different... If he now looked like Cho Chang... He wasn't sure, but her nose might be smaller ... and her lips might be fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have punched the air. The change was rapid and painfree, and as best he could tell successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen things started to go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt a heat build up beneath his nipples. Already the were wider and more sensitive... But now they were almost impossibly responsive. The air was chilly in a way that made 'The Boy who survived' very aware of her new sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a burst of pain, and a girlish grunt escaped her lips. The pain increased, growing and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to massage the pain away. The touch of her fingers was interesting... very interesting, and did distract her from the pain. However, there was something else that was becoming more of a concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potion had a side-effect. A very obvious side-effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's bust was swelling well beyond that of Cho's modest dimensions. They rose passed Pansy Parkinson's more generous bust... and soon eclipsed even Betsy Jones, the blushing Hufflepuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry really, really hoped that Cho never found out about this porn star version of her body. Even now the girls weren't slowing their growth. They were not to be outdone by the swelling of her nipples either. Their shape was clearly outlined by the straining fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whimper escaped Harry's lips, either of fear or need. It was hard to say. The hormones racing through her body was making it hard for her to keep calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped. Finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry took in the full damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fap.to/images/full/46/156/1566460615.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fap.to/images/full/46/156/1566460...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was certainly leggy, but she doubted any boy... anyone would notice her legs.</span></div></div>",

That's our friend. Now STOP ogling her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was still transfixed, his eyes kept shifting back to the jiggling, rolling flesh, it just drew his eyes. Besides he wasn't sure that Harry would appreciate a hug... or a kiss... Ron's body was already reacting as it should in the presence of an attractive female, and he certainly didn't want Harry to discover that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to have gone beyond saying 'There, there' and giving her a reassuring handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you aren't being sympathetic enough, I'm sure there more than enough here, to allow you to follow Harry's example. I'm sure Ginny would like to have a BIG sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to get through Ron's distracted haze.

He felt himself stiffen, at the idea of Hermione in such a sexual body. She was such a book-worm, that it was hard to imagine her cutting loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione growled at him, low, deep and very disappointed. Then she turned her attention back to the cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, he sat down at Harry's side, and gave her a tentative hug.

When she picked up Harry's notes, it flew from her fingernail, and landed on Ron's upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three Gryffindors were unaware of the tiny ball of potion. Ron's tongue darted out and removed it. His throat was soon rasping and dry, and a few seconds later there was a grumble from his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, are you ever not hungry?\" Hermione asked, half joking, but still half-serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further warning, the potion went to work. Ron clutched his stomach as it quavered. The pain was sharp and sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just a grunt, he collapsed forward, his forehead hitting the stone floor with a sickening thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione watched, as some giant breasts, first strained Ron's shirt, and then burst all the stitching as they broke free. His shoes retreated towards the bottom of his trousers, and she watched, they fell off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the transformation didn't involve a generous ass. So while there was a little straining, Ron's new sex remained hidden. Hermione didn't want to think of Ron ... not that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cradled her bosom, as if trying to press back on them.

That was unwise for two reasons, Hermione was already annoyed, and as she pointed, her bust broke free, and shifted. Ron felt the weight almost pull her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's normal behaviour took over, she looked sheepish as she thought about what she'd said. But was still too embarrassed to apologise, a loud and deep burp broke free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'd do ... do that, deliberately.\" she shot back. Waving in Ron's general direction, her arm moving up and down to indicate her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, as Ron rifted, she felt the pressure ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on her face was wide and sincere, as she watched her bust retreated. She felt her nipples draw in, reducing to their normal masculine dimensions and sensitivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gave a cough, \"Well if we wait long enough, then it looks like this will go away on it's own.\" he said trying to sound optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon and Hermione weren't quite so optimistic.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully he too wasn't reduced to mugglehood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as Ron's shirt pulled itself back together, the buttons flying up to re-attach themselves, and the rips invisibly mending. As the magic progressed, his jumper started to weave itself back together. The wool knitting itself back into the familiar food-stained jumper that marked him as Ron Weasley. She loved his scruffy nature, it was something she just wasn't capable of. She was diligent and hyper-organised. She sometimes envied his more laid-back approach to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that Ron was okay, she turned back towards Harry. She was as over-endowed as ever, and 'Mione just shook her head slowly in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are other dangers too.\" she told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you even see Ron drink any potion... It might have been the tiniest droplet, or she ... sorry ... he inhaled too strong a wisp of vapour. Heck, even now you might be extending the potion's effect just breathing in the air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a breath herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys, well, Ron and Harry looked at the little cauldron. It's contents -glooping- and -burbling- away like a colourful pool of heated mud. They looked a little worried as the mix gave a sound like a fart, and released a small pink cloud. The cloud rose a couple of feet and dissipated into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon edged back, just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the dangers to yourself. Imagine if you'd spilled some into the water supply. We'd have a school full of Cho Changs, or ... or worse....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMutely she gestured to Harry's hyper inflated chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that Beauxbatons wasn't always a female-only school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ron exchanged blank looks, before their minds drifted off towards their memories of the students and the Tri-wizard tournament, and those lovely girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-hem.\" she coughed, \"You do know that was where Dumbledore met Nicholas Flamel.\"</span></div></div>",

Hermione had reworked the ingredients, based upon a break-through that came to Harry in a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall had finally granted them approval to proceed, having satisfied herself that whether or not it worked, it was at least safe. The whole idea was so revolutionary that she'd allowed them to work together on what was usually an individual project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA skinsuit had been investigated by many great minds down the centuries, so the Professor wasn't holding up too much hope. It was all meant to be a learning process, and she felt certain that Harry would be diligent and precise. She never liked to dismiss any pupil, but when she looked at Ron, and his brothers, she always had to restrain a muttered groan of despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys had still tried to inject a little fun into their work, and decided to become the Patil sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva had ensured that the girls gave their consent, and to ensure the boys were entirely honest and transparent she stood in for the entire conversation. Harry blushing and looking at the floor, while Ron stuttered and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters made them repeat exactly what they were trying to achieve, and probed them about their motives. Until the boys were ready to run away from embarrassment, then, then the girls gave their consent with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach sister handed over a few strands of hair, and before they could snatch it and flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadma told Harry that long hair needed a lot of care and brushing, and how long it took to wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did manage to get out a 'Thank you.', which prompted Ron to give Parvati his thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a long time ago, although it was only a week. Professor McGonagall had them in the infirmary. She'd even ejected Madame Pomfrey from the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione had invited herself, and given that she was their friend, the teacher allowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two students added the final ingredients into the cauldrons, and with a -huff- a cloud of white smoke rose from each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon and Harry exchanged worried, hopeful glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva and Hermione exchanged worried, amused looks.</span></div></div>",

Soon his hand was coated. The mix continued up his arm, Ron's uniform shifting and rippling as the goo worked towards his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his hand up, it was clearly working. Ron's hand was clearly more slender and feminine. He turned it back and forth in the light admiring it from different angles. He gave a little gasp when he noticed the clear sheen covering his... her nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile was wide, and joyous as he turned and showed Hermione. He jabbed his arm in front of the professor, and as he did, the sleeve slid lower, revealing an elegant wrist and slim forearm. Alas, when Prof. McGonagall, reached out and touched the hand, the spell shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a liquid noise, like a marshy bubble bursting, and Ron's pale freckled hand and arm appeared through the dripping mess that was all that remained of his cauldron's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <b>was </b>a great success.\" She assured him. But the disappointment was just as clear on his face as ever. It was chased away, as Ron pulled at his uniform, the gooey mess sticking to his skin and his uniform in patches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gave a sigh, not expecting any more success than his friend. At a nod from the teacher, his right hand touched the surface. Harry now knew what to expect. But it was still unsettling to watch. His fingers became slender, and he found his nails were painted with a soft red colour. He was sure it would have some name, Crimson, Apple Red, Cherry Blossom... or something of that ilk. But for him, it was red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mix reached his shoulder, and he felt a chill race over his skin as it continued onwards. Spreading across his back and chest, and slowly climbing his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was further than Ron's had gone... He was sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell quite sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his left hand he felt up his right arm. It was positively weak and skinny. He encircled it with his thumb and first finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione gave Ron a conciliatory hug, but her eyes were fixed on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a warbling yelp, that shifted in pitch, rising and becoming feminine. There was the undeniable swell of a young bosom. Harry wanted to squeeze it, just to confirm it wasn't an illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the idea of that being his first female action, and of doing <b>that </b>in front of Hermione and the Professor were enough to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wobbled on his feet, and gave a brief shriek, yelp as the magic reached her toes and took six inches from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was fully feminine now, and she certainly wasn't going to confirm that by blindly groping around. Not in front of Ron, ... or 'Mione..... or <b><i>anyone</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goo climbed her neck, and as it passed over her face Harry had to force herself to keep on breathing. It felt like she was underwater, the liquid rippling over her skin. But once it passed, she let out a sigh or relief. The last change was as it raced over her scalp. Her boyish rough cut hair, stretched into a long smooth wave that fell to halfway down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProf. McGonagall gave a single clap of joy, and nodded happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry snatched up a mirror, desperate to see her new features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110801072045/harrypotter/images/5/5c/Padma_Patil_profile.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a huge success.

A rare smile, on her face, leaving the students a little surprised, and concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face took on a more distant expression, looking beyond the students, unbound even by the walls of the room, \"Oh... it's well over an hour.\" she said in a pleasantly surprised tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What two hours?\" Hermione blurted out, a rare rudeness as her enthusiasm defeated her manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's eyebrow rose, noting the quickness of Hermione's answer, but she turned instead to address Harry/Padma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations are in order, this is certainly better than poly-juice, a genuine break-through, oh... and a pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalm returned to Hermione's expression, as the word 'pass' reached her ears. She turned to Padma eager to share her joy. Instinctively, she then turned to Harry, and the pair were now triplets, each as identical as the other two. Though, one of the girls seemed a little less at home in her skin. A little upset by the length of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione hugged Harry, whispering her congratulations. With her free arm, she reached out, and pulled Ron into the embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a difficult spell, and I'll help next time.\" she assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind being Padma for the rest of the day?\" she asked Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn apologetic look towards the Patil sisters, in case she was offended by her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting his ... her friends on the back, Harry/Padma broke them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if it's safe for the rest of the day, can I explore the castle?\" Harry asked excitedly. The thought of seeing how convincing he could be amongst those who didn't know the truth almost too exciting to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that this would probably happen in any case, Professor McGonagall nodded her assent. Adding only a couple of conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want the three of you together... obviously.\" the sternest look on her face, as she looked at each of the girls steadily until they nodded their agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And no trips to Hogsmeade. I want you in the castle grounds just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Padma was bristling with questions, her Ravenclaw mind eager to experiment on her mirror sister. A muscle twitching on her cheek, as she made mental notes for her own future trials and experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought momentarily derailed by the reference to Hogsmeade, there wouldn't be any time for that anyway.

A safe experiment within the walls of Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, he'd not merely succeeded. He done so, so well, that he'd ... -damn it- that she'd have to live as one of the Patel sisters.

It just didn't suit Padma Patil's demeanour, and looked.. odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe convulsed in laughter again, this time, it quickly took on a filthy tone. She had to cover her mouth, as she looked at Harry. After a few moments she managed to get her humour under control. There was a disapproving scowl on Hermione's face, or at least the hint of one. Hermione wasn't one to challenge a teacher too openly.

She hadn't been expelled from Gryffindor... Now she felt like a member of two houses. She had an uneasy feeling that meeting Luna, that she would see who Harry really was. She just hoped that Luna was an ally and not in one of her ... -dizzy- ... moods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor ruffled Ron's red hair as she walked away, a twinkle in her eye, and quietly humming a Scottish tune to herself.

However, that would mean having to pretend to be a Ravenclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking between Hermione and Ron, she saw Ron blushing, and put it down to Ron's imagination, and her own new sex. Hermione was happy but with a vaguely disappointed hint to her bearing. Harry wrote it off, as being envy, after all the Ravenclaw students were generally the bookworms, and their common room was rumoured to have some unique books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry already knew where the common room was (because of the Marauder's Map), but without the password entry was forbidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Harry, who do you want to see.... who do you want to be?\" Hermione interrupted Harry's wandering mind.</span></div></div>",

The Ravenclaw common room was as you'd expect a house that favoured knowledge to be. Bookcases on every wall, and on one, a large statue of Rowena Ravenclaw. <br>\r\n\"So nice to see you, Sis,\" said Padma, walking over and giving you a hug, your identical breasts smooshing against each other. Padma led you over to a quieter corner of the room, where the only person close enough to hear was Luna Lovegood.<br>\r\n\"Hello Harry,\" said Luna, as Harry was getting settled in the common room, causing him to jump \"What are you doing in our common room?\" <br>\r\n\"It's complicated,\" said Harry \"How did you know it was me?\" <br>\r\n\"Don't bother trying to understand,\" said Padma \"I've known her since she got here, and I still don't understand how she makes these shockingly accurate leaps in logic.\"<br>\r\n\"Call it a gift,\" Luna said \"Or don't, it's your choice. Did something bad happen? Are you hiding from something here?\" <br>\r\nHarry felt his Gryffindor pride stung by that remark, but he remembered where he was, and that Luna's intentions were purely inquisitive. <br>\r\n\"Far from it, Luna,\" said Harry \"Something went very right.

Prickling, as if she were being run through a car wash, her skin felt scrubbed and cleaned. A level of cleanliness he'd never experienced before. Her hair already feeling awkwardly long... too long, was tidying itself. As invisible brushes ran through it, again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their unreality, they still tugged, drawing girlish hisses and mumbled objections from Harry. Though in Padma's voice they didn't seem to carry quite the same weight. A cocoon of light span around Harry's head hiding the rest of the room from her. She was unaware of it descending to hide her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, once encased, Harry felt her clothes vanish in an instant. A squeak of surprise and outrage spilled out. Hands pinned to her side she couldn't even cover her nudity. Moments later, she didn't need to, as she felt new clothes appear over her body. They felt smoother, softer and more expensive against her skin. She could tell they were cut to fit her new body, and already wanted to tug at the unfamiliar items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panties felt just too snug, and the bra was surely too tight and confining. Feeling the cocoon thin and fade Harry regained control of her body. Her hands exploring the unfamiliar clothes. Before the light faded away entirely, two stings drew squealing protests, as her ears were pierced and the weight of earrings appearing was impossible to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dusty cloud of colour, Harry shut her eyes as it whirled around her, at times brushing over her features as if sand-blasting them. Feeling them fade, a smile returned to Harry's face. It was different, her tongue darting out finding lipstick coating her lips, leaving a faint waxy after-taste. Blinking in the light she could feel the make-up the completed the transformation. Her magic may have given him the perfect copy of Padma's body, but it was the professor's that completed the disguise with it's knowledge of beautification spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ilarge.lisimg.com/image/1071137/1118full-harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire-photo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://ilarge.lisimg.com/image/1071137/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry beamed at his reflection in the mirror, she was dressed in her ballgown.

He was trying to feint a casualness he didn't feel. His own experiment less successful, and the professor's praise feeling more like mockery as he looked Harry over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rested one hand on the cauldron brim, as he stepped back. Hermione was more familiar with Ron's moods, and read his expression more clearly. She offered a sympathetic smile, that drew a half scowl from Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pout.\" Hermione hissed, softly chiding him, \"Boys shouldn't pout.\" She underlined her words with an elbow to his ribs. Alas, it struck just a little too well, as Ron stumbled, barely keeping his footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Shit.... Bloody Heck...\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharp disapproval was clear on the Professor's face. She had no love of harsh language. Her expression softened, as Ron held up her hand in explanation. It was coated in the contents from Harry's cauldron, the remains clearly already working. Beneath the goo, Ron's finger were slimming, and the potion oozed up his arm, leaving behind a more willowy slender limb as it passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten more points for Gryffindor.\" Minerva announced, impressed at the potency of Harry's brew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose twins should hang out together.\" she added, as the magic completed the changes.

The view from the outside was more profound than from the inside. The effect was incredible, if anything Ron was more beautiful than Harry. Her make-up more finely applied, and the startled look on Ron's face adding to the wide-eyed beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon too, was trying not to explore her new body, and the uncommon clothes she was wearing.

They were holding hands, under the table, and seemed to be the only two who thought their friendship was secret. The smile on Ron's face telegraphed his happiness, while Hermione had a smug grin, that suggested she was beating the odds herself. Dismissed as the geeky loner, she held his hand tightly in her own, their fingers woven together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had tried to engage them both in conversation, but they were rather too distracted for general conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver their shoulders, Harry spotted Draco Malfoy, and at his side were Vince Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. Harry hadn't expected them to reach the final year. But both relished the chance to wield power as prefects. They were whispering secrets to one another, almost giggling like school girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to picture them as female, but stopped when a shudder ran down his spine. They made eye contact, and Draco gave Harry a curt nod. Crabbe leaned in and whispered hurriedly in Draco's ear. This earned his a push. As he thumped back into his seat, Draco wiped the saliva from his cheek and hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing the Slytherin, Harry turned his attention to the soup, that apparated into place in front of him. The previous plates and cutlery whisked away by the same method moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends hadn't even noticed the arrival of the next course. Hardly surprising as they had barely noticed or touched the previous serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug Harry left them to their locked gaze. It was mushroom, and leak soup, ladling up a spoonful, he took a deep breath and savoured the aroma as he did. But the taste was too good to resist for long, and soon he was half-way through his bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a tickle at the back of his throat, and took a swallow of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water didn't help, as he felt a fever, he raised a hand to his head he dislodged a whisp of hair. It feel across Harry's eyes and he flicked it away. It was notoriously messy, but after a second he clicked that it wasn't normally blonde. As he flicked it behind his ear, a silence was working it's way along the table. Harry tried to find the source, but looking around it was clear he was the centre of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a sudden rush of trapped wind, and gave his chest a hearty thump. He let loose a belch that had to be magically enhanced, and a thankfully silent fart at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear these were mere side-effects to what was going on. Even Ron had fallen silent, and Hermione looked at him with a rather hard to read expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr... Harry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slide the condiments off one of the platters and raised it, allowing Harry to see his reflection. This must be one of Malfoy's jokes, as he pulled at his uniform. It just wasn't fitting as well as it should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason why was undeniable, as Harry gawped at his reflection. Raising a hand, he hoped the image wouldn't copy him... But it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at him from the underside of the silver plate was Lavender Brown.

But before they could figure out what had happened; another scream came from the Ravenclaw table. Then a scream at the Huffelpuff table, then the Gryffindor table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hall descended into chaos, Harry began to feel a pressure in his chest. A scream of pain from Ron was ignored as Harry was dealing with pain in his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPounds of flesh that could only be called boobs burst from his chest. He felt his raven colored hair lengthen and saw it brighten and turn an interesting shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin rippled, reformed, and his body mass shifted. He felt two distinct pops in his male member and his shaft began to retreat into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could guess what was happening. People were being changed into someone else. His someone else must be Susan Bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts escaped him as his shaft was fully sucked into him turning him into a her. The formation of Susan's womb, vaginal canal, and vaginal lips were so intense it created an orgasm for the newly minted girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes subsided he looked around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his right where Ron had sat stood a baffled looking Daphne Greengrass.

He was aware of the distracting appeal of female bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf-snatched glances, as Angelina Johnson's perfect thighs wrapped around her broomstick. The flashes of her gorgeous rump, as she flew past him on the Quidditch pitch. As Harry felt himself stiffening, he tried to dismiss the distracting thoughts. But his hormones were rampaging away. Instead filling his memory with images of Cho Chang swooping towards him on her broom. The wind catching in her uniform, the top billowing, framing a sumptuous view of her cleavage. A cleavage buffeted by the wind, mobile and hypnotic. He felt sure it was deliberate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting his own Quidditch strip out, he spotted an abandoned wand. It was Ron's broken wand, it sparked across the break as Harry picked it up. He wasn't entirely sure how it had ended up amongst his things. But he tossed it onto Ron's empty bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt landed with a crack, and a crackle, firing off one last bolt of magical energy. Harry ducked as it flew overhead. Glad to avoid it, however, it ricocheted off the mirror and struck Harry from behind. Flecks of pink magic flickered and flashed across his face, around his head and body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the raw magic invading his thoughts. A spike of pain ripped through Harry as he clenched his eyes shut against the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt vanished in a moment, and Harry reopened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/e8d503843b8538a2ca7b71cb0644a33e/tumblr_oi13grCWWJ1rr7ye7o1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://68.media.tumblr.com/e8d503843b853...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now a she. Abundantly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest heaved with every slight movement, unrestrained and very mobile. Harry was shocked by her reflection.

Wondering if it was detecting her nervousness, Harry was glad her hair wasn't so eye-catching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as she squirmed deeper into her seat, that her clothes felt different.... very different. She saw that she was dressed to reflect her new gender. The silky tights oddly unsettling, every twitch of her legs, every brushing glance of her thighs a reminder of the thin nylons. Despite not being one of the taller students, she felt even shorter now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angle of her heels screaming that she was wearing sky-scraper heels.... and they were comfortable. Around her waist, she felt a skirt. It felt like it was riding high on her hips, and absently she tried to roll it lower. Eager for more modesty, but it was clearly a mini-skirt. To her unfamiliar touch, it felt terrifyingly short, barely more than a belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire in the corner of the dorm, flared wildly into life. Emerald green flames battling shocking pink, before turning to a pale blue. Out of the fireplace stepped Nymphadora Tonks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry barely knew where to look, as she strode purposely towards him. She was stark naked, head to toe.

It's unwise to mock an auror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonks seemed unaware that she'd apparently forgotten she'd been practising her metamorph abilities.

The 'wait till my father hears about this!' the whole nine yards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's third year had just ended and Draco's taunts were the braking point to a bad couple of weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus was fired for being a werewolf, and Sirius was on the run again because of Peters treachery and Fudges stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he would get revenge. A day after arriving at Privet Drive; Harry left for Diagon Alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an eventful trip on the knight bus, a quick jaunt to the bank and finding a secluded corner in Flourish and Bott's, he began to prepare the next step of the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho better to get Draco in trouble then his own mother? Finding a useful spell in a more advanced section of the bookstore, he began to practice the difficult charm. The charm would allow him to duplicate a body template over his own similar to the Polyjuice potion. What was better, was only the caster could finite it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry would spend the next week practicing covertly at Flourish and Bott's. He would become Arthur Weasley, Penelope Clearwater, and Steven Helcast. He also discovered that it worked on clothes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the charm mastered, it was time to begin the punishment of Draco and his entire family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be another week before he could strike. Dobby's aid and good luck was what allowed him to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa Malfoy went to the apothecary to get some potion ingredients for the manor. A chance movement away from the crowds would allow Harry to act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back aisle of the store where it was just the two of them, Harry had Dobby stun the Malfoy Matron. Harry knowing anyone could walk up to them quickly cast the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took seconds, but it felt like forever. Harry gained height, grew a large pair of breasts, became blonde, and was now in her late thirties. Harry would pocket the original Mrs. Malfoy's wand, and Dobby would transfigure her into a brooch and place it in the purse that Harry would now carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick change of clothes with a flick of her wrists; she reemerged from the secluded aisle. From start to finish it had taken only twenty seven seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry finished the shopping to avoid suspicion. Harry paid for the supplies, had Dobby covertly deliver them to the manor, and began stage two of his plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius Malfoy was in everybody's pocket. The money ran deep.it would all soon disappear. Narcissa Malfoy walked into the bank with a value of over 20 million Galleons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the liquid assets would be shifted into a new account that would have no specific account holder. Rather it would be protected by a single password<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI solemnly swear I'm up to no good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   ...............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople watched Narcissa Malfoy walk out of the bank. Not knowing that she was 12 million Galleons poorer. They also didn't know that the real Narcissa Malfoy was actually stuck inside a purse and that the thirty eight year old cougar was actually Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry internally cackled. Now to drive the screws in a bit on the Malfoy name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving 'home' he (she) saw Draco. He was looking at a play wizard comic. This set up the perfect storm. Using the centerfold as a template Harry used the spell to turn Draco into a horny playwizard model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother what are you-ahhh?\" Screamed Draco as the spell hit. Harry didn't bother waiting to see his nemesis transform as he had two more major things to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dobby, were on to stage three. Pack up all of Narciss's clothing and jewelry. Once you are done with that use the password to get some Galleons and purchase a wizarding home in Hogsmeade. Lastly, untransfigure Narcissa and put her into stasis in the trunk I bought last week. We don't want her to age very quickly as her body will be useful as a disguise during the summers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat done he turned to see his handy work with Draco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde entitled ponce was gone. A busty, very attractive mid twenties witch with brunette hair was standing in the Malfoy foyer in nothing but an open robe that showed everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't have you blab about how you were changed. Or how an imposter impersonated your mom. Got to make it look the way I want it to. I win again Draco.\" Draco had only a moment to widen his eyes in horror as Draco realized who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obliviate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  .........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius Malfoy would come home to see Melinda Banks, this year's playwizard centerfold in his house. The fact that he had illicit affairs all the time; meant he didn't even bat an eye at the girls advances or presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after a lovely night of love making that Lucius began to be suspicious of why the model was in his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would fine a note from Narcissa stating that she had discovered the infidelity and had ended things. She had taken Draco with her, taken all of the liquid assets, her clothes, jewelry, and the black properties and had left. Melinda Banks was a supposed parting gift<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius just shrugged and went back down stairs to go another round with the bimbo model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   ................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry reverted back to himself in a unisex bathroom at a public library in the muggle world. Dobby's confirmation of access to the property in Rome had his summer plans look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grinning in the mirror he said two words.<br>\r\n\"Mischief Managed.\"</span></div></div>",

The obscure spell that he had found made the summer the best he ever had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had kept in touch with Sirius, Remus, and his friends. They didn't know that he wasn't with the Dursley's. But he knew that he wouldn't be able to stay away all summer. Especially with the World Cup in three weeks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the third time that he had used the spell to be come Narcissa. The first was to put the Malfoy's in their place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucius was dealing with the fallout of the divorce and the fact that he was duplicating people. Although Lucius would deny it, no one would believe it. Having two of the bombshell supermodel would do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Melinda Banks would sue Lucius for creating a body double. The extra Melinda was Draco of course but only Harry knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time was to enjoy a beach in Rome as he settled in the Rome property that he, or Narcissa, had acquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was ready to take the fun to the next level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    .....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later would find him at a muggle beach.

Albus raised his head to see a scantily clad Narcissa sitting across from him in a padded chair, while he sat on a stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Malfoy, why did you stun me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be grateful I didn't kill you. You invaded my property. After finding Lucius banging models in my living room; I thought Britain would leave me alone. Now I find it follows me across half a continent. Now why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbus didn't understand why, but he told her. \"I tracked Harry Potter to this location. It's imperative that I being him back to his relatives so that I can coordinate his eventual death with Voldemort.\" Albus was horrified at what he revealed. Why did he say that to a dark practioner like Mrs. Black?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I know how to deal with you. What was being tracked?\" The newly single lady asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His map of Hogwarts.\" Albus replied, trying and failing to fight the truth serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dobby.\" The lady black called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yous call for me Mr. Potter sirs?\" The excitable house elf inquired. Albus became confused at the delusional house elf until his feminine jailer responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did.\" We're going route Victoria. Finish the binding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbus realized that somehow Harry Potter was sitting before him in Narcissa Malfoy's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? Possession?\" Albus tried to convey disappointment to get Harry to back down on whatever it was that he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa snorted in bemusement. \"No. Something a lot more potent but ultimately far simpler. Imagius Duplicus. Simple spell really. Let me show you. Finite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbus watched as Narcissa Malfoy shifted and molded into Harry Potter. The process only took seconds, but was fascinating to watch. Not just the body, but the clothes changed with him. The Potter Heir sat where Narcissa did just seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagius Duplicus. Harry changed again. Only this time he was shifting into something that Albus saw daily, in a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were now two Albus Dumbledore's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that Dobby has finished binding your magic. It's your turn. I should also add in the fact that the spell I'm about to perform on you will be permanent. Only the caster can finite the magic in this spell. A little insurance in assuring that you disappear for good. Ah found one I liked.\" The whole time Harry had been talking, he had been looking at a magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagius Duplicus.\" Albus heard his voice intone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbus Dumbledore felt decades lift off of him. His weary bones and muscles becoming healthier. Albus thought Harry was doing him a favor. But then he felt the next series of changes. His facial features began to change, massive breasts jutting out of his chest, his average sized dick sucking into him forming a pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into a mirror, Albus Dumbledore saw that he, or rather she, was a Mediterranean beach babe. New memories assaulted him, or rather her. Albus looked up to see his face with a vindictive smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariel Valos. A Greek model that I just created. A squib who is aware of the magical world, but lives muggle. You'll remember your past but won't be bothered to tell anyone. An account with 5000 Galleons and a key is in a small handbag waiting at the front door.\" The Albus lookalike waves his hand and Albus eccentric robes shifted to a bikini top, small Bermuda shorts and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have a compulsion to stay away from Britain for the next two Decades. Enjoy your new life. Dobby!\" The excitable elf returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please escort miss Valos to the front door to pick up the handbag. After that could you pick up the dress for the party I have tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twill be dones master Harry sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin five minutes Albus Dumbledore was out of the villa, out of existence, and out of Harry Potters life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel Valos quietly cried and clutched the handbag tightly to her as she tried to figure out her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     ..............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry finited the Professors image.

The next day he would  be going to the Burrow to join the Weasley's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was contemplating his vacation from himself that he had enjoyed the last couple of weeks. Being a thirty eight year old Cougar was fun. If only Narcissa was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYounger! That's it! \"Dobby!\" Harry called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis loyal elf popped into his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the stasis trunk from the villa in Rome. Also, I need you to get some permanent age regression potions. Enough to you then someone about fifteen to twenty years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDobby nodded in affirmation of the orders and snapped his finger. There suddenly sat a large blue trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry locked his rooms door and then proceeded to enter the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third compartment had a magical cage that surrounded one Narcissa Malfoy. Using the lever Dobby had set up to turn on and off the stasis cage he cancelled the stasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     ..............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa started awake for the first time since she had been stunned three weeks earlier. \"Who- what\" Turning she saw Harry Potter standing in front of a doorway. Seeing that she was naked she tried to cover herself up. Harry waved it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing I haven't seen before. Imagius Duplicus.\" Narcissa watched in horror as Draco's mortal enemy slowly turned into her! Down to the shaved pussy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, you haven't been missed. You aren't even living in England anymore. Your husband cheated one to many times and you ransacked his accounts and fled the country. You now enjoy American, Italian, and Greek studs up and down the coast of Italy. Muggle or magical doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about your family either. Your husband is fighting against several lawsuits right now and your son is enjoying his, or rather her, new life as a playwizard model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've kept you alive because I need a template to copy when I use the spell I just did.\" It was at this time that her old house elf popped in with a potion in it's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an age regression potion. It's going to make you around Eighteen years old again. If you drink it, I promise that you will eventually gain your freedom and get to start your life over. If you don't cooperate, you'll be made to drink it and you'll be in stasis for the rest of eternity. Choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarcissa immediately grabbed the vial and chugged. She felt years melt off of her. She had always looked years younger than she actually was; but the firmness in her breasts and the tauntness of her stomach felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight\" was the last thing she heard before her world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      ..............<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled as the cage reactivated. Finiting the spell and recasting it verified what he thought. Narcissa was now even hotter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiniting it again and returning to malehood Harry smiled. Best summer ever.</span></div></div>",

He didn't immediately dive down, instead circling high in the air until he was sure that Harry was alone. He kept going for five minutes without seeing any other students either practicing with him or observing him. Kitsune was well aware of how unforgiving his mistress was, so was willing to wait longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his broom Harry had spotted the owl when he first arrived. But an owl on a delivery wasn't that unusual. He was practicing his bludger dodging and didn't want anyone else in harms way. As time wore on, he noticed that the same owl was still there. He didn't recognise it. His seeker-sharp eyes were excellent but this certainly wasn't Hegwig or anyone else's that he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart leaped at the thought it might be from his uncle. A strange bird behaving oddly ...cautiously... that had to be from his uncle the escaped prisoner. He landed the broom with his heart racing faster than it had during his flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitsune's sharp eyes picked out something odd. The boy was beckoning him down to land. In a smooth glide he descended, his wide wings showing his plummage magnificently, he circled lower and lower, until he was able to land on Harry's outstretched arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry ruffled his head feathers, and Kitsune relished the attention. He rarely received kind gestures, and basked in them. Taking time to compliment him on his swift delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry took the letter, the owl felt a pang of guilt, that was tempered by the fear of his mistress. As the young Gryffindor broke the seal and started to read, he took to the air. The soft touches and kind words wouldn't last ... not once Bellatrix's spell started to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper was hot in Harry's fingers as he read it. As the bird took to the air, he wished he'd given it some food. He wanted it to stay, so he could send some message back... some encouragement to his uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't read it very far. The pain from his fingers was getting worse. His eyes caught something that gave him pause. A break in the clouds allowed a shaft of light to hit the paper, and that revealed a watermark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe watermark was the Death-Eater's mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he dropped it to the ground like a live snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart was now racing for an entirely different reason. The joy washed away in an icy wave of dread. The damned thing was cursed. That much was clear, the pain in Harry's fingers was the pain of them transforming. He looked at his hands, turning them back and forth. They were slimmer,... -<i>feminine</i>- Harry realised. The palms were soft and not used to physical work. As he turned them back over, he spotted the nail polish. A glossy midnight black on each fingertip, each nail flawlessly done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pain shifted up his arms, Harry slid his sleeves up. It served to confirm his fears. His forearms were slender and lacked even his toned definition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Quidditch uniform wouldn't roll any further up, and Harry felt the itching, burning pain head towards his shoulders. A second wave of magic spread from his fingers, and a brief 'Oh Shit' escaped Harry's lips. A lacy thread was weaving it's way back and forth across his arms. The pattern soon becoming clearer as the fingerless gloves formed. With rapid, jerky gestures, he tried to wipe away the forming gloves. The thread merely took the strain and returned to their original place, their original pattern. He raked his sharpened fingernails over them, he drew blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting his lower lip he continued, but again the magic was prepared, only a few thread were snapped by his actions. Even those reattached themselves. The pattern remained intact. They finished their work as the pain reached past Harry's shoulders. He gave a gasp as it reached inside his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://36.media.tumblr.com/e3e13b134e8f9f975798709441aa4ad2/tumblr_mvw27nZwOU1synm1mo1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://36.media.tumblr.com/e3e13b134e8f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe separate pains from each arm joined together like a spike. A spike driven deep into his spine, deep between the shoulder blades. From there it radiated outwards. A rasp came to his breathing as it rose up his throat, and as it spread down his spine, and through his chest, Harry sobbed. The fear and pain working together, he knew... he dreaded what was coming.... How this would end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it became too much he collapsed to the ground. A shriek came from his lips. It was high and shrill, promising a future where that would be his... her normal register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was unaffected by Harry's tortured scream, and worked on relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new tickle danced around his neck, as a lace collar started to form there too. Harry couldn't even summon the strength to battle it, as he felt it form there.</span></div></div>",

His fingers traced the edge of a corset... A corset that was crushing the breath from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crack, and Harry felt his hips flare out wider, giving more definition beneath the corset. Even his flesh was pale, the parts of his legs visible through the stockings. He couldn't stop himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand lightly passed over his crotch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sob, Harry knew he was fully a girl. As if mockingly driving home the point. He felt the swelling spread, soon the tops of Harry's breasts were forming, full and proud above the top of the corset. There were frills and details that Harry didn't want to consider. But the magic had run it's course. The stockings lead down to painfully tight shoes, with five inch heels... needle-sharp heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt the dirt sticking to his round and prominent ass. She tried to brush it away, but that just made her flesh ripple and move. Harry stopped, Madame Pomfrey... The infirmary.... she needed to get there... That would be the best place for a cure... a treatment... something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry considered running and hiding, but that didn't feel right. She didn't want to be discovered cowering... in hiding. As a female death-eater, that would ... well... it wouldn't look good. It wasn't the actions of a Gryffindor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't vain, but he dearly wanted a mirror at the moment. The idea that this was one of Bellatrix's curses was at the front of his mind, and the idea that she'd give him, her body was deeply unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching her broom up, Harry jumped on board. Even now, she felt a thrill. A broom was the only way to travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the magic had one last trick to play. As Harry mounted up, she felt a rippling wobble come from her well-displayed bust, and a soft squishing from her rear as her weight settled on the broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't remain a broom for long. With a crash and a crack, it transformed into a black lace umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wanted to howl at the moon, at the unfairness of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sinking heart, she trudged back towards the castle.</span></div></div>",

It was becoming increasingly difficult, the height of the heels and the softness of the ground meaning Harry's hips were pistoning up and down. She was strutting her way closer, it took all her concentration not to fall on her arse and add to the humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she missed the flash of light come from the castle. But she absolutely felt the spell when it hit. Dropping her umbrella she collapsed to the ground clutching her corseted stomach. She watched as the clouds drifted past her eyes, as her vision faded to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyelids fluttered as she struggled her way back to consciousness. She wanted to believe she was waking from a dream, but even with her eyes closed that was impossible. The crushing hold of her corset, and the extra shifting of her breasts meant that Harry was in no doubt about her gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strident tones of Professor McGonagall cut through the haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bellatrix LeStrange, did you think you could just walk into Hogwarts?\" her voice was stern, but hinted at disbelief. There was also an edge of fear that Harry had never heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try anything.\" Another voice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistaking the hiss of Professor Snape, \"You are under the Confundus Charm, and we've taken your wand... your umbrella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explained the spinning sensation Harry felt, or maybe it was the after-effects of whatever spell he'd... she'd been hit with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say knock her out, and let the dementors take her back to Azkaban.\" Professor Sprout's voice did tremble as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a potion here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry finally managed to open her eyes. She didn't want the next time she woke to be a prisoner ... in that place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" she croaked, \"Please wait...\" her voice was dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a moment to make sense of the view. Pomona Sprout was above her head, Minerva McGonagall on her left, and Severus Snape on her right. She realised she was on her back on the ground. The wands of each of the Heads was lit, and the air crackled with defensive spells at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Sprout undermined her manner, as her left hand rummaged through her bosom. She then pulled out a small bottle from her generous cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her head was hard work. Harry wasn't sure if it was the spell or just the incredible length of her new hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/STJ4p4U.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/STJ4p4U.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a hand to her forehead, she found a... a crown ... or something like that. It didn't stop her head spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips, and groaned when her tongue brushed over the piercing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, please. I'm Harry... I'm Harry Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a trick...\" Pomona blurted out, \"I don't trust her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall was staring at Harry's face, deep into her eyes. An intense gaze, that Harry knew well from class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeverus Snape's lip curled up, in contempt. A second or two later, the other side curled up too. And he smiled as he looked down on 'The Boy Who Lived'.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rita Skeeter was at her desk at the Daily Prophet when she was hit by the revelation. She was getting old, and her contacts were getting old. The magical journalism business was cut throat enough, without the problems of being behind, too far behind, with the headlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that a new generation of wizards was rising, and rising fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a host of students at Hogwarts, that were likely to shape the future, and take on considerable power in the coming days, months and years. She ground her teeth at her missteps during the Tri-wizard tournament. She'd dismissed them as children, treating them with undisguised contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe no longer thought of Harry Potter as 'the Boy who lived', a lucky child who survived an attack by the Dark Lord, and was she no longer dismissed him as lacking talent. Her experience had cautioned her against inherited magic superiority. A view she never voiced, but she knew parentage was no guarantee for a good wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years ago, she had had to spike a story. Too much pressure from above, she'd <i>'discovered'</i> Draco Malfoy's magical rating, his inherent abilities. His magical potential was barely more than a squib. She'd presented her evidence and story to her editor, eager to please, and zealous for a by-line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was meticulously researched, and corroborated. She rubbed her hands in anticipation, but when the editor had returned to her desk. Her original notes were heavily annotated. She was told in no uncertain terms to lose the story. The Prophet would never publish it, and she'd be very unwise to try and sell it elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own magic skills were quite formidable, as well as being an unregistered animagus, she had incredible discovery magical powers. She analysed her own notes. The pages took on a glow that came from her own Quick Quills, with a gesture to the side, she swept those away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other magical touches became clearer. The pages were much dimmer, and she recognised her editor's magic, another gesture and those were swept away too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat remained was the touch of a powerful magic user. He had notes had been scried, someone was looking for the source of her work. The people who had talked to her. A scowl crossed her face, her editor had undermined a basic principle of journalism. Hell, it was true even of muggle journalism, you don't reveal your sources.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled apart the traces of the magic on her notes. Detecting the alignment, and preferences of the user. It confirmed her suspicions, the notes, HER notes had been handed over to a Malfoy. Probably Lucius, but Narcissa was not without her methods, and was fierce in the defence of her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, she found herself grinding her teeth. The protection that the powerful had, was unjust. She hated the privilege that came easily to some. Controlling her anger, she wondered if that had coloured her judgement, her actions in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrote off a note, an apology, to Harry Potter. It was sincere, and she realised that she had to mend bridges to the current generation. She asked for an audience... a meeting, a chance to set the record straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave it to her owl, and set him off on the long journey to Scotland, and the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply came back the next day. It was better than she'd hoped. Harry had agreed to meet her in Hogsmeade, his note was polite, and well-written. She had a good eye for these things, and thought he'd make a good journalist, or writer if he wanted to turn his skills in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a time and a location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tea shop in the High Street in two days time.</span></div></div>",

While Ron looked more like he was involved in some arcane ceremony. Rita went a little closer. She was still nervous, and not surprised that Harry had brought along some company... some witnesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer instincts kept her on edge. But that didn't stop her from being covered with an upturned jar. She scuttled about, but was unable to escape. Harry looked down on her. His face distorted through the glass. But his face was triumphant, and unhappy. He slide a postcard underneath. It was slow enough, that she didn't risk getting her spindly legs broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell to the bottom, when he up-ended the bottle. With a clap, the lid was put in place, and a twist was enough to secure it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer antennae twitched as she raced around the jar. The sides were too slick to climb, but at least there were some air holes in the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione took the container from Harry's hands and put it on the table out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. I told you we could make our own Marauder's Map for Hogsmeade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say we couldn't. I just said maybe we shouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it turned out useful here and now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned towards the trapped little bug, \"It is useful, isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping the glass, the effect was deafening inside the little jar. Hermione slid her finger down the side until she tapped the map, spread across the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita saw a plan of Hogsmeade, an active map, with the moving position of the various wizards and witches marked on it. Their little feet leaving trails as they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were drawn to the end of Hermione's finger. The position of the three friends was marked. But more revealing, she was still present. If an insect's shoulders could drop, they would have dropped here. Rita couldn't even deny she was there.</span></div></div>",

Hermione looked around before joining the boys. The three students drew absolutely no attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have just come and talked to us.\" Ron added. \"But no. You had to spy first, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione settled Ron with a hand, or rather distracted him from Rita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably know ... or suspect that my father was an animagus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beetle gave a quick tilt of the head. Harry took that to mean yes. It didn't really matter. \"His friends were also animagi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was surprised. Her information was good on James Potter and his friends, so this was a revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working... We're working on a potion, and it requires some animagus DNA., some of your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beetle shifted agitatedly. Clearly unwilling to submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you prefer, I could use an antenna. And when you return to human form... when we allow you back into human form, you'll just have to see how you manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug was powerless to resist. Her greatest gift as an animagus was stealth. A bug was ignored, it lacked the intimidation of a wolf, or the cuddliness of a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that you might want to renege on our little deal. But I must caution you against that. I can keep you in that jar and feed you on scraps for a very long time. And I think you know what happens when a wizard or witch spends too long in their animal form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was rather a vain woman, even if she didn't like to admit it. She preferred to think of her attraction coming from her talent, her writing skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook the jar, and took the lid off while she was still bouncing from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking of a binding promise. That you will give us a lock of your hair, and also that you will never knowingly write lies about people... ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rita settled herself, she found the jar upended and she was sitting on Harry Potter's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll glow when you agree to be bound by the promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon looked on seemingly enjoying the spectacle. Hermione was less happy about the situation. However, neither of the friends was ready to interfere. This was well earned on Rita's part. Her poisonous words had made life at Hogwarts a living hell.</span></div></div>",

His hand was barely out of the way, as Rita changed back into her human form. Her mouth hinted at a snarl, while her eyes darted about in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a moment to settle down. She took a pair of nail scissors from her bag, and snipped at her fringe before passing the lock to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" he said with a tilt of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita hated when she was outmanoeuvred. But she had to admit that Harry wasn't merely a child born to unfortunate parents. He had genuine magical skill, and intelligence. Smoothing imaginary wrinkles from her skirt, she tried to bring things back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Harry. You are right.\" Her words were painfully spoken, and carried little emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon didn't believe her. While Harry was more familiar with painful admissions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back in her chair, and addressed them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we didn't get off to the best of starts... some journalistic advantages are hard to resist.

If I see that you haven't tried to twist your promise, then we can work to build our trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita weighed up his words. It was a wasted journey, but should still hold promise. She decided to entrust the three students with her attempt to release Draco's less than impressive magic record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends shared an look. Draco was dangerous, treacherous and intelligent, but when it came to magic he was more bluster than reality. Using his family as intimidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry decided to make his own overture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we are successful with this potion, then I will come to you with all the details, and that's a promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon shrugged, while Hermione was a little put out, at Harry giving that snippet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was happy with the conclusion, and shook their hands before leaving. If she were quick she could catch the next train south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thanked them sincerely, and the friends smiled at her. Ron more so as she left the tea-room.</span></div></div>",

A cellophane bag, with a seal at the top. Hermione gave Harry a look, while Ron was sealing and unsealing the strip at the top. They'd both learned long ago, not to take the mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a present, Harry had sent Arthur Weasley a pack of empty bags. Ron hadn't stopped talking about how excited his father had been to receive them. Although it did invite a whole series of questions about other muggle artifacts that had caught his interest. Harry had had to request pictures to find out what he was talking about. He was endlessly fascinated with TV remotes... How did they work without magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an effort Harry brought his concentration back to the task in hand. Putting them each in separate little baggies, he tucked them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should keep looking for something of your father's?\" Hermione urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already have three different strands of DNA, different animals.

James had obviously loved his time at Hogwarts, and Harry felt the loss more intensely whenever his name came up. He also felt that it was personal and something he didn't want to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try the old Quidditch supplies, if we check the snitch, and the bludgers, there might be some DNAs on that?\" Ron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <b>Rivelio parentis</b> spell to scan for DNA was something that Hermione had created. Something she was protective of, too. She'd confided in Harry that she was worried, that some wizards might abuse it. That it could be used to prove the difference between full-blood wizards, and others with muggle parents, or mixed muggle-wizard parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon liked the spell, but his knowledge of DNA was uncertain at best. The red hair of Weasley's was the simplest way she explained it to him. Hermione loved Ron, and knew he wasn't stupid. But there were certain things that were alien to him. That anyone else might find more intuitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pecked Ron on the cheek, \"Good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both blushed, and Harry studiously paid attention to the strands of hair.</span></div></div>",

The cheeks sank inward, and the stern expression of Professor McGonagall was visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gritted his teeth, as the pain built. Harry's hair unravelled, forming wild curls around his face. The determination of Sirius was visible. Harry made eye contact with Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, his eyes lost their humanity. They shifted, becoming wide, chestnut and equine. Ron recoiled as they became reptilian, slitted and yellow. Harry shouldn't have joked about Norbert.... Ron really hoped it was a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Okay?\" Ron blurted out between incantations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was worry on Harry's face, and an undercurrent of panic and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's skin erupted, and his pores shot out jets of steam, obscuring him from view. Ron backed away as the cloud expanded. Myrtle leaned closer, and glowered at the mist, willing herself to see the shape within. She wasn't in danger. You can't die twice after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also curious and hopeful that Harry had listened to her suggestion. Maybe, just maybe he was going to have an ethereal animagus form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pulsing white glow started in the centre of the cloud. Ron hoped to make out a shape, but that wasn't possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow brightened and brightened with each pulse, until Ron had to shield his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a blast, and the cloud was blown away. It left only Harry in his new animagus form.</span></div></div>",

But it's too late. She giggles and snorts her joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon approaches Harry as he finishes his manoeuvres. He has to reach up to stroke Harry's mane.

She staggered over towards the mirror, her gait unsteady, she wanted to accuse the mirrors of lying. Harry blamed her glasses and eyesight. But as she made her way, she felt her body move and shift, the weight on her chest unsettling her. It confirmed what she wanted to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you belong in a girls toilet... now.\" Myrtle added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry swatted at her spectral form as she swooped past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the world spin as her breathing became laboured.

Harry trousers were retreating up his legs, and they were gaining pleats as they did. It was becoming a... becoming a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching downwards she grabbed at the hem, but nothing worked, soon she was in a skirt. Her socks had grown longer and extended up her legs, stopping above her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her shoulders, as she felt her shirt start to shift. The stitching moved around, and fit better around her narrowed shoulders. She gave a startled 'Eeek', as she felt her vest shift, it became a bra. It lifted and supported her new bosom, and stopped it from moving quite so dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry lowered her head over the sink, as she fought for consciousness. She felt queasy, and didn't like the new female look to her face. As she did she felt waves of hair cascade forward, off her shoulders and form a wall around her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. Shit. Shit.\" she repeated. Her voice sounding more like Hermione's than his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd have to.... -<i>Shit</i>- <b>She'd</b> have to switch dormitories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly Harry wondered if her hair was now longer than Hermione's.</span></div></div>",

Getting unsteadily up, Harry rose to over six feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the size that Norbert had been when he'd been whisked away in the night. It was then that Harry wondered if the animagus form grew old... or in his case bigger was more of a concern. Already he could easily gouge the ceiling tiles with his razor sharp claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon watched from the side, shocked into silence, as Harry stretched and examined his body in the mirrors. Myrtle was also rather quiet too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron.\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather failed to say, his throat was long and flexible, but no longer suitable for human speech. He let out a high, shrill squawk that was clearly not birdlike. Harry was startled and tried to clear his throat. The barbed tongue not meant for shaping words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing a couple of times, his claws rasped over his long neck. Their sharpness matched, by his impenetrable scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the third cough, a gout of yellow flame burst out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames shot out two feet, three feet, and stopped at four feet.

His wings were brown leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a more measured gaze, his slitted emerald serpent eyes took in his new powerful beauty, and he nodded his approval.

He tilted his head upwards to make eye-contact with Harry, his piercing icy-blue eyes and Harry's emerald serpent eyes. The inner eyelid flicked over Harry's eyes reinforcing their cold inhumanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had completed a circuit, \"Truly very impressive Harry.

He pictured his own body falling into this abyss, it wasn't something he wanted to imagine. There was a scream. A high human scream, and Harry stumbled backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room jumped back into focus and the abyssal darkness merely a terrifying memory. Harry staggered as he struggled for balance, taking a few steps forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadying himself on the ceramic coldness of the sink. Harry gulped the air to the pit of his lungs. His head still span and he threw up into the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent scraped his sinuses and he whirled the taps on, washing away the vomit even as he threw up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to ask Dumbledore a question and had to turn back as bile rose in his throat once more.

She felt a warm happy sensation, that even now, the school was helping her, and protecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the clothing adjust to better fit her new shape. Harry had always liked a woman's shapely leg, and their tight trousers too. It might take away some of the mystique to find herself wearing them. But at least, she wouldn't feel like she was being split in two, and kept very, very aware of her new sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pressure eased on her crotch, Harry ran her hands down her wider hips, smoothing out imaginary wrinkles. But as she did, she discovered that she no longer had pockets. Looking down, in case they were just smaller, tighter or just more finely tailored. Harry saw she her trousers were becoming a skirt. As the trousers were retreating up her legs, even as the material rose, it pleated itself together. With stiff fingers, she tried to stop the rapidly shortening skirt. However, her stubborn fingers had impact nor her silent heart-felt pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hem finally stopped shifting, half way up her thigh. It let Ron admire Harriet's slender legs, and the tights that was all that remained of Harry's former socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deliberate cough, she caught Ron's attention. Although who was blushing the brightest was hard to say. Harriet growled in a low voice, her voice a honeyed purr. She couldn't imagine anything more humiliating than Ron finding her attractive. She looked over to Hermione for sympathy, for some shared fellow feeling. Hermione quickly put a friendly smile on, but it replaced a rather less familiar expression... envy... Harriet wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas Harriet's ordeal was far from over. She felt a constriction around her chest, and thoughts of a heart attack chilled her. But it was merely the first effects of bra that the school was putting into place. Soon the girls were cradled in a silken embrace. As the changes worked, she gave a startled yelp, as they were lifted and separated. An unfamiliar weight pulling at her shoulders. But Harriet felt the effects most devastatingly when she saw how prominently she was displaying her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was... rather well endowed. For an instant her gaze darted to Hermione, and back to herself. She bit her lip, when she saw that she was bustier than her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rather suspect that your friend is right Harry.\" Dumbledore's voice echoed with authority, however quietly he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You chose a powerful form to become your animagus form, and there were consequences for you in choosing such a potent creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet swallowed, in her eagerness to get ahead, she'd resisted Hermione's calls to caution. Between Ron and Hermione, it would always be Ron who was the fun one, and Hermione the more measured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, that was part of why I chose my animagus form more .... with more subtlety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends exchanged looks, nobody knew that Dumbledore was an animagus. He certainly wasn't registered with the Ministry for any particular form. Each wanted to ask him what he had chosen, but equally none of them was willing to interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I must warn you against rash actions. Your body is in a heightened state of flux, and even if you think you've found a cure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice fell silent, Hermione was at his side her head nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet sighed, It sounded like she'd be female for a long time. A shiver ran down her spine, suppose they didn't find a cure, she'd have to return to the Dursley as she was. A sharp, swift, shrill yelp burst from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a lot to take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet was still listening, but she was also taking in her new features.</span></div></div>",

The window was small and round, and outside on the sill, an unfamiliar owl was sitting. The uneven roof meant all of the windows were askew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Owlery's over there.\" Ron said, shooing it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Don't be rude.\" Hermione chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a message.\" Harry went to the window, and the owl hopped backwards.

After a tight spiralling flight around the room, it landed atop a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping one taloned claw, it stretched it's leg for Harry to retrieve the envelope it clutched.

Perhaps it would be best to rip up the contents. But calming himself, he showed the mark to Ron and Hermione. It was a mix of D.P and R.S. carefully interwoven. The D.P. was stylised identifying it as 'the Daily Prophet', and the three friends knew who R.S. was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vile woman.\" Hermione muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Treacherous witch.\" Ron agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry kept his opinion to himself, and gave the wind-swept old owl a silver sickle in thanks. \"You can rest in the owlery, if you need... or wish.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain giving it's bobbing bow, it shot off towards the window, only tucking it's wings and flying through with the slimmest of margins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the dust cover off a sofa, and the three friends sat down, one each side of Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a folded note, and an even smaller envelope.

Blinking he tried to stand on his own, it still felt like the room was moving, but the blurry outline in front of him was clearly Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, not Ron. There was a mass of hair around her face, and he felt Hermione's soft hands both clutching his outstretched hand. Widening his stance, he slid his feet further apart for stability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry?... Harry?, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's voice called from behind him. Feeling a mass of hair fall across his own face, he wondered if he were some kind of long-haired dog, as he swept it aside. But he knew the potion had failed. He felt the brush of a hand, his own hand as he swept it off his face. His scrambling mind, putting together some of the other facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was standing on two feet, he had his hands still. Looking Hermione in the eye, even if he couldn't make out her face, he needed to know. He had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I a ... a monster?\" His voice having the same uncertain edge as Ron's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Hermione said rather sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry coughed, as he tried to clear his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione...\" he tried tentatively, \"<span class=\"clgrey\"><i>*cough* *cough*</i></span> Hermione...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Harry had another realisation. His voice was feminine... When he'd asked Hermione... that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I still human?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, Harry checked with his free hand. He felt his hand press against first one breast, then the other, giving each an exploratory squeeze, and pull. Harry felt them from both sides, on his...? ... her chest, and in his full hands. The unsettlingly large nipples responding to the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quavering gasp, Harry reached down... She found ....  she found a....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't face it, she couldn't even name it. But she was undeniably fully a witch rather than a wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry.\" Hermione hissed angrily, clasping his hand tightly, her nails digging in the back of his -<i>damn it</i>- her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione then pulled her in one direction. With an exaggerated scrapping shuffle, she allowed herself to be lead. Her heart was beating in her throat, as she felt her hand placed against something icy cold, and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the sink, Harry.\" Hermione informed her stiffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take your glasses off now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt her panic collapse, as she raised a trembling hand to her face. The relief she felt was palpable, she wasn't stuck as some blind witch. She felt stupid for her terror driving her to forget to take off those damned glasses. The glasses that defined him almost as much as that cursed scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with a cold metallic clink, the frames made contact with the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping tears of relief from her face, she spotted an unfamiliar face. It was Hermione, and she looked more lost and confused than Harry had ever seen. But that became worse, as she turned, and spotted another Hermione beside her. This one looking quite furious, her lips pulled tight, her eyes as icy as the chill marble sinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too monstrous, I hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his glasses off, he watched his reflection showed him understanding dawning on one Hermione's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...

But instead of throwing up, Harry was reclaimed by the dizzying whirling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was either less forceful this time, or Harry was getting used to it. But she managed to fight off her dizziness. Although she kept a firm grip on the sink. Looking at her new reflection, she could still see Hermione's face looking back at her. There were changes, though, and Harry wasn't sure she liked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes looked bigger, and more expressive, while her nose had shrunk and become cuter. But her mouth was the most different, it was smaller and fuller, with full lush lips, and a natural pout. Looking more intently he saw that her face was also more heavily made-up. Her lips a glossy scarlet, and pink blush on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry closed her eyes, as she fought to keep calm. It wasn't anyone's fault but clearly there was too much boggart in the mix. She also suspected that she was changing from Ron's subconscious. Firstly into Hermione, and now into this more sexual one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, she took in the rest of the damage. Gone was the bushy brown mane replaced instead with straight blonde hair. Well as straight as it could be. It flowed relentlessly forward, and cleaved to her curves. Although this particular angle was rather alien to Harry, he was sure that she was curvier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting a glance to Hermione's reflection, she saw that she was indeed much bustier than her friend. Although from the glower that Hermione was directing at the blonde Harry she'd caught his look, and where she'd focused her attention. Harry looked her in the eyes, and saw that despite her anger, Hermione was looking rather pensive. Not thoughtful, but almost insecure... at least there was an uncertainty to her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrenched her gaze back to her own changes, the Gryffindor lion, rather distorted by the swell of her bosom. She put that thought from her mind, and looked at her reflection. Her uniform was more strained by her changes... by her expansion. Or the material was thinner as a whole. But the effect was the same, Harry's shirt -<i>damn</i>- blouse was visible through the jumper. Even her hands clutching the sink had changed. Gaining a shiny veneer of pink. A perfect coat on each nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much for Harry, she whirled around to her copper haired friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>W</b></i>on. This is not funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anger was undermined by her pronounced lisp, and also by Ron's gaze which had dropped to follow the shifting, sloshing of Harry's bust as it caught up with her annoyed turn.</span></div></div>",

Distractedly, Harry hoped it didn't detract from her beauty, before wondering where that concern came from. A sense of modesty filled her... feminine modesty, and her gaze shifted to Ron, and the Gryffindor boy openly ogling her cleavage. Thankfully at that point, she felt 'Mione's spell go to work, as a blouse stitched itself into existence. Her bra finally being hidden, even if her extravagant measures were still pressing firmly forward. A pout of disappointment flashed over her features, as she felt the thick masking layer of a cardigan covering the blouse. As if a spell was broken, Ron managed to snap his eyes upwards to the slowly shaking head of Hermione Granger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>the girl who giggles</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that niggling thought, the boggart magic went to work corrupting Harry's fears.

But it was useless, the collar tightened and with a canine cough Harry was dragged into motion. He tried to concentrate on his male body, but the magic didn't restore him. His mind raced, but couldn't settle on an answer. Perhaps it was for his own protection, to stop him from choking. Or Hermione needed to remove the leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Harry found himself padding along behind his two best friends. Thankfully, the body came with certain instincts, that allowed him to easily lope along. Self-conscious, and afraid that everyone could see Harry Potter on the end of the leash, he tried to appear as insignificant as possible. However, as a wolf-hound, he was far from small. Instead drawing passing caressing strokes from most of the students as they passed along the corridors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Harry was walking by Hermione's side, his tongue lolling happily from the side of his mouth. A head ruffling scratch, and soon Harry was leading, his presence clearing the way. His size making him intimidating, even if his behaviour was more puppy-ish and eager. His snout high, as a whole world of aromas opened up to his canine senses. Snuffling and sniffing, he walked on, with only the hint of jerk from Hermione to guide him on the path to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked on, Harry got an idea where they were heading, as they neared the main doors. He let out a deep 'yip' of approval, at the idea of visiting Hagrid. Once off, the cold stone of the castle, and with the fresh air of the forest blowing across his nostrils, Harry was eager to slip his leash and run free. To explore the speed of this body, it's muscularity, it's stamina, to race and run as he knew he could.</span></div></div>",

As they approached the door, he scratched loudly at the door, until he heard the lumbering sound of Hagrid approaching the door.

With a sideways glance to Ron, and Hermione, he trotted across the threshold into the shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Hagrid.\" springing cheerfully from them. Sweeping the pair into a great bear hug, Hagrid was glad of the company.

Harry found himself waving back, as Luna looked around the pub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Harry.\" she said, taking the wave as an invitation to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the empty space beside Harry, she leaned forward confiding a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are looking at me.\" Blind to Ron's questing eyes flicking between Hermione, and Luna's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it because I'm not wearing shoes?\" she asked. With every appearance of genuine confusion. \"It's not my fault the nargles keep taking them.\" she said with a vaguely defensive air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Err.</i>.. No, it's not the shoes.\" Harry offered her in consolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down to confirm she was bare footed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... It's your clothes.\" Hermione said, her tone shifting between a whispered shout, and an exasperated rasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not ... not... conventionally dressed.\" Ron added, managing to hold his gaze on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded her understanding. \"You don't like the unconventional.\" Luna said to Hermione. Not judgemental, just observant. A shrug dismissed Hermione's opinion. A smile returned, she was happy to know the reason for those stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0dc229fae0b657ac7d07d3f897fd2e47/9d05dc57a641cd2b-e9/s640x960/706210329e5d8c19ff14d899cea7374bf4d0e76e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/0dc229fae0b6...</a></span></div></div>",

Harry jumped as his vision halved. His wild unkempt hair, taking on a lustrous sheen. Benefiting from a timely regime, It cascaded over Harry's chest. Wide, long, dark, thick locks covering his scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bounced as it fell, brushing over his... now her chest.

Given the nature of the 'Forbidden' Forest, only Harry and a few others had spent any time in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumours and stories made it to be a more horrific and scary place than it truly was.

Harry and Hagrid saw a centaur ...well... a centauress step out. As she approached, she left the darkness and passed into a more dappled light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had an idea who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he could only be sure once she was nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a beautiful palomino body, a white coat, and salmon coloured tail.

His other Gryffindor samples were roaming all around the castle, according to the Marauder's Map. Not really a problem, but at any time, they might return to the common room. Harry however, knew Angelina's routine, her dedication to the Quidditch team, she'd stay out as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the trio's experiment with polyjuice, and his experience with Barty Crouch Jr., he'd kept a batch ready, awaiting just the final ingredient. He'd picked up the habit of taking hair samples for any need. His muggle side encouraged him to think it worked on DNA, and he considered trying fingernails, rather than a strand of hair. In the end, a stray hair is easier to find, he now had dozens of carefully collected and labelled test tubes with a few strands of hair, and a carefully written label.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was sitting in the girls toilet once more, listening intently for the door, and keeping an eye out for Myrtle. He suspected Myrtle knew about his experiments, and kept the secret as a shared bond. Perhaps as blackmail for some future time, or more simply as a friend as someone she could talk to, someone who didn't think of her as '<i>Moaning</i>' Myrtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the one he'd selected up to the light, it was curlier and lay circled at the base of the test-tube, a hair from Angelina Johnson, collected from her broomstick. He just couldn't shake the idea that had invaded his thoughts. His thoughts drifting back to their first experiment, to Hermione's first mistake. He couldn't dislodge the idea this was a pussy hair, and she didn't have a cat as a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was out of the way, practising her flying at the Quidditch pitch. With a resigned shrug, he upended the test-tube, the hair drifted out to land in the palm of his hand. He found himself taking a tentative sniff, being careful not to blow it from his open hand. He couldn't detect anything, but he was in a toilet. With the prepared dose ready he dropped in the tightly curled hair. Instantly a puff of smoke rose from the dull chocolate surface, and it bubbled. The bubbles rising and bursting like a swamp with an upset stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he raised the cup to his lips, Myrtle's head appeared through the mirror, startling Harry, and almost making him spill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on.\" she encouraged, a broad smile on her face, \"You know you enjoy this part... The anticipation, the countdown until you see a pretty girl looking back at you from the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Adam's apple bobbed nervously, surely it wasn't as open, as widely known as all that. Myrtle winked lewdly at him. \"Come on, now. It's getting cold.\" she chided, \"Or perhaps a naughty girl wants a punishment.\" she giggled as Harry squirmed, \"I can't spank you, but I might find someone to do that for you...\" her words dissolving into a fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will keep my secret...\" Harry half-asked, half-questioned, almost pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectral head nodded in agreement, eager herself for the next stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry swallowed the contents in a few swift gulps. The taste was sour and biting, but he felt it going to work almost straight away. His grip tightened around the sink, as he felt his legs start to tremble and transform.</span></div></div>",

His hair lengthened,reaching to brush his shoulders, and continue growing. With a gasp, he felt his nipples widen, their sensitivity jumping. Eyes drawn to his chest, he watched as it swelled forward. His shirt bulging in two places. Despite the polyjuice, Harry found his hands rising to his chest, confirming it wasn't just the way the fabric was hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his hands were smaller, as they cupped and cradled his... her breasts. She felt the nipples harden, pressing urgently against the palms of her hands. There was a rippling lurch, and her eyeline dropped a few inches. Her bust also jumped in her hands, as if trying to escape her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smothered giggle from Myrtle caused her to snatch her hands away as if stung. Pressing off from the sinks, she stood upright, her new height shorter even than Harry's own. Her trousers hid the rest of her changes, beyond the fact that they hung oddly, both too snug, too loose and too long. She was standing on the cuff of her trousers. Even her feet felt like they were swimming inside the shoes. Taking a step backwards to admire her reflection full length, Harry's arms windmilled, as she stumbled. Tripped both by her shoes and trousers. Landing on her plump rear, she kicked away at the treacherous shoes, and scowled at the badly fitting uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you have the padding.\" Myrtle giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's head snapped around, her anger flaring, but Myrtle's face was transformed, sheer joy made her beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" she agreed, rubbing her bruised ass, and forgetting her bruised ego. He didn't want to feel any more isolated, he was doing this alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPictures of the Gryffindor sixth and seventh years were turning up, circulating of them in their dorm rooms, in their underwear. He needed to investigate. Hermione had glowered at both him and Ron, for offering to help, for even suggesting they understood. Harry trusted Ron, but was afraid that Fred and George would find out about his investigation, and might enjoy a joke or two at her expense. She tried to dismiss the idea that Fred and George were behind the candid snaps. But somehow, she couldn't dismiss the pranksters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Harry admired her reflection. Angelina was a beautiful girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vestiti Transformii</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching the crown of her head with the wand, a shower of sparks erupted, cascading down her body. Harry felt the uniform shift, slithering over her skin like an army of ants. She felt a constriction, and worried momentarily that something was wrong. Her conscious mind fighting to keep her calm, as she felt her... <span class=\"cgrey\"><i>HER </i></span>bra form. Silkily slipping over the swell of her sensitive flesh, then lifting, supporting, containing the girls. It was unsettling, her reflection looking pensive, her perfect teeth just visible as she bit her full lower lip. Her bust seemed to surge in size and prominence as the bra completely formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as unsettling was the sensation from her wide hips, and full arse. The unravelling of her plain underwear was rapid, as it became less constricting, less... well, just less of it in general. She wondered if Angelina went 'commando', the changes were so fast and so severe. However, she stood even straighter as she felt the last threads shift and slip between the pillow cheeks of her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, her hands reached backwards questing to retrieve the vanished thong. Instead confirming the plump, fullness, the soft roundness of her expansive new arse. Also confirming the tight confinement of her skirt, with her supple fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like a girl... worried about the size of her ass.\" Myrtle's voice a reedy attempt at sounding male and dismissive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to face the world, '<i>Angelina'</i>?\" Myrtle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last look at the Marauder's Map, she confirmed the real Angelina was still whizzing around the Quidditch pitch, slaloming between the towers, and the goal posts.</span></div></div>",

According to the wizard what he purchased was a magic quill. With some exceptions his quill supposedly could alter reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry personally thought that the quill was just a gimmick. But he paid three Galleons for it. Might as well try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the library he saw Daphne Greengrass studying Ancient Runes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry for a laugh wrote the following. Daphne Greengrass is naked. Looking up just as he finished writing the sentence, he saw the Ice Queens clothes vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" The pureblood girl screamed. The Slytherin girl hid behind a bookshelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the embarrassed girl he realized \"the quill was real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the invisibility cloak he snuck out of the library as it had became a scene of calamity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing infinite potential Harry began to think of what to do next. He had a slight crush on Cho, but she was taken. The Ravenclaw beauty was currently dating Cedric Diggory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that could change with a simple scratch of the quill. But; while Harry wasn't worried about embarrassing a pureblood snob, he wouldn't ruin a legitimate relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl he slightly fancied was Susan Bones. But he didn't know if she felt the same way about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now he could find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, still under the invisibility cloak, found the Redhead in question talking to her best friend Hannah. Harry needed a way to separate the two to enact his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he tried to figure out how to do this, Hannah separated from her friend saying that she needed to pick up her potion books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry followed the blonde into the Huffelpuff dorms. When she entered her room Harry stunned her. He stripped out of his robes to prepare for the change he would make. Then he pulled out his quill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Harry James Potter will turn into Hannah Abbott for the next three hours. During this time, Hannah Abbott will become the potion books that she needs for class. When the time ends both Harry and Hannah will revert to their original forms. Hannah will remember grabbing her books and going to potions class. She will not remember being stunned.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished writing his intended change the magic took affect. Harry watched in fascination as his hair lengthened out, lightened to blonde and braided itself into the hairstyle Hannah currently had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt his chest expand out. Looking down at Hannah he saw that she was shrinking in on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms shrank into her torso. The sleeves of her blouse hanging limply as the blonde girl no longer had arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had expected it to work. The quill had vanished Daphne's clothes. But to see this kind of Transfiguration was amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some ways the change felt like it took forever. In other ways it seemed to happen in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Hannah Abbott stood wearing a male Gryffindor uniform, looking at year four potion books intermingled a female Huffelpuff uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself, Harry set out to find Susan Bones and ask if she had a crush on him.</span></div></div>",

Harry had used the mystical quill to erase memories, transfigure a human into a book, made a pureblood male turn into a female Muggleborn, had that transformation be phrase operated, and could control who was aware of what change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Draco was busy being occupied with life as a girl. His constant usage of the mudblood slur had accumulated three days so far of being Hermione. The idiot didn't realize what had triggered it and was constantly adding time to his total. At the current rate he was going, he was going to be a girl through the rest of September.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Harry had to decide what to use the quill on next. His love life was currently secure. Finding the truth about Susan's feelings for him had allowed him to muster up the courage to date her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quill had also gotten Sirius Black, his Godfather, a trial. This allowed him to be a free man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had even created a jinx thanks to the quill. Anytime someone said princess within thirty feet of Daphne Greengrass, her clothes vanished. Harry knew of six different times that had happened. No one had been able to figure out why it was happening. The snobby, calm, collected pure blood was on the verge of having a mental breakdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when he was heading into Potions that he realized who his next victim could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting there early he began to set up his table and began to act as if he was writing notes down on parchment. In reality he was preparing his next change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Severus Snape will slowly change into a beautiful twenty one year old girl named Samantha Conner throughout the potions lesson. A blonde American Muggleborn who just earned her potions mastery. His hatred with me will turn into an attraction to Ron. Outside of myself; no one will notice the change, or remember Severus after the class ends.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Snape entered in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon class. Today you will begin preparing to make shrinking solution. The ingredients that will be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Snape talked Harry focused on the professor. The change would take place over an hour but Harry could already see certain changes. The dour professor seemed to slowly improve in mood as the lesson went on. The changes were soon visible. Snape's greasy straight hair, began to lengthen, curl, get healthier, and take a nice Golden hue. As he lectured he coughed, swallowed his Adams apple, and continued to talk at a higher octive of pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape's billowing black cloak began to dissolve, and his inner robes began to shift. Soon Snape was wearing a cardigan sweater and blue jeans. A bulge was briefly seen before it retreated. The cardigans neckline lowered to show the newly created mounds of flesh on her chest. The sweater puppies continued to grow to about a C- cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville got progressively more sure of himself throughout the lesson. At the halfway point of the lesson he raised his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor called on him. \"Yes Neville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do the nettles need to be crushed instead of flattened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great question.\" Professor Conner said. \"It's about the juices. We need them crushed....\" The dour professor was gone. A beautiful foreign teacher had taken his place. One that actually cared for her students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the lesson, Harry noticed the young teacher steal glances at Ron, Seamus, and Blaise. A small tint of blush was visible when her eyes lingered on the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the class ended and Harry began to pack his stuff. He began to joke with Ron about the potions mistress having a crush on him. Ron fervently denied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all. Harry thought potions was now changed for the better.</span></div></div>",

Seamus was impressed with the massive C cup chest that Neville's female version was sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan on the other hand was bulking up.

Natalie spots Hailey's exhausted look and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hank running you ragged?\" Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea. He's so big and has so much stamina. He saids he tries for a three to one ratio.\" Seeing questioning looks from not only Natalie, but Diana, Fay and Hermione as well; Hailey blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gives me three orgasms for everyone he experiences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that.\" Fay Dunbar said formerly. \"Is a true man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway\" Hailey Potter said. \"I'm going to take a shower,\" and she walked out of the room to head to the communal showers. As she walked it was apparent that she was walking slightly bowlegged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked at her watch. \"I need to go find Draco and hand him some more of these.\" Waving tampons in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie looked in astonishment at the resident book worm. \"He's still your body double?\" Granger nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They either need to wipe his memory and make him a girl, or they need to find a way to reverse what's happening to him. It's creepy looking at a bigoted version of me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The clock struck 8pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie, Diana, Fay and Sally Anne felt a wave of pressure hit them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic however made them unaware. Unaware of their boobs flattening. Unaware of dicks forming. In a matter of seconds, where four gorgeous girls had stood were now four well stacked guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you guys feel that?\" Dean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Samuel Perks said. \"Seems like Hogwarts displaced our dorm room. We're in the girls half of the dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFabio Dunbar shook his head. \"I hope we don't get in trouble. I'm not going to be held accountable for Hogwarts doing a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They heard the door open to see a toweled Hailey step in only for her to eek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you boys doing in our room?\" The Potter Heiress shrieked. This brought the attention of the nearby dorms where Katie Bell had smuggled the Weasley Twins in order to enjoy a threesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three checked out the screams coming from the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrive to see Hermione returning along with Angelina Johnson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" The sixth year prefect asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys explained that they had felt a pressure in their room, and then found them in a hybrid room on the girls side of the dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever hearing about this before Angelina decided to make an executive decision. Seeing Katie give her clues as to what she was in the middle of Angelina decided that all parties were to remain in the room until magic sorted it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know that it was magic feeding on the change and finding new ways to scramble reality as had been originally written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours past and all the inhabitants would sleep through the next wave of changes at 2am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville, Dean, Fabio, and Samuel would return back into their female identities of Natalie, Diana, Fay, and Sally Anne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Weasley twins Fred and George would change. The pranking duo, would become the fashion duo. Faith and Grace Weasley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina Johnson, Katie Bell, Hailey Potter and Hermione Granger; would lose their female gender. Andrew Johnson, Kevin Bell, Harry Potter, and Herman Granger would become the new identities for the four newly minted men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt three am, the boys were teleported back into their respective male dorms while the girls were sorted into their appropriate year dorms as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic having done its job, waited until next week for more change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next Friday saw 8pm once again approaching. Magic began to build to fuel the change. It enjoyed the changes that it had wrought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had over the past week enjoyed the twins attention. The twins were unknowingly pregnant. They would remain in their female state permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon approved of the threesome relationship and had dived into the world of dating himself. Diana's blowjobs escalating into full blown makeout sessions with the dark skinned girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie announced that she was pregnant from Steven Bones. A formal engagement between the two had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank Abbott was apparently banging Tracy Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman Granger was now a beater on the Quidditch team. He was also the only male Gryffindor not in a relationship. Kevin Bell was enjoying his new girlfriend Alicia Spinnett, and Andrew Johnson was reported as having scored with Cho Chang and Lisa Turpin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Lawrence Brown had broken house barriers and had the ice Queen Daphne Greengrass on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was exhausted from his endeavors with his girlfriend's and had turned in early. Ron had snuck Diana into the dorms and the two were going at it behind silencing charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman was doing some homework when Steven sauntered in. His cocky attitude had grown after he had knocked up Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Steven?\" Herman asked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for Lawrence. He owes me some money. I need it to get Natalie the latest intimates for Christmas.\" The well endowed Huffelpuff boasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman was mildly disgusted at Steven talking about his girlfriend's underwear like that. Just as he was about to respond the door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow a foursome had begun, and they had slowly made their way to Gryffindor tower. Lawrence Brown knowing the password and Hank Abbott being his wingman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bombshells of Tracy Davis and Daphne Greengrass were the ones moaning between them. The four soon began to abuse the bed that Lawrence normally used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Herman was impressed. He saw Stevens eyes raise in surprise and was about to say something when the clock struck 8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman felt a pressure in his scalp as he looked over at Steven. Somehow Stevens frame didn't look very impressive. Stevens supposedly large dick looked small and almost as if it was shrinking. His chest also looked as if it was growing boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman was distracted from this, by a painful pop and then a slurp in his gut. It intensified and soon.... Hermione let out a breath of relief as the pressure in her crotch ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up she scowled at the bombshell Susan Bones checking herself out in the full blown mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione saw the foursome that Lavender and Hannah had brought in, and had to admit that Travis Davis and Darren Greengrass were studs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies,\" Hermione turned to see Andrew Johnson standing in nothing but boxers admiring the female perfection that was Susan Bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione blushed \"hey Andrew.\" Perhaps it was the sounds of Darren's dick penetrating Lavender, or knowing that Dean was mauling Veronica in her bed that was getting her wet. Regardless, Andrew Johnson was soon dominating both her and Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed and Travis would soon be the only one conscious from their foursome. Travis would leave the blonde babes and Darren to make his way back to the Slytherin Dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica would stroke her boyfriends dick and smile. Sex with Dean was so enjoyable. She soon had to pee though and sauntered off with a sashaying of her hips to relieve herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Bones smirked at the lack of endurance Hermione had. She would soon follow Andrew out of the room. Time for round two to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2am hit and a new series of relationships formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica Weasley was now a girl. She would be dating Travis Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana would continue the daily blowjobs at lunch with Herman Granger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry remained unchanged having slept through the events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was now Andrew Johnson's conquest. The fourth girl to go all the way with the Playboy (Natalie Longbottom, Cho Chang, and Lisa Turpin being the other three) and the second after Natalie Longbottom to become Pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne Greengrass would be resorted into the house of the brave but would otherwise return to her elegant beauty. Her relationship with Lawrence soaring to new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank Abbott would go back to Huffelpuff confused as to why he had fallen asleep in the Gryffindor tower. Hank would later go to madame Pomphrey for mental healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic was satisfied. Another person pregnant. The growth of magical continued. More people were being caught into the vortex. The dictates of the quill, now forgotten in Harry Potters trunk, fueling the weekly changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic was happy and Magic..... Was gaining power.</span></div></div>",

The last two years had allowed the boys to grow closer in friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of his third year Lupin had helped Harry prove Sirius innocence. When they were leaving for the castle Professor Lupin had remained in the Shreaking Shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis allowed Harry to prove Sirius innocence, and remaining away from the Dursley's. It also allowed him to have almost two years of nothing but teenage drama. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five had stayed at Hogwarts for the winter holidays of their fifth year. The boys had begun to play a lewd game of Truth or Dare. It was Harry's turn to be asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth or Dare Harry?\" Ron asked his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare.\" Harry said instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare you to drink polyjuice potion not knowing who it's keyed to.\" Ron said confident that Harry was about to receive a couple of points. The boys were playing a points penalty version where you got a point for refusing to tell the truth and two points for refusing a dare. So far Harry, Ron, and Seamus had no points, Dean had two, and Neville had one. You were out at ten points and whoever the winner was got ten Galleons from the other four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Harry said thinking it wouldn't be that bad. He'd be Fred or Neville for an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon handed over the coal of potion and shooed Harry into the restroom. He was a little surprised Harry was going to do it, but had a cat ate the canary grin that Harry didn't notice as he headed into the dorm bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry got to a sink and downed the vial. Unlike in second year the potion didn't taste nasty. It tasted slightly sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste didn't stop the pain as his body began to be rearanged. His body shrunk slightly, his waist began to construct in and his Raven hair began to turn a unique shade of read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry soon realized that instead of Fred, Neville or another boy from his dorm, he was being turned into Susan Bones from Huffelpuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's impressive chest and butt began to fill out and Harry moaned at a higher octive when Harry's lengthy member began to retreat into himself. His balls shifted into him and we're replaced with Susan's vaginal canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds Harry Potter was replaced with Susan Bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering obscenties under his breath he transfigured his clothes to match his new from and went back out to the other dormmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree our of the four boys stared in shock at the stacked bombshell standing in the doorway of the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon meanwhile was snickering. \"Looking good Harry!\" </span></div></div>",

It was weird. His male mind could appreciate a well played dare, but his female body was angry over percieved violation. \"Truth or Dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot recognizing the tone of anger from his transformed roommate he flippantly said \"dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare you to drink one of your prepared vials and give Seamus a blowjob.\" Harry declared. Dean began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you just gave Ron two points. There's no way he wou-\" He stopped in mid sentence as Ron pulled out a vial out of the same satchel that had held the vial Harry had drank from. Not looking at the label Ron downed the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room watched in fascination as Ron began to change. Ron's trademark Weasley hair lengthened past his shoulders and began to turn blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others watched Ron's transformation, Harry looked into the satchel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of vials were in the bag with at least twenty different names on the different vials. Some male some female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up to Ron, Harry saw the last changes occur. Ron had turned into a babe like he had. Standing next to the doppelganger of Susan Bones, was Daphne Greengrass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite knowing that two of their roommates occupied the two attractive bodies before them; all three males in the room sported hard-ons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Harry got a little wet looking at Ron's blonde form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon got a determined look an her face. He walked three steps to Seamus dropped onto his knees, pulled Seamus pajamas down and began to fulfill the second part to Harry's dare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry got even more turned on by what he was watching and began to masturbate in front of the other guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally climaxed at the same time Seamus did. Surprisingly Ron swallowed every drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Awesome!\" Seamus declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville had watched the whole thing in stunned silence while Dean and Harry masturbated to the kinky expo that was displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neville\" Ron cooed out in Daphne's dulcet tones \"truth or dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth.\" Neville declared.

Rather he wanted to make a guy into a girl and then have his way with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville spent the next month learning about the Polyjuice Potion. He memorized ingredients and when to add ingredients. His mastery of the potion would allow him to extend Polyjuice potion from once an hour to once a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy March he had twenty seven vials of unkeyed Polyjuice ready to go. During the next several weeks he would covertly gather dozens of hairs from the female population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally during the Easter break he made his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeamus, Dean and Ron had gone home for Easter. Harry would have gone home but Sirius had the flu and Harry decided to stay at the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Harry.\" Neville asked. \"You remember that night during the Christmas break?

Since it's just the two of us I thought we could kill some time since tomorrow is Saturday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was surprised at the question. To be honest, he did have fun as Susan. It wouldn't hurt to have fun for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.

Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry already knew how Daphne looked. But if he was honest, she was the better looking of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daphne.\" Harry declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the decision made. Neville handed over the vial.

Harry had to admit he was kinda excited to be the Ice Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry chugged the vial and almost immediately doubled over at how intense the potion was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville looked on in excitement. As he thought, his fetish kicked in and he was getting hard watching Harry lose his masculinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's hair lengthened and brightened from black to blonde. His Seeker muscles disapearing as Daphne was not an athlete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's chest began to expand outwards as the Polyjuice built Daphne's impressive bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's legs lengthened, slimmed and his upper thighs thickened. Neville had to hold back his erection as he watched Harry's penis begin to shrink. Neville actually got a little closer and could hear the testes pop and dissolve. Harry's ball sack shrank into nothingness and Harry began to squirm as his reproductive organs were being remade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last signs of his male hood began a full retreat. The penis head collapsed into the shaft as it sank into his thighs. Finally the last folds of the penis shaft disappeared and created the vaginal folds of Harry's new pussy. Harry Potter was now fully female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Harry could get his bearings Neville pounced. His cock throbbed with need and the seconds old pussy was it's target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't protest as the thick member felt amazing inside her. Daphne was heterosexual, and thus into guys. Thus the body Harry wore was naturally attracted to Neville. Especially the cock. It was the biggest one she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry frowned. That last thought sounded suspiciously girly. Like something the real Daphne would say. Had to be careful. Coherent thought left her as a mind blowing orgasm hit her right at the same time that Neville cummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville smiled. The memory duplication he had added would make the weekend more enjoyable. Harry would slowly gain memories of Daphne during the next 24 hours. It would make it easier to persuade him to renew the dosage tomorrow evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry, in Daphne's body, bounced on his spent dick getting it excited for a second round. As she did so Neville was plotting. How to break the minds of his roommates, turn them female, and make them dependent on him for sex<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now he had a roommate to screw.</span></div></div>",

He was also the Heir to house Black due to his Godfather being sterile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic saw this and realized that Steven Potter needed two girlfriends to satisfy House protocols. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearest girl was Ron Weasley as a Polyjuiced Daphne Greengrass. Magic would interfere in the potions magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon Weasley felt his memories being erased. He tried to fight the primal magic, but to no avail. Being that Daphne Greengrass already existed; magic made the chess master her identical twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon Weasley would be removed from existence. In his place, Veronica Greengrass. Unlike her twin, she was sorted into Gryffindor. She would become girlfriend number two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the newly minted girl in mind and body began to enjoy a threesome, magic prepared to fertilize Veronica like it did Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this new forming reality Steven was more sure of himself having never been at the Dursley's. As such he wasn't desperate for friends as he grew up with many of his peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ruined any positive relationships that Hermione Granger had. Not making any friends, she had gotten lost in her work. Magic extended mercy to the miserable girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brainy Muggleborn would be erased. Like the original Lisa, her soul would travel up Veronica's birthing canal and enter the womb just as Steven fertilized the egg in Veronica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagics altering power continued to froth. The Polyjuice vials in the satchel, made by a boy that no longer existed; was absorbed into the changing magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo boys had been made girls, and two girls had been reverted into recently fertilized eggs. Magic needed to balance things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next victim would be Pavarti Patil. The outgoing twin was chafing at the restrictions of her family, while her sister embraced them. Magic would rectify this arbitrary injustice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPavarti Patil would be yanked from around the globe. Having been in Calcutta India. She was wisked back to Scotland and Hogwarts. She would arrive at the fifth year boys dormitory just as the changes were begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was her foreign heritage. Her skin lightened from the tan complexion of India, to the pale skin of North America. Her gender was arbitrarily changed and her memories deconstructed and rebuilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick Crawford, an American Muggleborn was the new identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was two final victims to the sacrificial magic that had been invoked by the insane Neville. The magic of the Polyjuice had fueled it to further heights then originally planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Alice Longbottom had been tortured into insanity. The magic began to heal the childless couple and gave it another chance at life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFay and Alan Carter were born into reality.<br>\r\nThe fifteen year olds would join Steven Potter's year mates. Fay would be sorted into Huffelpuff sharing a dorm with Susan Bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer twin brother Alan would be sorted into Gryffindor. Sharing a room with Patrick, Steven, Dean and Seamus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change fulfilled, and magic having gone it's course, time restarted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Steven Potter\" Veronica and Lisa said in unison. The two were satisfied from the best threesome they had ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love my lovely ladies as well.\" Steven said caressing Lisa's nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three would continue their lovemaking behind silenced curtains for the rest of the night.</span></div></div>",

A look of concern on his face. \"Everything ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick didn't know why he answered. Maybe it was because Potter was in such a good mood. \"A massive headache if you must know.\" Something told him to be completely honest. \"And my morning wood won't go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded in understanding. \"No Huffelpuff girls to ease your pain?\" Harry enquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my sister Susan.\" For some reason Potter looked queasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I could help you with your problem?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't swing that way.\" Derrick replied immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise that it would be a female who would solve your problems.\" Harry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, where would we meet up at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third floor storage hall, across from the restrooms.\" Harry answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Derrick answered.

Derrick began to recognize the student Potter was turning into. 5th year Slytherin babe Tracy Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last major change was to see Tracy's breasts form. They grew to a sizable C cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPotter waved his wand and his clothes rippled and shifted to something more appropriate for a girl to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.\" Potter said in Tracy's sultry voice. \"Let's take care of your problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick was in shock. When Potter saw he didn't move she took the several steps to him got on her knees and unzipped Derrick's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Potter said. \"It's so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick snapped out of it but before he could stop Potter, he (she) began to suck his hard member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick hissed in pleasure. The fact that he was finally getting relief stopping him from interfering with the Polyjuiced babe at his groin. That had to be what Potter was using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick mentally shrugged. Whatever got him off. That and any other thought was lost as Potter in Tracy Davis's body sucked him to the point of release. Derrick unloaded several bursts of seed into the manufactured girls mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPotter didn't waste a single drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dirty deed was done, Potter smiled. \"Just one more thing to do.\" Tracy's dulcet voice rang in Derrick's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupefy, Obliviate.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The typical Chudley Cannons poster was gone, a set of female clothes were at a pile near his bed, and unwrapped presents were strewn around Dean's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristmas was still several days away and Dean's birthday was in February.

Saying it at a higher pitch then his pleas for mercy moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never hurt Susan or another girl ever again, because you'll be one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pureblood boy could only cry as the changes continued.

His old memories were erased, and to top off the potion effected her clothes. They shifted to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pants uniform became a skirt. Her top and undergarments forming to support her cleavage and cover her crotch.

Just a little queasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reassured her friend, Susan felt a wave of pain wash over her.

Not sure how or why, Hannah could only stare in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was panting from the exhaustion a change like that created. She sat down only for Harry's member to notice a pretty girl. While in mind she was female, currently in body she was male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, as Harry, blushed. Hannah was as well but her eyes was riveted at the monster sitting between.... his legs. Dang the pronouns were going to be weird until this was sorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel?\" Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a guy?\" Susan asked. At Hannah's nod of affirmation he shrugged. \"Stronger, less sensitive in most areas, a little more in others.\" This last part was said looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roommates were the only two to stay at Hogwarts over the Christmas break. As such the two had worn only intimates. The intimates Susan had worn had not survived the transformation and thus had been sitting next to an attractive girl naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! How do I make this go down?\" Susan complained I'm frustration at her first case of a hardon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could help...\" Hannah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure how Hannah could help Susan nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde surprised Susan when her lips immediately enveloped the tip of her, oh bugger; his, dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing new to the experience and his body already being 'ready' it only took Hannah three bobs of her head before Susan exploded her male seed into Hannah's mouth.

She put that from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, that we're all here, it's time for more divination. You've already had your breakfast, and I hope you all remembered to bring you cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sigh from the girl. 'Hermione' she thought her name was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were easier to identify, that coppery hair was a typical Weasley. Both in his dedication to mischief, and lack of attention. The other one, well, everyone knew 'The Boy Who Lived', the scar on his forehead, announced his name before he had the chance to say his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a round a round of chimes, as the students dutifully put their crockery on the tables. As Gryffindors, they were generally hard-working and honest. But there were always exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking a table at random, she headed to the opposite side of the class. She had to restrain herself from blurting out what she saw, instead asking the students to interpret the remaining tea leaves in the bottom of the cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went well, as the students stumbled out their answers, doubts vanished beneath her encouragement. Soon they were more confidently expanding on what they could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSybill turned, and her heart sank, as she saw who was next... who was last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione introduced herself, and even offered an apology for her behaviour from a few years ago for storming out the class. She took and clapped Hermione's hand in consolation, she wasn't going to hold a grudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was why she liked Gryffindor students, although they made mistakes, they would apologise for any harm caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the girl wasn't blessed with the sight, and struggled. Sadly, comfortingly, she shook her head, and told her what was visible to her eyes. It was good. Sybill was glad to see she had a bright future, and her powers and talent lead her onto a great position of power and responsibilty. There was one thing she didn't want to mention,... until it was confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione took the news with grace, and let Sybill move on to Ron's cup. Ron Weasley was a good wizard, or rather could be with work. His second sight was a little hazy, and he added in a couple of guesses to complete what he had seen. She corrected him, and congratulated him on his improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she passed the cup back to him, she watched intently. She wasn't aware she was nodding, but her smile was clear. It was confirmed, even without the tea-leaves, the look exchanged between Ron and Hermione confirmed what she had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was running out for her class, and there was a general murmur building as they became restless. She wasn't sure what she expected to see. Perhaps a boy with Harry's history, all the major events in his life would be behind him. She wasn't even sure of how powerful a wizard he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let him speak, talk her through his reading. He saw change in the future, both wanted and unwanted. When he mentioned anonymity, Sybill was instantly skeptical. She took her first proper look at his tea-leaves. It sounded suspiciously vague and like wish-fulfilment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering deep into Harry's cup, they bumped foreheads. Harry apologised, fell silent and backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSybill saw change and transformation, and anonmity, too. But she saw more... It couldn't be true. She lifted her gaze and scowled at the three of them. She didn't like mockery, seeing the future was always a difficult skill, and she was used to disbelief, and even being called a liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl... -<i>hm</i>- Boy, I won't be mocked in my own class. You've set this up.\" Harry looked blankly back at her, incomprehension clear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you helped.\" she snapped, pointing to Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably put them up to it.\" she said to Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon and Hermione were flabbergasted. They started flapping and denying any plotting or mocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry asked her what she'd seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class ended before she could answer.</span></div></div>",

The complete change in her manner, and speech as she delivered her prophecy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe solid thunk, as the bolt slid into place told the friends, that they were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSybill was never an intimidating figure, but the purposeful way she strode across the room made them sit back, just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew her wand and with a hiss asked her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One chance... and one alone. Is this a prank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was rigid, and her tone severe, despite her scruffy clothes and appearance she was doing a startling impression of Professor Snape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of her wand flickered and sparked with an angry energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's no joke! What's a joke? What did you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that it was Ron who spoke gave it more weight. As she took in his words, the magic dimmed and the light went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a puppet with it's strings cut, Sybill dropped to the floor. She barely managed to stay upright as she landed on a stool. She returned to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steadied her hands, and took up Harry's cup. She peered deep inside, staring intently, with a focus that looked out of place. She'd shake her head, and mutter. But then she'd scowl and look back at the pattern in the base of cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we see a transformation in a reading, it can come in many forms. Not merely a physical one, it can refer to a change in career, or family.\" Sybill spoke clearly, and forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, in this case... Harry you will face a significant change and difficult challenges ahead. You shall experience life on the distaff side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Distaff side?\" Ron asked. Clearly having stopped from just grunting his incomprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione understood, and her cheeks took on a little colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's saying you're going to become female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I say that.\" the professor sniffed.</span></div></div>",

It was only if you looked closer that you could see it was truly wispy and imprecise, and not a defect. Harry couldn't bring himself to answer. As fascination battled fear. As if saying 'yes', saying 'show me', would make it real, make it happen. His lips were dry and stuck together, but he managed a weak nod of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's expression tightened, disapproval bubbling beneath the surface. Judgement looming for the boys' curiosity.

Her eyes immense behind those glasses, her chin resting on Harry's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic crackled from her fingers, as she swept the three of them into one embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's brow furrowed, as an imprecise face started to appear in the mist of the mirror. He felt relief, that even now, he could tell it wasn't a red-head. As the face drew closer it became more detailed. The familiar tawny mess of Harry's mop of hair, before moments later, cascading downwards. A woman's hair clear in the image, Harry swallowed, it was unsettling. He felt Hermione take his hand, give it a comforting squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as she squeezed, the mirror face rippled and rolled.

A spell he'd invented on the spur of the moment. She wasn't sure it would work, but the time delay on the spell would stop Harry from being blamed.

Every moment expecting a scream of outrage and an outstretched figure pointing her out as a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dreams did nothing to calm her, as Ron appeared in her dreams. The dream Ron comforting Ginny grieving the loss of her boyfriend. Harry woke with a start as Ron promised to fill in for his sister.

Oddly, annoying, paining Harry more than his own transformation. Luna Lovegood was jinxed as she tried to intervene brokering peace. The spell knocking her unconscious, the two sides split and left her to eventually be taken to the infirmary. She woke with her her usual airy disposition.

The transfigured wondering how this had escalated so quickly, the former wizards reacting differently than those born witches. Fractures were clear, and painful as many relationships were destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week-end started a special assembly was called for the entire school. Dumbledore scowled down from his lectern. His gaze passing over all the students. Behind him, only two of the four cylinders had any points in them. No trace of Gryffindor red, nor the least trace of green showed for Slytherin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbledore's lips moved as he started chanting a spell. One by one, the other teachers joined in, spreading out wider and wider until the whole head table was repeating the same spell. Harry crossed her fingers hoping that this would end the fight, that this would restore everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a brilliant flash or palest blue, a sphere spread out from Dumbledore's position, spreading and disappearing through the walls. Until the entire castle felt it's effects. A few girls exchanged glances, as if they too were thinking the same as Harry. But nobody lost their new genders, or their unwanted '<i>enhancements</i>'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStiffly, Dumbledore announced that the Big Jugs Jinx would no longer work anywhere on the castle grounds. There would be no further casualties to this spell. That this was no mere prank, and shouldn't be indulged as a joke. His eyes fiery, as he glared at those he suspected/knew to be guilty of casting the spell. There was a pain in his voice, an ache as he continued speaking. The cure for the Big Jugs Jinx hadn't been found or made, and that those affected should expect a long wait. A couple of girls fainted, and many sobbed, as the news sank in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was still unsettled by his visions of the Dark Lord, and the distance that the Headmaster was keeping from him. It was a small act, but he ensured that Hermione and Ron sat together. It made Hermione happy, and perhaps Ron study a little more carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bolt of pink magical energy crackled and flew just beyond his shoulder. It hit Hermione, and rippled over her skin, lighting up her flesh. It roiled over her face, and her hands, sending out an angry spark, as Ron tried to get closer to her. As the sparkling, arcing magic focused, it moved towards Hermione's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same moment, Harry's seat went flying crashing backwards from the table to crack loudly against the heavy oak shelves. He peered through the gap just above the books, where the spell had shot. But he only saw a retreating figure. He raced after it, reaching the main passageway, as the library door thudded shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpotently, belatedly cries, of 'Don't Run.', echoed after the culprit. Harry still hadn't caught a clear look. But he charged through the door. Eyes flashing wildly from the doorway, he spotted a figure as she disappeared into an archway. The length of her dark hair, and the flapping of her skirt marking her as a witch. The beading on her jumper green and grey marking her as a Slytherin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry raced after her. But the stairways were against him, grinding their stony dance at a painfully slow pace. When Harry reached the archway, there wasn't a trace of the witch. His wand glowed with angry power, in his tightening fist. But unable to do more, he returned to the library. He might be able to help Hermione, whatever that spell had done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library door was kicked open, almost smashing Harry's nose in it's violence. But his anger drained away, as he saw Ron half-lifting, half-hiding Hermione from the library. Tears of humiliation flowing freely, but silently, her cheeks were crimson with suppressed rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infirmary.\" Ron hissed impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione merely added a sorrowful nod of agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer distress was obvious. Her blouse was ripped wide every button gone. Only her jumper was stretched to it's limit. Hermione was burdened with two of the largest breasts he'd ever seen. Trying not to stare, he took Hermione's right hand side, to protect her from casual glances as much as possible. Her chest was more mobile, too. Obviously her bra was as destroyed as the blouse. Her jumper clung tautly to her exaggerated figure, even outlining her full nipples, each as ripe and firm as strawberry, the hint of their succulent pinkness teasing through the stretched wool of her jumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the longest walk they'd ever taken to the infirmary. One of the few, when Harry wasn't the patient, too. Harry drew his usual degree of attention as they went. Glances quickly shifting from him to Hermione, then just as quickly away again, or in some cases staring in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame Pomphrey.\" Ron called out loudly, once they reached the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was fuming, he'd decided not to bring the Marauder's Map, or his invisibility cloak. It was only meant to be a simply library visit. But both would have been immensely helpful. For identifying the attacker, and for getting Hermione here, more discretely and with more of her dignity intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was frustrated once again, by the fact it clearly wasn't Draco behind this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting to be invited, Hermione slipped into a bed. Not even bothering to undress, the thick blankets helped disguise the extent of her harm. Finally masking her proud nips from accidental expose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoppy gasped, as she saw Hermione, quickly shooing, the boys away, she pulled the curtains around the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry snorted as Professor McGonagall hurried into the infirmary. Obviously sent by the Headmaster, who probably also knew what had happened, and who'd done it. Harry found himself grinding his teeth, and with an effort relaxed his jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a hurried, whispered exchange beyond the curtain. Before Professor McGonagall came out, to question the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will she be alright?\" Ron snapped impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's left eyebrow shot up in surprise. But she mastered herself, recognising the pain that caused his concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be fine. It's a simple potion to mix up and after a night or two of rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry suspected it wouldn't be that simple, that there's be some potion ingredient missing. That there's be something to delay Hermione's recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Big Jugs Jinx.\" The professor explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a complex brew, but we should have the ingredients to hand.\" Her voice striving to sound convincing and calming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon nodded soberly, \"Can I see her?\" he asked as steadily as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't disturb her.\" Ron quickly assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint smile creased her face, as she nodded and led him to sit quietly by Hermione's bedside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry saw that as his invitation to leave. The first stages of a plan coming to mind. Without saying anything, he headed for the Gryffindor dorm, he'd need the map, and probably the cloak too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was fixated on their entry into the Slytherin common room three years ago. This time he'd need to take the form of a witch, in case he needed into their dorm room. Retrieving the map and cloak, Harry went to the Girls' Toilet, and the hidey-hole with the spare poly-juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took two phials of polyjuice, not wishing to risk turning back too soon. It was a stronger brew, and each dose should last a full two hours, so he should be safe. Flattening the map out, Harry looked for a Slytherin girl who was isolated and vulnerable.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as he'd unfolded the map, and the ink had darkened onto the parchment, Harry started scanning it for familiar Slytherin girls. There were a small coterie of girls who tried to catch Draco's eye, and marry into his name. The plan maybe coming from their parents rather than themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands ran over the dry parchment flattening stiffer folds, until he saw Pansy Parkinson, she was walking on her own. He could have punched the air for joy, when he saw her enter the bathroom. Already tasting the anticipated sweet revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouble checking his pockets for the phials, he quickly refolded the map, patted his wand and wrapped the cloak around himself and disappeared. The halls and corridors were bustling, so he was able to go quickly without worrying about the sound of his feet. He went at a quick walk, just shy of a run taking care not to bump into anyone. A couple of students felt the brush of the cloak as he slipped between milling groups. But it was dismissed as simply a breeze. After all, there was nothing to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only slowed down as he spotted the door to the toilets. Double-checking the map, he ensured she was still alone. Harry sneaked into the Girls' toilets. Pansy was at the bank of sinks, washing her hands and admiring her reflection in the mirror. There was a certain devil-may-care disregard for her looks that Harry half-admired, her hair wasn't as wild.... Ah, but she was a Slytherin, and quite a nasty one too, if rumours were to be believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled on the hem of her cardigan, it tightened over her bust, as the wrinkles disappeared. It hit Harry that in a few moments, that... that would be his bust. His resolve wavered, but his fist tightened around his wand nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stupefy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetrify<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivio</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only the tip of his wand slipping out at the last moment Pansy was taken entirely unaware. As each spell hit her, she was propelled further back, until the last couple just had her back crashing against the cold tiles. Then she slumped to the cold floor like a rag doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her he hid her in a toilet cubicle, sitting her on it, and squeezing in before closing the door behind himself. Ripping a few stray hairs from her head, he dropped a few into each vial. A noxious smell rising as the potions accepted the final ingredient. He'd need her uniform too. He realised uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to wake up, a little disoriented and confused, but importantly with no memory of a magical attack, in about four hours. But otherwise unharmed, he couldn't bring himself to undress an incapable girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, Shit, Shit...\" he growled, until an idea occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottoms Up.\" he toasted the unconscious Pansy before downing one vial in three swift gulps. He choked back the rising feeling of nausea in his throat, not wanting to throw up over her, and equally not wanting to leave the wooden cubicle until he was able to pass as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of his own flesh rippling and rolling as the potion went to work was uncomfortable both mentally and physically, a masculine belching burp, was accompanied by a drop of several inches in height. But it was the next feeling, the sensation of trapped wind that brought the real worry. Harry stomach growled and gurgled, in protest as it shrank. His jumper already untidy now looking baggy enough to fit a tramp who'd lost his self-esteem. Plucking idly at the jumper, he spotted his transformed hands, slender, small and lacking even the sparse black hair that speckled his. The sleeves slid over his spindly arms, allowing him to confirm that only the the softest, and faintest of fair hair were left on his forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely noticed or felt the rapid crack-crack-crack, as his face shifted, his cheekbones rising or his lips getting plumper, even as his tongue ran over them moistening them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\" he muttered quietly, to himself. Even those words were higher, softer, girlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure built and built, until Harry craned his neck backwards eager to loose what would undoubtedly be a wall-shaking belch. But at the last minute the pressure shifted direction. Instead, it headed to his chest and ... and downwards. His... now... Her chest erupted forward, the slack, loose jumper suddenly propelled forward in two unmistakable places. At the same moment, he felt his hips widen, and his ass inflate. Though it gained weight as well, in a worrying manner, too. Only stopping, once the seams started to pop, and clearly outline that Harry was fully a witch, with no trace remaining in his trousers to hide anything. The damned trousers felt like they were cutting her in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trousers were now just too long, and the legs ending in pools around her petite feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vestiti Gemini</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tapped his glowing wand first to Pansy's Uniform, and then to his own. The spell duplicating her clothes, transforming his own to fit. It was like an army of spiders crawling over her skin. An instinctive urge to scratch threatening to overcome her. A squeaking gasp, high, feminine and startled slipped out, until she 'recognised' that her bra was forming. The girls lifting and separating as if they had a mind of their own. They looked larger from this angle, though she tried to dismiss it as unfamiliarity, and imagination. She wanted to tug at the skirt that her trousers had become, the hem rising higher and higher. Revealing more and more of her firm legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same squeaking gasp slipped out a second time, as Harry felt his boring male underwear make the journey in material and shape, becoming a silky thong, one that split her in two, and kept her intimately aware of her new sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing the cloak and the map into her bag. Emerging from the stall, Harry took an involuntary step backwards. A giggle emerging, she'd been startled by her own reflection. Her heart racing she stepped out once more, before closing the slumped Pansy alone in the stall. A swish of her wand, and a soft click as the bolt slid into place would protect her, until she woke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/2/26/Pansyinfobox.png/revision/latest?cb=20141024191624\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/harr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he'd have plenty of time to find out who was behind the outrageous attack on Hermione. Patting the spare vial of polyjuice, she felt her stomach squirm nervously, as she thought about the Slytherin common room, and what she might find there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have a clue what the password was, but hoped to run into a fellow Slytherin, and arrive with them. She snorted, her nostrils flaring cutely, just like before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost skipping, that stopped before she left the bathroom. It didn't suit Pansy's nature, nor did Harry find it terribly comfortable either. As her body felt more mobile than she liked, especially the rhythmic shifting of her bust. Wasn't the bra meant to stop that, also their felt like there was more weight in her hips too. A sideways glance, and a check in the mirror reminded there truly was more weight back there, and a giggle escaped. Only a girl for a few moments, and already she was worried about the size of her bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, she hoped to calm herself, but the swelling of her chest had the opposite effect. Stepping from the toilets, she let the door close behind her. Half expecting everyone to see her, and point 'Harry Potter... Harry Potter's wearing a skirt.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there were no accusing fingers, no curious glances. Indeed she was more invisible than ever the 'Boy Who Lived'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to orient herself, she headed for the dungeons, and the Slytherin common room.</span></div></div>",

Although, it wasn't his first experience with polyjuice. Her body did keep her very aware how different this felt as a girl. The swish of the skirt over her legs. It felt like everyone was looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glances were accompanied by flinches, and tics, and in some cases, with a tightened grip, or a shifted grip on their wand. As the 'Chosen One', she'd never realised how much fear Pansy generated. The other girls looked more nervous, lighter on their feet, as if ready to dodge a spell. While, the student wizards were harder to read. It was a different flavour of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the basement, she found that she too was gripping her own wand tighter, ready to respond.  A realisation was growing on her. Perhaps Hermione's attacker was already slumped unconscious in the toilets. Followed quickly by another thought, if she was behind it, she'd have to be careful in how she phrased her questions, to not reveal her own ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath hissed between her clenched teeth, as she imagined herself being struck with the Big Jugs Jinx. The ache in her shoulders wasn't great, but it was something she wasn't used to, and it was constant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft sound of water dripping, and the clammy chill walls. Her hips felt a mile wide, as her hands slid over her skirt, reflexively smoothing out imaginary wrinkles. The ripple that came from her equally full and round rear, also kept her on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo her shriek of surprise was richer, higher, shriller and girlier, when she felt a resounding pat. The pat followed by the hand coming to rest, and pulling her aside. Her head snapped to the opposite side, as her hip bounced against another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the leering face of Draco Malfoy, who'd pulled her to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... my sweet Pansy.\" His hand patting her bum, appreciating it's padded warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was stunned, he hadn't known that Pansy and Draco were an item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... er... oh Draco. It's so nice to see you.\" you answered a little stiltedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heading to the common room?\" she added, eager to move the chat on from the lovey-dovey stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I've a couple of books to pick up.\" he shrugged, a shy smile on his face. Harry wasn't sure, but it looked like he was also starting to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing the rising bile in her throat, she started her investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear about Hermione...\" she kept her tone snarky, as she mimed a large bust with her hands in front of her own more modest chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's adam's apple bobbed, and his cheeks were now almost crimson. Harry dropped her hands, aware that ferret-boy was imagining her with the immense chest. Or his fascination with Hermione was deeper than he suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not talk about her.\" Draco answered, \"Not when we're breaking new ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wanted to wail in protest, Draco and Pansy weren't a couple. Well, not until now. Now! Now, he thought they were. She struggled to keep her expression neutral, to keep her disguise intact. As she framed a reply, she saw Draco's face heaving towards her like a super-tanker, inevitable and unavoidable, his lips puckered in readiness for a kiss.</span></div></div>",

A state Draco happily mistook for her excitement. Harry however, was finding that her handling had been rather more revealing than she'd thought.

Just perfect.\" Draco complimented her, once more an appreciative swat to her curvy rear underlining his words.

Swallowing nervously, she made her excuses to Draco, and headed for the dorm room. Time perhaps for a girlish confession. She wasn't sure of the cause of Daphne's anger, maybe she fancied the position of Draco's future bride. A sick feeling rose in her throat. Choking down the bile, another thought intruded, perhaps Daphne was behind the 'Big Jugs Jinx'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dangers felt like they were spiralling out of control. A conspiracy, a girly bullying session. Harry recalled the unfortunate first year, and Hermione's difficulty in making friends, even the disastrous overheard conversation between herself...<i> damn it.</i>.. between himself and Ron. She patted the second phial of polyjuice nervously, assuring herself it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping past Daphne, she felt her eyes burn her back as she climbed the spiral stairs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her stomach grumbled hungrily in protest, as it too collapsed inwards. Once more the weight headed to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was helpless, as Daphne sauntered over to her bed. Her fingers unbuttoning her blouse, and in a few moments had it slipped off. Harry couldn't even resist as she heard the zipper being lowered on her skirt. Or fight to hold it in place, as Daphne slipped it off, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest rolled ominously, each rippling wobble threatening to smother her. Each full breast, each one bigger than her head. Limply she found a degree of control returning, as one arm flopped leadenly to cover her chest.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Squeezing herself into a blouse, Harry could only fasten the top two buttons before the swell of her bust made the rest impossible. She didn't notice when Daphne left the dorm room. Thankfully, she was able to slip on a skirt without any bother. She had to pull on a jumper to have any attempt at modesty, any attempt at looking like she was in uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jumper stretched and stretched as she pulled it over her immense titties. The fabric thinning as it did, her blouse was visible through the material, even the gap showing her expanded bra beneath. But she knew she couldn't remain in the dorm room, or the Slytherin common room. The polyjuice ensured that, she couldn't just cower like she wanted, she had to pass through the school her humiliation visible to all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite tugging at the hem of the school jumper, her midriff was still on display. A clear gap showing her cute belly button piercing. Harry raced down the stairs, well, the first few, until her jiggling bust threatened to throw her tumbling forward the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nModerating her pace, Harry found the rhythm that didn't cause her to speed up, or make her bust any more eye-catching. Entering the common room, Draco was still basking in the glory of his introduction, standing near the fire-place Daphne smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving across the common room, as quietly and unobtrusively as possible. Her dancing bust caught Draco's attention. But with a crowd around him, he didn't attempt to break free. Assuming instead, that she'd made a mistake, or was trawling for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to be free of the common room, Harry looked around the dungeon, uncertain about where to go. She was sure this curse would vanish when the poly-juice potion ended, at least, she sincerely hoped so. The infirmary was tempting, with Hermione there to share her pain. Though judging from Daphne's taunts, there weren't any cures from that direction. Biting her lower lip, she thought of the stupified Pansy in the toilet stall. A snarl flashed across her face, this... this damned bust was meant to be hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like it was time for Karma to play a role, patting her bag, Harry ensured she still had the spare polyjuice potion in her bag. Plucking a hair from her own head, she added it to the bubbling mix as she walked back to the toilets. Surely, if Pansy drank this, she'd end up in a jinxed form of her own body. The one that Harry was currently wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt bizarrely like her... no, his... first year. Every eye on her, as she passed. This time though nobody was looking at his face, scanning for the scar. This time, every one was distracted by her chest. It's fluid, constant movement. Either in fascination, or horror and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she made it to the privacy of the girls toilets, and with a quick <b>alohamora</b>, she opened the cubicle with the frozen Pansy inside. Stepping inside, she locked the door behind her, and carefully poured the potion into the sleeping girl's mouth. Massaging her throat, Pansy swallowed it without any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven asleep, her face contorted reflexively at the vile taste. A couple of burps, belches and farts announced it was starting it's work. She watched for a moment, as Pansy's chest started to swell. Just as Harry was about to leave her to finish the transformation, she heard the chatter of two girls entering the toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to keep the cursing to herself. It would be impossible to re-close the cubicle behind her, with others in the toilets. So she had to wait out the visitors, as they chatted and washed. Checking her bare wrist, Harry started to worry how much longer the polyjuice was going to last, both for himself, and the newly administered Pansy. At the back of her mind, she didn't want to think about how long the original stupefy spell was going to last, and if the chattering would wake her.</span></div></div>",

The range is unlimited in this case. The drinker can still see through and control his own body in both cases. <br>\r\n2.

He didn't know what to expect, and was very shocked to see himself as if in a mirror. Another noticeable thing was the slight breeze between one set of legs, while the other set was still secure in the jeans Harry decided to wear this morning. Harry experimented a bit with the separately moving of his two bodies he quickly became used to the fact that he was in two spots at once. Only then did he decide to look down and see that, indeed, he is now also a she. Quickly shrugging off the robes that Daphne was wearing over her blouse and skirt, he as Daphne tried to squeeze his new found breasts with his hands. Since Daphne is a proper lady who doesn't risk her safety to leave her breasts hanging around Harry attempted to unhook his bra as Daphne; which failed, until he realized that he has another body ready to be used for this kind of thing! As he undid the buttons of the blouse she was wearing, and as Daphne he slid down her skirt he was left standing in only his knickers, while his nipples hardened from the cold air in the dungeons. As his fingers started sliding south he remembered that he has a mission to complete, namely to find out who has cursed Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will he do next?</span></div></div>",

Daphne asked, while Harry gave it to her, because he was curious as well. So, what made you leave my body in the middle of a corridor, Daphne asked Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I was just reading that book -you should try doing that a lot more Potter, you might actually learn something- when suddenly I was forced out of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, can you try getting inside my body again, and leaving straight after?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, but I don't know how (or even that you could at all) to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the opposite of when entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell. Here goes nothing then. As Harry said that he tried to take her over again, did a few stretches as Daphne which made her boobs jingle and attempted to leave the body again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so I am guessing that works?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment two Hufflepuffs entered the corridor, and with a look from Daphne Harry quickly controlled both Susan Bones and Hannah Abbott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry quickly noted that Susan boobs are a lot bigger than Hannah's, and also bigger than Daphne's, although he didn't dare to feel himself up with Daphne standing right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it does still work, and works on different persons as well, it's just the range then, Daphne mused. Say Harry, could you three walk me back to the room I used?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought Slytherins knew all of the secrets of the dungeons? Harry as Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need you three to see what went wrong, duh. Also, when did you take the potion? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh, just over an hour ago, Harry quickly confirmed using the tempus charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, that's weird, it should've stopped at the one hour mark on the dot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I don't know, but I do know that we're here again, Harry stated to Daphne just as Hannah opened the door.</span></div></div>",

But the distance had grown a meter since he had begun to use first years as testers of the potions range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a new development was beginning to form. He currently controlled Twenty seven Slytherin's minds. Their memories were his. He could delete, copy, switch, or reorganize the memories as he saw fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne was the only one he had to worry about. Sifting through her memories, he erased all memories about the metamorphosis potion, or the mind control potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to erase the memories of Daphne Greengrass from everyone's mind currently in the room.

It would be a waste not to use it, especially given the proficiency of the man who added all the notes in the margins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a list of ingredients given at the end of the chapter on transformation. A chapter that Harry had studied rather closely after the experiment with polyjuice and their time as Crabbe and Goyle....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one was simpler to prepare, and promised to work it's magic on the subject's clothes as well as their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had just read 'The Lord of the Rings', after his misadventures during the incident with the Goblet, and partly as a reference to that, he'd asked her for a lock of her hair as a memento.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't planned anything beyond that, and intended is simply as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his fingers trembled as he held a single hair above the test-tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he was deciding whether or not to go ahead, it slipped from his fingers, and dropped into the waiting potion. A small puff of white told Harry the ingredients had already mixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wondered if the clothes would be based on what she'd been wearing when she'd cut the lock from her head, or maybe what she was wearing when he drank the potion. In either case, it was certain his clothes would transform, as she certainly wouldn't be wearing the boys Gryffindor uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he worried himself into not taking the potion. He raised it to his lips, and quickly swallowed the contents. It tasted of freshly picked mint, and as Harry felt it go to work, he told himself that one way or another it would be over in an hour, and he'd be back to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muscles started to twich and spasm as his body changed. Falling backwards, he drummed his feet on the toilet floor, as Myrtle floated above him, circling slowly, watching curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world faded to black, as the potion went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Harry woke, he... she punched the air with joy. Her arm much skinnier and covered in the pale powder blue of Beauxbatons. As she sat up, she felt an unusual weight on her head. Instinctively her hand went up and discovered the loose tendrils poking out from beneath her cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131005092301/harrypotter/pl/images/8/83/Wyglad_fleur.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry wants to be a girl...\" Myrtle circled above the smiling student. She started to sing her words, as she giggled at the flustered Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to hush her, he didn't want this spreading around the school. The thought of Malfoy hearing send a shudder down her spine. But if he could keep her occupied for an hour, then it would just be another bizarre Harry Potter story... and hopefully dismissed.</span></div></div>",

Instead shrugging away his own question. This was a bathroom, so there were plenty of mirrors. It was odd, to look at your reflection and have a stranger look back. His body is incredibly attractive, and Harry starts to pose in front of the mirror. Making pouty, sexual faces..., glancing backwards over one shoulder at her reflection. She takes in her ass, and gives an impersonal nod of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrtle is back to her curious, quizzical expression.

She couldn't spot a single flaw in the copy. Her face was perfect. An idle thought wandered through. It was a shame there were no cosmetics to enhance her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Harry found himself becoming aroused, looking so intently at a beautiful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was unfamiliar with the body, but she felt restless, her hands eager to be busy. Her body was becoming aroused too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection winked back encouragingly at Harry. Had he done that... He wasn't sure.... He must have... mustn't he?</span></div></div>",

He couldn't just make wild accusations, without appearing mad or malicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one way to gather more evidence, and that was to visit the Slytherin common room. He'd managed to get a stray hair from Pansy Parkinson. It would feel odd being inside a girl's skin, he thought. The upside would be he... she'd be able to ask Draco questions without raising suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment she was at Hogsmeade, and should be away for the rest of the day. So Harry felt now was the time to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why he was secretly brewing polyjuice potion. He hid it from Ron and Hermione, because he knew the reaction... well the reactions they'd both have if he told them what he'd overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis previous visit had confirmed the idea that neither Crabbe nor Goyle were given to questions or curiosity. Besides he was more likely to open up to Pansy. Although he hid his feelings, Draco craved Pansy's attention. That was something Harry could understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't demure or as smart as Hermione, but she did possess a gruff self-confidence, and judging from her marks on the notice board she was intelligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped the hair into the polyjuice potion, and with a small -whuff- and pale cloud, the ingredients mixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry hid in a cubicle and slid the bolt across. It was cramped, but he didn't want to risk being discovered with a Slytherin uniform... a girls' Slytherin uniform....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully he undressed and put his Gryffindor clothes to the side. Before he could change his mind, he raised it to his lips and quickly swallowed the contents. They tasted bitter, but not unpleasant. Like a strong herb... Harry was trying to work out which one, as a strand of hair fell across his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic continued to work, and soon he felt his face shifting and contorting. Touching his lips, they felt massive and the hair felt like an unwieldy cascade. He tried not to think of the other changes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the weight built on his chest, his hands came forward instinctively and cupped the swelling breasts. He had to restrain himself from reaching lower, and with a gasp he felt his ass expand to a more feminine swell. It was a high pitched gasp, and she stepped away from the chill marble of the partition... the cause of her gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt the magic fade, she quickly got dressed, and ready to face the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill tugging at the unfamiliar underwear, Harry left the cubicle. It pinched and pulled at her shoulders, but Harry went to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110901153320/harrypotter/fr/images/e/e8/PromoHP7_Pansy_Parkinson.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was impressive, and Harry tugged at her uniform, she only had a limited time until the polyjuice wore off.</span></div></div>",

It was hard to tell with the cloth covering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just wanted a quick look at his family. Telling himself, he had kept his promise to Dumbledore... He hadn't sought it out... But when it was near enough to touch, Harry sighed... it was a different mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the dust sheet away, it slid down the glass and slithered onto the floor, forming a loose pile around Harry's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was writing around the frame of the mirror, and Harry ran his fingers over them just enjoying the texture. When he looked at his reflection he was disappointed. It was simply himself, and the rather unkempt room behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting this way and that, he tried to see any magical qualities in the glass. It was only when he leaned in close, to examine his face that he saw anything. The scar was still there... the glasses were still there... but... his in the mirror his hair was tidier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood back upright as he tried to work out the purpose of the mirror. Was it meant to flatter the owner... or to inspire them to better present themselves... or was it instructing him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Hermione would be better able to work out it's purpose, or Ron would see something different. In either case, Harry wanted to consult with his friends, if he found this room again... and if he didn't no harm done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry almost stumbled into the mirror with his feet caught in the dustcloth at his feet. But found his balance before the worst happened. He shook his head at his reflection and carefully stepped out of the tangled cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the reflection was different... again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he hadn't shaken his head he might not have noticed. His reflection had longer hair, it was just short of his shoulders, and even as he looked it took on a tidier aspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting from a chestnut mess, reminding him vaguely of a lion's mane. It shifted into a tidier curls... similar to Hermione's but shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand over his head, he confirmed that the reflection wasn't real. It looked realistic, but Harry's hair simply wasn't that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly it was starting to freak Harry out. The changes ... and not knowing the nature of the mirror ... well ... both brought their concerns. The mirror could be a Slytherin artifact... But Harry didn't want to just flee because he was afraid. That wasn't a Gryffindor characteristic. Courage was feeling the fear and still doing the right thing...

The scar that had marked him, that had defined him as 'The Chosen One', it was ... it was fading. Harry ran his pinky over it. In the real world it was still there, only his reflection in the mirror world lacked that curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his focus out wider, he spotted that his whole face looked cuter now. His nose just a little smaller, a little more refined. He was feeling worried in his distracted state, his reflection now had hair that fell past his shoulders. The styling was more elegant, and clearly belonged on a girl... on a woman. It would have looked incredible framing Ginny's face, either in her natural copper colouring or in this rich chestnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he mused about what was happening, Harry saw his reflection with fresh eyes. It looked more androgynous now. Even as that thought entered Harry's mind, his mirror lips plumped up, and took on extra colour. It changed his whole look, it brought out how high and defined his cheekbones were. With a snort Harry recalled an overheard conversation, when he'd been wearing his invisibility cloak. Apparently, high, well-defined cheekbones were incredibly desirable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the evidence of his own eyes, Harry couldn't help but agree. In the mirror there wasn't a cute girl looking back, it was a beautiful woman. Harry caressed his cheek with the back of his hand the entrancing image looked so much more attractive, as she mirrored his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping Harry stumbled backwards a step, he took in not just the face, but the whole of the mirror. Pouting back at him from the mirror was a divine beauty. The Gryffindor lion on her jumper hinting at the gentle swell of her breasts. Harry's right hand went to cup one breast, only to find nothing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis left hand slid lower, towards his trousers... her mirror skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was still intact.

Over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Harry's feet had become entangled in the cloth. He lost his balance and crashed towards the mirror. He yelped as he felt his ass hit the mirror. Everything tilted wildly as the wooden frame creaked. With a wooden -crack- the hinge broke, and Harry and the mirror crashed ass backwards onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Harry it happened in slow motion. Like a dizzying out of body experience. As he fell, the world stopped moving, and time reversed. Before his eyes, he saw himself walking backwards out of the room. His sense of balance told him he was still falling. But his view unwound further into the past, to the first meal in the Grand Hall. That flickered away in an instant, and Harry saw himself at the Train station trying desperately to figure out how to get to Platform 9 3/4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene flickered again, and he was in a dark, dank room. Spotting a friendly face, he wanted to weep for joy. But no words came out his lips. He was simply a mute passenger on his journey into the past. Unable to express himself, as Hagrid said, \"You're a Wizard, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faded outline of the real world intruded into Harry vision, as the scene shifted again. This time, to one of Dudley's birthdays, there were five candles on the cake, and as Harry caught his reflection, the misery was already as clear on his face, as his youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flurry of owls, as the scene shifted. Harry was wrapped up, warm and cosy. He looked up into the massive face of Albus Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall. Behind them, towering over them, Hagrid his face wet with tears...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead...\", he sobbed, blowing his nose loudly on his handkerchief. It looked big enough to be a towel, or even a blanket at his own diminutive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out one tiny hand, to try to hold onto the headmaster, but he just scraped his pudgy digits over Dumbledore's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the scene shifted again, Harry knew there wasn't long to go. Either he'd simply vanish, or be forced to face his own nightmare memories. Even as the realisation struck, he found himself sitting in a crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take them, Lily... Take them and run...\" he felt his throat tighten at the sound of his father's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the door, there was sickening green flash, and a  scream. A death scream. Harry knew his father was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily entered, her hair was wild, and her eyes glittering green and fired with passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something was off, something was different. His crib was in the wrong place, when he looked over to where it was meant to be, he saw it. There was another crib there. An identical infant sat in his pale blue romper suit, he was crying at the noise. He was still struggling to work out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent into the crib, and picking him up she hugged him to her chest. \"He'll never harm you.... he'll never harm either of you.\" she swore with passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Voldemort was already behind her, his wand pointing steadily into her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avada Kadavra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSickly green lightning shot forth, and rippled and roared around their hugging bodies. With a shriek, Lily and Harry Potter died in each other's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Voldemort tried to pull his wand back, it resisted. The vile green lightning leapt from their bodies, and wrapped itself around the Dark Lord. It was his turn to shriek in pain and denial, as the magic backfired and killed him utterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the crib bars, Harry watched still unsure what was happening, still not sure if this was a dream, a nightmare or the actual events... and why they were now different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still in shock, as Hagrid crashed into the room. Literally shattering the frame, as he entered the room. His face fell, as he saw the bodies on the floor. His foot crashed down into the corpse of Voldemort, turning his broken spine to dust. Hagrid's anger fled, and his tenderness returned, as he examined Lily and Harry. But it was already too late. Their lives were extinguished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wail ripped itself from Harry's lung, he felt his powerlessness vanish, and a cry rip from his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid heard it, and a smile split his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep you safe.... At least, I can keep you safe, little Harriet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt himself being lifted in powerful, but tender hands, safe and secure. He was carried to Hagrid's bike. With a kick, the engine started, and they were airborne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flickered, and the scene shifted. He was back on the Dursley's doorstep, still wrapped in the blanket, and his romper suit. Hagrid was sobbing, McGonagall's eyes were wet with tears, and the Headmaster was struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was already dead.\" his voice was distant and cold, \"Voldemort was already dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ... I couldn't save them... I tried...\" Hagrid's voice quavered and broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took time to gather his thoughts. His mouth opened and closed several times, but no words came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Dumbledore put a steadying hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved Harriet... You saved her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her?\" Harry thought. He wasn't able to check. Time flickered, and the scene shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Dudley's ninth birthday, and Harriet was passing him a simple present in a white box with a pink ribbon. \"Oh Shit.\" was the thought racing through her head, as Dudley snatched it from her open hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flickered and flashed, Harry barely noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil with a crash, Harry returned to the here and now. Sitting up, she saw Hermione leaning in to offer her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Harriet, just make sure you don't cut yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending his hand, Harry saw that once again Hermione was right. <b>His </b>hand was <b>her </b>hand. Slender and feminine, it disappeared into the frilly cuffs of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, she gave a shimmy to shake loose the shards of mirror she felt sticking to the back of her uniform.</span></div></div>",

As Harriet watched, the small tears and rents in the fabric pulled together and repaired themselves at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet took a quick mental observation of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corner of her lips quirked up, '<i>herself</i>', that felt <i>odd</i>... no, <i>not odd</i>, just different.

Freed from a burden, she'd never realised she'd been carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet determined that she'd at least enjoy today, even if she did decide to return to her real world.

She tried to wriggle free, but that was fruitless, and just made her nipples graze against the firmness of Ron's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrendering to the inevitable, she felt a growing sense of rightness, even more so when Hermione joined in wrapping her arms around both Ron and Harriet.

However, it lacked the emotional weight of her new memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arguments.\" Hermione snapped. She put one arm around Harriet, from the left, as Ron supported her from the other side. Together they carried her to the infirmary and Madame Pomfrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waves of new memories slowed, Harriet recalled that she was still the youngest seeker for Gryffindor, and taking after her father made her feel warm inside. She hoped she grew to be as compassionate and kind as her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three caused a commotion as they carried Harriet through the school. There weren't many students in the halls, the sound of parties breaking out from various closed door, as the Wizarding world celebrated the utter defeat of the Dark Lord. But whenever they did pass someone, they left a trail of goggling faces in their wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in her less than coherent state, Harriet still noticed that the boys reacted rather differently than the girls. She -<i>damn it</i>- He was used to furtive glances, and whispered comments everywhere he went. But this... this was different. She felt their eyes undressing her, judging her dimensions, comparing her to other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls looks just as intently, although their faces held different judgements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure... it was all so strange... But she thought she liked it.</span></div></div>",

He rummages through until he finds what he was looking for. He finds a cloak, and slides it into place. Stealing another glance, he's still alone, he spots a mirror and goes over to check out his reflection. The cloak is a little tight on his shoulders, but it's a base impulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs his fingers over the silver and green serpent embossed on the edge of cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions he'd asked himself as he thought about the Sorting Hat. He knew he was in the right house, but that didn't satisfy him entirely. Perhaps as a Slytherin, he'd be more able to vanquish Voldemort.... or as a Ravenclaw, he'd have found a wiser solution to the return of the Dark Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled at his absent minded gestures, Harry snatched his fingers away from the serpent.

From the Slug Club. There was a Slytherin girl there with that name. This was probably her mother's cloak. She looked to be a bit of cold fish. But he'd thought the same of Hermione at first. Besides she was well spoken and held her own in any discussions at the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore came back to Harry as he thought about the club and Hestia. She'd had a twin sister... F..-something... Flora. That was it Flora. Wouldn't he still be himself, if he were in Slytherin. If he were friends with the Carrow's rather than the Weasley. Surely a house couldn't change a person. Harry didn't want to dismiss all Slytherin, just because Draco was a .... Draco was Draco. A pipsqueak upstart with delusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising he'd almost walked into the mirror. He drew himself up to his full height and struck a Slytherin-y pose.

He recalled Hermione nudging him, telling him not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a beautiful girl, and as Harry absently brushes his hair aside, he spots his reflection has the same scar. The pensive look is familiar too. He wasn't sure what to think when he thought again about finding herself beautiful.

Perhaps a world where he'd been born a girl, a world where he'd been slow to object when the Sorting Hat had suggested Slytherin as his... -<i>er</i>- her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry scowled at his reflection, maybe he was blaming the wrong thing. It might be the cloak that was enchanted, he might truly be female, and it's only his memories that tell him what he expects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, if it were dangerous then Dumbledore would have kept it's location more secure or destroyed the item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided the quickest way to settle his nerves was like ripping off a plaster, or facing cold water. Slapping his hand flat onto the glass, the frame rocked with the force of the blow, giving him a glimpse of the ceiling as it almost fell over backwards. But it's weight pulled it back forwards, and gave his hand a slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe high-fived his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when things became weird. Harry felt his fingers become wrapped in those of his reflection. Instantly his gaze shot to his hand, semi-transparent fingers were woven around his own. They were more slender than his, and the nails were glazed in glossy crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to break free, twist his hand loose. There was a wrenching, and Harry was pulled forward. His hand vanished beneath the surface of the glass. His reflections face was twisted in victory. Her face a grinning mask. Her hand vanishing at the same point. But you still felt her fingers woven together with yours. A second chilly hand gripped your forearm, and Harry was wrenched forward again. This time up to his shoulder. He scrabbled to break free, flailing wildly afraid to grab the frame with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a firm grip, Harry was powerless to resist, with a final pull. Harry stumbled across the threshold of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill raced across his skin as he passed. But that was nothing compared to his other shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back out the mirror, Harry saw his body blowing him a kiss before turning and walking away. Harry tried to follow, but the glass was simply a wall to him. Beating his fist on the glass had no effect. Harry watched as he spoke some words, at least his lips moved, but he heard nothing emerge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt his chest shift as he battered again and again against the barrier. Looking down, Harry spotted that now he was female. Not overly endowed like the witches in Ron's Magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Harry did fantasise about some of them in 'the Golden Snatch'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching slimmer hands downwards, Harry confirmed that she was fully female. She recoiled when she did confirm it. Her hands flying away like they'd received an electric shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around to examine her mirror universe.</span></div></div>",

Flipping his hand up to his shoulder, the girl in the glass tosses her hair back off her shoulder and out of the way. But Harry's hand met no obstruction, felt no tickling caress of long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing away from the mirror, he double-checked his own body. It was still the same, the same Gryffindor jumper beneath the Ravenclaw cloak. the same boys jumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously he took a step closer to the mirror. His eyes searching for something to explain the mirror's magic. Just to look more closely, to check for an engraving around the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDizzyingly, the surface of the mirror rippled, slowly like a deep lake. As the mirror resettled, Harry stood still eager to find any changes. However, it looked like the same girl looking back out. She looked to be in her third year... or thereabouts. Rather a pretty girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another step forward, he was almost at the mirror. Again it rippled, and again Harry stopped, to see what changed. A gorgeous fifth? year girl was reflected back. Her face, refined, her lips full, her nose petite. Turning sideways, Harry admired the curves... Their size, nice without being too obvious... yet still firm and full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden, the comparison sprang to mind. She was more beautiful than Cho Chang, her face, her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling sideways, the last half-step until he was almost pressing against the mirror. It rippled once more, the girl had to be in her final year. An elegance in how she wore the uniform, a confidence in her pose. She was as tall as Harry, her long hair now long straight and smooth. The little girl vanished, only the woman remained. Harry smiled in pleasure, she truly was a beauty. Naturally enough, she smiled back, those full perfect lips spreading to reveal perfect white teeth. Her high cheek bones shown to their best by simple act of smiling.</span></div></div>",

As he stroked the soft fabric of the box, he saw it lacked the chain of a necklace, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain flared, from his scar, as his fingers brushed over the engraved writing of the crown... tiara?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching his hand back, he suppressed the idea of slapping it to the floor.

Until he found a thickly padded wing-back chair. It reminded him of the ones in the common room, though a little the worse for wear. Settling down, Harry was glad for a little privacy, peace and quiet. Free from the different demands placed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a book, from his back, he gave a small snort, as 'Advanced Potion Making' came out.

He didn't want to lose his reputation in Potions, or the chance to impress him, any leverage that could help him retrieve that memory needed to be exploited. He wasn't sure he convinced himself, but it did no harm either. He knew the book wasn't imbued with any menace itself. A test he hated to admit he was reluctant to perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, both Hermione and Ginny, were finally convinced. The pages crackled dryly as he turned them. His attention caught, by an arcane swirl on the previous page. He recognised it as a wand gesture, and beneath it. <b>Pectore cresce</b>, was the incantation, and beneath it, <i>for enemies (witches)</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe murmured to himself, once more Hermione's suggestion, that somehow, the Prince was female. Was this a spell, only a witch could cast, or was the target only to be a witch. Wandless his finger traced the path through the air, the spell unspoken as his lips moved silently. Perhaps, it was a weaker spell, like Sectumsempra, but somehow gentler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted, Harry glanced at his wrist. The old analogue watch, a replacement to his digital one. A cheap Casio, a present from the Dursleys one Christmas. The best present he'd ever received, until he saw it had come free with some breakfast cereal. Alas, digital watches and magic didn't mix, and he'd bought something more reliable from Diagon Alley. It's face aged yellow, and with two other smaller dials at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock, with the phases of the moon, the other being a tiny orrery, with the position of the planets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost time for his next class, easing himself up from the chair with a groan and a sigh, Harry headed off.</span></div></div>",

It made the shadows deeper, the darkness blacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only a dream.... It's only a dream....\" he kept muttering under his breath. His recollection was fuzzy, but the last thing he could think of was being in the castle. Whatever he was thinking.... wherever his mind was, physically he was in the castle. Harry tried to picture himself slumped on the floor... tried to imagine himself getting to his feet... tried to imagine waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise startled him, and he whirled around. The shadows danced and flickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harrrry ... Pottter...\" the voice hissed. It sent a shiver down his spine.

All alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's lip curled up in contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not alone.\" the voice continued with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething made him look upwards... It was a chilling sight, there were dementors circling above... He felt his soul grow colder, grow harder. He felt the fear of losing his Godfather afresh... he remembered losing Sirius in the ministry. Despair grew, hopelessness threatened to overpower him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light flickered at the tip of his wand as his grip loosened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surrender... Just surrender... and let the pain end... let it all end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words, the sentiment were still from the Dark Lord, but Harry felt more swayed by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of Ron and Hermione... Perhaps without him they wouldn't be targeted. He felt hope swell, as he realised that even if they weren't beside him physically, his friends hadn't abandoned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Expecto Patronum!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flurry of white sparks, but it faded into the dark. Harry refused to surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>EXPECTO PATRONUM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the light shot from the tip, and the stag formed proudly it pranced around Harry. His very presence illuminating the enclosed glade more than his previous spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chanced another glance upwards, the dementors were still circling, but not descending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a serpentine laughter, and Harry felt his head being wrenched. A shriek was ripped from his throat. Ahead of him, a cloaked figure was fighting his patronus. There was a flash of pale skin. The hands gripped the antlers, and Harry felt the pain rip across his temple. Not merely focused on his scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a shower of sparks, the antlers detached. His knees gave out, and he fell to the mossy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear... oh deer-y deer-y me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest faded, and the voice faded, as Harry felt the cold smooth stone of the castle floor reassert itself.</span></div></div>",

In his first year, he'd found the Mirror of Erised, and that had made him always want to find more of the castles secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA place as old as this, with it's history, and it's predecessors made him take a deep breath as if he could inhale their memory their deeds. He wanted to find what had made his father an animagus. Professor McGonagall always insisted that it was a rare skill, but the fact that James, Sirius and even Peter Pettigrew... were all animagi. Well, it just seemed as if there was more at play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to quiz Hagrid for clues, without giving away too much himself. He'd never come out and asked directly, although asking the Head of house didn't seem especially suspicious. So he liked to probe Minerva as much as he could. As the only animagus in the school (or at least the only registered one), he tried to be as flattering as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe liked to suggest that Dumbledore was an animagus, and ask what his form was, what his patronus was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lost in thought as he walked. It wasn't a corridor that was immediately familiar, but sometimes that was the way of it. Rounding a corner, he spotted Ron standing outside a door. There was something very odd, furtive about his behaviour, that stopped him from calling out to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped back around the corner, and pulled out his cloak. It slid into place, and with a shimmer he was invisible. Harry was free to observe Ron's odd manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a look out... Glancing worriedly up and down at the least noise, even an unexpected breeze was enough to make Ron start to sweat and look unsettled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA number of unpleasant ideas surface, a Slytherin curse or some kind of controlling geas. But as George and Fred burst out of the door, the reason became clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a prank afoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge and Fred high fived each other, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll never discover it... until it's too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's eyes darted between his brothers, clearly he wasn't in on the plan, as he listened intently for snippets of information, clues as to the prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Slytherin's will have a fun practice.\" George said before giving a ludicrously camp wink to his brother.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Harry padded down the corridor his senses were peaked. There was a muted boom, followed by a hiss and a scattering of shouts. He looked around anxiously, his invisibility cloak would be no protection if a horde of students came barrelling down the passageway. There was a huff of escaping gas, and Harry spotted a flare of emerald smoke jetting out from behind a portrait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather flustered looking old man. He was posed in a chair, but he kept trying to look behind his own frame. Harry backed against the opposite wall. The frame of the picture juddered, more gas burst out, the ornate frame making it dance in billowing patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cries became louder... closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt fell into place. Harry recognised the picture.... recognised the location. This was an entrance to the Slytherin common room. With a crash the frame gave a crack, and the picture swung aside. Out from the green smoke strode the students. Some covering their mouths, others just coughing, promising vengeance between rasping breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wanted to help, this seemed a cruel prank. But he stopped, revealing himself like this would make him look like the prankster. He knew there wasn't much love for him in that particular house. Harry covered his mouth, as more students came out. They milled around, and Harry was careful to avoid getting too close, to risk bumping into anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something else that was a little odd about it. All of the Slytherin students were female. He wondered if there was a meeting for the Slytherin girls, or whether this was the Weasley's target. Until he spotted a certain platinum blonde girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked particularly upset, and offended. There was a snarl on her face, and an overbearing manner that shouted that this girl was Draco Malfoy. There was also the fact that she was drowning in a poorly fitting boys uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glad to be covering his mouth, otherwise a harsh burst of laughter would have given him away. Harry looked closer, there was more than one girl in the wrong uniform. However, that was already altering. Hogwarts had a very strict dress code. A very strict dress code that was magically enforced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Harry's eyes, Draco's trouser legs pulled up, retreating up his legs, revealing first bare ankles and soon an elegant knee. As it rose the fabric stitched itself together. He tugged at the hem, in a futile battle for dignity. The uniform showed no mercy, and soon Draco was appropriately dressed in the Slytherin girls uniform. Or so Harry thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a high yelp, and a flurry of hands. Draco fought against the bra that was forming beneath her shirt turned blouse. It lifted the girls, and gave her the support and separation that she hated needing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite knowing who she was, Harry still found her attractive. Her face a challenging pout, rather than a spiteful scowl. Her nose and mouth petite and delicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls scowled as she realised something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. You know the rules. We still have to attend classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" There was soon a chorus of unhappy muttering, some wanted to deny it, but others harder to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry recognised Pansy Parkinson, and she looked to be in her element. She goosed the arse of the new girls, each squawk making her smile wider, bearing more teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... NO\" Draco's denial was high and girlish. \"But... But... I've got Quidditch Practice.\" he moaned. She went pale... paler even than her normal skin tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Do you consider being a girl, a punishment.\" Pansy said, sneaking up behind Draco. She snaked one arm around the new girl's waist, rather low on her hip. She leaned in a licked Draco's earlobe.</span></div></div>",

She looked scared, when another student bumped into her and her bust gave a gentle shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the cloak, Harry suppressed a cough. But another followed straight away. It was time to leave. The noise of his coughing was lost amongst all the other coughs and gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point Harry realised he'd over-stayed his welcome. His fist looked smaller than he expected, but worse than that his fingernails were topped with a glossy crimson coat of polish. Looking down towards his feet, the smoke was clearly billowing about the base of his cloak, and while invisible it was no barrier to the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry darted between the spluttering Slytherins, as he darted towards the end of the corridor, and away from the transformative effects of the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went, he started to notice other effects from his exposure. There was a growing jiggle from Harry's chest as he moved. He was afraid to remove the cloak now, and reveal his rapidly changing body. His messy mop of hair, was streaming downwards over his narrowing shoulders, the fringe falling across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe material of the cloak was also reacting to contact with the gas. Lilac and mauve sparks and twinkles lit up the inside of the cloak, like flickering Christmas lights, or a badly wired appliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA breeze tickled Harry's ankles as he sped down another passageway. This was the start of the change of uniform. He also felt his shirt shifting, it was becoming softer and smoother. His hand darted to his mouth, as Harry felt his socks transform, stretching thinner and thinner, as they worked their way up his legs. His heart was beating wildly as he tried to control his panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he still a he... Harry's hands darted to his crotch... or rather her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands discovered that Harry was now a member in good standing of the fairer sex. The pressure of her hands meant that Harry felt the cool embrace of satin panties, beneath her uniform. The uniform that was now approaching it's final changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult, but Harry felt a degree of empathy for Draco as she felt her own bra forming. The material darting over her shoulders, becoming steadily thicker and firmer. Soon there was a growing weight as the cups cradled and supported her bosom. The angle was unfamiliar and unsettling, but they looked massive to Harry's disbelieving eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had to slow her pace, as her shoes now had a small heel, and clicked on the stones until she slowed down and moved at a more sedate pace.</span></div></div>",

Sitting down opposite the doors to the toilets, she waited under the cloak. Already she was sure that she had a rather significant ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a snort, a girl for less than an hour, and already thinking about how big her ass is. Harry was happy when nobody came out or entered the toilets. In fact, nobody had even walked down the corridor while Harry had sat and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer centre of balance was different, and kept her aware of the changes. Beneath the cloak, the light was diffuse and poor, but her bust was clear. Besides, her hands had already confirmed that she was the newest female student in Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, this was starting to look like a good place to wait out the effects of the Weasley gas. A last glance to either side, she strode across the hall, and entered the toilets. Or would have hadn't the magic kept her out. The door flared a brilliant blue, and rippled outwards to the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the Hogwarts magic wasn't fooled by Harry's invisibility. For the moment, Harry wasn't able to enter the boys toilets. With a resigned sigh, Harry looked to her side, and spotted the girls toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the girls toilet offered no such resistance. The toilet was empty, without even a ghostly presence. Harry slid the cloak off, and took in her face in the mirror. The cloak gave a crackle as Harry lay it down on the counter. It had never had a manual, and he truly hoped it wasn't beyond repair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no denying she was cute. Her mop of hair had grown out, the untidiness worked to create a different effect. She didn't look unkempt, weirdly it added to her appeal. She had <i>'just fucked'</i> hair. Her emerald eyes were wide and inviting, her nose petite, her lips full and ruby red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very Harry-biased opinion, but she was looking at the cutest girl in the school. The thought made her smile, revealing gorgeous pearly white teeth. Harry suddenly realised the cutie in the mirror was herself, and the smile vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a subtle layer of make-up on her face. Tilting her head, she spotted an old friend. The scar appeared between the locks flowing over her temple. It was lighter, paler, but the shape was still clear. Anyone seeing her would see Harry Potter, if they saw the scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teeth clicked angrily, she would have to stay hidden the entire time, until this ... this thing was over. Dearly Harry hoped it would only last an hour. But for all their good humour, Fred and George were good wizards when they put their mind to a task. There was a distinct possibility this would last longer than an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir jokes frequently had an extra dimension... a sting in the tail... perhaps when the spell ended and the student was restored, their uniform stayed the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps, the brothers were selling 'a cure'.</span></div></div>",

He coughed as he restrained his laughter. There was a number of students looking very uncomfortable in skirts with hairy legs, and suddenly too tight jumpers. Harry knew his own restoration couldn't be far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Harry was about to jump down, the handle of the door turned. Harry froze, his hands tugging and teasing the cloak, ensuring that she was fully covered. Jumping down was out of the question now, she'd never be able to do it silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree ravenclaw girls walked in chatting. The topic of discussion was what Harry expected, the sudden transformation of the Slytherin students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry recognised Maria Glossop, Sue Li, so the last one had to be Millicent Bagnold. Maria was wondering why the Weasley's weren't in Ravenclaw. She admired their imagination and insight in crafting new spells. Sue Li, suggested it was probably because they weren't ... academic. Millicent asked if they'd give her a copy of the spell to use on her brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came over to the sinks, and turned on the water. Harry shifted, slowly and quietly, lifting herself up to sit on the windowsill. She didn't want to be splashed with water, and wasn't sure how the cloak would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding herself backwards, she shifted the dust with her plump ass. Harry suddenly realised, she was still fully female. She'd been exposed at the same time as the rest of the students, and she still fitted her female uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd have to go Weasley hunting... At least it was an easy job with the Marauder's Map, they didn't stand a chance. She'd simply corner them when they were alone, and slip the cloak off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't an option until he could leave the toilet. <i>The toilet</i>, she almost snapped her fingers as it fell into place. That must be why she was still a girl. The spell couldn't reverse until she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her perch, she enjoyed the view. Both out to the Quidditch pitch, and down to the girls well displayed bosoms.</span></div></div>",

Despite her experience with the troll in the first year, there were defences in place for more mature students to stop misbehaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to hold back a groan, as he looked down Maria Glossop was adjusting her jumper. Asking her friends if the new bra was working, and playing with the neckline of the jumper. She had to be looking through his leg to see her reflection. The realisation made Harry twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria jumped backwards at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mirror... did you see my reflection ... it rippled.\" her brow was furrowed. Cautiously she reached her hand forward, and slowly approached the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her knees up to her chest, Harry carefully pulled up the cloak, just before Maria's fingers would have touched it.

With regret, he watched, as the Gryffindor Lion, unstitched itself, and rewove itself into a Slytherin serpent. It wouldn't be much protection, but hopefully in the confusion it would be enough. It was then he noticed a recess in the wall, with a suit of armour from the fourth wizarding wars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed backwards into an small alcove. She was careful not to jostle the armour on display there with her wider hips. However, she didn't want to be revealed in the confusion. The gas also meant he couldn't see very far himself... herself. After all, the gas had already changed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the chill of the steel armour in her chest. Even through the cloak, her jumper, the blouse, and she assumed .. .. the bra. The chill pierced her in a way she hadn't expected, drawing out an aroused gasp. High, girlish and sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle burst from her lips, as she watched the chaos of the milling Slytherins. The smug amusement of the girls, and the startled, and slightly scared looks of those new to their gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco made a rather attractive girl... with long platinum blonde hair, her face still familiar was more refined and feminine. On either side, she had to assume were Crabbe and Goyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrabbe had kept her weight, although it was distributed in a much more pleasing manner. Goyle looked rather upset at she saw her reflection as his.. now her girlfriend held a hand mirror up for her. She was elegant and refined, and clearly found her own image distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her hidden vantage point, and still under the cloak, he admired the chaos. Despite their less than stellar marks in exams. Harry held both Fred and George in high esteem, both for their ability to invent new spells, and for their sense of fun and adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink cloud of feminising gas, even now, was still resisting magical attempts at dispersal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as a prefect, still male took out his wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flurry of pink sparks, in a sphere around his head, as the gas sought a way to get into his lungs. But, he remained steadfastly male, but just as steadfast was the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students were spreading out, and the gas was getting thinner. Harry decided it was time to leave, before the professors arrived, and she was discovered. She knew that when Professor Snape arrived, she'd get the blame, even with her own new gender to show her as a victim, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the cloak, snag on some sharp corner of the armour, and missed quite what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the pink cloud, shimmered, changing in brightness, before flashing into a new shade. An emerald green, Oh shit. Harry thought. She wasn't sure what that meant. She didn't know if it was part of the prank, or an interaction with the prefects magic. But she wanted to get out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to tear the cloak, she let it slip through her fingers as it resisted coming with her. She felt very visible, and obvious. Nobody was paying her the least attention. But looking backwards, she saw the cloak, hanging from the back of the armour. She left it there, she could collect it later, as she didn't want to draw undue attention to it just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she saw... three other Slytherins. An attractive blonde, a curvy brunette, and an elegant but unhappy girl. She felt she should know their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, she realised, she didn't even know her own name. But through the confusing haze, she knew one thing. Slytherins were proud, powerful and independent. They'd get out of this, and whoever was behind this would pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her resolve and anger, she was glad to see the green haze dissipate entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she saw that there was only one guy there. Whoever was behind this had attacked only the Slytherin women. There was a huddle of people around him, and she dismissed the idea of waiting and asking him what was going on. A true Slytherin doesn't wait for help, or ask for guidance.</span></div></div>",

Casting her eye around, she took in the three girls huddling together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir slumped shoulders, and little girl lost looks screamed out that they were formerly boys. Not strong women, embracing their feminine power, and grace. She threw her shoulders back, proudly displaying her curves. Not some timid Ravenclaw, or insignificant Hufflepuff, she was a Slytherin, and not about to dismiss any weapon in her armoury.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shouts and screams erupted behind Harry, and behind him there was a -<span class=\"cgrey\"><i>pouf</i></span>-, and a cloud of pale green smoke billowed around the corner. He watched from beneath the cloak for a moment, until coughing and spluttering he spotted a host of Slytherin girls gust into the corridor. Their expressions a mix of horror, shock, disgust, and from some others a mix of amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more girls spilled into the corridor, until Harry felt it was too full. That he might be discovered even cloaked, an accidental bump could reveal his presence. He also felt the slightest hint of a cough approaching, perhaps a side-effect of the gas he mused. A cough would certainly give him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused only for a moment, as a gorgeous platinum blonde girl staggered into the passageway. She was tall with curves in just the right places. She was flanked by a couple of chubbier girls. Still nicely rounded, but not as tall, nor so beautiful. But there was something odd about her. At first Harry thought she was struggling to breathe. But it became clearer she was holding her bust. Her eyes wide in horror, her fingers softly, blankly squeezing and releasing her chest. She slowly shook her head in denial, her lips silently mouthing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a squeal of surprise, as Millicent Bullstrode joined her, and gave her a sisterly hug, forcefully pulling them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only the tickle building at the back of Harry's throat, and the desire not to get mixed up in whatever the Weasley's had done. She left them, and headed off for somewhere with fewer people, and more privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was obvious, Harry headed for the Room of Requirement. It had always fascinated him, since he'd first heard of it. The random detritus stored there told a more interesting history of the castle than that book Hermione kept trying to get him to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched patiently, as the wall took on the deep engraving of a double door, and doorway, sinking backwards until part transfigured from stone to wood. With a careful glance to either side, Harry checked he was unobserved and entered. Slipping the cloak off, and forcing it into his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an immense hall broken up with tall, sturdy pillars reaching high up to the ceiling. Most of the room was hidden beyond the chaotic piles of rubbish. Despite it's size, it reminded him of his cupboard beneath the stairs. But with that twist of magic, he felt home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing slowed and deepened as he wandered further into the room. His hands tracing their way over the surface of the various artefacts as he went. Mostly his fingers left dusty trails where the passed. But occasionally, a spark of residual magic sparked weakly into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at his reflection as he passed a mirror. Pausing only briefly as the image shimmered. With a snort of surprise he recognised the mirror of erised. But with determination he walked on beyond it's siren call. His feet only stumbling briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musty smell built until Harry felt sure he must be near the centre of the room. If it even had a centre. A dark mahogany wardrobe loomed over him, ornately carved, and despite the lack of attention still free of dust. The mirror on the door thankfully didn't shimmer or show any magical properties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers went unbidden to the wardrobe door. Opening it with only a slow, quiet creak. Inside was a corset just hanging there. His imagination already racing to picture Ginny wearing it. Her waist pulled in tight... and the girls lifted and put even more on display. Swallowing as he imagined their liquid dancing movement with even the simplest of breaths keeping the girls mobile and eye-catching, he felt himself stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his hand back from feeling the soft material, unaware of even having reached out. Despite it's size it looked strong and confining, with it's bright buckles and shiny chrome fasteners. Trying to dismiss the thoughts racing through his mind. Harry doubted it would ever fit. It was clearly tailored for a tiny waist, and a large bust. It just didn't look like it would fit Ginny. Not that Ginny was fat... or flat... He felt his cheeks turn a deeper red, warming as his thoughts spiralled once more in intriguing directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to end them, he pulled the corset out. The red and black looking less comfortable, the shaping struts less forgiving than ever. The hanger fell free, clattering against the wooden floor of the wardrobe. His breathing was more rapid, now he held it, it was clearly too small. He doubted it would fit even the diminutive Cho Chang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFingers trembling he eased the door closed, and held it against his own body for comparison. Just to see how small it truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash, a flare of brilliant light forced Harry to squeeze his eyes shut against the pain. Even his breathing caught. As the painful redness vanished from his eyelids, and he felt the heat of the light diminish. He blinked his watering eyes. His blurry vision returning only slowly as the tears streaked down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had the same difficulty taking a deeper breath. But, as his vision cleared, he doubted what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere reflected in the mirror was a startled and horrified witch. Her bust rising and falling with each shallow breath. Her mane of midnight hair cascading over her shoulders. It didn't take Harry long to recognise the same tickling sensation from his own shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis uniform gone, nothing more than a memory. All his clothes now reduced to a corset and some ruffled black panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/2bbcd8031da223127c0bf8b3ef850d0c/tumblr_ovafb1JGsB1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/2bbcd8031da2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe... No, She. She wanted to scream, but the corset was too tight, her lungs incapable of taking enough air for the scream she release to the uncaring ceiling.</span></div></div>",
