Local people from the little city that was at the edge of the forest told him all about the naga in the forest.  In fact, the people consider the forest as the naga's forest as if the naga really owned it.  One kid about seven named Danny told Adrian about how he got lost in the forest one time and ran into a nice naga named Carmen.  According to Danny, Carmen was about 100 feet long and beautiful...for a naga.  After hearing the tall-tales of the naga in the forest, he bought some camping gear and entered the dense forest.<br>\r\n                Throughout the long day, Adrian saw no evidence of any naga;  just the usual wildlife you'd find in any other forest.  At one point, Adrian saw a bear off in the distance along with three or four little cubs.  As the day wore on, Adrian doubted he would run into a naga...but it was a good hike.  The forest had no paths to speak of.  He kept following the stream deep into the forest.  By early evening, Adrian had reached a high ridge that overlooked the small city of Oakdale.  He took a moment to take in the sights, not noticing that he was being  watched.  By late evening, Adrian found a good place to set up a camp; a sizable clearing about 40 feet square.  There, he found the remains of an ancient campfire.  The old campsite looked to be about two years old.  Adrian set up a medium-sized tent and built a large campfire and settled in for the night.  <br>\r\n                      If the forest was noisy in daylight, it was nothing compared to the forest at night;  there were animal noises everywhere and once or twice the long howl of a wolf.  For dinner, Adrian had some hot dogs.   He bought along a small battery-powered radio which he listened to the local rock station.   At around midnight, Adrian had whipped out a camera that could see in the dark and decided to take a little stroll before settling in for bed.  Adrian saw some squirrels with the camera and what looked to be a wolf in the distance.    Then he spotted something on the ground;  a sight heat signature on the ground.  By the looks of it, the heat signature seemed to be some kind of track;  a track that a snake would leave behind.  Adrian carefully measured the track and found it was about 40 feet thick and 20 feet long.   \"That's one hell of a snake\" said Adrian softly.   Maybe the stories about the naga were real after all.   Adrian returned to his campsite and crawled into his tent and sleeping bag and quickly fell asleep.  The only sound at the campsite was the soft music from the radio.<br>\r\n                            Some time later, Adrian woke with a start.   For a moment, Adrian looked around wildly to find what sound had woken him so suddenly.  He clicked off the radio and listened.  A faint dragging sound was coming from outside.  It was steadily getting nearer.  Adrian's first thought that it was a bear.   Then he heard someone giggling softly.  <br>\r\n                          \"The radio hasssss gone sssssilent\" said a soft voice that had a hissing quality.  <br>\r\n                           \"The batteriessss must've gone out\" said another voice, a female one.  <br>\r\n                           \"Could it be naga....?\" thought Adrian to himself.  'What should I do?' <br>\r\n                         </span></div></div>",

However, if Adrian said no, Imarah would most likely either crush him slowly in her coils or swallow him whole and he'd be digested alive. Despite her being the size of a human, because they're part-snake, a naga can unhinge it's jaws to swallow prey as big as itself (not to mention their throats can stretch to an unimaginable width for their size). Adrian were conflicted, as this was a dangerously loaded question. As Imarah hugged his waist, saying \"We nagas can love you humans just as good- if not better- than others of your species. And don't worry. I'll protect you from all those nasty people who would want to take your sweet, tender, tasty body away from me.\" Now Adrian began to panic, as it sounded like she wanted him also as a snack! He shivers in fear, and Imarah is upset. \"Oh! I didn't mean to scare you, sweetie. I would never hurt someone as cute as you! if i do eat you, All i would want and get is that sweet, sweet cream that we love so much. you men always make it for us to enjoy, if you know what i mean.\" she twirls her finger around Adrian's crotch, and he became aroused. giggling, Imarah says \"I knew I made a good choice! Don't worry, baby. with me, you would live like a king, and be treated like the luckiest man in the universe!\" Imarah rose to Adrian's face, and kissed his lips. She kept trying to open his mouth with her tongue, but for some time, he kept them sealed like cement. the warmth of Imarah's body soothes him more and more with each second, he began to loosen his seal. He never felt this way with a naga before, as all the others tried to eat him in their coils. \"Maybe she's not lying. she does seem kinda nice. but i need to tell her about those i care about.\" he began to think, and this thought blasts his mind like a hurricane. Adrian cannot hold this in any longer. \"Imarah? If I say yes, will i ever see my family again? or my friends?\" Imarah was discomforted for a few seconds, but regained her happiness. \"Don't worry, darling! My family can get other nagas to bring them to our home! You only need to just say yes! My family will be your family and yours will be mine! Please be mine?\" looking into her eyes, Adrian begin to trust this young woman. He stared into her for a few minutes, then smiled and nodded. Imarah squeals in joy and tackles him. she hugs Adrian tightly, and tries to kiss him again. this time, he does not resist, and lets her tongue wriggle into his mouth. as the two kiss, Adrian finally felt... love from a naga. this feeling was amazing, and he never wanted it to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After ten minutes of intense kissing, Adrian and Imarah lay on the ground, thinking of the future. \"Hey, Imarah?\" he asked, and his new lover turns to him. \"Yes, darling?\" Adrian smiles and answers \"Thank you for showing me love.\" Imarah blushed, and assured him \"oh, sweetie. that wasn't TRUE love. That was just us meeting heart to heart, like any boy or girl would want. THIS is TRUE love!\" She tackles him again, and reaches for his pants. she undoes the fastener and pulls the zipper, revealing Adrian's erection; exciting her greatly. \"Ready to do it, darling?\" he was amazed at Imarah's eagerness, and says \"Do with me what you will, baby. I'm all yours!\" She begins to get teary-eyed, and began to remove her coverings, revealing the body of a goddess. Adrian moaned at her form, and she presses her chest onto his own. Her body releases heat similar to a summer day, and she kisses his cheek and lips with an undying and undeniable passion. Adrian's steaming member throbs in anticipation, and Imarah says \"you can have me whenever you want, darling. Starting right now!\" she lowered herself onto him as she said this, and in seconds, she gave her flower to Adrian. Gasping, she embraced him, and Imarah began her mating with the lucky explorer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(Naga mating lasts in a six hour ritual. The male is strained to his limits during this time, but will become much stronger after each mating with the naga he loves) Imarah smiles at Adrian's firm body, and wraps her tail around him in a tight hug. If she wasn't careful, this grip could crush a couple of ribs (this was common between humans in love with nagas). Despite all odds, she never strains a single bone in his body. As the coils begin to wrap Adrian's arms, she stops and wraps them around below her shoulders pits. As he begins to lose control, she locks her lips onto his own. Both Adrian and Imarah would be in this position for six hours. He came several times into her body, but each time, he regained his energy quickly for another round. Adrian and Imarah were in perfect synchronicity, like that people only hear about in love stories. As the sixth hour drew near, Imarah began to pant and moan rapidly. For the last few minutes, she kept hugging Adrian, and kissing his cheek and tongue. Then, at the six hour mark. She screamed, and erupted spectacularly. Adrian was soon to follow, and the two new lovers were deeply satisfied with each other. They both collapse in each other's arms, exhausted at last, and fall sleep in her embrace. As Adrian slept, Imarah softly said \"I love you, my sweet Adrian. We'll be together in happiness forever!\" She kissed him, unwrapped her coils, and slept beside his exhausted body. Tomorrow would be a new day, and the start of a new life for the explorer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sun slowly rose over their sleeping bodies. As Adrian wakes up, he notices Imarah with her lips kissing his scalp, his head in her bosom and her arms around his chest. Adrian is a little confused as to why she is sleeping with him like this, but the warmth of her body makes Adrian forget any questions to this matter. kissing right where her heart is in her chest, Imarah squeezed him tightly, and a loud \"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,\" came out of her body. He smiled and said, \"Good morning, my dear!\" Imarah slowly opened her eyes, and saw Adrian looking at her. \"Good morning, darling! Last night was wonderful! You are what every girl dreams of, and then some!\" she kissed his cheek after she said this. as she let go of Adrian's body, he smiled back at her, asking \"Is there anything you want to do today, honey?\" her smile shined like a diamond in an open pit mine, and she hugged him tightly (his sternum was almost crushed). Adrian patted her back when suddenly he heard Imarah's tummy growl. \"Are you hungry, baby?\" Imarah blushed, but Adrian smiled. \"It's okay! Let's go get something to eat!\" She smiled at him softly, and whispered into his ear. \"One thing I was going to tell you, darling, is that I DO eat humans, as it is in many nagas' nature; I promise I won't eat you or your family! You are MUCH too sweet to be in my tummy! *giggle* is that okay?\" Adrian gasped, but smiled, thinking of how cute she would be if she was nice and full. He smiles and says \"Honey, as long as it's you, I'm alright if you eat humans! I just want to see you do it with that beautiful body, my love!\" Imarah squealed in happiness and tackled him, once more, in a huge hug. as they hug and kiss all over each others' bodies, Adrian heard a voice from the bushes. \"Shhhh! Quiet, boys! I hear a naga! this one's mine! I know that naga hides are worth a fortune this time of year, so we better not screw this up! just make sure that it's alone! I DON'T wanna become a naga's belly stuffer like the last twelve did today!\" Imarah stopped hugging Adrian and whispered \"I'm sensing six yummy humans, darling. they have got to have food for your liking too! lay low, and let me deal with the nasty men!\" he nodded and hid behind a boulder. Imarah smiles and gives Adrian a sign of approval, and the men get into her sight. they're lightly armed, but they look tough. \"I have to be quick with this! I don't wanna lose my sweet man to their blood lust!\" Imarah thought. she stealthily reaches the men, and just as they begin walking again, she whips her tail around them, and wraps them tightly, cutting off their escape. They struggle in vain, crying, which was quite embarrassing for seasoned hunters. Imarah brought them to eye level, and they all looked terrified, as their lives would end in her stomach within a few hours. Seeing the fear in her prey, Imarah used a hypnotic stare, and their fears subsided. the six men stopped fighting, and stared at Imarah's face, smiling. As they became calm, Imarah spoke. \"Don't worry little morsels. I won't hurt you when you're in my tummy! just go to sleep and let little Imarah tuck you in!\" the men smiled, nodded and closed their eyes. As the men began to fall asleep, Imarah's stomach growled again; this time out of anticipation. When he heard Imarah's tummy, Adrian came out of hiding, and hugged his lover. had the men still been awake, they would have been shocked to see this. He gives Imarah a kiss and says \"Give me a second to look for food for me, my love!\" Imarah winks at him and Adrian looks through their backpacks. He found a small banquet of food that he liked, and is satisfied. He doesn't really eat much in a meal, so this could keep him full for at least a couple days. Seeing the smile on his face, Imarah asks \"May I, darling?\" Smiling, Adrian pats her tummy and said \"Bon appetite, my love!\" Imarah then began to unclothe the men, and their aromas whetted her appetite. Adrian nods at her and Imarah began her morning feast.</span></div></div>",

As soon as the last hunter enters Imarah's belly, she releases a loud belch. \"Oh my! Excuse me!\" Adrian can't help but smile and assure her \"That was so cute, honey!\" Imarah was satisfied, and beckoned him to her. \"Come here and feel the bulge, darling. You know you want to!\" She was right, and Adrian walked over to her stomach, and poked it. Imarah moaned and he began to caress her stomach. He rubbed, licked, teased and kissed Imarah's swollen belly, releasing an orchestra of pure happiness from her body. after five minutes of pleasuring her tummy, Imarah's stomach began to work on the men. The sounds of digestion fill Adrian's ears, and he smiled. He hugged the bulge one last time, and got up on his feet. Sweet Imarah saw Adrian get up and said \"Let's go home, darling. I'm sure my family would be happy to meet you!\" Adrian nods, and the two lovers headed off for home, and Adrian's paradise.</span></div></div>",

But suddenly they were growing dozens of meters every second; their lying bodies broke through the trees like they were made of thin paper.

But as Ray intented to protect them, they were not hurt despite being pinned to the ground under the couple's bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they had reached 3 kilometers from head to waist their power surge entered its final phase: their growth again increased thousandfold, now growing dozens of kilometers every second.

From her waist up, the naga was about 30ft tall, her tail down was 90ft long. If she were human, her chest would have been a C-cup. Her tail was spackled with scales of varrying shades of brown. Her torso seemed heavily tan by human standards, but otherwise appeared nice and smooth. The naga's pointed ears, red eyes, alluring smile and perfect jaw all appeared to compliment an expression of nobility on her face. <br>\r\nEllana recalled old stories about a naga's hyde being near impenetrable to most rudimentary weapons. They rarely ventured near human settlements, even then, only near defensless villages or farms. They tended to live deep in forests or in mountan caves, but were known hunt near undeveloped trade routes, eating local wildlife and humans. Even more unsetteling than that were the rumors of humans kidnapped by naga, never to be seen again. Some speculated that the humans were somehow used for naga procreation, but that theory was turned down due to the existance of male naga. It wasn't known if they had any control over magic, but their strength and speed more than compensated for it. <br>\r\nViews on their intelligence varried from no smarter than a common snake to on par with unicorns and dragons, the most intelligent of known magical creatures. This one spoke with such a presence and clarity that it killed the theory that naga were stupid. Her voice was soft, caring and somewhat threatening all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the naga's tail shifted, bring both out of their thoughts.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of the first thing, that nagas use humans as a source of food. Your species has a unique flavor that we love, and the feeling of one of you squirming in our belly is so arousing. A single human can fill up a normal naga for several days; but for a giant naga like myself, a human like you is good for a single meal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you\u2019re not going to eat me are you?\u201d Ellana stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVylite smile at her little captive, \u201cOf course not little one; if I were, I\u2019d have swallowed you long ago.

The first that they were at the base of an incredibly large mountain that had been previously blocked from view by the trees. The second that directly in front of an enormous thorn bush, that upon further examination, appeared to cover the entire face of the mountain. She recognized the vines as Kalsheer, the thorns that can pierce anything. The third and final thing she noticed was a large gap between the vines that appeared just large enough for a naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVylite looked down at Ellana. \"I can tell you've figured it out by now. I live in a cave on the mountain, these thorns protect it from unwanted guests and the stink of the vines makes it near impossible to track me past this point. There's a natural sort of maze running through the vines that any creature other than a naga of at least my size would have problems navigating. I think the human term is prime realestate.\" She paused to gather her thoughts. \"The problem is that I need both hands and my tail to manuver past the thorns and to be honest, you'd be a bit of a liability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana didn't bother argueing going to the cave, no matter how much she wanted this whole thing to just stop. She started thinking of ways the naga could get her to the cave without using her tail or hands, and didn't like what she had come up with. \"Maybe i could grip your hair. I realize it's not that long and that's so it doesn't get caught, but there's enough for me to grip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVylite turned toward Ellana rather abruptly and without warning reached down and plucked the human from her coils. The naga held the petrified human in her hands as delicately as possible. She gently pulling and pinching Ellana's arms, who was worried this monster might rip them off. While her thumbs and index fingers were occupied with her arms, her other digits were free to roam. They poked and prodded her stomach, torso and pelvis. One finger pressed down rather hard on her right breast and started moving it around. Eventually she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Completely ignoring what she had just done. \"I don't think you could ride my hair. To do that you'd need the arms and hands of a farmer, yours are the arms and hands of a weaver or some house servant. Im sorry.\" She seemed sincere. \"It really was a nice idea.\" Was she trying to be supportive or sarcastic? \"I'm afraid there's only one way we're getten you past those thorns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana was afraid to ask. \"H...how is that?\"</span></div></div>",

My hunt will take some time, so you don\u2019t need to wait up for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Vylite was gone Ellana explored more of the cave and thought about Vylite\u2019s question. When she grew sleepy she settled down on the edge of Vylite\u2019s fern-bed and soon drifted to sleep, not noticing when Vylite returned after a successful hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVylite was the first to wake up the next morning. Her meal from the previous night had been digested and her stomach was ready for more, but she waited for Ellana to wake up. Ellana woke up not too long after Vylite and saw the giant naga looking at her with a welcoming smile. \u201cMorning Ellana. Now, in regards to my question last night, what\u2019s your answer?\u201d The naga asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally, about a month ago, I went to an old friend of my mother. She's a mystic. In exchange for some old pendant I found, she answered my question about who is right for me.

It was always an assuring sound that let her know that whatever strange or terrible dream she had been having that night was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But it also means I have to face the true toils of real life,</i> she thought glumly as she opened her eyes to the dark stony ceiling above her. Wait a minute\u2026this wasn\u2019t the ceiling she slept under. This wasn\u2019t her room. Looking down at where she lay, she saw it wasn\u2019t so much an old ratty mattress, but a pile of green ferns. <i>This isn\u2019t my bed!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Ellana was getting nervous. She had to get up, find out where she was, maybe get out of here. But as she pushed herself up to a sitting position, a new horrifying revelation came over her: her legs were gone. Not severed, as her lord back home was wont to do to whatever people displeased him, but fused into one, long serpentine tail covered in emerald scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-wh-what is this?\u201d she cried falling onto her back and pushing herself away as if she could actually get away from it. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden movement of something coming. Something large. Ellana peered over to it and had to put a hand over her mouth to keep herself from screaming. It was a naga! An enormous naga. She wanted to desperately hide, but it was too late; the beast was looking directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d said the naga in a happy tone, but Ellana was too frightened to notice. She screamed as the creature approached her and tried desperately to crawl away with her hands. She couldn\u2019t get far though; her tail was flailing every which way and was almost pinning the young woman in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet away from me!\u201d she screamed in her panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now the giant snake woman looked alarmed herself. \u201cShhh, calm down! It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s only me,\u201d she said in as gentle a voice as possible. When that didn\u2019t work, she brought a hand down onto Ellana\u2019s body, hard enough to pin her down, but not so much it would cause the smaller girl any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of me!\u201d Ellana shouted as she continued to struggle, her coils squirming within the great naga\u2019s fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEllana, it\u2019s me!\u201d said the naga. \u201cVylite. Your betrothed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u2026what?\u201d Ellana asked. And it all came back to her. Her running away into the forest, her encounter with the oddly friendly naga, the strange offer to be part of a family. \u201cYou mean\u2026that wasn\u2019t a dream at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what gave you that impression,\u201d said Vylite. \u201cThough I guess it was very strange for me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you\u2026let me go?\u201d Ellana asked, finally going limp in the snake woman\u2019s grasp. She was still wary, but at least she knew she wasn\u2019t in any immediate danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you promise to stay calm?\u201d said Vylite. When Ellana nodded, the naga rose her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former human stood up to the best of her ability and looked down at herself. For the first time since waking up, it suddenly registered that she was completely naked. Her breasts, which were small but pert, were bouncing freely out. And while she now had the lower body of a snake, she still had a very womanly slit down where her crotch used to be. Letting out an embarrassed squeak, she attempted to cover herself with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVylite let out an amused chuckle. \u201cYou humans and your modesty. Always feeling so shameful about what you were born with. But look at me, I\u2019ve got a lot of the same parts as you!\u201d At this, she stood up and gave her own bare breast a squeeze with one hand and ran another down her own uncovered slit. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed, and I haven\u2019t worn a thing in my life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026what did you\u2026what happened to me?\u201d Ellana asked, hoping to steer the conversation away from both their states of undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d said Vylite with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWell, in short, I put you into my womb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInto your,\u201d she paused and blushed deeply when she recalled the strange incident where the naga actually shoved her naked body into her vagina. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t know,\u201d said the naga with a shrug of her shoulders. \u201cSomething was compelling me to. Something was telling me that this is what I needed to do so that we could be together. I didn\u2019t really understand it myself. And to be honest, when I was done, I was actually afraid that I might have killed you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut luckily, there was always some sign that you were still kicking. You seemed to be quiet most of the time, but every now and then, I could feel you wiggle around inside of me. And I admit, it felt really nice, feeling you kick, flail, and pummel my insides as if you were trying to get out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, don\u2019t remember doing any of that,\u201d said Ellana a little uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you wouldn\u2019t. Nobody recalls their time in the womb. Anyway, while you were in me, you were transforming. I couldn\u2019t see what was happening to you, but I could feel <i>something</i> about you was physically changing. Your movements, your size. And just this morning, you finally came out, transformed into a naga.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026see,\u201d said Ellana, sitting down on the ferns. She ran a hand down her lower half, feeling her new cold metallic scales. This was going to take a while to get used to. \u201cIs this normal for nagas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all!\u201d said Vylite. \u201cI think this was something my mystic friend did. We could go ask her if you like. Not now, though. I think you could use some food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana put a hand to her stomach. Come to think of it, she was feeling hungry. \u201cI guess I could use something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to know,\u201d said Vylite as she reached to the floor to pick something up. \u201cI was just out hunting for something for you. I\u2019d be a very poor wife if I didn\u2019t provide for my betrothed.\u201d And with that, she laid the body of a stag right onto the table.</span></div></div>",

At your size, I thought it would fill you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not reassuring to the newly-transformed naga. Just the thought of eating this animal as it was now was making her stomach turn. \"I...don't know if I can just eat this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Vylite, raising an eyebrow in confusion. \"It's not rotting yet; I killed it only an hour or so ago. And it didn't have any diseases that I saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana didn't quite know what to say. The naga already had no understanding of human decency as it was. How could the former human explain her natural aversion to...unprepared meat? \"It's just so...raw,\" she said with some hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, that's another thing humans do. They need to cook their meat! Well, it shouldn't be necessary for you anymore, but if it'll make you feel better, I can maybe try my own hand at cooking it.\" She picked the stag carcass up and went about preparing it for a fire. \"Though I warn you, I'm not very good at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Ellana. She felt like she was being rude, spurring the food this giant snake-woman was offering her. But she couldn't help herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's all right,\" said Vylite after she made a small pile of wood out of sticks that were twigs from her perspective. \"You just transformed, so I figure it'll take you some time before you adjust.\" She paused to impale the stag on a thorn of Kalsheer. \"And contrary to what you may have heard, we nagas don't <i>always</i> eat our meat raw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't?\" Ellana asked, perking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Raw's good and all, but we like variety as much as everyone else. Expose meat to heat, spice it up with certain ground-up plants, saut\u00e9 it in fruit juice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That doesn't sound so bad</i>, though Ellana with a hopeful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...or marinade it in the blood of different animals,\" Vylite continued, lighting the fire ablaze and holding the stag corpse over it. Ellana felt her heart fall again. \"I don't really bother with all that usually. Takes too much time. But my sister really enjoys cooking, and is really good at it too. I'd eat her stuff all the time if I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation ended there, leaving Vylite to cook the stag over an open fire while Ellana mulled over her new state of being in silence. After a few minutes, Vylite inspected the stag, which now looked appropriately burned and crispy, and concluded it must be good now. \"Food's ready,\" she said, bringing it once more to Ellana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana was still not so sure how she was going to do this. While the carcass was now less nauseating to look at, she still wasn't feeling up for eating it. It still wasn't properly skinned and prepared, and it was likely undercooked in certain places. But she couldn't just go and ask Vylite to do more for her. That, and her stomach was really starting to hurt. She'd have to eat something sooner or late. Crawling over to the burned carcass, she took hold of a leg, pulled it lightly to at least look like she was interested...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and neatly tore the whole thing off from the haunch! If Ellana still had legs herself, she would have leaped in the air in surprise. She didn't expect to have that kind of strength in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we nagas are built much tougher than humans,\" said Vylite, as if she had read Ellana's mind. She flexed her arm for emphasis, showing off a nicely toned bicep. \"Even at your size, you should be much stronger than those big, macho knights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see,\" said Ellana, staring at the stag leg in her arm. While the outer flesh had been burned to a crispy black, there was still plenty of reddish-brown meat within. Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes, tried to picture the most succulent delicious thing she could think of (<i>Just think of gingerbread, just think of gingerbread, just think of gingerbread...</i>), and took a bite.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The second the meat hit her tongue, Ellana's mouth exploded in a torrent of flavor. For reasons she couldn't explain, the stag haunch tasted...good! Maybe it was because thinking of gingerbread helped, even though it tasted nothing like gingerbread. Maybe it was because of her hunger, which was growing more ravenous. Maybe it was because her tastes had changed along with her body. Whatever it was, Ellana enjoyed moving the succulent flesh, still dripping with blood, around her mouth before swallowing it. In moments flat, the leg she held was stripped to the bone and she was rapidly moving on to the rest of the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 30 solid minutes of feasting, the stag was clean of most of its muscle and organs, which were now nestled neatly within the confines of her stomach. Finally feeling full, Ellana let out a loud burp of satisfaction. \"Excuse me,\" she said, covering her mouth in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" said Vylite, scooping the smaller naga up into her hands. \"Keep this up, and you'll grow big and strong in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana was initially alarmed by the sudden contact, as well as the sensation of being lifted high into the air, but she was much too full to offer much resistance. Fortunately, she wasn't there for long, as the giant snake woman was quick to place her into a basin of water. \"Wh-what's happening now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting you clean, silly,\" chuckled Vylite as she rubbed Ellana's body up and down, wiping the grease and juice off. \"I can't have you be dirty and smelling the cave up. Didn't know you'd be such a messy eater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana was about to issue out another apology, but it died in her throat as Vylite massaged her bare skin. While the naga was large enough to crush her, her caresses were firm but gentle. She rubbed Ellan's back, her bare sides, and her stomach, hitting the little naga's nerves in all the right places. All she could do was moan gently at the contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that?\" Vylite asked sweetly. \"I promise, there will be more where that comes from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ellana could formulate a reply, she then felt something long and smooth as silk slide up the length of her back. It wasn't her fingers, for it was much narrower, wetter, warmer, and completely boneless. It took only a few more seconds for her to realize that Vylite had licked her! Ellana couldn't help but quiver, but it wasn't in fear. It was because it just felt <i>so good</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All clean,\" said Vylite, picking the girl up once again. Ellana wasn't ready to leave the bath just yet, but she was still reeling from the feeling of Vylite's tongue caressing her soft skin. This time, she carried her to the large bed, placing Ellana onto the soft ferns before lying down on her side. Looking lovingly down at her bride-to-be, the giant naga couldn't help but reach forward and brush the small naga's form with her tender fingers.</span></div></div>",

I guess I kinda skipped over that part. Well, um. Im going to, I guess, incubate you for a day or so. When you come out, you'll be a full fledged Naga. Maybe not as big as me, but enough to raise you a few links on the food chain.\" The whole while she spoke she spoke with an incredibly warm and motherly tone.<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Ellana blurted reflexively. \"So then, I won't be a baby or anything?\"<br>\r\nVylite shook her head, still bearing a warm friendly smile. \"I'm not ready for kids yet.\" Vylite pulled Ellana inbetween her breasts, squeesing them together into what she assumed was a hug. \"With you by my side, maybe someday.\" <br>\r\nVylite's voice was soft and soothing. The warmth of her breasts and the steady rhythem of her heartbeat were making Ellana drowsy. The little human cued like an infant, letting Vylite know that she had accepted the offer. Vylite was so grateful, she almost started to cry.<br>\r\nEllana felt herself be pulled away from the warmth and security of the Naga's bosum. She shook her head and realized that she was back infront of Vylite's face.<br>\r\n\"So, are you ready?\" Vylite asked enthusastically.<br>\r\nEllana answered...</span></div></div>",

The girl tried to climb her way back into a steadier position on the massive tongue, but it was now useless to try. She whimpered as her body involuntarily slid into the dark tunnel of Vylite's esophagus, coated in a mound of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! Vylite!\" Ellana called out as loud as she could. \"Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong throat muscles pulled the girl downward, pushing against her in an attempt to break her up. Moments later, her legs reached an open area that allowed for movement; Ellana knew full well where the next stop was, and it did not please her at all.

She tried kick and twist away from the finger, but Vylite simply moved forward and began pushing on her butt. Nothing she did could remove her from the massive digit as it forced her deeper and deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVylite's pussy seemed to narrow further on, and Ellana felt the walls constrict around her, squeezing her body tightly. The muscles around her seemed to clutch and carress her as she was pushed deeper, like hungry mouths and hands. When the finger finally withdrew, Ellana was trapped in a tight, hot tunnel that sucked, squeezed and stroked her constantly. She was covered in thick slime that she knew all to well as Vylites passion juices, and already knew she had swallowed far more than a few mouthfuls to keep breathing. It was like a warm, salty milkshake of straberries and creme, and it felt almost solid inside Ellana's belly. The fact that the taste was palatable didn't make it any more pleasant to breathe or choke on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There...\" Vylite's voice reverberated around her, the pleasure of her exertion obvious, \"You should be safe now... Let's move on shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana didn't know how long she clawed at and kicked in that tight tunnel of flesh. She was assaulted by vertigo, from Vylites movements or the lack of air she couldn't tell. The air is perhaps what drove Ellana to fight on: it was warm and horribly, horribly thin. The fear of suffocation in this tight, squeezing place was everpresent: and while she could always find air, it was always thin and her face was always pushed into another mass of muscle before long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard quelches and slurps as she moved, and far off gurgles and groans that from Vylite's huge body. Ocasionally she heard her voice sighing or moaning in happiness, and always the steady beat of the Naga's heart...</span></div></div>",

It was midday, and she was gazing up at Vylite\u2019s bright face. Ellana was cradled in Vylite\u2019s arms close to her chest, close to the warmth from her breasts. Vylite was still big to her, but not as big as she was when Ellana went unconscious. \u201cM\u2026 mommy\u2026\u201d Ellana squeaked. \u201cThat\u2019s right little one, I\u2019m your mommy.\u201d Vylite said softly with a bright smile.  In a far flung corner of Ellana\u2019s mind her old self was in hysterics, <i>NO! She\u2019s not my mother! This can\u2019t be!</i> but the rest of Ellana\u2019s mind rejoiced at seeing her new mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny gurgle escaped Ellana\u2019s stomach. \u201cOh, it seems you\u2019re hungry. I guess it\u2019s time to feed you.\u201d Vylite cooed before gently bringing Ellana to one of her nipples. Ellana suckled from Vylite\u2019s breast and both felt the bond of family growing stronger between them. When she finished, a small burp escaped Ellana\u2019s mouth. \u201cAw, that\u2019s my good little girl.\u201d Vylite cooed as she rubbed Ellana\u2019s back, \u201cI love you sweety.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One day, Ellana\u2019s fifth birthday to be exact, Vylite told her, \u201cNow you stay here sweetie, Mommy will be back shortly.\u201d before slithering away. It was around the time that Vylite went out to hunt for their evening meals, so Ellana wasn\u2019t upset by her mother\u2019s departure. Ellana curled up in a corner of the nest, thinking about her life. Vylite was a very caring mother; she was always there for Ellana. For the first year or so Vylite breast-fed Ellana, then started feeing her small animals like squirrels, raccoons and, rabbits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana was napping when Vylite returned; her stomach was filled with three humans all vainly struggling against her stomach walls to escape. \u201cEllana, wake up sweetie. Mommy\u2019s got a surprise for you.\u201d Vylite whispered into Ellana\u2019s ear. Ellana yawned and stretched both her arms and tail as she woke up, \u201cA surprise?\u201d She asked as she sat up and gazed up at her mother. Vylite smiled and nodded before gently taking Ellana\u2019s hands and putting them in a cupped position next to each other. She then brought the end of her tail forward, revealing a wriggling male human wrapped in her coils. Vylite released her tail\u2019s hold on the man who fell into Ellana\u2019s waiting hands. \u201cIt this for me?\u201d Ellana asked excitedly as she gripped the man so he couldn\u2019t escape. \u201cYes it is Ellana. My mother started feeding me humans when I turned five, now it\u2019s time for you to start.\u201d Vylite said. Ellana looked at the frightened man in her hands and the part of her mind that was the old human Ellana burst into hysterics again, <i>Oh No! I can\u2019t eat another person! It\u2019s not right, I don\u2019t care if I am a naga now, I won\u2019t eat another human!</i> But the instincts of Ellana\u2019s naga body and mind were too strong. She put the human in her mouth as Vylite watched, pride for her daughter radiating from her. After a moment of savoring the human\u2019s extraordinary taste, Ellana swallowed. She felt the human sliding down her throat and landing in her stomach. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so proud of you Ellana.\u201d Vylite exclaimed as she hugged Ellana. \u201cThank you Mommy, that was wonderful.\u201d Ellana said as she hugged her mother back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to go to sleep now Ellana.\u201d Vylite said as she curled around her daughter for the night. Ellana settled in by her mother\u2019s chest and said, \u201cGood night Mommy.\u201d before going to sleep. Vylite smiled as she pushed some of Ellana\u2019s hair from her face. \u201cI\u2019m truly blessed to have such a beautiful daughter.\u201d She whispered to herself before she too settled down for the night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only real noticeable difference was now Vylite would return from her hunts with a tasty human for Ellana. Ellana was always excited to get her human from her mother, they tasted so good and their struggles made her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the night that was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVylite put Ellana to bed like every night before that, then eventually went to sleep herself. But tonight things went wrong. Vylite had been asleep for a few hours when her senses picked up something. She rose from the nest, taking care not to disturb her daughter to look around. A faint glow in the distance was all she could see, but the noises carried by the gentle breeze filled her with fear for her daughter\u2019s safety. \u201cEllana. Ellana sweetie, wake up.\u201d She said urgently shaking her daughter\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Mommy, breakfast?\u201d Ellana asked sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo dear, it\u2019s too early. Now listen closely, you need to leave. Now. Go to the place we talked about. And do not leave until I come get you. Go!\u201d Vylite said hurriedly. She watched as Ellana slithered away before turning back to the glow. The oncoming army of humans would not harm so much as a hair on Ellana if she could do anything about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place Ellana went was a tall, ancient tree. As her mother told her, Ellana climbed up the trunk of the tree and hid among the leaves to wait. She didn\u2019t know why her mother told her to leave, but she was certain her mother would come soon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The vines were wrapped around the woman's legs, waist, and chest, but the stranger's arms were free and holding a blowgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, please get me out of here!\" the woman pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, hold on.\" Ellana said as she pulled out a hunting knife and began to cut the vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, the darts have been in a while and you might wake it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake what up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as the words were out of her mouth Ellana was shocked to see more vines come out of a bush and head their way. At the same time the vines around the other woman came alive and began coiling around her again. Ellana tried to cut faster, but the vines healed as they wrapped tightly around the woman's chest and arms, forcing her to drop the blowgun. At the same time the vines around the woman's legs began to pull the struggling mass into the bushes. Ellana decided it was no use on her own and decided to try and find more help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was far too late. As Ellana stood the other vines behind her coiled around her ankles and pulled her to the ground. In shock, Ellana couldn't free herself as the vines continued up her legs. Soon they engulfed most of her lower legs and began wrapping around her shapely thighs. At the same time more vines appeared and began lashing themselves around Ellana's chest and neck. She kept her arms free and tried to pull the vines off of her neck and keep breathing but they were very strong. Soon the vines around her legs coiled tightly around her hips and waist. As she too was pulled into the bushes Ellana wondered what they would find or if help would come.</span></div></div>",

She and the other woman were on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vines dragged her along Ellana started hearing voices. One of them was definitely the voice of the other woman; the other voice was female, but had a strange accent to it. \u201cI told you that you couldn\u2019t escape me. But you wouldn\u2019t listen, and then you shot me with those blasted darts of yours. I might have let you off easy if you hadn\u2019t shot me, I don\u2019t\u2026 appreciate being shot by darts, or anything else for that matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the vines dragged Ellana into a clearing where she saw the other woman being held by the vines by a naga. At the start of this Ellana had been only slightly frightened, now she was truly afraid. \u201cOh, my vines have ensnared another human female. Welcome.\u201d The naga said, flashing a fanged grin at Ellana. The naga\u2019s scales were as green as the vines she commanded, her eyes with snake-like pupils were the color of emeralds, and her long hair was a lighter green than her scales; Ellana wasn\u2019t sure but she thought she might have seen a faint green tint to the naga\u2019s pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines suddenly jerked Ellana upright, yanking her out of the naga\u2019s way as she slithered closer to the other woman. \u201cAnd now to deal with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana was forced to watch with horror as the naga unhinged her jaw and plunged the other woman in headfirst. She closed her eyes, but she couldn\u2019t shut out the muffled screams of the doomed woman, or the gulps and satisfied moans from the naga. Only after the noises stop did Ellana open her eyes, only to see that the naga, now with a visible bulge in her snake half, had slithered up to her. \u201cNow then, what shall I do with you?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ever since I first saw one I always imagined that I was one. I even imagined I was one of those giant ones once in a while. I loved to think of what it would be like to squeeze a person in my coils, what it would feel like to swallow creatures up to human size, and humans too, whole and feel them wriggle inside me.

But as far as she and the rest of the naga race knew, the only way to become a giant naga was to be born one. \u201cWell then, I guess this\u2019ll make at least some of your dreams come true.

For some reason, however, Ellana was still her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Aurora to put 2 and 2 together and figure out what was happening: if the only way for a naga to become a giant naga was to be born that way, then it was apparent that Ellana <i>was</i> going to be born that way! Aurora softly patted her stomach to wake her future daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ellana, I think that your dream is going to come more than half true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ellana woke up and heard this, she was filled with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aurora, you don't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Year passed. Ellana and Aurora had become very good friend in the time between then and now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised Aurora the most during their time together was the end of Ellana's first year of being a naga. She had been woken up in the middle of the night by something that weighed heavy on her mid-section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eye and looked to see what is was, it was Ellana's naga half's tail laying on top of her, easily measuring 3/4th of her combined length. It took her by shock when she follow the tail's length up to Ellana's naga half and up to her human half, which, combined with her naga half, Aurora had to admit that Ellana had outgrown her by much. Ellana's width had also out done her's, meaning she was officially larger than Aurora in every way. Ellana had to be 115 feet long by now and all of her feature were still in perfect proportion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora had never expected that within that year it would be the year Ellana outgrew her in size and mass. She was frightened and shocked by this development... but that soon fades away, replaced by pride and joy for her beloved daughter. A smiles appears across her lip as she looks on at her beautiful girl, then she lays her head back, laying it down on her arms as she slowly drifts back to her lovely slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother full year went by and finally, Ellana has reached the 200 foot mark. In said time, her body has sculpted itself into a more voluptuous form. Her breasts had grown into the D-sizes and her waist was large and so to was the part of her that would have been her bum. Her hair had become long and altered in color to make a shift to Brownish dark-red. Her skin has become extremely well-resistant to damage, almost like flexible armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangest thing about her growth was not necessarily her size or characteristics, but her snake half! It had altered drastically. Her main scail color had changed to the color of her hair and she has developed a hard-armored, orange underside to her snake half. The one thing that was, however, unusual, is that her genitalia was showing, not covered up by her snake half's portion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had become one of the rarest types of Naga' there were. Not only a giant naga, but a power Giant, powerful, rock-breaker Naga! (No. There isn't a such type name. This is geared toward Canyon-dwelling snakes. The color might not be accurate, though.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora Obviously hadn't expected that she would become a different type of Naga than herself, but she reminded herself that she wasn't a pure breed of Naga. It might have been a suppressed gene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you are caught up, what say we get the ball rolling again? What is the first thing you wanna do with your new size? Are you contempt with going this Mother and Daughter scenario the two of you have going, or would you rather a little friendly bit of payback?</span></div></div>",

How's that's sound, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana smiles, eyes twinkling with excitement and mouth forming an agape smile. She was  eager to try out this changed body of her's. \"Yes! That sounds like an great idea, mom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora is almost frighten by how eager she sounds, her cheek sweating a bit as if a wave of heat passed through her and quickly vanished.\"W-wow! I never would've guessed from the moment I'd found you that you'd become so... into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana realizes what Aurora says and calms down quite a bit, looking Embarrassed as she blushes flush red. She answers in a somewhat shaky and dry tone. \"I-I guess I am getting a bit too excited... aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's nervousness eases at her Daughter's calmer, yet shaky tone, and tilts her head, smiling. \"Yeah. But I guess that's only natural for you to be so excited. Your finally what you've dreamed of becoming, and better yet, your getting to test out your new form.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger naga is calmed by her mother's understanding. She smiles at Aurora with warmth and love in her gaze. She speaks in a quiet and calm tone. \" About that. Aurora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora is a bit confused when her daughter uses her name instead of calling her mom. \"Yes, Ellana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant naga takes a moment to lean in, down to the now much smaller naga woman, using her arms for support. Aurora is caught off guard and mistakes this for an eating crouch and puts her arms up in defense, closing her eyes tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllena sees that and stops, her face a very small space away from her mother's. She waits, patiently for her mother to calm herself and as Aurora realizes she is not being sucked down her daughter's lips, she peeks an eye open to see Ellana's unchanged, warm and loving expression. She lets her guard down, seeing that her daughter truly meant no true harm and stared at her a bit confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger naga leans in, eyes closed and plants a long, soft and warm kiss on her mother's cheek. Aurora froze up, but not in fear, just in surprise. Her cheeks turned red in a hot blush. As Ellana pulls away, ending the kiss and reopening her eyes, looking at Aurora with a humble expression. Her answer finally comes. \"Thank you, Aurora... All this happened, because of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora blinks once, pausing for a moment. Then a small smile appears on her blushing face. \"Your welcome... Ellana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later, the two have made their ways into the Forest of Whispers. This place was a good start for a first hunt to try out Ellana's new potential. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana looked over the area around her, but her vision was horribly limited by the treetops blocking her view. She was just too tall to see anything. She then turns her attention to her mother. She leans down and whispers into her ear, aware that her voice would be loud enough to scare off all the prey in the area as full volume. \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora hears her as she is holding a kowo cat in her hand, but cat turn to her to see her face, or she might lose her prey. \"Yes, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to catch prey when my head literally towers above the tree? I can't see a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aurora swallows the kowo cat down into her belly, she looks at her daughter and smiles. \"Easy. You see what your doing to speak down to me, right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana looks at herself, seeing her point. Because of Ellana's naga half, superb back and stomach muscles, she was able to lean low to the ground without tiring and falling over. This was what Aurora was referring to. This simple solution made Ellana feel silly and embarrassed for asking. She looked at her mother, her embarrassment showing through in a nervous grin and light blush. \"Ehehehe.. right! S-silly me~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora smiles, looking playful. She teased her. \"You might be big, but bigger doesn't mean more experienced~!\" She then giggles and turns away, continuing on to find more prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ellan goes to follow, she feels a movement not too far behind her. Ellana freezes, then turns to see a \"large\", feathered body who's long beak picked at the ground. It was a Glouteux fowl bird! The perfect sized first meal! But the the question was, would this dodo bird really be stupid enough to stay in that one spot? (Glouteux' are EXTREME dense and severely lack intelligence.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she catch her prey or is it lucky enough to see her coming and run away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ellana carefully Creeps toward the fowl. Even though Ellana's tail which lay right in side of it, the fowl doesn't suspect a thing. This creature really WAS as intellectual challenged as she had been told by her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora saw what her daughter was doing and watched her creep up upon her prey, eager to see her catch her first prey as a giant naga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana got close enough to this creature that she could literally stick out her tongue and lick it. Instead, she grabs it in both hands and prepares for a struggle... but it doesn't react! She stared at the thing, but it only looks around in confusion, still not completely sure of what's going on. She was dumbfounded at how utterly idiotic this bird was. She thought to herself. {What the... I just grabbed the thing and all it does is look around? Exactly how stupid IS this bird?} She waits a moment, then just shrugs it off. {Oh well. Prey is prey~. Even if it's dumb prey.} <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts the bird up to her mouth and starts stuffing it in, head first. She has to dislodge her jaw a little because even though she was a giant naga now, it was still as big as a small chicken to her. She takes a gulp, sucking the head and upper body into her esophagus as it begins to make a bulge, both in her mouth and her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the idiot bird finally realizes what's occurring, but it is now completely helpless to move much more than a slight wiggle, due to it's tight surroundings. It can only lay in wait for what will happen next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora is just giddy at the sight of Ellana's throat bulge and with an excited agape smile and equally excited, sparkling eyes, she watches as he daughter takes another swallow, sending the fowl deeper inside, it's body now in her mouth completely, allowing her to relocate and attach her jaw, making a larger bulge apparent half in her throat and half out. That is quickly remedied with another gulp and now it is traveling down her esophagus toward it's final destination. Her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motherly naga couldn't be more awestruck if she tried at this point. She could literally feel her heart start to race intensely in her excitement. It felt it would pop right out of her chest if it beat any harder or any faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana feels the fowl bird slip down her esophagus in a wide bulge and as it reaches the end, she gives it one last swallow as it slips through quickly and *PLOP*! It lands in the digestive juices of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow allowed more room, the bird starts to flop around, looking for ways to get out, but it quickly realizes that it's hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana, straightens her human half back up and looks at her just slightly bulging belly. She gives it a few pats, smiling playfully. \"Sorry, little guy, but you weren't nearly fast enough~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora quickly slithers over to Ellana and gives her a congratulatory hug on the side of her waist. \"That was incredible, Ellana! I've never seen a naga eat a glouteux WHOLE, so easily~! That was just amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young, giant naga smiled down at her and was about to thank her, but then she realized that what Aurora said was odd somehow, looking puzzled as her smile quickly disappeared. \"Whadiya mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora then jumps as she hears her and looks up, noticeably nervous. She stops her hug, separating from the much larger naga and backing up so that she isn't hurting her neck as much to look up.  \"O-oh! Umm... Well.. You see, your the first naga that I've ever truly seen reach this size, truth be told. I didn't really expect for you to get this big, much less in such a short time.\" Sweat forms on her brow as she rubs the back of her head with growing nervousness as she goes on. \"You may just be the biggest naga in all the lands! Ehhehehe..he..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana was quite surprised by this, if not even a little shocked. She was finding it truly hard to believe that she was the biggest naga in existence. She thought there were surely more like her. Maybe even more bigger than her, but to learn that she was the biggest... She looked at Aurora. \"Is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora nods. \"Yes. Not even Malika is as big as you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana looks away from her mother and up at the daytime sky, thinking of it. She was truly a giant among giants... She looks down at her mother, feeling like she has butterflies in her stomach, even though the only thing in there was a giant fowl, soon to be digested. She easily Dwarfs her in size, but she can't decide if this was good or bad to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, she was happy to be the biggest naga, one with many more choices in prey than all the others, but on the other hand, at this size, she could easily get other ideas in time, especially now that she knew she was one of the highest on the food chain. But was that really a good thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke in a hesitant tone to her mother. \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora looks confused and nervous. \"Y-yes, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllana had only one question she wanted to ask, but something was holding her back. The words were being choked back by uncertainty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would she do? Would she ask the real question that had her confused, or would she ask a delaying question to put it off until later on. Either way, now was the time to pipe up or she may worry her mother more that intended. The question on her mind was already worry enough for her...</span></div></div>",

We promised to always love each other, didn\u2019t we?\u201d The red haired child said. Despite the brave words, deep blue eyes were welling with tears. <br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026you\u2019re leaving for 5 years! At least! How can you be so sure that you\u2019ll still love me? You\u2019re going to be meeting people from your own race, could you still love a\u2026a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA naga?\u201d asked the human. Her green eyes looked back up at her fiery haired lover. The human placed a hand on her brown mop of hair. After a few moments it lowered to her chin, forcing the girl to look back up. <br>\r\n\u201cThen let this be proof that you are the only person in this world for me\u201d the human said before their lips met. They stayed like that, joined together for at least a few minutes. When their lips parted, the tears had stopped but the naga held an uncertain look in her eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cI have to go now Lily. The caravan should have already arrived and they\u2019ll come looking for me.\u201d The human pulled the naga into a warm embrace while speaking. \u201cI only have to live with them until I\u2019m considered an adult. When that happens, I\u2019ll come back to you. Wait for me by the oak tree in the summers. When we meet again\u2026I\u2019ll make you my bride\u2026\u201d <br>\r\nThe human pulled back and looked at Lily one last time. Her messy brown hair, her emerald eyes, and her long brown tail. Lily couldn\u2019t stop her sobbing to respond. With a final kiss on her forehead, the human turned and began to walk back towards the far off cabin. After a few steps, Lily gathered her voice, closed her eyes, and yelled \u201cI\u2019ll be there Nat! I\u2019ll wait for you as long as it takes! Even if we change, I\u2019ll be there for when we\u2019re adults! And then\u2026then\u2026THEN I\u2019LL MATE WITH YOU!\u201d A deep flush came over her face before she fled into the woods. Nat smiled and continued onward towards the cabin, where a small group of armed individuals were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, then what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last time I saw him. This is the fifth year since he left, and I\u2019ve been waiting for him every year since then. Once I see him again, I have to make it clear that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat you turned out a lesbian after screaming you\u2019d sleep with him?\u201d asked her friend with a smirk. Lily shot a glare over to her friend Mana. She had befriended the blonde naga around a year ago, she had short hair, green eyes, and a golden tail with a yellow underbelly. They were on good terms despite one of them being human sized and the other giant. She had come over and wanted to know why Lily was hanging around the giant oak tree.<br>\r\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s that. I also want to let him down subtly; I really did love him when we were young. Even now I can\u2019t help but feel it for him. He was tall, cool, and was good looking\u2026but there was no way for me to know that I\u2019d end up liking girls!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow good looking are we talking? The handsome ones always taste better\u2026\u201d she teased. Lily just smirked.<br>\r\n\u201cVery. He has this fiery red hair, deep blue eyes, and a feminine looking face. While he probably does taste good, there\u2019s no point in eating him. I was so scared of him getting eaten when we were kids that I snuck into my aunt\u2019s cave and stole one of her potions to make him indigestible. He\u2019d just stay in your gut, and also I\u2019d prefer if you don\u2019t eat my friends!\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but cringe at the memory of her punishment by her Aunt. A week in her belly\u2026all for a boy that ended up never needing the protection.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, maybe I should just scoop him for myself, tall, handsome, and won\u2019t die in my belly\u2026but there\u2019s one more part I need to know about\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026the \u201clittle Nat\u201d\u2026or if it\u2019s a \u201cbig Nat\u201d\u2026\u201d Lily\u2019s face flooded with crimson as she snapped over to look Mana in the eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I never saw it! Geez, knock it off will ya?! I didn\u2019t exactly follow him to the bathroom when we were kids!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so you never saw it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you know he\u2019s a man?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou said he had a feminine face and you never saw his junk. How do you know \u201che\u201d wasn\u2019t just a tomboy?\u201d Lily was stumped. She had never considered this possibility before. They were 13 years old back then, so neither of them was maturing yet. The thought that her childhood love might actually work out for her made her heart flutter. By now, that would make Nat quite a beautiful woman. It was a possibility, except for\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cMana, you know that humans can\u2019t stand homosexuality. They have LAWS against it out there, so even if Nat was a girl he wouldn\u2019t love me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right\u2026well, I should probably head back before Nena gets hungry. Last time I was late she tried to eat ME\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Mana, I\u2019ll see you later\u201d Lily said. With that, Mana slithered down from her high branch and took off into the forest. All of these memories were making her feel nostalgic. Lily slithered down herself and stood in front of the base, staring at an old carving. L + NW FOREVER. Lily sighed as she felt along the grooves\u2026this was going to be hard. If Nat came back still in love with her she would have to turn him away. It made her a bit scared. A small part of her wished he would never show up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe caravan driver was scared. He was just a town to town merchant trying to get by, so of course he was good smuggling. Food, weapons, even people. But this time was different. The pouch of gold weighed heavy in his pocket, and he was worried about seeing a stampede of knights coming after him. Even with a hood on, he noticed the long red hair. Only the Webber family possessed red hair. Those groups of nobles were dukes and duchesses\u2026and he was now carrying their famous problem child. The child had been brought into the infamous naga woods as a child by the disgraced father. If they notice the child was gone, an entire battalion would butcher him. He nervously looked back at the hooded figure, who was simply staring at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat remembered all the time spent with Lily. Carving their initials in the oak tree, playing down in the river, her nasty attempt at making juice\u2026 She would be fully grown now. A deep fear that she wouldn\u2019t remember or care about Nat surfaced. While Lily had promised to wait, nagas ate humans. Why keep a promise to food? Nat\u2019s thoughts flooded back to the day the Webber family came to the cabin. A group of cousins, uncles and aunts were waiting in an impressive castle upon arrival. The most notable memory was Aunt Cassandra. She was incredibly beautiful, but would give the worst beatings. She would always justify herself by saying \u201cI\u2019ll make you a proper lady even if it breaks us both!\u201d<br>\r\nThe caravan hit a rock, shaking Natalie Webber out of her thoughts. Her hood had fallen off, exposing her long fiery hair. She hurriedly covered back up and looked towards the driver. He was facing forward. A sigh of relief escaped her rosy lips, if anyone knew she was a Webber they would likely bring her back in hopes of a reward. But there was no way she could allow that to happen. She had a bride to get to. Her family had tried to beet it out of her, but boys held no interest to her. Every arranged marriage had failed when she failed to appear at the altar. But that never stopped the next one. After all, she really had become a proper lady that every man wished to wed. It worried her that Lily might not like her new, gentler personality. She had fallen for the tomboy part of her after all\u2026<br>\r\nTaking a peak out the door her heart began to race.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where I get off. I thank you for your service, sir\u201d she declared. Hopping off the carriage, the man turned and called out to her.<br>\r\n\u201cMissy, this is the naga woods! You\u2019ll die in there!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe so, but I have some business to attend to inside.\u201d With that, she took off her hood and ran into the tree line with only her knapsack of supplies and clothes. Her lovely Lily would be there for her, she had to believe in that. Going off her memory, she estimated it would take an hour to reach their tree. Only an hour left before their reunion. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lily let her arms hang from her favorite branch. From her perch she could see the clearing around the great tree. It stood taller than even the largest of nagas, easily 300 feet tall. She only really left her perch to hunt or switch branches. The thing about waiting for a childhood romance is that it can get incredibly BORING. Hours just droned on with nothing to do but reminisce. Today was especially bad. There haven\u2019t been many humans around lately, so she\u2019s had to hunt deer for the entire week. She could really go for some humans to play with. As much as it embarrassed her, she had a thing for human women. Most of them would just run away, and Lily would eat them. But those oddballs that stuck around\u2026they all ended trying to run and digested. She really wanted to find a nice human girl that could move passed her species. One that\u2019s thin, sexy, gentle\u2026Someone that she could protect and tease. It\u2019s thoughts like these that make it hard for her to wait for someone she has to break up with. She could really go for some fun\u2026 It was then that she heard some bushes rustling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie Webber had been exploring the forest that she used to call home. Her first stop was the cabin that her father had built when she was just a baby. The forest was bringing back memory of her childhood. Her father was a large man with enough combat prowess to take down ten men. His name of Armand Hexler, he had dark hair and eyes with a long beard. He knew that his area of the forest isn\u2019t very crowded because of the berries that grew around it. The berries had poison in them, and the animals knew not to eat them. Without animals to hunt and poison fruit, humans and nagas alike stayed away. She never knew her mother as she had died giving birth. Her name was Camila Webber. Her father was a commoner at birth, but became a knight through radical service in the army. He was assigned to her mother as a bodyguard\u2026so of course their love was forbidden. They had covered up her pregnancy as long as they could before fleeing to the woods. The Webber blood was strong, and Natalie grew looking like her mother. <br>\r\nArmand was truly a strange man compared to other humans. He seemed to love everything there was in life. Social statuses weren\u2019t important to him, and he believed in true love. He had never taught her that homosexuality was evil like her Aunt did. When she told him about Lily, he just smiled and proclaimed \u201cLove is Love!\u201d <br>\r\nBut he was a man in 50s. When he grew sick, he knew that there was no way he could afford a doctor. So he traveled to the road and sent a message to the Webbers. He said that Natalie was the bastard child between Camila and another noble that eh heard had passed. He proclaimed that he felt guilty for kidnapping Camila and her unborn child. He made sure to explain everything to Natalie very carefully. She was to be raised by her mother\u2019s family, even if it resulted in his execution. She had refused at first, not wanting to leave Lily or lose her father. <br>\r\n\u201cNatalie, listen to me and engrave these words into your heart. I\u2019m just a sick old man that will be gone either way. You will move past me, and you don\u2019t have to worry about Lily. True love transcends everything, you will find a way back to her.\u201d<br>\r\nHer father was right, the proof being her presence back at her childhood home. She stood in front of her old home to find it destroyed. It appeared that a storm had caved in the roof. <br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026no place to live\u2026I hope Lily is fine with me staying with her\u2026\u201d she muttered. Being here allowed her to get her bearings and set off for the tree. Every step made her feel a little more nervous. What if Lily HAD changed? What if she didn\u2019t want her as a part of her life? What if she wasn\u2019t into women anymore? What if\u2026what if she had found someone else? The thought made her stop in her tracks. Natalie had held onto her love for the naga throughout the years\u2026but what if Lily couldn\u2019t? She was betting everything in her life for a predator that might not even love her anymore. At that thought, she slapped herself. She couldn\u2019t afford to have thoughts like these. If love truly transcends everything, she didn\u2019t need to worry. She kept moving onward. After a few more minutes she came upon a wide clearing with a large oak tree in the center. After pushing through some overgrown bushes she ended up falling onto the soft grass. Quickly scrambling up, dusting herself off, she then checked the surrounding area. Luckily she didn\u2019t see Lily anywhere. It would have been embarrassing for her to see Natalie fall on her face. She walked up to the large base of the tree with a smile on her lips. The carving she had made years ago was there. However, underneath it was a new one. \u201cYEARS APART\u201d was carved with 5 lines near it. She was the one who taught Lily to write, so it made her proud to see that she was applying it. Reaching into her bag she pulled out a knife to write another message.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch that, human\u201d someone angrily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily watched as the human entered the clearing. She was easily the cutest thing she had ever seen. She was wearing a plain hooded cloak, but underneath was an elegant blue dress. She had a slim build, but some nice assets. Long, red hair draped down halfway to her back. Her blue eyes looked around the clearing, as if scared of something. Given her stature, they were likely around the same age. It had been so cute to see her fall over. This girl was definitely her type. At least she could have a bit of fun\u2026she silently moved towards the lower branches while watching her approach the trunk. She was a little hungry at the moment, so she was debating eating her compared to flirting. She seemed like the timid type, so she would probably end up eating her either way. But the decision was clear when the girl pulled out a knife and put it up to her engraving.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch that human\u201d she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie looked up at the voice, but the sun was shining in her eyes. She could only make out the outline to a busty naga, but she knew. The one above her was the love of her life. Her Lily had grown up, but had actually waited for her. But why was she angry? Perhaps she didn\u2019t recognize her? That hurt a little, but it should have been expected. She had completely changed in her time away, but Lily should have at least pieced together the pieces. This called for some teasing.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello miss naga. Is this your carving? I say it and realized that this must be a very unique spot.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPut the knife away\u201d she ordered. \u201cThat carving is between me and someone special. This entire area is special to us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so? Well this person must truly be important for you if you claim such a magnificent area for the both of you. Pray tell, where is this special person.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know. We were separated years ago, and I\u2019m waiting for him to return\u2026\u201d Him? Did she just say HIM? Natalie may have been a tomboy but she couldn\u2019t believe Lily actually made a mistake like that.<br>\r\n\u201cTruly? How sad to hear, but at least you would NEVER forget that person right?\u201d she asked, venom lining her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily actually recoiled a little. Why was this human getting angry at her? Then she did something that made her see red. The human drove the knife deep into the trunk and looked up at her with challenging eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cOh that is IT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie hit the dagger right next to their initials. She had enough strength in the swing to keep it lodged in the bark. She was about to scold Lily for being so stupid when Lily made the first move. She saw the naga leap from her branch with her mouth wide open. <br>\r\n\u201cLily, NO!\u201d she cried out before\u2026</span></div></div>",

She coiled the tip of her tail around the branch to stop herself from hitting the ground. <br>\r\n\"Lily, no!\" she cried out. A second later her mouth hit the head of the terrified girl. Her lips stretched easily over her head. The momentum she carried from falling pushed Lily down all the way to the woman's knees. A muffled scream rang out from within her. Her head had shot straight through Lily's human stomach and had pushed into her snake stomach. The woman began struggling for her life, but it was far too late. Lily slowly released her tail from the high branch and placed herself on the ground. She straightened herself out to let gravity help her as she gave another swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Nat was terrified. Lily had taken in the majority of her body in a single swallow, leaving only her calves outside. She tried to scream, tried to fight, but the stretchy flesh muffled her voice and pushed against her on all sides. <br>\r\n\"Lily! Lily stop it! It's me, Natalie! Stop! Stop eating me!\" she begged. Instead, she felt herself get turned upside down and another swallow dragged her down to her ankles. Two more swallows and Natalie found her entire world to be a hot, wet and shifting tunnel of flesh. Her entire body was completely inside of the naga, slowly sliding into her lower half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally slowed down when her feet pushed into the snake stomach to join her. She felt a pressure from outside the soft walls squeeze around her, Lily was hugging her from the outside! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was panting when she finally got the woman's boots down her throat. That was by far the tastiest human she had ever eaten. She had swallowed her down so fast that she was only left with the remnants of her flavor. She watched the human shaped bulge slowly work its way down into her snake half. Looking over to her carving, she checked the damage. But to her surprise, the knife was wedged far away from her own marks. Why did the woman do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered herself to the ground and wrapped an arm around the woman trapped in her belly. \"Hey there, why did you avoid the carving? Were you just trying to make me angry?\" She placed a hand over the outline of her breast and gave it a squeeze. The woman squirmed heavily in response. \"Or were you trying to make me eat you? Well, mission accomplished!\"<br>\r\n\"Damnit Lily, let me go!\" she cried out. <br>\r\n\"Wait...you know who I am?\" she asked surprised. She let go of her breast and sat up straight. \"How do you know me?\"<br>\r\n\"You idiot! It's me! Natalie Webber!\" she yelled. That made Lily stop and think. Natalie? That name sounded familiar...But how? She looked over to her carving: L + NW. NW...Natalie Webber?! <br>\r\n\"...Nat?\"<br>\r\n\"YES!\" she screamed. Lily's blood turned cold at that. She turned over and immediately started to heave. Forcing her stomach muscles into reverse she began to bring her fiance out of her and into the open air. It was quite an unpleasant process, like throwing up without a break for about fifteen minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, Nat was left soaked in saliva but untouched by acids. As soon as she was free, she had backed a few feet back and glared at the naga girl. Lily looked apologetically at her, but also with curiosity. Nat was supposed to be a man, yet before her was a lovely woman who claimed to be the same person. She was far more beautiful than when they were children. Her long red hair, her supple curves, yet the same burning blue eyes... Mana's words rang out in her head that she couldn't know Nat's gender as kids.<br>\r\n\"Nat...is it really you?\" she asked carefully, like she would disappear if she was too loud. She remained silent, but nodded a yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily couldn't hold it back any longer...She let her emotions take over and leaped the distance between them and latched onto Natalie! Using unbelievable strength she hugged the human tightly and nuzzled her cheek to cheek. <br>\r\n\"Oh Nat!\" she exclaimed. Lily kept repeating her name over and over again while holding her close. Her eyes began to water up. But she needed more...she planted a small kiss on Natalie's lips. Her hands found themselves ripping apart her dress while she planted small kisses on the base of her neck, working her way up-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stinging sensation spread across her cheek. It didn't really hurt much, but snapped her back to reality. <br>\r\n\"Get off of me you horny lizard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip out of Natalie was much slower than the way in. It was hard to resist squirming against the tight muscles, but anytime she did it would only slow her exit. When she was finally outside she got away from the other woman. Now that the fear of becoming food was gone, anger was the only thing left. She glared at her supposed fiance, finally getting a good look. She was the taller one, easily over two heads larger than herself. Her messy brown hair was kept at shoulder length, but still held its mousy quality. Her emerald eyes refused to match her heated gaze. The most obvious difference though was her breasts. She was quite busty...her Lily had become quite the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat...is it really you?\" she asked. Knowing that she would only be able to speak with a sharp, cruel tongue she simply nodded. Then Lily shot forward and latched onto her! For a moment she was afraid Lily was going to eat her again, but noticed that she simply hugging her with misty eyes. <br>\r\n\"Oh Nat!\" She seemed so happy...Natalie was about to hug her back when Lily suddenly turned and kissed her! She froze in shock...until she heard the fabric of her dress rip. That was the last straw. She swung and slapped Lily as hard as she could.<br>\r\n\"Get off of me you horny lizard!\" she shouted. Lily pulled back in shock. She clearly wasn't expected to be rejected like that. <br>\r\n\"N-nat? What's wrong?\" she asked innocently. <br>\r\n\"What's wrong? What's wrong is that you just ate me! Did you think I've already forgotten?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily flinched. She had actually forgotten about that...<br>\r\n\"O-oh, right! I'm sorry about that, it's just-\"<br>\r\n\"Just that you were expecting a man?\" <br>\r\n\"Well...yeah, but-\"<br>\r\n\"Or are you just fine with anyone as long as they're humans? I also remember you grabbing my bosom when I was inside you.\"<br>\r\n\"That-!\"<br>\r\n\"And now you try to bed me because you assume me some common whore?\"<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" she screamed. Everything Nat was saying was true, and made sense, but...it was wrong! It was right, but wrong! \"Just...let me explain myself...\"<br>\r\n\"Hmph, fine.\" she huffed.<br>\r\n\"Well...I thought you were a man back when we were kids. I know you never said that, but I just assumed. Truth be told, it's actually better because I like women. I was worried about what to do when you showed up...\" Looking up, Nat still looked angry but wasn't going to interrupt. \"So when you came, I didn't think that it would be you. Then you pulled out the knife I thought you were going to attack our carving...so I ate you.\" <br>\r\n\"And?\" she asked, unsatisfied. <br>\r\n\"And about touching you like that...I admit that I was wanting to tease you. I tend to do that a lot with my meals...not that I eat a lot of humans! Only the ones that deserve it!\"<br>\r\n\"And?\" she asked again. Lily knew this would be the hard part...<br>\r\n\"AND...I missed you so much...and you're so pretty...and I wasn't really thinking about what I was doing. I don't think you're a whore, but I do want to mate with you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Nat's cheeks got rosy. \"W-well...I guess that explains everything. It shows that you need to think more, but at least it alleviates some of my worries.\"<br>\r\n\"Say...you've been talking like that for a while. And your dressed pretty nice now. And you grew out your hair...\" Lily was beating around the bush, but her real question was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know I've changed. But...\" Nat let out a heavy sigh. \"I love you. Even after being in your stomach, which I always wished would never happen, I still want to marry you.\" Lily finally perked up at Natalie's words, a bright smile coming over her face. <br>\r\n\"BUT! I want to do it right.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever it takes...\" Lily said dreamily. She slithered back over to Natalie and sat next to her. She leaned over and rested her head against her shoulder. <br>\r\n\"Well...first, I should meet your parents. After that, we need a ceremony.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that how humans do it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. I never asked, how do nagas marry?\"<br>\r\n\"We don't, we mate.\"<br>\r\n\"What's the difference?\"<br>\r\nLily smiled and licked her neck with a surprisingly long tongue. \"It means as long as we have sex with love in our hearts, we're together forever.\" Natalie was about to push back...but instead wrapped her arm around her larger companion. <br>\r\n\"Well...that comes later... for now, I'm exhausted. Is it alright if I...stay with you? My old home was destroyed...\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natalie could do nothing but scream as the love of her life completely took her entire body inside her mouth. She felt her lips clamp down her ankles before being sucked entirely in. It was impossible to tell before, but apparently Lily was actually a giant naga. When they were children she had yet to reach her growth spurt, so there was no way for her to know. <br>\r\nBut there was no time to think about that. Right now, she was busy screaming her head off as the giant tongue of her fiance was probing every nook and cranny of her body. The soft muscle was pushing her all around, and seemed to be focusing on her...sensitive areas... Terror was coursing through her...but she did notice that under different circumstances this could feel good. But those thoughts all flushed away when the maw tilted back and the throat opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was in bliss. This human woman...she was just too freaking tasty! It was a shame she had eat her...she was perfect. She was totally her type and delicious on top of it. But the little bitch had turned mean all of a sudden and messed with her carving. It was really hard making the marks that tiny! Her tongue wandered a bit and lapped at the assets she had been admiring. Given the immediate squirming the girl either loved it or hated it. But enough was enough, so she tilted her head back and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GULP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily you idiot! It's me!\" the girl screamed as she went down the tight throat. Lily perked up up at the mentioning of her name. She looked around but there was no one else around...<br>\r\n\"Huh? How do you know my name? Well, it probably doesn't matter anymore little cutie!\" she passed off. Without any more thought to the matter she climbed back up and waited for Nat to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside her gut, Nat was crying. She couldn't believe Lily. The girl that had promised to love her forever had just swallowed her whole. Even when she had cried out to her...She had just passed it off and ignored her. Now she was going to die in here. Her heart was aching. It felt like she was being ripped apart from the inside out. She felt so betrayed...All she could do was sob as acid began to drop down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours had gone by, yet Lily could still feel the human inside of her. Normally they would have been completely gone by now, yet the little red head still left a pleasant weight inside of her. Oh well, she'll probably be gone by morning... With that in mind she started to head back to her home tree. <br>\r\nWhile heading on her way she saw a familiar flash of gold.<br>\r\n\"So, any progress today?\" asked Mana. Lily smiled at her human sized friend before picking her off her branch and placing her on her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"No, he didn't show up today. But I did get a nice little surprise...\"<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I know that face. Did she taste that good, or was she just that pretty?\" her friend teased.<br>\r\n\"Both, definitely both. I lucked out today, she was totally my type. But she acted pretty weird and tried to attack my old carving.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, was she a fighter?\"<br>\r\n\"Not really...actually she's still just laying around in there...\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, she's still in there?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess she's taking a while to digest...\" Mana looked over with annoyed eyes<br>\r\n\"Lily, what did this human look like?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, she was thin and curvy. Plus she had this long red hair...\"<br>\r\n\"Like your friend Nat...\"<br>\r\n\"...these deep blue eyes...\"<br>\r\n\"Like your friend Nat...\"<br>\r\n\"...I'm guessing around my age...\"<br>\r\n\"Like. Your. Friend. Nat.\" She pointed out, ready to pull her own hair out.<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep saying that?\"<br>\r\n\"Lily listen to this description real quick. A human around your age with red hair, blue eyes, and doesn't digest comes directly to your tree. What does that make you think of?\"<br>\r\n\"Nat\" she replied, a bit confused.<br>\r\n\"And do you remember what I was talking about earlier when I said you couldn't tell the gender of Nat because you never the 'downstairs?'\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what does that have to do wi-\" Lily stopped moving as all the cogs began to move in her slow brain. Human+red head+ blue eyes=NAT! <br>\r\n\"SHIT!!!\" she screamed crouched down to force Nat out of her stomach. Mana quickly coiled around her neck to keep from falling off. Lily began to regurgitate as fast as could, forcing Nat's unconscious body into her waiting hands. A wave of relief came over her to see that she was still breathing...and then a deep blush as she saw her clothes and been melted off. <br>\r\n\"WOW! You said she was pretty but...WOW!\" Mana said, staring. \"Hey, if she's down with it do you wanna go for a three-way?\" Lily glared over as she placed a hand to cover the unconscious girl. She took off as fast as she could towards her tree to lay the girl down. <br>\r\nOnce arriving she quickly weaved together a makeshift bed out of leaves and covered Nat from the aroused eyes of Mana. Emotions long buried were flooding through her all at once as she gazed down at sleeping human. She had always been a woman. Her beloved Nat really was perfect for her. She had loved Nat as a person, but had tried to push away her emotions because she wasn't attracted to men. But Nat was a woman...and just her type too. She gently brushed some of the scarlet hair out of her face. This could still work out for them...<br>\r\nA cold shiver ran down her back as she realized that Nat may want to call it off. Sure she had returned just like she promised, but Lily had just ruined it. Instead of a heartwarming reunion she had swallowed down her fiance and ignored her cries. She had a deep pit in her stomach. The guilt and fear was only getting worse as she heard Nat rustling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Natalie react when she wakes up?</span></div></div>",

Her lovely blue eyes slowly opened, glancing in all directions. A tree...a bed of leaves...no clothes...a giant naga watching over her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hi Nat...\" Lily said, her voice nearly cracking with nervousness. <br>\r\n\"So...you finally recognized me, huh?\" Natalie said with a slight smile. \"Lily...come closer\" she said with a weak voice. The giant naga felt her heart pounding painfully hard in her chest, but she slithered a bit closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Closer...I need to tell you something...\" the human said, weakly reaching out a hand towards her childhood friend. Lily felt her guilt rising as Nat spoke so weakly. She must be traumatized from being swallowed alive like that. The giant naga moved slowly, trying not to startle her as she lowered her head down close to Nat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily...YOU FUCKING MORON!\" Natalie screamed, suddenly sitting up and punching Lily on the nose. The red head stood up and started to pound her little fists against Lily's surprised face, not hurting her at all. \"What the hell kind of reaction is that?! I sneak away from those noble bastards, manage to come all the way back these woods, avoid all the other nagas, just for you to EAT me when I show up?!\" she berated in an angry fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant naga took her blows, barely even feeling the impact. She really did deserve this much punishment...<br>\r\n\"And why the hell did you think I was a boy?! Do you realize how worried I've been that you wouldn't want to be with me anymore?!\" she yelled, her voice beginning to crack. Looking down at her, Lily saw that the little human was starting to cry as her punches weakened. \"Does...does this mean...you really don't want to be with me anymore?\" she asked weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily finally responded, scooping Nat into her hands and giving her a small kiss on the head. <br>\r\n\"Nat...I'm truly sorry that I swallowed you. I...I would never hurt you. It's been so long...I'm sorry I didn't recognize you right away. I'm not really the smartest girl in the woods. But...I love you. I really do\" she said, feeling her nerves fade away. This was her ideal situation...the human she fell in love with was a woman, just her type...and still wanted to be with her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie let out a tense breath, relieved to hear that it truly had been an accident. <br>\r\n\"Well...I love you too...you big dummy...\" she muttered, standing up in her palms to give her on her lower lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple, reunited, then decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natalie woke up cold. In a way, this helped, as this realization forced her to focus and take in her surroundings as quickly as possible. A bed of leaves, in a giant tree, inhabited by a treacherous giant naga. Natalie sized her up in the two ways she learned how - as one did a physical rival one was likely to scuffle with as she did when she was a child, as a rival lady at court who was engaged in schemes to benefit herself and might arrange for anyone else's downfall if it would help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither perspective looked good. Lily had grown to humongous proportions, and had the biggest home-field advantage Nat could imagine. Lily had also proven that she attached no value to human life and did not care enough to remember anything at all about those she struck deals with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hi, Nat,\" Lily said, her voice wavering as she saw the human's eyes had become filled with fear and betrayal. \"You grew up beautifully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do know me,\" Natalie responded neutrally, before responding on the same topic, \"You've grown in directions I scarcely imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that how humans talk to each other?\" Lily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ones I had to deal with,\" Nat responded, \"I did hope to get away from all that, but it seems to be the only thing you let me keep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly, why did you undress me while I was unconscious?\" Natilie maneuvered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, It's not that I undressed you... you just... lost your clothes inside me?\" Lily weakly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a moment, I dared hope that was a nightmare,\" Natilie said, covering her fear with anger, \"So, what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat, I'm sorry!\" the giant naga said, \"I didn't recognize you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find that hard to believe,\" Nat responded, \"But I'll let you elaborate. Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, well, I thought you were a boy, back then,\" Lily continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did imply such,\" Natalie admitted, \"But I've never hid my gender from anyone, for as long as I've lived. And the girl I fell in love with was no fool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily winced. Now that Nat mentioned it, she didn't remember her human friend ever calling themself a boy. When they were first getting to know each other, it hadn't mattered. She'd only applied the \"boy\" label later. \"W-well, you never said you were a girl either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That may be true. I always did focus more on my friend's actions when I thought back to those times,\" Nat admitted, starting to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat, I'm sorry. It was an accident,\" Lily tried to explain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Nat cut her off, \"The one thing I learned among my own kind that's actually <b>useful</b>: Accidents don't exist among adults. When someone says they did something accidentally, they're <i>really</i> saying that there isn't evidence of the conspiracy.\" She met the giant naga's eyes again, \"You planned on eating me the moment you saw me. When I began to realize that your side of our love had become a lie, you struck and savored my despair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat, no!\" Lily shouted, leaning back, \"It wasn't like that! I never planned on eating you!\" Except, that wasn't the truth was it? She had planned to eat that traveler, but she hadn't realized it was Nat. ...Except why didn't she? It wasn't like there was anyone else who'd visit their carving so purposefully... Hadn't she enjoyed dismissing Nat so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My beloved was not the kind of person who kills on a whim, Lily,\" Nat's logic seemed undeniable at the moment. \"You... She makes plans, and never lets anything get in the way of what she sets out to do...\" She slumped over, hugging herself. Her own argument was breaking her mind apart, \"We spent a decade together, so why wouldn't I have seen this coming...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True love conquers everything. Conversely... I... You...\" she breaks down crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily couldn't bear to look. Oh why <i>wasn't</i> this a Nightmare?</span></div></div>",

Ever since being reunited with her human family, she had been trained to withhold her emotions. Being swayed by something as fickle as emotions could be life or death in a court of nobles. Even with all the pain she held inside over the years, she never cried. Yet before the woman she loved, she was sobbing like a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer angry facade had crumbled apart in the strong current of her sorrow. The tears and the pain just wouldn't stop. Everything that had built up inside herself was flowing out all at once. She had dealt with physical and verbal abuse constantly. That was simple. But after being eaten by Lily... She felt so hurt and betrayed she just wanted to disappear. Maybe she should have just been digested...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat...P-please don't cry...\" Lily weakly asked. \"I honestly didn't know it was you...I would never try to eat you...\" She slowly reached a hand out towards Nat. She longed to make contact, to stroke her and hold her close. To tell her that everything was going to be alright. However, when Nat saw the giant hand approaching she recoiled in fear. \"I...I still love you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" she cried out. Lily's hand snapped back, not wanting to make things even worse. But it was too late. \"You love me? Is someone as merciless as you even capable of love?\" Nat curled back up and cried further at this. Did she really mean that? Not even she could tell at this point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily gasped in shock. It hurt for her to hear such a cruel thing from someone she loved. She felt awful. Was this how she made Nat feel? She even felt a little bit angry at her for saying such a thing. But it wasn't her fault, really. Nat was just lashing out her pain. Maybe she really did ruin their chances at love...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not the way their engagement ended! Sure she made some mistakes, but there was no way Lily would just sit back and lose Nat again over something so stupid as a misunderstanding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit Nat!\" she yelled. Her fist slammed into the bark of the tree, breaking a hole clean through to the other side. The tiny redhead shot up to attention and stared wide eyed, pausing her crying to outright quiver in fear. Lily wanted to apologize, but knew she needed to say this first. \"Look, I know I messed up. I've been an idiot for not even considering the possibility that you were a woman. I was so convinced that you were a boy back then that I couldn't be swayed.\" Seeing that Nat still hadn't moved, she lowered her voice to a calmer tone. \"Everything seemed so perfect back then...it was hard to imagine that things weren't as they seemed. But I truly do love you. From the bottom of my heart I do, and I'm sorry that I swallowed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie loosened up a bit and just stared, listening to the giant naga explain herself. Lily even started to tear up a bit as she continued.<br>\r\n\"I understand if you're still mad at me...or even outright scared of me. But you don't need to be afraid of me, never. I just want...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped her speech as hot tears started to stream out her eyes. Nothing else was coming to mind, but Nat had stopped crying. She appeared to be in deep thought. With nothing else in mind, she tried once more to reach out. Her giant hand extended over and gently stroked Natalie's back. The human girl flinched, but made no protest<br>\r\nagainst the huge appendage.<br>\r\n\"Please Nat...This might be selfish of me, but I want this...us to work out. I...I want <b>you</b>. More than anything else, I want you to love me...So if you'll have me...\" she trailed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat was silent. Lily's confession was easing off the pain...and her stroking fingers felt so good... Natalie begins to...</span></div></div>",

Do you know why that may be?\u201d The naga thought for a moment then said, \u201cWell, you said you went to sleep with a fresh catch, right?\u201d \u201cYeah, a big human man, more brawn than brains.\u201d Rosetta answered. \u201cHmm\u2026 It is possible, it\u2019s rare but not unheard of; you must be an Absorber.\u201d The naga said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d Rosetta asked in confusion. \u201cAn Absorber, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve never heard of them before.\u201d The naga laughed. \u201cActually, if it\u2019s common knowledge to nagas, I wouldn\u2019t know. I only became one last night.\u201d Rosetta admitted. \u201cReally? Wow, that\u2019s\u2026 that doesn\u2019t happen too often.\u201d The naga said with a hint of awe. \u201cAny way, what are Absorbers?\u201d Rosetta asked. \u201cThey\u2019re a very rare breed of naga, whatever they eat is completely absorbed into their bodies. The more you eat the bigger you\u2019ll get until you\u2019re a giant. There is a point where you won\u2019t grow anymore, but that\u2019s probably for the best. And anytime you eat something intelligent, it\u2019s knowledge and spirit will be absorbed into yours.\u201d The naga explained. For a moment Rosetta thought it was too farfetched, but on a whim she closed her eyes and delved into her memory. To her surprise she saw Glok\u2019s memories in a secluded corner of her mind.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happeness now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had flash-lights and where shining them about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep look out, if Glok dissapeared last night, were not going to test a night for the next person to dissapear.\" the older one said. He was well dressed, skinny and known as the smartest person. His glasses were specially made, but noone knows how special. His name was Ian The 10 year old was also skinny but was more into going into Action than thinking through. His name was Mark. You knew them both but what will they think of you as a naga?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glok was one, but if it gets to the second person or if we get a lead-off, we can find out whos doing this.\" Ian said. He flashed his light at the ground and moved it side-to-side. Ian was also had a glove he told you that he invented. It was a shock glove that uses waves of high voltage electricity to fire at people / enemies. Mark was holding an AK-47 with a flashlight attached to it. They moved slowly so they can get a good look of the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian, i don't know why were doing this but, if its something exciting to do, i'll do it.\" Mark said. Ian had stopped at the naga track thet you left after taking Glok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this mark.\" Ian said. bending down to get something. He grabbed what seemed to be a peice of your Undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Ian? just look like a peace of fabric.\" mark said. covering Ian back while he studies the peice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats the point, since when do nagas wear cloths? and also, i think i've seen these designs from a pair undergarment somewhere.\" Ian said. Ian poketed the peice of fabric and stood up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've just got our lead-off. Lets go see Rosetta\" Ian said. Mark lowered his gun and both Mark and Ian started to walk in your house's direction. You slithered quickly across the area and made a loud Hissing noice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?!\" Mark yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounded like it came from overthere.\" Ian said. pointing in your direction. Mark loaded his gun amd Ian Activated his Spark Glove. They both started to walk to your direction till you quckly slithered left to the next house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see that Ian?!\" Mark asked. Mark had seen you slither to the next house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and i think we don't need to follow it anymore.\" Ian said. He deactivated his spark glove and adjusted his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Mark asked.</span></div></div>",

You see, the leader of a mission to kill a naga was Glok, and the event of his disappearance happened on the same night. There was only one person who was hurt during the mission. The person that was hurt is the person that was bitten by, what soldiers claim to be, a male naga with no fangs. If I remember correctly, a fangless male nagas who bites humans have a strange effect on humans. This Effect is that the human will turn into a naga by night and back to human by day. Since this person was bitten and used as bait during the mission, that person wanted revenge and went after the person who arranged the mission, Glok. Plus, the peace of an undergarment I found had a design, a design I know very well. The killer is none other than so. Come on out, ROSETTA!\" He demanded. You were shocked how a 16 year old boy is smart enough to solve it already. You slithered out so they can get a good look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was me, Rosetta, who killed Glok, and-\" <br>\r\n\"And ate him. By my search through the corpses found by the Escorts, I didn't find Gloks body, so since nagas are part snake and swallow their food whole, you had the idea since your going to look like a naga, why night be one? so you swallowed him whole and went to digest.\" He had the LOOK min his eye, this 'LOOK' was his look of disappointment. He gives this look to people who are too stupid for Ian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what\u2019s your defense, naga? you can't stop me and Mark, you know very well that were unstoppable together.\" Ian said. He activated his spark glove and started to fist-up to charge the glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....I\u2019m sorry,....I wanted revenge because I was being used as bait, and even worse was that it wasn't even in my free will.\" you said. Ian looked you, confused and disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know what to do. Rosetta, a naga, an enemy to the Human-Race and a friend to me. Should I fire at will? or see what happens next? if I see what happens next and she gains my trust, she will eat my then Mark. Soon later the village population will go down slowly.\" He mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slithered a little closer but stopped because mark cocked his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what your heart tells you, am I your enemy? or a naga friend?\" you said.

However, something went wrong and no reports had come from the Facility in weeks. Only in desperation was Mira\u2019s team sent to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Facility stretched downward nearly two thousand feet into the soil, completely hiding it underground.

These huge rooms and tunnels were likely for missiles and other weapons the Facility was developing; there was another network of rooms and tunnels of smaller size including labs, barracks, mess halls, and recreation rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira felt uneasy, no matter where she looked there was nothing.

Without pause a huge snake tail wrapped around them pinning their arms to their sides and forcing their guns away. Mira followed the tail, which seemed to go on for at least a hundred feet, with her eyes to its owner. Where the tail stopped started a gigantic woman\u2019s waist. From there it went on to a giantess's chest and head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA naga giantess.\u201d Terra whispered nervously, \u201cI thought the Animal-Hybrid and Giant Size projects were being done separately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently not.\u201d Mira whispered back, remembering the briefing they received earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSplendid, finally some females,\u201d the naga said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, she\u2019s going to eat us.\u201d Terra moaned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anlonger i'll have to do it myself.\" Said Felicia. Hunting human was a very hard thing but when taught to young children, it will improve their hunting skills. It would also make it easier because their also giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay lets go\" Selina said.

I will show you how to get them by getting 1 of them, the other two are for yoll.\" she said. She started to slither up the wall untill she almost reached the edge of the platform. She looked up and slowly slithered ontop of the platform. The girls could hear loud screamings and yelling untill their mother returned. When she slithered infront of you, the chopper on the platform was in he air. Selina did some damage to it and it fell and crashed into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, your turn Rachel\" Selina said. Rachel did exactly what her mother did. She slithered up the wall and found that the area was trashed. There was one man looking th eopposite direction. You quickly coiled around him and dragged him to where her mother and Felicia were waiting. You had the human in your coils and he was trying to escape. What looked odd about this human was that he was in a tight bullet proof vest and wearing and gas-mask with glowing blue eye lence. On his suit arm patch it said 'Homo Sapiens Combinus'.

She then asked, 'why are you doing this? are you releasing me?' it was a hard question to answer. I had to tell her the truth. I told her but she didn't care, She just wanted to know why I am doing this? I told her 'I just wanted to give you something to try and forgive me on what I have to do, it isn't my fault, its just....work.' she ate the cake and I wondered to myself 'does she forgive me?' She hugged me and gave me a little lick with her forked-tongue and said 'yes, I do' It was a good feeling and that was that........I shackled her up but she still didn't lose her forgiveness in me.....I still wonder if she still forgives me or not.....I think she may because I out of all 6 of the scientist in the science team, I survived.\" Felicia had a tear in her eye, she must be picturing things too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I became a priminister of Sector 17 and the jobs going good.

How do we have kids?\u201d Felicia asked with mild annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelina chuckled before she started explaining. \u201cIt was difficult for me to figure out how you could continue our species, but a few years ago I found a way. First you\u2019ll need to find a suitable human, and you know how I feel about men so you\u2019d better find a woman for this. Then you remove all their clothing and anything on their person. And then finally you bring them down here,\u201d she paused and pointed to her sex, \u201cand push them in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I get it. We get them into our womb which then turns them into a naga like us.\u201d Felicia said excitedly. Rachel found this exciting as well, but she kept it hidden better than her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Felicia. Now I suggest you don\u2019t do it right after you move out. You should be well settled by proper resources before you think about having children. And I also strongly recommend you have only one at first, after she\u2019s eight or so you can think about another. I love you two very much, but you were such pains when you were little.\u201d Selina said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s time we got to sleep girls. I guess I should say ladies now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night didn\u2019t go by swiftly for Selina, but morning came all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye Rachel. Goodbye Felicia.\u201d Selina said hugging them in turn, \u201cI know you\u2019ll both do great things out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye Mom\u201d Rachel relpied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll visit you soon.\u201d Felicia promised. With the goodbyes said the two nagas slithered together from their old home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went the same way for almost an hour before they went their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo long Sis. I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d Rachel said as she hugged Felicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you too, Sis. See you around.\u201d Felicia replied as she returned the embrace. And then the two left each other, heading on their own paths to new parts of the forest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Felicia always was more reckless than her sister, and as much as her mother\u2019s suggestion was taken to heart, she wanted to be a mother very soon. She listened carefully for the sounds of human females and to her joyful surprise she heard a pair of fairly young female voices not too far away. She slithered towards the voices eagerly giggling to herself \u201cHere comes Mommy\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t fair!\u201d the first voice cried, \u201cI\u2019m just a civilian.

Rachel slithered and the voices were getting louder and louder until she found Humans. 1 child, 2 teens and 3 adults wearing white masks with glowing eye lenses. You know they were forcing into the forest but not with KIDS AND TEENS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think just because our combinus units you can disobey an order from 880?

Driven by her hunger Rachel attack viciously grabbing the white masked men and tossing them down her throat into her belly before they could react.Then seeing the teen and crying child trying to run she circled around them cutting off any hope for escape with her coils. Now that she had them trapped with nowhere to go Rachel took the time to really examine them. The teen that had spoken back against the men she ate was a boy who looked to about 16-17 years old and was glaring at her defiantly. The other teen was a girl of approximately 15-16 years old who was trying to comfort the child while casting fearful looks at her. The child was a little girl that appeared to be about 9 years old and was currently hysterical with fear. The boy, who appeared to be the spokesperson for this little group, spoke up with a bravado he clearly didn't really feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to eat us now?\" he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly curious Rachel questioned, \"Why would I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a giant naga that's what your kind doesn't right?\" he asked, \"I mean eating humans that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes,\" responded Rachel, \"Your kind is a delicacies for us nagas. But why would I eat you? I am already quite full as you can see.\" As Rachel said this she patted her largly distended and wriggling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said the boy, \"Are you going to keep us around until you get hungry again and eat us or are you going to let us go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bryan,\" hissed the girl, \"Don't give the giant predator ideas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara,\" said Bryan, \"You, me, and little Tina deserve to know even if she's scared out of her wits. Besides its not like asking is going to influence her decision one way or another you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was impressed with their relative calm acceptance usually prey either didn't know she was coming or tried to beg pathetically for their own lives even going so far as to offer others in their place. While pondering what do with these curiously brave children she remembered what her mother told her and realized that she could unbirth these children and make them her own; but she then remembered what her mother said about how difficult it was to look after more than one child.<br>\r\nSuddenly realizing that she had been quite for an awkward length of time she turned to the children and said, \"Who says that I'm going to eat you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you'll let us go?\" asked Sara hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I can't let you go but I do have an alternative if your willing to hear it.\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do then?\" asked Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make you my children,\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you'll be our new mommy?\" asked little Tina with such hope and sadness in her voice that Rachel's heart ache from hearing it.<br>\r\nRachel looked sharply at the little girl, \"What do you mean child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She means that when we were chosen to be bait our parents objected and were killed right in front of us as an example of what would happen if we didn't obey,\" stated Bryan in a dull, flat voice.<br>\r\nWell shoot thought Rachel that puts an end to my tentative plans of eating one or two of the older ones and keeping the others or just Tina as the case may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to make us your kids miss snake lady? You gonna adop us?\" asked Tina timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Rachel,\" said Rachel, \"And no I'm not going to adopt you, instead I'll unbirth you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is unbirth and how would you do it?\" asked Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Rachel with a smirk unbirth is the opposite of giving birth and I'd do it by stripping you naked and shoving you up into my womb. Then nine months later I'd give birth to as my little giant naga babies. Well what do you say do you want to be my children or shall I eat you instead?\"<br>\r\nSara was blushing at the mention of being stripped naked but shakely agreed to being one of Rachel's children with her brother and younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Rachel, \"I'm sure we'll be one happy family.\" Now she thought how am I going to go about this? I definitely have to unbirth Tina it'd be to risky to wait for the two years until I'm ready to unbirth again, but what to do with the teens? She could make them one or both of them wait two years then unbirth them or she could unbirth all three of them at once. </span></div></div>",

Although Rachel's belly had stop writhing and was now three quarters its previous size it was still an intimidating sight for the three child, even so they followed Rachel's orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright now that you've got all your clothes off Tina's first. Crawl into mommy's pussy honey, crawl all the way into mommy's womb,\" said Rachel in an oddly gentle and loving voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay I won't be the baby anymore,\" cried a suddenly excited Tina as she crawled into Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was surprised by the rush of pleasure she felt , she had never experienced anything like it before and as Tina wriggled inside of her trying to get into her womb Rachel couldn't help but grope her breasts with one hand while the other she used to finger her sex as she moaned and groaned from the sensations. As this was going on she managed to notice that the strange appendage between his legs had gone stiff and was pointing up while he tried to hide it blushing. AS far as Rachel was concerned everything was going well until she heard Tina's voice inside her, \"Mommy I can't go in any further there's something in the way and I'm stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was confused wondering what inside her could be stopping her daughter-to-be from getting into her womb. But it seemed that Bryan knew what was going on because he went digging through the left over gear and came back with a sheathed knife. \"Have Tina cut through the barrier with this then bring it back out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel did as Bryan asked and it was pleasurable for her right up until Tina cut open the barrier and then it hurt and Rachel couldn't help but unintentionally tense up in reaction. She whirled on Bryan, \"What was that!\" she asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah mommy you're squishing me,\" yelled Tina from inside Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your hymen breaking it always happens the very first time something penetrates the pussy for human woman  and apparently Naga woman as well,\" replied Sara, \"You should relax so you don't hurt Tina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel did as Sara said and Tina resumed her journey into Rachel's womb and the pleasure resumed for Rachel as well accompanied by her groping,fingering, moaning, and groaning. Just as Tina finally reached Rachel's womb Rachel came for the first time and was nearly overwhelmed by the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that felt fantastic your next Sara,\" said Rachel. And the experience repeated itself except that this time Rachel was more sensitive from her previous orgasm and came once when Sara was half way to her womb and again when Sara pulled herself inside Rachel's womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn Bryan,\" said Rachel with and eager voice and gleam in her eye. Rachel was not disappointed it was just as good when Bryan crawled into her womb as when Sara did so. Panting Rachel lay on her side recovering from her last orgasm , her belly nearly twice as big now then when she had eaten those three men; she was feeling oddly full almost bloated and very content as she rolled over onto her back. She felt something shift inside and realized her move might have gotten one of her babies hurt, \"Are you kids alright in there?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine,\" replied Sara, \"You just caught us by surprise when you moved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch,\" cried Tina, \"These rope like things bit us on the bellybuttons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there is now a membrane surrounding us with some sort of fluid coming in on the other side of it,\" said a worried Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry children that's mommy's body making sure that you're safe and will get all the nutrients you'll to become healthy naga babies for mommy,\" said Rachel as she watched swell even larger and become a taunt round ball on her torso. \"Now go to sleep and when you wake up you'll be nagas just like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can we keep our names when you give birth to us again,\" asked Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you may sweetie,\" cooed Rachel to the little lives now inside her and now dependent on her for survival. Lazily swishing her tail back and forth Rachel began to daydream of what the future might hold and then fell into a restful slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later Rachel woke to sharp hunger pains and the sound of men marching toward her so she rolled over and hide out of sight. Not 15 seconds later a group of nine men marched into the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread out and search the area,\" bellowed the leader, \"This is last known area of the missing bait and capture group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot giving them time to follow their orders Rachel attack and shoveled men down her throat as fast as she could. Several minutes later when Rachel had finished the last one (The leader) she rubbed her hands over her now grossly distended pregnant belly and groaned, \"I shouldn't have over indulged,\" then she smiled and continued, \"but I'll need all the food I can get for my new babies who are growing inside of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly giggling Rachel left the clearing and returned to her hidden lair to make preparations for the children she was now expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive and a half months later Rachel was entering the clearing where she would meet with her mother and sister for their bi-annual get togethers. Her stomach was astonishingly bigger than one would expect it to be at nine months pregnant with a single child though she explained it away as the result of having triplets. Arriving at the clearing Rachel saw that her sister, Felicia, was already there waiting she gasped in surprise when she saw Rachel, \"Your pregnant already and I thought for sure you'd wait longer than me to get pregnant. What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well something happened that left me with this as the best option considering the circumstances. I'll tell you more when mother gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Rachel and Felicia's mother Selina slithered into the clearing with a pregnant belly even larger than Rachel's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom what happened! How did it happen?\" squawked Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect that it was similar to what happened with you dear,\" said Selina, \"but I want to hear how you became pregnant before I share my Story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rachel told her mother and Felicia about how the strange men had brought children out as bait to try to lure her and/or her family out to be captured, and how she had decided to unbirth the children, what happened when she did and all the patrols and wild life she had attacked since then in order to feed her growing babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very similar to what happened to me right down to killing the children's original parents the only difference is that I ended up unbirthing a pair of male and female twins a week before you got yours, so I will be giving birth to quadruplets. I don't know how I will manage them. Additionally I am concerned with the increased patrols they are starting to get close to our lairs we may have to fall back deeper into the forest to a communal lair both for mutual protection and for the protection of the little ones we will be having. Felicia should also be on the look out for men using children as bait and use your best judgement. Now that all the serious stuff is out of the way who wants to go hunting with mom for old times sake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with brilliant grins that Felicia and Rachel said in unison, \"I do I do!\"</span></div></div>",

It was serrounded by 30 Combinus units and all welding Shotguns. The choppers blades were spinning and ready to take off. A door opened and Selina saw a familiar face. It was one of the survivors of the Experementing team at the facility that used to be there. You remembered there were 6 scientist but only killed 5. He was young in the ages between 25 to 35. (yes, a young child was testing on a naga) He was being escorted to the chopper by 3 combinus units. The chooper was very heavy metal and had auto-aim turrets on the sides, this last scientist must be needed alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All units, dispatch to the forest.

Sam's dream was about her and Alex having a relaxing picnic on top of a hill while watching the sunset. They then took each other in their arms and had a love filled kiss. Alex's dream was similar, except his was a bit further along in their relationship; he was dreaming of a romantic wedding ceremony between the two! They were both blushing in their sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sun rose again, Alex was the first to wake up... With surprising results... Alex awoke on a flat, skin-colored surface. He looked around in confusion and noticed two massive mountains; one on each side of him. Looking forward again, he saw an expansive flesh-colored plain that seemed to go on forever. It was completely flat with the exception of one large crater near the horizon. He then heard what sounded like a feminine yawn. He quickly put 2 and 2 together, and he realized just where he was; he had wakened up in the middle of Amy's cleavage! The massive mountains were now recognized as her boobs, the vast plain as her stomach, and the crater as her bellybutton! His first reaction was wondering what had happened. At first he thought that he had somehow shrunken, but looking down off the edge of Sam's chest, what he saw proved otherwise. The once massive trees below were now slightly shorter than Sam's massive form; it was obvious now that <i>SHE </i>had grown! Alex knew that some nagas grew to be quite large, but he never knew that they had such massive and sudden growth spurts! Just then, Sam awakened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*yawn* Good morning Alex... Alex? Alex, where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then looked around to see that she had outgrown most of the trees around her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Did I grow? Oh, please don't tell me that I crushed him! Alex! If you're still alive, say something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shouted out at her from between her breasts, and she just barely heard the squeaking sound of his voice. She looked down to the source and located Alex. She then scooped him up and pressed him against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alex! I was so worried about you! I thought that I might have crushed you! But why were you between my boobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just where I woke up... Nice growth spurt, by the way. You look beautiful from this angle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Alex... But I'm scared. This isn't normal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Don't a lot of nagas grow to giant size like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are grand nagas. They are born at about human size and grow steadily over the course of their lives. I'm just an ordinary naga. I shouldn't ever have grown past human size! Even if I were a grand naga, it would have taken years to reach this size naturally... It doesn't make sense that a normal naga like me would outgrow a grand naga in just one night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe it has something to do with being around me... Have you ever hung out with humans before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Although most of them run away at the sight of me, I do have a few human friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Well, maybe it has to do with the fact that I love you... Have you ever had a boyfriend before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I haven't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not. You're absolutely beautiful! But I think that we have our answer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, you don't honestly think that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any better explanations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but... It just doesn't make sense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, a lot of things in this world don't make sense. I'm a human, and yet I've fallen in love with a naga! I doubt that makes much sense either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really do love me, Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sam, I really do love you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Alex! You're so sweet! I love you too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then took Alex in her arms and gave him a tight, yet very gentle hug. They held each other for several minutes before Sam started glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly The glow faded, and Sam started ________.</span></div></div>",

She smiled at Alex and slithered up to hug him. Just as she was about to, however, Alex jumped out of the way. Sam was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Alex? I'm back to normal now! Don't you still love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, Sam. It's just that... Something weird is happening. Whenever we hug, you seem to change size. The first time we hugged was right before we fell asleep, and you became that massive overnight. Then we hugged again, and you went back to normal. I think that we need to be careful with this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I love you, Alex. I want to be able to hug you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Okay, but just a quick one. We still don't know whats going on with you, and I'd say better safe than sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Alex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then moved in and hugged Alex. She released him a second later, and realized that she was growing again. This time, however, she only gained about a foot and a half before she stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... I really grew again! You were right Alex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I think that I noticed something else about your growth. Last night, we fell asleep hugging each other; and we both know how big you were when you woke up. But this time, we only had a quick hug. Your growth this time was noticeably less extreme than last night. I think that the length of  the hug affects how much you grow, and a second hug while you're still big reverses the effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right Alex! That really seems to make sense now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! So, my naga girlfriend, what are we going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pulled a strand of her long red hair away from her sapphire blue eyes and tucked in behind her elf-like ears as she caught a scent. She followed the trail for only a few minutes when she came upon a female naga fighting down a human female. The naga had soon incapacitated her prey and was about to devour the woman when she saw Ilirea. \u201cOh, good morning miss.\u201d The naga said with a bow, \u201cI was about to partake in breakfast with this young catch, but you may have her.\u201d Ilirea smiled and shook her head. Giant nagas like her were revered, almost worshipped, by the normal sized nagas; under their laws she had the power, and right, to take the prey of a smaller naga if she so wished. In fact she could eat the smaller nagas if she wanted to. \u201cThank you little one, but I prefer to catch my own prey. It\u2019s much more rewarding.\u201d Ilirea replied the smaller naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny naga\u2019s face lit up with joy as she bowed her head to Ilirea. She then turned to the woman in her coils and said, \u201cI guess you\u2019re stuck with me sweetie.\u201d Ilirea smiled as the smaller naga started engulfing her catch, and then started off to find some prey for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlirea had been at her hunt for about another thirty minutes before she\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From there she waited for whatever was out there to make its next move, fairly confident she could handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something pop out of the trees running toward the girl as it was rushing her with a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ducked down to dodge the sword and thrust her kunai forward toward the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature makes a popping noise as a cloud of smoke appears relieving it was a tree stump.

Whatever this thing was it seemed to know some ninja techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she cut the vine more vines pop out and started to go after her and then the distant there was a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a growl as she hacked at the new vines. While she did that she pulled another kunai from her belt and threw it toward where she heard the chuckle.<br>\r\nAll you could here is the kunia make a thud as it hit a tree. But as the girl kept slashing away more and more vines sported out of the ones she cut until she was surrounded<br>\r\n<i>Why won\u2019t you damn things just die!?</i> She thought angrily as she pulled out a third kunai and kept it in her other hand. She look around wildly, searching for an opening to attack, or if necessary flee through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she heard the chuckle again, but then it broke out into a loud and long evil laugh. Suddenly the vines went turning into snakes as they wrapped around her hands and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the-!\u201d The girl cried out, finally uttering words since she came out here. She tried to break free but the snakes holding her were too strong for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the figure showed itself in front of the girl.

Mizuki was almost 16, had green eyes, and black hair she kept tied back in a ponytail. She wore a low neck shirt that revealed some of her still developing cleavage and a short skirt, both were a dark red, she also wore a pair of black legging, her elbow length gloves were the same material and color.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHigh Master Ayako was much older, but the only sign of that age was the grey poking through her brown hair that she kept in a bun. She was dressed in an elegant white robe trimmed with gold. The High Master stopped at the door to her room and spoke to Mizuki \u201cThe other Masters felt that you weren\u2019t ready. And I agree with them, since a young ninja\u2019s place is not questioning the decisions of her masters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u2026\u201d Mizuki muttered to herself as the High Master opened the door to her room. She was two ranks behind the other girls in her age group, and given her skills she should have been ahead of them. The masters often commented and praised her in the group and private lessons, so why were they holding her back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the High Master now in her room with a door between them, Mizuki headed back to her room with a rock-hard expression. The academy had five levels to it: the ground floor was training rooms and entrances/exits to the village, the academy gardens, and a hot springs; the second floor was filled with classrooms for the ninjas-in-training to learn math, reading, writing, history, general skills needed for daily life; the top floor was the smallest, and was just the High Master\u2019s chambers; The fourth floor was rooms for the Masters; and finally the third floor was the rooms of the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when Mizuki was on the third floor, and in the privacy of her room that she finally showed her emotions. She slammed her fist against the wall as tears began to form in her eyes. It was bad enough that she was being held back, but it was worse that she wasn\u2019t being told why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade, the naga, finally made it at the entrance of the ninja village by now the girl was in her snake womb to keep her safe from harm. \"So how am I gonna get in.\"she stares at the large wall around the village \"Hm.........I got it.\" She slithered over to a tree that was growing by the village wall, climbed up that tree and crawled along a branch that extended over the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Jade made her way to the ninja academy. \"So this is it.\"she smiled. Then drove for cover when she heard a door slam thought it was an alert, but later on realizing it was a ninja girl, who was probably mad inside the building. She waited outside to see who might show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one appeared. Mizuki was two levels down, crying herself to sleep without bothering to get under the covers or undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh Master Ayako was in the bedroom of her four room suite, she was taking off her robe and slipping into a more form fitting suit for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Jade decided no one was coming and silently slithered into the building.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One was a young student; the other was one of the masters. \u201cI just want to live on the top floor. Like the High Master. It\u2019s such a pretty view up there.\u201d The young girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is one of the privileges of her rank. Someday if and when you are a High Master you\u2019ll be able to get a room with that view.\u201d The master said patiently. The two of them continued on, never noticing Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thanks girls, that just made my job easy</i>. She slithered through the building towards the top floor. Avoiding ninjas that passed by her like she wasn`t even there \"This is too easy.\"she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy for Jade to enter the High Master\u2019s suite, which had no lock on the entry door. The main room she was now in was a fairly large room.  Directly ahead of her was a group of cushions for sitting around a tea table in front of a fireplace. Above the mantle hung an exquisite painting. Around her were a few other paintings, several potted plants and a couple vases. To her left was the High Master\u2019s bedroom and a meditation chamber. To her right was a private kitchen where the High Master could make herself a meal, or have a lower ranking ninja do it for her. The scroll Jade was searching for was hidden in the meditation chamber, where the energy of the scroll would be hidden by the residual energy of hundreds of meditations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn she's living the life.\" Jade said softly. She started to look around for the scroll, trying to be quiet so as not to wake up the High Master. </span></div></div>",

Something was wrong, she could feel it. She quietly got out of bed and snuck out of her room into the dark hallway. It was definitely passed curfew, and she\u2019d get into trouble if she was caught, but she had to make sure this feeling wasn\u2019t something dangerous. She went up the stairs and her feeling felt stronger. As she came to the stair up to the High Master\u2019s floor the feeling was even stronger. Whatever was causing it was up there. Mizuka silently began going over her arsenal of jutsus as she climbed the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade noticed someone trip her alarm and it meant it was time to go. She had no time to go out the front exit and decided to take an alternative route. She packs the scroll into a leather pouch at her hip. \"Time to go.\"she said as she smashes one of the walls making a exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe High Master heard the smash and was awake almost instantly.
