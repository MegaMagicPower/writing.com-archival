On the 18th of April the archery team kicked her off mainly because she was almost never their and she was getting bad at aiming when she was their. Since then Yukari did start gaining because of what she dose with her time now. She wakes up eats a big breakfast goes to school eats a lot at lunch goes home and do stuff that dose not require walking. She started getting flab on her stomach and thighs then everywhere else. Yukari did notice but she did not mind to much \"Hmm this is probably because I don't do much but I like how my body is softer now.\" Yukari now weighs 147 pounds (I have no idea now kg work :/) her belly is getting bigger it is around the size of half a soccer ball her breast are plumping up she (witch she likes.) her arms are flabby along with her plump legs and is forming a double chin. Yukari debated with herself for a little bit if she wanted to gain more after 10 minutes she figured their is no avoiding it mainly because she only walks to get food and go to the bathroom at her dorm. She ordered two pizzas and snacked on chips when waiting. After she ate the pizzas she started hurting but she did know that she was getting bigger witch she deiced to purposely get fat because she  liked being soft and she knew she was going to get more lazy. </span></div></div>",

Her boobs despite being big are small when compared to Mitsuru's they are like two cantaloupes her arm fat is all wiggly when she moves them around and like her face also jiggle and belly. Speaking of her belly it is trying to from a roll in the middle and when naked hang's to her crotch it is the biggest thing on her body with out a doubt. Her love handles make it almost impossible to wear jeans but they push her hips out adding a very sexy look to even those who are not fas.

She was pleased with this rare find and thought to herself, this will be the perfect option to make her feel her pain being forced to stay at home and being so close to the main protagonist before he died. So Aigis built the machine in 3 hours due to her supernatural speed and processor for a brain, the machine consisted of a chair that can extend in very wide angles, a tube that attaches to the mouth and holds onto the neck, and a gigantic vat that can hold all the fattening materials to pump her up with. With how fast the machine can pump and its ability to determine when to stop it will be no time before Yukari becomes a gigantic blob.

That's the only thing she asked herself. \"Must be nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on the bed getting ready to call it a night. \"I'm feeling hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a fridge Mitsuru opened it up and ate a fresh sandwich and sat down, eating, she looked through some magazines she brought with her that Yukari suggested, for some reason she was looking over the Maternity section. \"These women, they have a motherly glow, hmmp wonder if I'll have such a thing. No...I won't have time to settle down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm hmm hmm, I wonder...if that's as true as you think?\" Mitsuru turned to the door seeing Takaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! But...you're supposed to be dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am Miss Kirijo, I'm a...Shadow of the Past if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru went to get an Evoker she had just in case but Takaya was holding it. \"Looking for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I'm not here to kill you, in fact...I CAN'T kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Takaya?\" Mitsuru asked suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't kill you because like I said, I'm a Shadow. The real Takaya is in fact dead, but his strong desire to see Nyx destroy all humanity...lives on through me, his Shadow. His shadow bore from hate against this world and it's insignificant people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...a Shadow!?\" Mitsuru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I've come to tell you that you my dear miss Kirijo have a nasty curse about you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Curse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems Nyx had one last trump card up her sleeve, if the Death Arcana couldn't stop you all, then the World Arcana will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...there's something stronger then Nyx coming!?\" Mitsuru was in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's already started, inside your womb that is, see you my dear Miss Kirijo, are going to be the mother of 20 Bouncing baby shadows all of the Aracana that are needed to from The World. Oh they'll LOOK human, but they'll be shadows through and through; instinct, mission, all of it. Then once they're here they'll fuse into the World Arcana shadow that Nyx has planned, and this world will be dust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru gasped running a hand down her stomach the Shadow Takaya laughed. \"Yes you can feel it can't you Miss Kirijo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find a way to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh good luck, oh and I'll send flowers when the little bundles of Death are born.\" The Shadow Takaya vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuru fell to ground and began to cry. \"WHY!? WHEN WITH THIS BE OVER!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her hands around her stomach, grabbing a knife she held it up high, but she couldn't. She remembered what Shadow Takaya said, that they'll look human. Could they not only look, but be human? Could Mitsuru change this all and prevent the world's destruction by forming a bond with her future children? If they came one by one she could teach each child like a mother would, if they came at once she'd have a hard time teaching 20 kids at once. Maybe advice from her old friends could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Mitsuru's fate?</span></div></div>",

Only Mitsuru was present as she stood in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter Mitsuru-San?\" Aigis asked in her semi-monotone voice. Her robotic eyes reflected curiosity within as she stared at the red-haired young woman before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are Aigis\" Mitsuru said, keeping her usual calm demeanor. \"The Chairman stepped out, but he wanted me to tell you, as you're now attending school with us, he wanted to add a new feature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis seemed confused and curious. \"New...feature?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You have been fitted with an additional energy system that will enhance your parameters in combat. Finding out how to power it without leading to overheated presented some difficulties. However, some of the scientists proposed that it be fitted as a sort of synthetic stomach. In other words, you generate new energy by eating, similar to human beings, which will also help camouflage you further as a human being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAigis paused. She realized that human beings did need nourishment from food in order to go achieve the energy needed to go about their daily actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Aigis responded. \"I shall accept this 'stomach' so that I may further appear as a human being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater the next day, Aigis walked up to the roof with bag lunch in hand. From what she saw, eating on the roof was a popular way for students to spend their lunchtime. She opened the bag, pulling out a sandwich; cuts of ham, cheese and lettuces with mayo between two round, toasted bread buns. She opened her mouth, took a bite, chewing as crumbs stuck around her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taste buds...operating at...93% efficiency...\" She said to herself with a mouthful of food as she chewed. Luckily she was sitting in a corner as she said this to herself, so no one overheard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to eat. As she didn't need to worry about oxygen and breathing, and thus choking, she ate down her sandwich fast. She reached back into the bag, pulling out a bag of potato chips. She popped open the bag and quickly stuffed the crispy chips into her mouth. Other students stared in awe, assuming her to be gluttonous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't wholly wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Aigis had a rather simple lunch to herself, her new battery had only received a 6% increase in stored power from what she had eaten, sitting at 31% now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should bring my stored energy up to 100% before we next go to Tartarus.\" Aigis said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly picked herself up from where she sat and decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She was always afraid...Scared that they would harm her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, after she had met Minato Arisato...the fear that once gripped her, soon began to release it's hold upon her, until eventually...she was free from it's grasp. Finally able to speak for herself, be strong for herself...and it was all thanks to Minato. With his guidence and support she was able to overcome this, and transform into a whole new person...well, she was still a bit timid, but not nearly as much as she was before. Now that she had conquered this with Minato, Chihiro began to notice something else...that she loved him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after giving him a manga she once read, as a token of her appreciation for helping her, Chihiro and Minato had already began 'going out', and although Chihiro felt 'selfish' for having him all to herself, this emotion was soon over powered by that of sexual pleasure as she and Minato became one on that faithful night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minato-san...\" Chihiro gasped her arms wrapping around the neck of the teenager who lay atop her body, his hands still groping her nude bosom. It was a first for her...and her lover, the both of them having finally made it to the next level of their relationship by the means of joining as one and sharing their heated passion in a wondrous, but short, sexual encounter. Chihiro was afraid at first...but this was Minato, the one who helped her become strong, there was no reason to be afraid of the man who helped transform her into a better woman. \"...I love you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Love you too...\" Minato replied bringing his head down and locking his lips with hers in a passionate kiss. As much as he wanted to stay and let her nestle into his chest...he had to get going. It was getting late, and not only did he have school tomorrow, he didn't want others finding out about what he and Chihiro just did together. Although premarital sex was somewhat uncommon amongst the youth in Port Island City...it was still an immoral thing to do, regardless of if the two loved each other or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Minato arose from her lips, she could see it in his eyes, the fact that he had to leave so early even though she was just getting warmed up to him. \"...You have to go...don't you...\" Chihiro said, crestfallen that he had to leave her. But she knew it was for the best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...afraid so...\" Minato sighed as he arose from Chihiro's bed and searched for his underwear and trousers, finding them haphazardly thrown almost clear across the room. It was almost funny, how the initial trip to the bed and everything thereafter was nothing but a blur to him. Only the act of making love to Chihiro was what his mind could fathom from him even being here in the first place...not that he minded it. As he pulled out of Chihiro's womanhood (the two of them having remained locked together like this even after he came inside her), he quickly made haste to his underwear and pants, slipping on the former first before his eyes came to see Chihiro covering her own. \"Heh, why're you afraid to look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...I don't really know...\" Chihiro replied a blush still reddening her cheeks as she giggled in light of her own actions. \"I guess, I have to get used to us doing this, huh Minato-san...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this was our first time...\" Minato said with a smile pulling up his black, uniform pants, zipping the fly of them up and searching for his shirt and jacket. He had to get back before Junpei did, if not then he'd surely ask a number of questions that Minato...just wouldn't want to answer just yet. He glanced up to Chihiro who lay on her side, her breasts were...a bit larger than he imagined, but that made intercourse all the more enjoyable. Watching them bounce and jiggle about was a definite plus for the experience. \"Ah, do...do you have club meeting tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right I forgot that I did!\" Chihiro perked up, now having realized her duties as the treasurer still remained even though her cowardice didn't. \"Although...not much has been happening now, but I guess we still have to meet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, it has been quiet lately...\" Minato hummed slipping on his shirt and jacket, his headphones still in the pocket of his uniform jacket. \"Well, I'll see ya at school tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-goodbye, Minato-san...\" Chihiro smiled warmly to the young man as he parted with her, waving her had to him. \"You...you're going to be back right...?\" Chihiro spoke up, suddenly sitting up in her bed causing her breasts to shake from the sudden movement of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you're amazing, Chihiro-chan.\" Minato replied with a smile, the gesture getting Chihiro face to redden once more, before he left her room completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlopping on her back; naked in bed, and giggling at the joyous feeling that was aflutter in her chest, Chihiro soon realized just how late it truly was. It was far later than she had first remembered. Looking out the window, she could see some of the evening lights of the city beginning to illuminate the dusk colored streets and less people roaming around. Perhaps she and Minato went at it a bit too long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, no matter how long it was...it was wonderful. The closeness the two of them shared, the passion of the moment. If it weren't for the moral issue of premarital sex, then Chihiro would be in absolute bliss at the moment. Feeling sluggish from having expended most of her evening energy during the inital love making, Chirhio pulled the covers over her nude frame and fell asleep...</span></div></div>",
