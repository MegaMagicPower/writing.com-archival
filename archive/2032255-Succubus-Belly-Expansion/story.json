And she was one of the most well know succubi in the underworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also, at the moment, completely lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala had been asked by a friend to pick up a rare plant from some old forest on Earth. The place was enormous, but she managed to find the plant. But when she did, she realized that she had no idea which way she came from or how to get back to her portal. Annoyed, she just picked a path and started walking. Three hours later, she had gotten nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now I'm pissed off. Where the hell is the entrance to this place?\" She yelled to no one. Blowing a lock of silver hair out of her face, she looked around. All she could see were trees. But then, to her right, she saw a lake. \"How did I miss that?\" She asked herself. \"Doesn't matter. At least I can get a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the lake. It was crystal clear. She bent down at the edge of the water and scooped up an handful of water. Slurping the water down, she was amazed at how cool and clean it was. She continued to scoop up and drink until a voice stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, what the hell are you doing?!\" The voice yelled angrily. Surprised Antala looked up. In front of her was a mermaid. The mermaid was pretty, with green scales for skin and orange eyes. Antala noticed that the mermaid was bald, which didn't surprise her since some mermaids shaved their heads to make swimming easier. Her cloth bra was strained against her breasts, which were slightly bigger than Antala's. Instead of legs, she had a long, green tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going to answer me?\" The mermaid demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry to intrude, but I seem to be lost. Do you happen to know where the entrance to the forest is?\" Antala asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I tell you? You're a trespasser, and you're drinking my water. Give me one reason why I don't drown you now.\" The mermaid said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I am a succubus, and if you don't tell me how to get out of this forest and back to my portal, I will boil your lake until there's nothing left.\" Antala threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill fuming, but not willing to lose her lake, the mermaid pointed to the opposite end. \"Go that way and keep walking for about 2 hours. You should see a road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Antala replied. She got up and walked away from the lake. As she walked, she thought she heard the mermaid speak some old language. Too tired to care, she just kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was out of sight, the mermaid chuckled. \"So she thinks she can just waltz in here and drink my water? Well, I hope she's happy for now, because she's about to get REAL thirsty. Then she'll learn not to mess with Marissa the Mermaid Witch. I can't wait to see how this goes.\" Marissa said before laughing. Then she realized something. \"Wait, how can I see how this turns out if I can't leave my lake?\" She sighed in annoyance. \"I really need to think my revenge's through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later, Antala finally found the exit and her portal home. Before she entered it, however, she got an odd feeling. It almost felt like she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Confused, she looked down and was surprised by what she saw. Her belly had grown. It looked like she was 9 months pregnant. A bit confused, she poked her belly to see if it was real. Sure enough, her finger was pressing against a real belly. It felt like it was full of water. Surprisingly, it felt kinda good. Smiling, she gave her belly a light slap and watched it jiggle. She giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess I drank more of that water then I thought.' Antala thought to herself. She then grabbed her belly and jiggled it again. 'Heh. This is actually kinda fun. Maybe I'll enjoy this for as long as I have it.' Smiling, Antala walked back through the portal to the underworld.<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\nA few hours later, Antala was back in her home. She dropped the plant off at her friend (who was a bit surprised by Antala's belly) and returned home straight away. Along the way, she got some weird stares from other succubi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow sitting on her couch, Antala looked down at her belly again. It hadn't gotten any smaller since she got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I should have worked you off with all the walking I did.\" Antala said, holding her water-filled belly. She smiled. \"But you know what, I think I've gotten to like you. There's so much potential fun for you. So I think I'm going to keep you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala yawned after saying that. \"Geez. Late already? Guess we'll see more of what you're capable of tomorrow.\" She said, before giving her belly one last playful slap. Lying down on the couch, she dozed off.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\nBack in the pond, the mermaid had solved her little problem of not seeing Antala by making a small magic screen in the water. And she was annoyed with what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?! She's supposed to be freaked out by that belly, not happy with it! Why do all my revenges backfire?!\" She yelled. \"Well, let's just see how much she loves it in the following days.\" She then let out an evil laugh, hoping for the following days to be torment for Antala. Then she let out a sigh when she was done. \"I'm bored now. Might as well go mess with some elves.\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThe next morning, Antala woke up with a smile. She then looked down the see that her belly...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And yet somehow, it managed to remain perfectly spherical. Surprised, Antala put her hands on her belly to confirm that this was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" She said after realizing it was real. \"How did you get bigger overnight? I didn't drink any water.\" She smiled. \"Ah, who cares? Twice the belly size means twice the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned her body and started to get off the couch, but struggled with it due to the added weight of her belly. Eventually, she managed to get up. The constant movement made her belly jiggle. She could feel the water sloshing inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez.\" Antala said after finally getting up. \"This weight is gonna take some geting used to. I should go do something to help with that. But what?\" Before she could think on it, her phone rang. She walked (well, waddled) over to it and picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Oh, hey Kaza. What's up? The beach? Why would you want to go to the beach all of a sudden? Volleyball game? I though you hated sports. Why in the underworld would you want to do that? Oh, you want to try and get a workout? You hate exercise. Admit it, you just want to see me in a bikini, don't you? Just as I thought. Fine, I'll indulge your fantasies. Meet me down there. Alright, bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala hung up the phone and looked down at her belly, grabbing it. \"Well, looks like fate is smiling down on us. We have a chance. Just gotta pick the right thing to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala then went over to her closet and opened it, looking over her options. Eventually, she settled on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The top just barely covered her breasts, and the bottom was basically a thong. Antala grinned as she began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she was out the door, dressed only in her bikini, her now huge belly bare for the world to see. She smiled. This was going to be fun.<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Antala arrived at the beach. There were quite a few succubi there already. She then heard a voice and recognized it as her friend Kaza. She turned to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaza was only 2 inches shorter then Antala. She had orange skin, green hair, and purple eyes. She lacked horns and wings, but had the spade tail and hooved feet. But what most people knew about Kaza was her weight. She was quite obese. Her breasts were like beach balls, her butt could fill an entire couch, and her belly reminded Antala of a spare tire. Kaza was one of the heaviest succubi Antala knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anta!\" Kaza said, using Antala's nickname. Before she could continue, she finally saw Antala's belly. \"Woah! What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know.\" Antala said. \"It just started growing yesterday. But I think it's cool. Watch.\" On that, she jumped, making her belly jiggle. Kaza could hear the water inside slosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Kaza said. \"You're sure to draw attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even if I don't,\" Antala said. \"I'll still love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well known throughout the succubus world that Antala had a fetish for big, perfectly spherical bellies. If she saw a succubus with one, she instantly fell in love with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kaza said. \"So what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala thought for a moment. \"How about I...\"</span></div></div>",

Pretty interesting huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say so much interesting as bizarre.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women talking were Antala and Haka, a pair of succubi. Antala was 5'10'' with silver hair, gold cat-like eyes, red skin, an hourglass figure, huge bat wings, a spade tail, and horns. Haka was 5'9'' with blue hair, orange cat-like eyes, silver skin, a pear shaped figure, and only a spade tail. Both were wearing a one-piece bikini, Antala's being purple and Haka's being red. The two of them were standing in front of an old fountain in the human world. It was said to be enchanted. And Haka had just bet that Antala couldn't drink from it and get a huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way I'm doing this.\" Antala said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's a bet. That means you need to do it.\" Haka retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's enchanted. And you know succubi are supposed to stay away from enchanted things in the human world. Besides, you didn't say what you would do if I did drink from it.\" Antala replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you do, I'll find a way to hook you up with Uda. And you know how much Uda loves big bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got Antala's attention. Uda was another succubus, and one of the most well known. She was Antala's height, had short pink hair, green eyes, and blue skin, but the things she was most known for were her breasts. They was gargantuan, easily the size of yoga balls. Another thing she was known for was her love of big bellies. She would only go out with succubi with big bellies. Antala had a massive crush on her. If this would get Uda to see her, she was willing to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would really do that?\" Antala asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I would. But only if you drink.\" Haka replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the convincing Antala needed. She jumped into the fountain and immediatly began drinking. As she did, her belly grew.

Curious, she gave a pat to the globular gut and caused it to jiggle for several seconds before coming to rest. \u201cWow, this is\u2026 just\u2026 wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say, with a belly that huge, there\u2019s no way Uda will resist you,\u201d Haka stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think so?\u201d Antala asked as she struggled to stand up. She constantly adjusted her stance to counteract the sloshing motion inside her belly. Despite it being filled with water, her belly resembles more of a sphere than a teardrop shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I saw the girls Uda had dated, and their bellies paled in comparison to yours. Once she sees your big, jiggly belly, I guarantee she won\u2019t keep her hands away from you,\u201d Haka assured, giving her friend a slap to the stomach. \u201cWe should probably get back home. I\u2019m going to set things up with Uda. You sure you won\u2019t need help lugging around that water balloon of yours?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny Haka but no, I\u2019ll be fine. This will give me time to acquaint myself with my new belly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Haka commented as she conjured a portal. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the portal open when you\u2019re ready to leave. I\u2019ll call you after I talked to Uda. Later!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala waved goodbye to her friend as Haka walked through the portal. Staring at her massive orb, she placed her hands under her belly and attempted lifting it. She hoisted it upward a few inches before succumbing to its immense weight and dropped it, watching it bob in place. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I did this, but\u2026\u201d Antala\u2019s mind thought about the blue-skinned busty succubus. Her red skin turned brighter as she blushed; daydreams of her and Uda walking hand in hand flutter her head. \u201cif this giant stomach gives me a chance with Uda, then I suppose\u2026 no, it has been to be worth the trouble.\u201d Restored with certainty, Antala marched (or waddled in this case) toward the portal and headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Succubus World, many of the fellow succubi were astonished at the bumbling Antala waddling down the sideway. The big-bellied succubus panted heavily she wiped the sweat from her forehead. Her yoga ball of a belly swung side to side with each laborious step, accompanying by the sound of the sloshing water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Antala? Goodness, what happened to her?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at her belly. How can she move with something so massive attached to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes anyone else hear sloshing? That\u2019s not coming from Antala, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala overheard some the chatter while trudging along. Disregarding the gossip, she continued waddling her way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis belly is a bigger problem than I thought,\u201d she noted. \u201cI really need to get home; maybe some rest and sleep will help take off the weight. Though I must admit, hearing the water splashing inside is kind of alluring. But I\u2019ll listen more to my belly once I\u2019m home, preferably before this water gut causes any incident.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He had snuck in after the medical examiner left and was messing around with some strange and unknown formulas. \u201cThat bone-headed community,\u201d said the crooked man to himself. \u201cThey\u2019ve outlawed my work as crimes against nature and society. But it is I who will laugh last. Once I complete this formula, foreign militaries will pay through the nose for this special steroid that shall create an army of superhuman soldiers. Just as soon as I perfect it. The pachyderm DNA is still highly unstable. Only a few more adjustments to make.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when you use science for immoral, selfish or outright evil intentions, you must be expected to pay the consequences sooner or later, because these unlawful experiments always managed to backfire on those foolish enough to undertake them. At that moment in the parking lot, Antala was getting ready to drive the hospital\u2019s medical examiner home while she was busy sipping a large bottle of water. As soon as she finished that bottle, she took out another one and was about to drink it when her boss showed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medical examiner was a very large kappa woman resembling a dark blackish blue-skinned leatherback turtle with white spots all over her body and a thick shell that alone weighed 500lbs. \u201cYou keep drinking so much, I sometimes wonder if you\u2019re a water element monster.\u201d Antala blushed in embarrassment. \u201cSorry about that Nala,\u201d said Antala. \u201cI guess I was working harder than I thought. So, any plans tonight.\u201d \u201cNot really,\u201d said Nala. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quiet next door. Mr. Plunkett got arrested for stealing my cable.\u201d Antala let out a laugh. \u201cServes that guy right. He was always threatening his oldest son with punishment for helping people with their pets. Not to mention he was the biggest hypocrite I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Nala let out a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he was always on that boy\u2019s case. Somebody who knowingly commits crimes that harm people is in no position to criticize his son for doing something unambiguously good. Maybe after spending a few months in the slammer, he\u2019ll straighten up and fly right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls laughed but then Antala gasped. \u201cDarn!\u201d yelled Antala. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Nala. Antala let out a sigh. \u201cI left my coat in the morgue. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d What Antala didn\u2019t know was that at that moment in the morgue, the evil janitor was almost completing his concoction and had put it in a syringe. \u201cNow,\u201d he said. \u201cNow. The moment I\u2019ve been waiting...\u201d Before the man could finish his sentence, he heard the door open and panicked, tossing the syringe into the air. \u201cAnton?\u201d asked Antala as she took her coat. \u201cWhat are... ouch!\u201d Anton looked in shock as his syringe landed on Antala\u2019s shoulder and injected his serum into her. \u201cOh no.\u201d Thought Anton. Antala grunted and groaned as she walked out and then pulled out the syringe. \u201cWhat the?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh.\u201d Antala felt woozy and her mouth felt dry. \u201cI need some water.\u201d Anton watched nervously and tried to escape as Antala walked to a nearby water cooler and then proceeded to empty the contents into her mouth. As she drank the water, her belly started to bulge out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Antala was done, she looked at her reflection in the bottle of water and gasped because she saw the face of a strange creature that looked like a hybrid of a succubus and a(n)....</span></div></div>",

Standing before her in the mirror was a strange barrel-bellied creature that had the red skin, horns, wings, hooves and tail of a succubus with silver hair and golden eyes, but with the thick skin, large ears, enormous trunk and two long tusks of an African elephant. Antala was speechless at what she had become. She was so scared of her new form that her skin turned a pale platinum shade as she let out a trumpeting scream. \"What happened to me!?\" shouted Antala. \"What happened to my face! I'm an elephant!\" Antala trumpeted again and felt her stomach in pain as it continued to swell and the potion that mutated her was still acting up inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water!\" shouted Antala. \"Water! I need more water!\" Antala burst through one of the hospital walls and then found another water cooler and stuck her large trunk right into the nozzle as she begun to drink it. In the confusion, Anton figured the best thing to do would be to run off before Antala realized exactly who it was who created the mutagen that transmogrified her. \"Discretion is the better part of valor,\" said the corrupted janitor turned wicked scientist to himself. \"That stupid succubus used up my super steroid and if word gets out on what happened, I'm dead meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnton heard more loud trumpeting and then heard a crashing sound because Antala had tossed the water bottle right through a hospital window before the succubus elephant hybrid let out another scream. Anton was now afraid for his life and then tried to run. He was not going to stay around a hospital with what was essentially a rouge elephant if it could be avoided. However, he bounced off of another large belly, one that felt like it was encased in a shell made of rubber. Anton grumbled and then looked up to see Nala and she didn't look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anton,\" said the medical examiner. \"What the devil is going on here? It sounds like a circus.\" Upon seeing another of the hospital staff, Anton panicked. \"Dr. Kato!?\" yelled Anton. \"What are you doing here?! You should get out of here, right now!\" Nala, being a medical examiner, knew a suspicious person when she saw them and none were more suspicious than Anton was acting at this exact moment. \"Why?\" asked the kappa. Anton stammered and stuttered as he tried to think of an explanation when there was a loud crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnton and Nala walked into the hallway and Nala's jaw dropped as she saw the elephantine Antala with a larger and more liquid-filled belly. Antala in her desperate thirst had broken into a vending machine and was slurping down bottles before tossing them aside and trumpeting. \"An-Antala?\" asked Nala in dumbfounded horror. Antala then trumpeted and held her ears. She was not in the most stable mood and her next thoughts turned to...</span></div></div>",

What's happened?\" Anton bit his fingers. \"You fool,\" said Anton. \"My super soldier formula isn't perfect!\" \"What!?\" shouted Antala. Anton grabbed his face as Antala stormed up to a refrigerator and was going through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that work wasted! It took me weeks to perfect the ultimate infusion of pachyderm and demon genes. I was going to sell that to fund my experiments! And now you've ruined it, you stupid, stupid, stupid, succubus!\" Antala overheard what was going on and went through the refrigerator, chugging water from every single bottle that she could find. \"What?\" asked Antala as she sucked some bottled water. \"Those experiments are illegal, Anton! You could go to jail for life for creating those kinds of mutagens.\" Anton gave a scoff. \"Why do you think that I was doing it in secret!? You're a moron, you know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala did not like that insult and in rage, she tore the door off of the fridge and then blew her trumpet in Anton's face, causing his toupee to fall off. \"Don't you DARE call me a moron!

Antala trumpet as her belly expanded with more and more water until her belly turned bright blue. \"More water!\" yells Antala. \"More water! More water!

She tore open the fridge but there were no more bottles of water. As she ripped open the fridge, Antala saw that there was nothing left but ice cubes. She was so thirsty that she was desperate and she inhaled the ice cubes off the floor with her trunk and then blew them into her mouth and chewed on them. \"Ugh!\" yelled Anton. \"That is absolutely disgusting.\" Antala then felt her eyes glowing.

Anton saw Antala looming over his smaller body and was terrified. He tried to inch away but Antala held him up and then glared at him. Anton screamed and this alerted Nala to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in there?\" asked the kappa. \"Antala, are you o... oh my goodness!\" Nala looked up at Antala whose belly was bouncing up and down as the mammoth trumpeted again. \"An-Antala?\" asked Nala. \"Is that you?\" Antala nodded her head. \"Cross my heart and hope to die, Nala. This creep has been fooling around with mutagen.\" \"What?!\" yelled Nala in a horrified and disgusted tone. Anton gave a gulp. \"Looks like the jig is up.\" \"Antala,\" says Nala sternly. \"Drop him.\" Antala trumpeted loudly and then she dropped Anton to the ground with a thump. Nala then walked up to the phone and then she decided to contact the police. \"Hello? Barry? This is Nala. You won't believe it, but some crook at this hospital turned Antala into a succubus mammoth hybrid. No, I'm serious.\" Nala took a photograph of Antala with her camera phone and sent it to the police on the off chance that the police didn't believe her. Antala then turned to Anton and smirked. \"Oh,\" she said. \"I wouldn't want to be you, Anton.\" Anton then let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until the police came to take the villainous scientist away. The lieutenant from the looks of it was a male werewolf with blonde brownish hair and a long nose. \"You'll get life for this.\" He told Anton. Anton let out a sigh as the sirens blared. \"So I've heard.\" Antala and Nala watched as Anton was taken away in the paddy wagon. Nala could only shake her head. \"Science can be a very dangerous thing. Especially when it is used irresponsibly.\" Nala then heard a moaning and a trumpeting and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nala turned around, she stopped Antala trying to drown her sorrows in bottled water, but all this did was give her a more severe case of belly bloat. \"Antala?\" asked the kappa to her transmogrified friend. \"Antala, are you alright?\" Antala burst into tears as she moaned. \"Look at me. I'm supposed to be learning as an intern to be a doctor but now look at me! I'm a mammoth. I'm too big to even fit in the darn hospital. Antala moaned and shook her head again. \"What can I do for the hospital, now.\" Antala looked down at Nala and Nala gave a smile. \"Don't worry, Ant, we're in this together and I have just the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala gave a blink and snorted before drying her tears. \"Really?\" she asked her best friend. Nala nodded her head. \"It just so happens that the hospital is due for the annual charity event to benefit the pediatrics wing.

Her name was Antala and she had decided to see the wonders of the human world. As she stepped on the bus, she gives a smile. \"Bella,\" she says. \"So this is Italy.\" One minotaur stepped on the bus and gave a snort. \"Personally,\" he said. \"Greece is better.\" An obese werewolf woman stepped on the bus next and gave a growl. \"Watch your mouth.\" Antala took her seat and all the monsters looked at the tour guide who looked in fear. Obviously she was afraid of being devoured by the tour bus full of monsters. However, she swallowed her fear and prepared to do her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonjourno,\" said the tour guide. \"I am Alexandra and I will be your tour guide for today's trip around Italy. Several of the monsters on this bus originated from the Roman empire.\" The minotaur gave a snort and rolled his eyes but Antala ignored him as the bus took off. \"On your right, you will see the famous Baths of Caracalla. These public baths were build between 212 and 217 A.D. during the reign of Septimius Sevarus. Every day for 6 years, 2,000 tons of material were installed to these baths which would become the second largest in Rome.\" Antala looked at the Roman baths and snapped a photograph. The tour bus then passed one of the aqueducts of Rome. She would've photographed an aqueduct but a large and overweight gargoyle woman got in the way to snap a photograph herself, leading to Antala snapping a photograph of the back of the gargoyle's head, to her dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tour continued, they soon reached Naples. In the distance, Antala saw an island with a rather large volcano up ahead. \"What is that island in the distance, Alexandra?\" Alexandra begun to shake in fear. \"Oh,\" she said. \"That. That is the island of Pompeii. In 79 AD, the island was destroyed when Mt. Vesuvius erupted, burying and petrifying the remains of the inhabitants. One cyclops kid in the crowd blinked (or rather winked) before speaking. \"Is that where we're heading next? Isn't Vesuvius still active?\" Antala gave a look of surprise. \"Is it?\" Alexandra nervously laughed and waved her hand. \"N-Now, don't, don't worry. Vesuvius won't be erupting anytime soon.\" Alexandra sweated heavily as the minotaur man from the tour gave a smirk. \"She's the one who looks ready to erupt.\" He said with a laugh. \"Now,\" says Alexandra. \"We will take the next ship to Pompeii. As they got closer, Antala saw several perfectly preserved ruins and what looked like plaster casts of those who perished in the flames. She then looked up and thought that she saw some smoke coming from the top of the volcano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour group stopped at a cafe at the foot of the mountain but instead of focusing on her gelato, Antala couldn\u2019t help but think about Mt. Vesuvius. \u201cAlexandra said that it wasn\u2019t going to erupt,\u201d said the succubus. \u201cBut I\u2019m not so sure.

Somewhere on a mountain flames are erupting from a cave. Once they die down a red skinned succubus walks out brushing herself off. She's got an hourglass figure with E cup breasts, as well as a spade tail. \"Jeez, he sure seemed angry.\" Antala says. \"Guess he wasn't too fond of me eating his soul.\" she says. Being a succubus, Antala seduces and feeds on the souls of other creatures. Her latest victim was a dragon man she met the other day. He was pretty aggressive in bed, but she still got him. Unfortunately when she was about to take his soul he fought back. She still managed to get it though, only getting a little singed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say though not many actually fight back like that.\" she says to herself. \"He must have been a nasty piece of work.\" She spreads her bat like wings and takes off into the sky. Overall she's pretty satisfied. She got out alive and that dragon was a pretty good lay. Little does she know that that dragon's soul is restless and vengeful. As she flies through the sky she begins to feel hungry again. \"Whoa, I thought I was full.\" she says as she scans the area below. She spots a town and figures that would be a good place to grab a human soul or two, so she lands there. After disguising herself as a human with a little magic Antala heads into town looking for some prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she spots is a tavern so she goes in there. This should be a good place to find some men. When she enters she sees a good candidate and sits down at his table. \"Hey there handsome.\" she says. The man smiles and lights up a cigarette. For some reason the sight of the small flame makes her hungrier and before she can think Antala grabs his lighter and licks the flame up. \"Whoa! Thats some trick!\" the man says impressed. \"Uh..yeah.\" Antala says, not knowing exactly why she did it. The only thing she does know is that the fire tasted pretty good. What does she do now? </span></div></div>",

Using her succubus charms she starts seducing the man in front of her. \"So do you come here often?\" she asks while twirling her hair. \"Yeah, but I haven't seen you around.\" he answers with a smile. She gives him a flirtatious smile and places her hand on his. \"How would like to see a little more?\" she asks seductively. The man grins and nods eagerly. \"That sounds great, why don't get ourselves a room?\" he says. The two of them get up and head for the back. The tavern also functions as an inn so there are various rooms for rent. They enter a vacant one and get right to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala lays on the bed and begins undressing while the man does as well. He strips rather quickly and is naked before she's even halfway done. He sure is eager. Meanwhile Antala doesn't seem all that excited. She's about to have this guy's soul but the thought doesn't have the same appeal it usually does. With a sigh she stops undressing and waves a hand in front of his face. He falls asleep instantly, she just used a sleep spell on him. Deciding to test something she removes her disguise from her hand. With her claws revealed she reaches into his very soul and pulls it out. Hesitantly she has a taste and finds that it doesn't satisfy her at all. Disappointed she tosses it back into the sleeping man and puts her clothes back on. As she gets up to leave she reaches into his pants pocket and grabs his lighter. Curiously she makes a flame with it and slurps it up, finding it quite tasty. With a shrug she leaves the spellbound human in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon leaving the room Antala calls over to the innkeeper. \"The gentleman I went in with will pay for the room.\" she says as she leaves. When she gets outside she pulls out the lighter again and eats another flame. She's getting used to the taste and wants more. While she wants to find out why she's eating fire all of a sudden she really wants to sate her hunger. What does she do?</span></div></div>",

As she leaves she pulls out the lighter and has another fire snack. She eventually reaches a forest outside of town and looks around. She knows the lighter won't last forever so she begins thinking about how to get more fire. With a flick of her finger she produces a small flame on the tip. It barely looks like a snack and producing a bigger one would take more energy. She realizes it would take too much magic to satisfy herself and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits her. She doesn't need to make a lot of fire. It practically makes itself! She then begins gathering leaves and plants to make a pile on the forest floor. With another flick of the finger she tosses a flame at it and it catches fire. After waiting a few seconds it begins to grow. Once the whole pile is burning she helps herself. Reaching in she grabs a handful and stuffs it in her mouth. It tastes so good that she begins grabbing more and more, until the fire is gone. With a burp she sets off, unaware that her stomach has gotten slightly bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala begins walking on a path that leads to a mountain trail. She climbs the mountain, wondering why exactly she likes to eat fire now. Then she passes a cave and remembers the dragon. Maybe his soul had something to do with it!

And that is saying a lot, since there are many, many succubi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not all of them were hybrids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Antala's mother was a succubus, but her father was a Chinese Dragon. How they fell in love is unknown, but eventually, Antala came into the world as the first succubus-dragon hybrid. At 24 human years of age, Antala went out on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala was considered a knockout beauty. She was 5'11'', had long silver hair, and gold cat eyes.

She had a great hourglass figure, with E cup breasts, wide hips, and a big ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her most prized feature was her belly. When she was 21 human years, she learned that she could produce fire in her belly, but could not expel it in any way. As such, it continued to build in her belly. Now, she has a beach ball sized belly that was burning hot to touch. And she loved it.

The people knew about her and were quite friendly, since they knew she was harmless. Because of this, despite not actually living in the city, Antala was considered a welcome citizen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Antala was just lazing around, reading a book that was lying on her huge belly (though Antala couldn't expel the fire, she could lower it's temperature to room temperature. She never understood how). Suddenly, she heard metallic footsteps near the entrance. Antala could only think one thing as she got up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing part-dragon, Antala often had to deal with random Knights or other stupidly brave people wanting to \"slay\" her for various reasons. Most of the time, she just scared them off with a dragon roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the front of the cave she saw the new knight. The knight was a young woman, about mid-twenties. She had no helmet on, revealing a tanned face with green eyes and red hair. She was wearing full body armor. In her hand was a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vile dragon beast!\" The woman yelled in a accent Antala couldn't place. \"I have come from Morveno to end your terrible reign of destruction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morveno?\" Antala asked, tapping a finger on her belly. \"Sorry, never been there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar!\" The woman yelled. \"A dragon had come to our village, burned it, ate our livestock, and stole our gold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala sighed. \"Well, I'm not the one you're looking for. I don't eat live animals, I have a job, and I can't breath fire. Watch.\" She said. Then she inhaled and breathed out a small cloud of smoke. Doing this, her belly inflated again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman raised an eyebrow. Antala rolled her eyes. Clearly this knight still had doubts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, go over to Terak. They'll tell you I mean no harm.\" Antala said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the young woman...</span></div></div>",

In that ridiculous succubus disguise, I see through it. I heard that dragons could change themselves into other mythical beasts and I can tell that you're a dragon disguised as a succubus just by those scales alone.\" Antala rolled her eyes and blew smoke out of her nose. \"Listen,\" says Antala. \"I'm not a dragon <i>disguised</i> as a succubus, I'm a dragon who's also part succubus. It's a long, long story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight gave a look of surprise and shook her sword, lowering it to Antala's neck. \"You dragons truly are monsters. You're mixing together with other beasts of mythology to create monstrous hybrids. Wait! Wait a minute! If that's true, where is the parent dragon.\" Antala's eyes bulged out in fear at what the knight most likely had in store. \"Do you seriously think that I'd tell you where to find my family?! Besides, I'm not that kind of dragon. My father's not one of those barbaric western dragons. He's a Chinese dragon.\" The knight looked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the west,\" says Antala. \"Dragons are usually evil and dangerous but in the East, dragons are for the most part benevolent and wise.\" \"Well I've never seen a Chinese dragon before,\" says the knight. \"How do I know that they're any different from western dragons.\" Antala bit her jaw and growled as her eyes glowed. \"Well,\" she said. \"It looks like I'm going to have to show you the difference.\" Antala exhaled as if to breathe fire, but she knew she couldn't expel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala's belly bulged out and pushed the knight to her feet and startled the knight's horse in the process as it neighed loudly. Antala's scales took on a more bronze colorization and her hair grew longer as her horns curved and her hoofed feet turned into reptilian-like talons and her teeth grew sharper as her face begun to elongate into a large snout as smoke came out of her now flat nose. Antala's neck elongated as her tail took on a more serpentine form. Her body became longer as her belly grew bigger and bigger and the knight looked up in surprise. She had never seen a dragon of such an unusual shape before. Chinese dragons were a whole new thing for her. The knight actually trembled as she tried to hold up her sword and shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Antala didn't fear the knight and kept exhaling as her belly filled up with fire until it was the size of a....</span></div></div>",

I'm not a thing. I'm a dragon.\" The knight looked at Antala again and again and couldn't believe it. \"<i>This</i> is the hybridized dragon that I've heard so much about. You don't look like any dragon that I know of. Dragons are large-bellied lizards with horns and wings. While you have the belly down, you don't look like any kind of dragon that I've heard of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala let out a sigh. \"That's because Chinese dragons look much different that the kinds of dragons that you're used to. We look much different. Antala blew smoke from her nose as her belly filled again with fire. \"My father was such a dragon and he's as wise and gentle as most Chinese dragons come. Eastern dragons are the benevolent dragons. But if you don't believe me, come at me. I won't do anything to stop you.\" Antala, feeling rather confident, held out her large belly that was so very much filled with fire that it was glowing shades of bright orange and yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight held out her sword and shook it in her hand. She had never encountered a dragon before that was neither afraid to die nor willing to fight back. This dragon was new to her in both behavior and appearance. She didn't know what to do. After thinking it over and raising her sword and lowering it several times, she finally dropped her sword and shield in defeat and let out a sigh. \"It's no use. Slaying your type of dragon would leave a bad taste. I guess not all dragons or succubi are evil monsters.\" Antala smiled, snorted and then nodded her head. \"I don't blame you for your attitude. Western dragons are so barbaric that they've kind of caused people to think lowly of dragons. But I happen to know there are some western dragons that aren't half bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala lowered her hand in order to allow the knight to shake it, now feeling a sense of friendship towards the one who originally attempted to slay her. The knight looked in surprise as Antala smiled down at her. \"Let's start over. My name is Antala.\" The knight hesitated slightly but then she nodded her head and held out her hand to shake it with Antala. \"Jane.\" She said. Antala and jane let out a laugh at what had occurred. Their confrontation was due to a misunderstanding and they had no more reason to hate each other.

There was a double rainbow forming a loop among clouds that resembled menageries of animals from tropical birds to exotic fish to wild cats. The two then flew above a castle made out of ivory and then passed by lion roaring into the air and then flew over a flock of unicorns that were running across the ground. Jane looked at the unicorns and spotted a Chinese-looking unicorn among the more western-looking ones. Antala and Jane shared a laugh as Jane rode on Antala's back and they passed by a tree that grew rubies for fruit and a large rose that took the shape of a dragon. As they passed the rose plant, Jane used what was left of her broken sword to cut some roses to place in Antala's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala and Jane laughed and then Antala flew 100ft up into the air.

She looked out and saw that this was a town that she had never explored before. \u201cCalliope town?\u201d asked the succubus dragon hybrid. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been here before. The carriage driver didn\u2019t respond. He was a man in a black suit with pale bluish white skin and no face. The carriage came to a stop and then Antala decided to get out. Of course, this was proving to be a problem because the demon dragoness was having trouble getting her belly out of the front door. Antala grit her teeth and in rage breathed out smoke. She couldn't breathe out the fire and it simply built up inside her. This caused her pot belly to expand to cauldron size and bend the sides of the carriage before she fell flat on her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala grunted and blew smoke from her nose before she stood up and then picked up her suitcase in order to walk into town as the carriage left. Calliope city was a city consisted of marble buildings that were painted in bright colors. There were also large statues of horses that were as big as buildings. Antala took out a map and laid it on her belly before she drew on it and whistled a tune to herself. The map she drew was a map of several towns she had visited throughout her travels and she was drawing Calliope Town on it. As she was trying to steady herself, she led out a grunt and accidentally jerked her pencil, causing her to draw a crooked line. Antala looked down and saw a bratty kid laughing and bouncing a ball off her belly. \u201cHey!\u201d yelled Antala. The dragon-succubus hybrid snorted smoke and chased after the boy who grabbed his ball, laughed and ran away. \u201cCome back here you little brat!\u201d Antala had chased the boy underneath the legs of a rather large blue marble horse only to get stuck. Antala growled as the boy made a face at her and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of struggling, Antala finally managed to free herself. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t say that this town agrees with me much. Now I\u2019m thirsty.\u201d Antala saw what looked like an inn in the distance. She walked up to the inn and noticed the banner on the door. \u201cThe Dinosaur Heel Inn. Heavy on our stomaches. Light on our feet.\u201d Antala then spotted something on the side of the window that caught her attention. \u201cDancing Girl wanted.\u201d Antala scratched her head because she wasn\u2019t sure what that meant and then the dragon succubus hybrid walked inside the inn. There she saw that the inn was completely empty. From the looks of it, they weren\u2019t open yet. The inside of the inn looked typical of any Victorian era Inn but they were arranged to resemble a large amphitheater and there was a stage in the center. Antala looked and saw that there were six ballerinas already on the stage. Each of them was a monster girl and they all had wide bellies like Antala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back row there were three monster girls tapping their feet on the ground. First of them was a tan-skinned wendigo girl with glowing silver horns and eyes and long white wild hair. Befitting a wendigo, she also had sharp teeth that were visible when her mouth was opened. Next to the wendigo girl was a gray-skinned gorgon girl with puff adders for hair and a long snake tail. The gorgon girl had a long brown pierced tongue and was wearing yellow sunglasses that were shaped like hearts to prevent her gorgon eyes from petrifying her coworkers. Next to the gorgon girl was a reddish pink furred weretiger woman with long red hair and black stripes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also three dancers in the front with the leader in the center. To the left of the lead dancer was a cyan-skinned lizardwoman who resembled a moloch with large horns and a patch over her left eye and no hair. To the right of the leader of the ballerinas was a harpy woman with golden blonde hair and green feathers of a parrot with yellow talons. The leader of the dancing girls was a bright golden skinned gargoyle girl with large leather wings, long golden brown hair and a bestial-looking face that somehow still looked feminine. She was wearing a large tiara signifying her as the leader of the dancers. She also appeared to have a larger belly than the rest of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala sat down just in time for the dancing girls to stop. \u201cAlright everyone,\u201d said the gargoyle. \u201cTake 5.\u201d The girls let out a sigh and the lizardwoman turned to face her harpy friend. \u201cHildy sure has been working us hard lately,\u201d said the lizardwoman. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that Naiad would quit on us?\u201d The harpy girl gave a squawk. \u201cYou said it, Jasmine. We\u2019ve had to pick up the slack. I just hope Hildy hires a new girl soon.\u201d The weretigress picks up a serving tray and then she turns to see Antala. \u201cOh my,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like we already have a customer.\u201d Everyone turned to face Antala and the wendigo turned to face the gorgon girl. \u201cCheck out the belly on that girl, Elisa,\u201d said the gorgon to the wendigo. \u201cShe looks like a perfect fit for the job.\u201d The wendigo girl smiled and turned to face the gargoyle. \u201cYo, Hildy,\u201d she said. \"I think that... uh... whatever she is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHildy, the big-bellied gargoyle simply looked at Antala before she made her move towards her. \"Hello, stranger,\" said the innkeeper. \"I don't believe I've ever seen a creature like you before.\" \"Oh,\" says Antala. \"Well, long story short my mother was a succubus and my father was a dragon.\" Hildy gave a look of surprise and the tigress dropped her jaw. \"That can happen?\" Antala then started to cough a few times and build up fire causing her stomach to expand to the point where it was slightly bigger than Hildy's. Hildy gave a look of shock as Antala's belly destroyed the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief,\" said Hildy. \"Hmmm, I wonder.\" \"Uh,\" said Antala. \"Can I order now?\" Then Antala noticed Hildy smiling and staring at her stomach.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins during a festival in an alien world populated by the monsters and demons of mythology. This planet was called Planet Chaos and it was millions of lightyears directly above the Earth where humans made their home. Chaos\u2019s sky was littered with bright black stars that shined in the bright gold regardless of the time of day. There were oceans of water that coexisted with sees of lava and the land was made up of jagged metallic-colored Earth and magic ruins. Monsters of four different elements called this place their home. It was said that the inhabitants of Planet Chaos could appear on Earth through astral projection and were seen by the Earthlings as monsters from stories. Some monsters had dark intentions when they came to Earth. In particularly, succubi were often dispatched to this planet to wreak absolute havoc and collect the souls of the Earthlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this night they were in the middle of an alien holiday. The festival was to celebrate an event where the planet\u2019s four moons that represented air, earth, water and fire were aligned. This was the one day of the year in which the creatures of all four elements came out and mixed together. Eerie music filled the air as torches flared with flames, geysers, tornadoes and pebbles. At four corners of the festival, the monsters of air, earth, water and fire were partaking in festive activities. In the earth corner, there was a female kappa with turquoise skin, a bright green shell and brown hair worn in a bun who was in the middle of a sumo match with an equally large lizard monster girl resembling a bright purple-skinned sungazer with long orange-red hair who was wearing a yellow and gold metallic leotard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the air corner of the festival, there were monster children flying kites as two monsters were having a race. One of them was a harpy resembling a red hawk with long golden red hair and a beaked face. Her opponent was a gray-skinned gargoyle with a bulging right eye and two crooked horns. The gargoyle did his best to keep up with the hawk harpy, but in the end, the hawk harpy flew through the flaming hoop that marked the finish line as several air-elemental monsters cheered loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally. In the water corner of the festival, they were several mermaids perched upon icebergs singing a strange tune in alien language while in a junk sailing out from the shore, a Lovecraftian man resembling a brown-skinned octopus with bolts embedded in his arms was launching roman candles into the sky. These roman candles caught the attention of one young (relatively) succubus girl named Antala. She was an hourglass shaped red-skinned succubus girl with silver hair, gold cat\u2019s eyes, E-cup breasts and enormous hips. She was wearing a festival dress that looked like a kimono made of leather with red, green and blue skeleton designs planted on it. Antala looked down at the festival and smiled. \u201cWell,\u201d said the succubus. \u201cIt looks like the festival is already fired up. I came around just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala flew over the fire corner of the festival and saw a voluptuous zombie girl with the left side of her body covered in decayed blue skin, the right side covered in exposed muscle tissue and a skull for a face, dancing a Hawaiian dance and twerking as she juggled around burning batons. The succubus flew down to watch the act from a distance as several male monsters were cheering. Antala gave a scoff and then started to walk and clop her hoofed feet against the ground, passing by a brown-skinned and dark-haired werehippopotamus woman who was drinking from a transparent gourd filled with a strange alcoholic beverage that appeared to have screaming faces forming in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said the succubus to herself as she looked around and saw all the activities going on. \u201cWhat should I do first? Maybe I could take part in the piranha-catching contest. There is no way I\u2019m letting that double-faced coral golem beat me again this year. Or maybe I should head to the air corner and catch the air show. Possibilities, possibilities. I know. I\u2019ll find something to eat first. There must be some yummy festival food here somewhere.\u201d Antala looked around to see if she could find any delicious festival food to eat. There was one food cart that was serving what appeared to be cotton candy with eyeballs coated in them while another food cart served calzones with green meat coating them. However, neither one caught Antala\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Antala saw something that caught her eyes. It was a stand that had what appeared to be a sweet stand with several plastic eyes on top in a straight row. Antala took a closer look to see that the vendor was a baku, a Japanese monster resembling a fanged tapir. This baku woman was a fat baku with green skin and white spots. The baku woman lifted her head and then smirked at Antala. \u201cCare for a bit of dango, young lady?\u201d The baku woman handed Antala a stick of dango (Japanese sweet dumplings) and Antala looked to see that each dumpling had a human-like face. Additionally, unlike regular dango, these dumplings were as big as cantalopes Antala shrugged her shoulders and bit into the first bite of dango and then gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala\u2019s eyes popped and flames appeared on her irises before Antala\u2019s jaw dropped and flames came out. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d said the succubus as music played all around. \u201cThis is the best dango I\u2019ve ever eaten. I\u2019ve never tasted anything so sweet. What\u2019s in it?\u201d The baku gave a snort and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this dango recipe has been in my family for thousands of years. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m telling you.\u201d Antala let out a sigh but then remembered she had five dumplings left and ate them one by one, each dumpling sweeter than the last. \u201cMay I please have another?\u201d The baku smiled and handed Antala more dumplings as the succubus continued to gorge herself. She had developed a taste for the dumplings and was blissfully unaware of the potbelly that was forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Get away!\u201d In Antala\u2019s dream there were several creatures chasing her, resembling tomato headed grim reapers that were snarling and holding out large scythes. The leader of the tomato reapers had what looked like a bear trap where his teeth should be and was snapping his jaws as he came closer and closer to the terrified succubus. \u201cStay back!\u201d yelled Antala between screams. \u201cStay back! Suddenly, a large hand came out of the ground and grabbed Antala\u2019s foot. Antala screamed as a tomato headed zombie came out of the ground laughing evilly, showing an eyeball on its uvula right before a creature resembling a cross between a tomato zombie and a fallen angel came out and approached her with a machete. Antala screamed until she woke up and stood up in her bed, panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese tomato nightmares were a recurring problem. Antala had an unexplained and illogical fear of tomatoes. It wasn\u2019t a problem before, but somehow tomato seeds got mixed in with her potato seeds and she had accidentally grown an entire field of the red, green and yellow fruit (or vegetables, tomatoes are a rather grey area on that). She walked up to the mirror in her kitchen and splashed her face with water before she breathed in and out. \u201cNot again,\u201d she said. \u201cNot again. This was almost as bad as that nightmare where those tomatoes forced me to watch that awful show with the teenage nanny. I\u2019m putting a stop to this right now, even if it kills me.\u201d Antala was about to leave but then she looked at her watch and then sat down in front of a television. \u201cI guess I could tend to my problem after watching this show on the Mystery Channel I\u2019ve only been able to watch because of my insomnia. Maybe these nightmares aren\u2019t so... oh who am I kidding, I\u2019m getting rid of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Antala was outside a waiting room ready to see a psychiatrist. Outside the waiting room, there were several strange cases, such as a Frankenstein\u2019s monster that hid under a chair when a bolt of lightning suddenly struck outside. There was also a turkey harpy who was twitching nervously and spinning her head around like an owl. Antala looked ahead and saw a gargoyle wearing a Napoleon hat, with the receptionist looking at him and mumbling \u201cNot another one.\u201d. The receptionist then pressed a button and turned to Antala. \u201cAntala,\u201d she said. \u201cThe doctor will see you now.\u201d Antala sprung up and slowly walked to the psychiatrist\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychiatrist in charge was a large werehippo who was three times as large as Antala and if she was Antala\u2019s height, she would weigh 1000lbs. She had pitch black skin and long blonde hair and was wearing a pair of rectangular glasses. She also had what appeared to be a tattoo of three diamonds on her right breasts from what could be seen from her clothes. The doctor blinked as she looked at Antala. \u201cMs. Antala,\u201d she said. \u201cMy receptionist tells me that you have quite an unusual phobia.\u201d Antala gave a gulp. \u201cWell, you see, Dr. Keeler,\u201d said the nervous succubus. \u201cI have a fear that is getting in the way of my work and is making it hard for me to sleep.\u201d The hippopotamus psychiatrist nodded her head. \u201cI understand you live on a farm? What is the fear? Chickens? Cows? Crows?\u201d Antala held her head down and gave a gulp. \u201cIt\u2019s tomatoes.\u201d\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Keeler looked at her patient and raised an eyebrow. \u201cTomatoes?\u201d she asked as if it was the most absurd thing she\u2019d ever heard (which it was). Antala nodded her head. \u201cI have a fear of tomatoes.\u201d The doctor rolls her eyes and taps her enormous belly. \u201cI see. Any particular reason for this fear?\u201d Antala bit her lip. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know where this fear actually stems from.\u201d Dr. Keeler let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll be frank,\u201d said the werehippo. \u201cThis is perhaps the strangest case I\u2019ve ever seen. In cases like this, confronting the fear is the best antidote and I know where to start.\u201d Antala was initially confused until the psychiatrist held out her arm and opened her hand to reveal a...</span></div></div>",

She looked as though she was about to have a panic attack. Seeing that green tomato made her briefly suffer a nightmarish fantasy where aliens with green tomato heads invaded her farm in a flying saucer and bore eyeless faces with no lips and jagged teeth as they hissed loudly and attacked her. Antala could imagine those tomato aliens pulling her apart right before she let out a loud scream and snapped back to reality. She folded her wings into a cape and covered herself as she held her tail and shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Keeler rolled her eyes and let out a sigh. \"Oh brother,\" the talking hippopotamus psychiatrist thought to herself. \"I can tell that I've got a wild one here. This is going to take some persuasion.\" The werehippopotamus let out a snort before she let out steam from her nostrils, cleared her throat and spoke. \"Ms. Antala,\" said Dr. Keeler. \"Sometimes we have to face our fears head on. I once knew a man who was afraid of heights but conquered the fear by climbing up a water tower. In your case, the best thing to do about your... tomato phobia... is to swallow your fears. Literally in this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala gave a look of even more horror. Never before in her life had she ever thought about eating a tomato. She never even had ketchup on her french fries. \"Me?\" asked Antala. \"Eat a tomato? There has got to be another way.\" Dr. Keeler sat down in both her seats before she shook her head. \"Antala. What you're afraid of is nothing more than a harmless food stuff. If you can eat just one tomato, then it will be the first step towards conquering your fears and getting rid of them forever. I want you to eat green tomatoes for the next 24 hours and then come back and see me tomorrow. Now shut up and eat this tomato.\" Antala stared at the green tomato in Dr. Keeler's hands and was hesitant. \"But Dr. Keeler,\" she said. \"This tomato is green. It isn't even ripe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Dr. Keeler lost her patience and let out a loud roar, revealing her enormous, sharp and yellow stained teeth. Antala didn't want to get the doctor any angrier and she stuffed the green tomato into her mouth and then gagged before she held her neck. In her haste to eat the tomato and conquer her fears, Antala had forgotten to actually chew the tomato. Antala grunted and groaned before she finally swallowed the tomato and then huffed and puffed and coughed a few times. \"How do you feel?\" asked Dr. Keeler. Antala just coughed a few times. \"Like I'm going to be sick.\" Dr. Keeler gave a snort. \"Well, nevertheless, you won't get over your fears unless you eat lots and lots of tomatoes. Come back tomorrow and we'll discuss your progress.\" Antala nodded her head and then walked away, leaving Dr. Keeler to her next patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Antala walked out, in walked a male weretiger that was holding his head. \"You gotta help me, Doctor,\" said the tiger man. \"I've been seeing stripes everywhere I go.\" Dr. Keeler let out a grumble and held her head. \"Why me,\" thought the hippo woman to herself. \"Why all the time me?\" As Antala left the doctor's office, she held her stomach and moaned. Something was not sitting right about the green tomato she swallowed and it wasn't just indigestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, does her body undergo any immediate change?</span></div></div>",

Oh.\" Antala clutched her stomach in pain before she walked out of the hospital and then started to fly away. She didn't notice it at the time, but her stomach had begun to bulge slightly. However, at this point, it was hard to say whether or not it was due to the tomato that she ate. Antala flapped her leather signs to reach the air and she looked down to see a cart that was filled with green tomatoes and as she looked down, she imagined the tomatoes with sharp fangs and glowing eyes. They hissed like cobras and opened their jaws up so much that they split in half and exposed snake-like tongues. Antala's eyes widened as she saw the tomatoes for more than they actually were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, the tomatoes were nothing more than ordinary green tomatoes that were being peddled by a kamaitachi, a Japanese weasel-like yokai. He was having no luck and there was an obese pink-furred wereleopard girl dressed as a policewoman badgering him. \"You expect anyone to buy these tomatoes?\" asked the leopard cop. \"They're green! It's against the law to sell unripe produce. You should at least wait until they turn yellow before you try and sell them. I'll let it slide this time, but I'm warning you, nobody is going to buy green tomatoes.\" That's what the pink-furred police leopard thought, but then Antala flew down from the sky and nervously bit her lip. \"I'll buy them.\" Both the leopard policewoman and the weasel fruit vendor looked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala was soon welling up with tears of fear as she bought the entire cart of tomatoes and swallowed every last green one. The green tomatoes however, were clearly not meant to be consumed in such excess and Antala quickly became ill as she held her stomach and groaned. \"This was not a good idea,\" groaned the young succubus. \"I don't think I'm any closer to breaking my fear of tomatoes.\" Antala groaned and then she finally arrived home where she collapsed in front of her front door and had to crawl onto the verandah before she took out her cell phone. She decided to give Dr. Keeler a quick buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the werehippopotamus psychiatrist had just stepped out of the shower and was wrapped in three towels. \"Dr. Keeler,\" said Antala. \"I did what you said. I ate an entire cart of green tomatoes and they just made me sick.\" \"I didn't tell you to eat <i>that</i> many tomatoes, Antala. You need to pace yourself. If you're not careful, you'll make yourself gravely ill. It's like that human my sister ate the other day that made her sick. You can't expect to get rid of your fear of tomatoes so quickly. It takes time. From now on, try to control how many tomatoes you eat at a time.\" Dr. Keeler hung up and Antala felt her stomach in pain. \"Now she tells me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a ripping noise and then Antala gasped. She looked down and saw that her shirt was coming apart. Her belly was getting bigger and bigger and swelling. \"Oh no!\" yelled Antala. Antala screamed so much that her skin turned as green as an unripened tomato.\" Once her skin was completely green, Antala looked at her belly and saw it was now as big and heavy as a...</span></div></div>",

She can make them do anything, but her favorite thing to do is this: if she consumes a living beings shadow, that person becomes her mindless slave. There's just one catch to that ability: she has no way of removing the shadows from her belly, so he belly just grows and grows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dream Eater: In this story, Antala is a benevolent succubus who has an interesting ability: she can consume the nightmares of any sleeping person. When she does, the nightmares are replaced with sweet dreams. She then stores the nightmares in her belly, so she can deal with them later. (This story is RedHurricane's idea.)</span></div></div>",

It was like this at least twice a day at the Undertown gym. Of all of the monsters, succubi were under the most pressure to look decent and to stay in shape. Antala was even moreso than other succubi and put herself at such pressure to remain in good shape that at one point she passed out mid workout from dehydration and the owner had to call the paramedics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Antala didn't learn from the experience and was sweating up a storm on the treadmill when it suddenly turned off. \"Hey!\" yelled the succubus. \"What gives?\" The weretiger owner let out a slight growl and walked up to Antala. \"I turned off the treadmill, Antala,\" he said. \"You're taking this way too far.\" \"Bite me,\" said Antala as she grit her teeth. \"I'm only looking out for my health.\" \"If you keep going this way,\" said the tiger man. \"You're going to destroy your health. You gotta chill down.\" Antala stuck her tongue out at the tiger man as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Antala know that there was a couple of gargoyles on a nearby building that were watching her. One of them was a pitch whited skinned female gargoyle with rainbow streaks in her hair and an hourglass figure wearing a white tunic and  the other was a black skinned male gargoyle with flying-squirrel like wings, a curved neck and no hair, wearing a blue loincloth. The white gargoyle gave a smirk as she looked down at Antala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A perfect target,\" said the white gargoyle. \"Don't you think, Schwarz.\" \"I don't get it, Weiss,\" said the black gargoyle to his female counterpart. \"What's the deke this time?\" Weiss lets out a laugh. \"Think of it as a social experiment. Monsters can be so desperate that their feeble minds will lead them to believe anything. If somebody promises them a cure for their problems, they'll...\" \"I think Succubi are the ones who are supposed to convince people to sign over their souls.\" Weiss however, held up a briefcase and shook it as Schwarz looked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala was then jogging down the street and this gave Weiss the opportunity to fly down and land in front of the succubus, catching Antala by surprise as she gave a smirk. \"Hello.\" Weiss said. Before Antala could say anything, Weiss started to walk around and inspect the young (by succubus standards) succubus. \"I see you're a working girl. Oh my.\" \"What?\" asked Antala in worry before she gags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss started to feel around Antala's thighs. \"Now,\" she said. \"That's not good. Not good at all. You've got quite the thunder thighs.\" Antala blushed and looked back at her rear end as she blushed. \"Before long,\" said Weiss. \"You'll be as big as a bus.\" \"B-But that's not possible,\" said Antala. \"I exercise three times a day.\" Weiss just shook her head and smirked. \"That's not going to matter much. However, I do have a proposition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala was suddenly very interested. Weiss held out her briefcase and opened it up to reveal several bottles of soda. \"Soda pop?!\" yelled Antala. \"WTF! I want to <i>lose</i> weight!\" \"And you will,\" said Weiss. \"Sometimes you have to get bigger to get smaller.\" Antala just blinked. \"I don't follow.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss held up a bottle of the soda and smiled. \"This is a new experimental soda. It will increase the size of your stomach, but it will also make your body stronger, go beyond its limits. That way you'll be able to work out twice as hard without killing yourself. The first one is free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala didn't know what to think about it. Weiss's proposal was screwy, but there was a chance that it could've worked.

Now, here's my number.\" Weiss said as she handed a card to Antala. \"Call me when you see results. Then we'll see if we can do proper business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, um, I'm sorry.

Just down the entire bottle in one go, and the soda will do the rest!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala picked up the bottle and opened it to get a smell. It certainly did smell like grape. She was still concerned, but if this worked, she'd never have to worry about passing out again. Throwing caution to the wind, she put the bottle to her mouth and started chugging. It took her only a few seconds to finish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited a few seconds, but nothing seemed to happen. She was about to throw the bottle in anger when she felt a gurgling in her stomach. She looked down and was shocked to see her stomach begin to expand. She dropped the bottle and clutched her stomach.

She checked the caller ID and was surprised to see that it read \"Georgia\". Antala snatched it up and put it up to her ear. \"Antala here.\" \"Hi, Ant,\" said Georgia. \"What's up?\" On the other side of the line was Georgia, an hourglass shaped gorgon with with an hourglass shape, D-Cup Breasts and a round heart shaped butt. She had gray skin and black cobras for hair. She was wearing blue jeans and an apron but no shirt or bra. She was busy working on a sculpture of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much is going on here, Georgia,\" says Antala. \"What's the word from my favorite gorgon.\" \"Well,\" says Georgia. \"I've just been commissioned to make a succubus sculpture for a very rich client and I figured that...\" \"Oh,\" says Antala. \"So you want me to be a model. Say no more.\" \"But Antala, there's something you need to know..\" Before Georgia could finish, Antala hung up and got dressed in a purple bikini with spiked shoulders and hearts on the nipples. It was there, she walked into her closet, revealing a rainbow colored crack on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Georgia didn't just live in a different city as Antala, she lived in a different dimension. As Antala walked into the crack, she found herself in Georgia's apartment and saw in front of her were the painted nails on Georgia's toes, each one bigger than she was. In Georgia's dimension, the monsters of mythology were as big as skyscrapers and the smallest full-grown monster was 300ft tall. Georgia herself was 550ft tall and was looking down at Antala before she picked up the tiny succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala looked around Georgia's workshop to see there were sculptures of all kinds of monsters. There was a sculpture of a gargoyle's skeleton, a sculpture of Siamese twin mummies and one of four conjoined mandrakes, one for each season. \"Nice stuff you have here, Georgie,\" says Antala as she stands in Georgia's palm. Georgia gives a smile as her snakes hiss. Georgia made she she was wearing her yellow sunglasses as she looked at Antala. Being a gorgon, Georgia had a fatal petrifying gaze that required her to wear sunglasses to prevent herself from petrifying non-gorgons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" says Antala as she holds her hands in the air. \"How should I pose?\" \"Uh, there's something you should know, Antala. My client has a belly fetish. I need a succubus with a big belly, preferably to the point of immobility.\" Antala lets out a scoff and taps her hips. \"Excuse me?\" \"N-Now, don't be angry Antala. We've been friends for 2 years now. You were the first to come to mind.\" \"Don't tell me you brought me here just to stuff me like a turkey, Georgia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia walked towards her kitchen and there were several bottles of soda lined in a row. \"It won't be as bad as you think. I'll just inflate you with a bottle of Ghoula Gola.\" Georgia placed Antala on the table and Antala walked up to a bottle of soda as big as a grain silo. \"You're the artist,\" she said with a sigh. Georgia was opening a bottle but before she could pour it into a glass, somebody was knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit,\" says Georgia. \"Nefernina. I forgot it was rent day. I'll be back.\" Antala had heard about Nefernina, Georgia's landlady. She was a giant pear-shaped mummy who ruled the Monster Arms apartment building with an iron fist wrapped in gauze.

I'm just wondering what I'm doing with my afterlife. I've decided that maybe I should issue a rule against eating humans in this building. Lupa won't like it, but let's face it, she could stand to lose some weight. I've also decided I'm going to mellow out and be nicer to R.L. Well, see you around.\" Nefernina took the rent and left, leaving Georgia confused. \"That's odd,\" said Georgia. \"Nefernina isn't acting like herself. It's as if there's something grim on the horizon. What do you think, Antala?

Suddenly Antala hiccuped and then held her mouth as she groaned. She looked up to see that to her surprise she had drank the entire bottle of orange soda.

It seemed to be twice as wide as she was tall and she could barely stand. \"Oh,\" said Antala as she felt her red skin becoming more orange in color. \"Ugh. Ooh.\" Antala felt her head spinning and even belched up a few orange bubbles before she felt her stomach. It seemed like the soda was still bubbling inside of her. \"I guess bigger soda means bigger fizz.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia walked into the kitchen and looked in surprise. \"Wow,\" she said. \"Antala.

Georgia had the general body shape done and was now chipping in Antala's wings. She would've continued but there was a knock at the door. Georgia's snakes hissed in response and Antala grit her teeth. \"Who the hell could that be?\" asked Georgia. Antala let out a moan as Georgia got up to walk towards the door. As Georgia opened the door, there was a 300ft tall olive Ridley sea turtle-based kappa with bluish hair smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Georgia wasn't happy at all to see this kappa woman. \"Shelly!\" she yelled. \"What the hell do you want you bitch.\" Shelly let out a laugh. \"Come on, Georgia, is that any way to treat a friend?\" \"You and I aren't friends, Shelly,\" says Georgia. \"Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying.\" Antala leaned forward to get a good look. From what Georgia told her, Shelly was a con artist and had swindled her once before. It was rather bold of the kappa to try and cheat anyone where she lived since there was a cop on the third floor; an orange skinned and white haired gargoyle woman by the name of Petra and at 1000ft tall, Petra was the biggest monster in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Georgia and Shelly were arguing, Antala leaned forward but because of her bigger belly she fell back too far and yelled. She fell on the ground and started to roll across the floor. The succubus rolled under and between Georgia and Shelly's legs and into the hallway. \"Georgia!\" yelled Antala. \"I...! Ouch!\" Antala then found herself being kicked upstairs absentmindedly by a giant cat sith girl who resembled a Siamese cat dressed up as a biker. That was Patsy, a biker who was in a gang of werecats called the Fire Cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatsy had kicked the big-bellied succubus upstairs and Antala rubbed her head before she heard stomping.

This is the police! We have some questions for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala gasped and then looked out her window to see two large male gargoyles dressed in police uniforms outside her front door. One was a pudgy tealish blue skinned gargoyle with spikes running down his head and large fangs while the other was a red gargoyle with a beaked mouth and white hair. \"We're not here to arrest you,\" said the red gargoyle as he continued to knock. \"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" Thought Antala to herself. \"Stupid gargoyles cops. If they see this gold, I'm history.\" Antala looked around to find any possible way of disposing of the gold. First, she looked out the window. She could've tossed out the gold, but the cops would've seen it. She could've hidden it under her bed but they were cops, it was their job to search the whole house and throwing it down the drain was out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala was sweating before the red gargoyle knocked again. \"Open this door or we're breaking it down! We have a warrant!\" Antala saw the gold and then got a desperate idea and gulped. \"What other choice do I have?\" she asked. Antala grunted as she held the briefcase and opened it up before grabbing the gold by the handful and shoveling every last coin down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point the red gargoyle was getting impatient. \"I don't think she's opening the door, Bennett.\" Said the teal gargoyle. \"Then I'm breaking the #&amp;@%ing door down.\" The red gargoyle was ready to punch the door open but then Antala opened it with a smile. \"Is there a problem officers?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth gargoyle cops looked in surprise because Antala's stomach had swelled so much that she looked like she was pregnant with octuplets. \"Uh,\" said the red cop as he tipped his hat. \"I'm terribly sorry to trouble a woman in your position, ma'am.

I thought crime would be low after Taxanos got the iron maiden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala let out a groan and held up her belly. \"Well,\" she said. \"There's no way those gargoyles would believe I was pregnant with a gut <i>this</i> big.\" Antala had to wait for the cops to leave before she walked out of the alleyway and looked around and then waddled down the street as her belly was slowly getting bigger due to the magic penny in her stomach.\" Antala let out a groan. \"Well,\" she said. \"I better get out of the country. They'll never be able to follow me there. Hmm.\" Antala flapped her wings but they did nothing. She knew she had to get far away from town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, while making absolutely sure the guards couldn't see her or her growing belly, she headed for the...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Antala thought her options over and then she realized that with her belly being so big, taking a plane was out of the question. All the gold in her stomach would only serve to weigh her down and she would take the plane with her. Besides, there was the whole issue with the metal detector and she'd be caught in no time. \"Well,\" said the big gutted succubus with a heavy sigh. \"It looks like I'm taking the train.\" Antala grunted and lifted up her large stomach as best as she could and then saw several people were walking down the street. Antala gulped because she realized all too well that there were too many witnesses in the area. She needed some way to hide her stomach. That was when she saw some old curtains and a damaged shopping cart and got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala placed her belly filled with gold into the shopping cart and covered it with some of the curtains while fastening the rest into a form of makeshift dress, making her resemble a bag lady. Antala slowly walked down the street, pushing the cart as she looked around, making absolutely sure that nobody spotted her. At one point, she stopped and sweated because the police car with the two gargoyles inside it passed her and the cops inside very nearly spotted her. Antala waited five minutes to see if the cops would return and to her luck, they most likely assumed that she was an ordinary bag lady. Antala let out a sigh of relief as she made her way towards the train station. \"Thank goodness,\" she said. \"This isn't easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, at that moment at the police station, the very moment where Antala was reaching the train station, one of the boys back at the station had contacted Bill and Bennett. The dispatcher was a short yellowish-green gargoyle with a bald held and long jagged wings. \"You two might want to hear this. We've identified the gold smuggler.\" \"Are you sure about that, Thom?\" asked Bennett. Thom nodded his head and looked at a composite sketch. \"Our main witness was an elderly wheelchair-bound cyclops who was painting in the area. He claims that smugly we're looking for is a succubus; 5' 10. 187lbs, red skin and silver hair with an hourglass shape.\" \"That's funny. We saw a succubus who fit the description earlier, except she was pregnant.\" Thom thought hard on that but then he realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or at least that's what she <i>told</i> you. My guess is that she converted the gold bars into coins and literally swallowed the evidence.\" Bennett nodded his head. \"Oh, really? I think we need to have another talk with a certain demon.\" Bennett hung up as Bill turned the car around. \"I can't believe it,\" said the red-skinned gargoyle. \"You can't trust anybody these days. What is the world coming to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Antala had reached the train station but saw that there was a metal detector posted outside of the train. \"Blast!\" yelled Antala. \"Everyone is so on edge. That's the problem. Criminals in this city ruined everything for everyone.\" Antala needed a way on the train without being detected. That's when she spotted several caskets being loaded in one of the cars in the back. Antala remembered that there was an undertaker's convention in the next city over and had an idea. She sucked in her gut as best as she could when the porter wasn't looking and then she squeezed herself into the biggest coffin there was. She still grunted and groaned because it was very tight. The weight of the gold caused the two porters loading the coffin to almost drop it. It was a sheer miracle that Antala managed to get on the train at all. Antala gave a smirk, thinking she had once again escaped Johnny law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then...</span></div></div>",

Have you ever heard of <i>anyone</i> trying to hide gold away by swallowing it?\" Bill snorted. \"And my wife says that <i>I</i> have strange eating habits. And I actually thought that woman was pregnant. We'll fix her wagon.\" Antala opened the coffin slightly and gasped because she saw the police looking all over for her. She slammed the coffin shut and gulped. \"Well,\" she said. \"This is a fine kettle of fish. If those bozos find me in here, I'm done for. Perhaps I need to find a better hiding spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what Antala thought, but then she heard a rumbling and shaking sound and then she heard the sound of gold rustling. \"Oh no,\" muttered the succubus. \"Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Not now!\" But it was too late because the gold in Antala's stomach multiplied again due to the Midas penny and now her belly had gotten so big that she was trapped inside the coffin and was unable to come out. \"Ho no.\" Grunted Antala. Antala tried to struggle but it only succeeded in causing cracks to appear in the coffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that time, Bill and Bennett were looking around. They had encountered another large-bellied succubus similar in body shape to Antala (before her not quite bright idea to swallow the gold that is) except with blonde hair and blue skin. Bennett had just finished looking around. \"This one isn't her. She really <i>is</i> pregnant. Not to mention the wrong color. You're free to go, ma'am.\" Bill then tapped Bennett on the shoulder just as the other succubus left. \u201cHey, Bennett,\u201d said the larger gargoyle. \u201cSomething just occurred to me. Maybe our perp is trying to get away on a train.\u201d Bennett gave a scoff. \u201cWell, duh, Bill. Of course. Are you\u2019re saying that\u2019s she\u2019s already on her train by now?\u201d Bill nodded his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either gargoyle cop could do any more thinking on the matter, they both heard a loud crash. \u201cHoly moley!\u201d yelled Bill. \u201cWhat was that.\u201d The coffin that Antala was in had broken apart and Antala had to get up fast. She grunted as she held up her gold-filled stomach and entered the last car of the train she was on. \u201cOh,\u201d said Bennett having heard the nose. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That sound was definitely Antala. She\u2019s on one of these trains. Let\u2019s get her, Bill.\u201d Antala heard every word and begun to panic. She was tapping her hooves on the floor as her stomach shook and she begun to sweat. \u201cOh,\u201d muttered Antala. \u201cThis was definitely not my best idea. Why didn\u2019t I try to leave by plane? Oh no, oh no, oh no.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut is Antala in the right to be worried? Do Bill and Bennett get on her train?</span></div></div>",

Needing a place to stay, she chose to call up her old friend Yuki to ask if she could stay at the house she haunted. Despite being a Onryo, a spirit born of rage, Yuki was happy to let her do so and to show her Japan's best sights. Today, just after Antala arrived via portal, Yuki had shown her the Tokyo Tower and had her try to climb Mt. Fuji (Antala ran out of energy half-way up). By the time they got back, it was night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How were you able to get to the top of Fuji and back without breaking a sweat? I gave up half-way and I'm an immortal succubus.\" Antala yelled to Yuki through the door as she changed into a black bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a ghost means I have infinite energy. No getting tired for me.\" Antala heard Yuki laugh. \"I can't believe I found you sleeping on the ground when I got back to you. You looked so cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala chuckled herself. \"Yeah, and you had to carry me back to the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. You are one loud snorer.\" Yuki said as she opened the door to Antala's room, having already changed into her white nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala looked over at her. She had to admit, Yuki looked pretty. Yuki was only an inch taller than Antala. Her pitch black hair was loose and framed her chalk-white face. Though she had a similar figure to Antala's, she did have one difference: her belly was rather chunky, looking like an overinflated spare tire. Yuki said that she worked out enough to get her current shape, but Antala didn't know of any workout that gave that figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Antala a minute to realize that she was staring at Yuki's belly, and quickly looked away, blushing. Yuki giggled. \"Well, gee, Antala. I didn't know you had a thing for bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Antala didn't want to admit it, Yuki was right. Antala did love big, fat bellies. She even had a slight crush on Yuki mostly because of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" Antala lied. \"It's just, your nightgown is tight enough that it's hard NOT to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe during the night, the Nebutori well give you a belly just like mine.\" Yuki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala looked at Yuki like she just spoke in some dead tounge even Antala didn't know. \"The Nebu-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nebutori. It's a supernatural virus. It only affects women. During the night, it makes them become really fat and lethargic. Though it can target specific spots sometimes. I knew a kappa who got infected. By the time she was cured, her butt was the size of a truck. Took her a month to slim down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala just stared at Yuki for a moment. \"Ok, you need sleep. Go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki shrugged. \"Alright, see you in the morning.\" She said and went back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala shut the door and flopped down on the bed, going to sleep instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night, a small blue orb appeared in Antala's bedroom. It went over to Antala, seemed to look at her for a moment, and sent a soft light to her belly. It then vanished, leaving a blue glow on Antala's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Antala woke up, ready to really begin her vacation. But when she tried to get up, she felt a weight on her stomach. Throwing off the covers, she looked down at her belly. To her shock she saw that it was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yuki flew in carrying breakfast when she spotted Antala. \"Good morning, Antala,\" said Yuki. \"I hope you're hungry, I.... oh my gosh!\" Yuki dropped her dishes and looked in surprise as Antala held up her slightly larger belly. \"Yuki?\" asked Antala. \"What is going on?\" Yuki gave a laugh and tapped Antala's stomach, much to her western friend's discomfort. \"It looks like you have nebutori, Antala. Just look at that belly. Okay, so the size isn't that impressive but it's still something.\" Yuki gave a giggle and held out her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala however, was not feeling as excited about this situation. While she did have a thing for large bellies, she didn't mean that she felt comfortable with one on herself. Antala tried to push in her stomach, causing Yuki to have a fit. \"Wait!\" yelled Yuki as she tried to stop Antala. \"Stop! What are you doing!? This is nothing to be ashamed of.\" Antala let out a sigh. \"That's easy for you to say, Yuki. People where I'm from are rather critical of fat.\" Then Antala realized something and looked at herself in the mirror. While it was true that her belly was slightly bigger, the rest of her body was completely untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki,\" says Antala. \"I don't mean to pry, but isn't nebutori supposed to make women really large and lethargic? So far, it's only centered in my stomach.\" Yuki remembered that and then rubber her chin and then her own stomach. \"Well,\" she says. \"Nebutori affects all victims differently. I knew of a gargoyle who looked like a dead ringer for that blue one in the cartoon. She came to Japan on vacation and was infected. Instead of focusing on a particular area, it made her spherical and she kept falling and rolling down hills.\" Yuki let out a laugh remembering that particular instance. \"Or then there was another tourist who was friends with that gargoyle. A human woman whose nebutori literally went to her head and it took her weeks to recover.\" Antala shivered thinking of such a horrifying experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those poor women.\" Antala was so stressed out that she was pacing in circles and tapping her hooves. As she did so, Yuki looked on and blinked. She had to rub her eyes and the Onryo's jaw dropped because at one point, Antala started to jog. \"Antala,\" she says. \"Haven't you noticed that you're acting usually active for somebody who's supposed to have nebutori.\" Antala stopped in her tracks and her eyes popped out of her head. She tapped her stomach and it made a noise like a basketball. \"You're right. Nebutori makes women lethargic. How come it didn't affect me. Hey, wait a minute! Do you know of any other succubi who were infected with nebutori?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki actually had to think long and hard about that, but then she realized something. Not a lot of succubi actually come around here. Come to think of it, nebutori doesn't often infect western monsters. Maybe some certain people in the west have a natural immunity to certain aspects of nebutori. That's amazing. You can do what other girls without nebutori can do.\" Antala blinked. \"That's... that's...\" Antala was of mixed thoughts. She <i>was</i> overjoyed that the nebutori didn't make her lethargic like most of the other victims of nebutori. She did have a thing for big bellies but she was still having second thoughts about having one herself and bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala did her best in order to forget what was bothering her, but she realized very quickly that none of the clothes she brought with her could fit over her large stomach. The Doctor Who shirt she had with her, that was one of her favorite shirts, only covered her belly halfway. Antala let out a groan but then Yuki tapped her on the stomach and handed her another t-shirt that was bigger and would've fit much better. It had bright colored Japanese letters on it and some kind of anime graphic. Antala smiled and took the t-shirt and found it fit her much better. \"Thank you, Yuki.\" Said Antala. Yuki smiled and nodded her head at her succubus friend. \"Anytime. Anything for a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala was about to walk out but then looked at her stomach. \"I don't know if I should be going out like this, Yuki. What if somebody sees me like this?\" Yuki gave a scoff. \"I happen to know some girls with past experiences with nebutori. They'll understand. Besides, what should you care what others think of you. The important thing is to have confidence. Just because your belly is bigger, doesn't mean you should be ashamed. After all, I thought you liked them like that.\" Antala smiled and then nodded her head. \"You're right, Yuki. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort for Antala to get through the door, but she walks out and is rather confident with herself as Yuki follows her. Where are the two friends on their way to, in the big city?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The what?\" Antala asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. You don't speak much Japanese. It means \"Sexy Belly\". It's a woman's only club. As the name states, it's all about big bellies. It doesn't matter what their filled with, just as long as they are big. The bigger, the better. So get changed. I'm taking you clubbing!\" Yuki said, before starting for her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki, it's 11 in the morning! Can it wait?\" Antala asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki looked back and blushed. \"Oh, right. My bad. Got a little excited.\" She said. \"You want breakfast or lunch?\"<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\nThe day went by uneventfully, oddly enough. Antala and Yuki mostly spent the day inside, either watching cheesy horror movies or playing games. At around 6, Yuki told Antala to change into something to wear to Sekush\u1fd9 Hara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes, Antala changed into a skimpy black dress and her high-heeled boots. She stood at the front door waiting for Yuki. Eventually, Yuki came down. She was wearing a dark orange tank top, tight black pants, and red high heels. Her belly was completely exposed. When she saw Antala, she frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wearing that?\" Yuki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with it?\" Antala asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're new belly's not out for everyone to see.\" Yuki replied. \"Is this your favorite dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have 7 more back home. Why?\" Antala asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki simply walked to the bathroom and grabbed a pair of scissors. When she came back, she told Antala to remove the dress. Antala did, and Yuki started cutting. When she was done, she gave the dress back. Antala put it back on, and saw that Yuki had cut the dress in a way that Antala's belly was out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better! Ready to go?\" Yuki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala shrugged. \"I guess.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki then grabbed Antala's arm and took her out the door.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nAn hour later, Yuki and Antala were standing outside the club. Antala had to admit, it looked decent from the outside. A simple neon sign with the name and a bright blue color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we need a secret password or be members or something like that to get it?\" Antala asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It's a fairly open club. The only real rule is you need to be over 18. You're 24 in human years and I was 25 when I died, which was 20 years ago, so we're good.\" Yuki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Antala could say anything, Yuki dragged her into the club. After a brief check with the bouncer, they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala was amazed. The outside did not properly advertise the inside. Inside was incredible. There were two well stocked bars, a very open floor, bright cheery lighting, and wonderful music. The club was filled with female monsters of all species, all with varying belly sizes. But Antala's eyes were drawn to the stage. On it were 8 of the most beautiful women dancing in skimpy clothing. All of them had truly massive bellies, easily twice the size of her's and Yuki's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Antala,\" Yuki yelled over the music. \"What do you want to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala thought. \"I want...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of them moved with flexibility and grace, which contrasted their huge bellies. Antala also admitted to herself that the dancers bellies were beautiful. Despite their size and presumed weight, they kept a spherical look. She was almost hypnotized by watching them sway and jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a half hour, Antala got to go get another drink from the bar.

The young succubus wiped frozen snot from her nose and shivered as she curled her wings up and started to form a large wall of ice. Antala was in the middle of rebuilding her igloo that was damaged in a storm. She was a succubus who used to be one of the queen\u2019s guards, but due to a massive failure on her part, mostly due to clumsiness, Antala had been banished to Alaska. Succubi were creatures that were so very used to warmer environments, so Antala was clearly not enjoying herself with all the cold and was shivering with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate cold weather,\u201d muttered Antala. \u201cStupid queen. It\u2019s not like I meant to destroy the back wall of the city. I just tripped. These things happen. I surely didn\u2019t deserve to be banished for this.\u201d Antala begun to huff and puff and then sneezed again, blowing away the building materials she needed to complete her repairs.\u201d The succubus grumbled as her red skin was turning an icy blue. \u201cOh great,\u201d complained Antala. \u201cNow I need to find more ice. It\u2019s not pretty being me.\u201d Antala grumbled and walked out to gather more ice and snow into a bucket in order to build her igloo. Unfortunately for her, she didn\u2019t notice that she was walking out over the frozen sea and the ice underneath her feet was getting thinner and thinner. The ice started to crack and as soon as Antala filled up her bucket, the ice finally broke and Antala screamed as she fell into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala grabbed herself and shivered. The water was more than 50 Below and it didn\u2019t help that Antala was nowhere near properly dressed for the weather. Antala grabbed herself and shook in discomfort. \u201cI hate the cold!\u201d complained Antala. \u201cI hate the cold! I hate the cold! I wish there was some way that I could survive in this horrible environment! If only I had thick fur, or even feathers! I wouldn\u2019t care if I was 1000lbs fatter if it would help me beat the cold!\u201d Antala was crying as she struggled to climb back out of the freezing water. However, Antala was not alone in the water, for something big and hidden by shadows with glowing white eyes let out a bellow as it swam under the water. It was dark and forboding, looking aquatic and mammalian at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange creature was clearly looking around for prey when it spotted Antala and no doubt mistook her for something tasty. The creature swam forward just as Antala had finally managed to climb out of the water and back onto the ice. Without warning, the creature bit Antala by the tail and made her scream as she jumped and flew through the air like a frightened skua. Antala landed back on solid (albeit frozen) ground and blew on her tail before she looked down at her hooves and groaned. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t lose those to frost bite. And to top it all off, something bit me. I hate this place!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Antala had eventually managed to repair her igloo and was sitting inside in front of a fire that was quickly going out. \u201cNo!\u201d yelled Antala. \u201cNo! No! Don\u2019t go out! Not now! Ugh!\u201d Antala then yelled in pain because her belly touched the fire and made her stand up. Antala looked in the reflection on the icy wall and saw that her belly was bulging out. \u201cWhat the?! Whoa!\u201d Antala\u2019s belly was still growing bigger and Antala gasped as she started to undergo a strange mutation. As Antala\u2019s stomach expanded, Antala started to turn into a hybrid of a succubus and a....</span></div></div>",

Her skin turned a turquoise shade of green as her wings expanded to accommodate her bigger belly that was now as big as a baby whale. Antala's hooves turned into fins as webs grew between her fingers and she then let out a bellow like a humpback whale. Antala looked at her reflection in the walls of her igloo and was horrified at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a whale,\" said the transmogrified succubus. \"I'm a big, turquoise, humpback whale with an enormous belly. How did? Wait!\" Antala then walked outside and looked around before she spotted a sign that was covered in snow and half frozen with ice. Antala pounded the sign until the snow had completely fallen off and then used her sharp fingernails in order to break the ice. The sign depicted a demonic and almost undead looking humpback whale with glowing red eyes and there was a description of some sort under it. Antala looked closer to read what was on the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under no circumstances is anyone to go swimming at night,\" read the succubus turned into a humanoid whale. \"These waters are infested with vicious, undead and very unfriendly werewhales that will attack anything they see.

Perhaps there's a shaman who knows how to change me back.\" Antala let out a moan. \"Well, it couldn't hurt to try.\" Antala was running as best she could in the direction towards the village she had mentioned and was sweating with every step.

Antala struggled as her belly was now like an oversized yoga ball and her tail was wagging as she attempted to reposition herself. \"Come on! Come on!

I <i>know</i> I'm going to be sick. I still can't believe that something this ridiculous is happening to me. Why me?\" Antala waddled through the snow and then saw the ocean littered with pieces of ice that were as big as rafts. On the other side there was land and what looked like a village of some sort, complete with igloos. \"The village,\" said Antala. \"There will surely be somebody there who knows about the werewhale curse. Maybe there will be a witch doctor who can help me.\" Antala looked out again and noticed the pieces of ice floating in the water and let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those chunks of ice will never support my tummy.

Geronimo!\" Antala held her nose and then leapt with her enormous belly into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus-turned-werewhale landed with a big splash that caused a tidal wave to strike the land behind her and get all the trees wet enough to melt the snow on top of them. Antala felt herself sinking and gasped as she flapped her wings and shook both her arms and legs. Antala paddled as best as she could until she finally had her head out of the water and gave a gasp. After a minute, Antala finally managed to position herself and was swimming through the water more gracefully than she was before. \"Thank Heavens,\" said Antala. \"Huh. Well, at least I can swim.

That doctor with the mustache? Listen, Antala, please be careful. These people are expecting food and a lot of them have really hot tempers. Don't do anything that would upset them.\" Antala let out a nervous laugh as Kai handed her a tray of pasta. \"Don't worry, Kai. I'll be careful.\" However, Kai let out a groan. \"I wish that I could believe that. Just don't try anything stupid, Antala.\" Antala nodded her head and skated on her way. \"Oh!\" yelled Kai. \"Bring that to table 23!\" \"I got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt table 23, there was a man wrapped from head to toe in black robes. It was unknown if he was a human or some sort of monster but he had glowing red eyes and dark gray-skin. He was hissing as eh was tapping his fingers on the table. He was holding onto an idol of some sort that resembled Ammut, the devourer of the dead. \"Where is my pasta?\" asked the man. \"What is with this restaurant?\" \"Coming!\" yelled Antala as she was skating.

She had almost made it when suddenly, her roller skates lost their wheels and she let out a yell as she fell towards the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala spilled spaghetti all over the man and made him scream.

Antala's eyes were still bright yellow, but her silver hair was getting smaller until it turned into an Egyptian-style bob cut and her pointed tail had shrunk until it was small and stubby.

Everyone stopped and stared at her and one young man even walked into her belly and fell down.

Antala looked around and saw the damage, somehow failing to notice her own transformation and blushed, causing her metallic pink skin to briefly turn to its original red tint. \"Sorry,\" said Antala. \"I'm sorry.

It looks like you have more serious problems to worry about than your job.\" Kai held up a piece of broken glass and Antala looked in surprise at the fact she was now a hippopotamus with a large protruding gut.

She was so busy that she didn\u2019t notice that down the street there was a van that was coming to a stop. The Van had an image of a white hole on the side of it, surrounding a galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front of the car was a couple of male monsters, both of which were cyclopses. First there was an older cyclops with red-orange-skin and no hair who was wearing an apron like a cook. The other cyclops was significantly younger and had pink-skin and freckles and was wearing a cap on his head. From the looks of it, they were coming back from city hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a stroke of luck that the Mayor signed the seal of approval for us to put up the White Hole in Bagel Heights.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t celebrate just yet, Corey,\u201d said the older cyclops. \u201cWe still have to be ready. I\u2019m expecting a shipment of Jupiter Jelly. It\u2019s made from a newly discovered plant that grew where a meteor landed. It appears to be safe for consumption. I think it will be very popular.\u201d \u201cI should hope so, Uncle Ivan,\u201d said Corey. \u201cEspecially after what happened back in Strawberry Valley.\u201d \u201cThat was unfortunate,\u201d said Ivan. \u201cBut they finally caught him before he could do some real damage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cyclopses\u2019 car came to a stop sign and Corey stopped his vehicle. However, Antala was still texting in her own car right before she noticed Corey\u2019s car. She gasped and tried to turn on the brakes but was too late and rear-ended Corey\u2019s car, spooking the young cyclops who switched the car to park as Ivan clutched his chest. \u201cGreat Zeus!\u201d yelled the older cyclops. \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d Corey immediately got out and yelled as he spotted the damage done to his car and then spotted Antala\u2019s car. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d Muttered Antala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Corey was triggered and angrily tapped on Antala\u2019s car window. \u201cCome on out of there you jerk!\u201d Antala stepped out in embarrassment as Ivan came out of the passenger seat of Corey\u2019s car to see the commotion. Corey saw Antala\u2019s cell phone in her hand and was even madder than he was a second ago. \u201cYou idiot! Don\u2019t you know that texting and driving can get people killed!?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d muttered Antala. \u201cI wasn\u2019t...\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t thinking!\u201d yelled Corey. \u201cLook what your stupidity did to my car! I demand restitution.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala took out her wallet but there was nothing inside of it but her driver\u2019s license. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, sir. I\u2019m tapped out at the moment.\u201d Corey was about to erupt again but Ivan intervened. \u201cCorey, calm down. I\u2019ll pay for the damages. As for you, young girl. I think I know of a way for you to reimburse us and make up for it. It just so happens that we have an opening at the White Hole for new employees.\" Ivan took out a cap and uniform and handed it to Antala as she let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment at the White Hole, the delivery truck came before Corey and Ivan could even reach their donut shop and a large burly minotaur with an eyepatch dropped off a package containing jars filled with a strange glowing jelly of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we skip to Antala starting her first shift on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a dark and stormy night (cliched beginning, I know, but roll with it, please). In a part of the world where only monsters lived, there was a lonely island on the ocean consisting of nothing but a lighthouse that shined a bright blue light among a sea that was bright red with pink clouds billowing through the sky and spewing lightning so powerful that it caused rocks to shatter. Swimming through the water was a rather gigantic and obese mermaid who resembled a dugong in body shape but with bright pink hair and a tattoo of a triangle on her face. The mermaid was chewing on a suspicious looking bone as she looked up at the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness sakes,\u201d said the mermaid as she rubbed her enormous belly. \u201cThis storm is the worst we\u2019ve had in years. I hope that Antala is doing okay. If memory serves, she\u2019s starting her job as lighthouse keeper tonight.\u201d\u2028\u2028Approaching the lighthouse was a rowboat that was 1/10th of the enormous mermaid\u2019s size. The mermaid ducked underwater as the rowboat was approaching the lighthouse. Aboard this boat was a bright red-skinned and silver haired succubus with a voluptuous hourglass shape, gold cat-like eyes, sharp teeth and huge bat wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Antala and she was beginning her first night as lighthouse keeper. There was a bayside town of monsters in the area and they relied on the goods that were shipped from overseas. However, Antala was very nervous. She couldn\u2019t handle the responsibility, especially because practically every night in the area was a stromy night. This night in particular was even stormier than usual. As Antala sailed towards the lighthouse, fish that were even bigger than the titanic mermaid she passed, swam under her and Antala screamed as one large spike-covered tentacle reached out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did I sign up for this job?\u201d asked Antala to herself. \u201cThe last lighthouse keeper has been missing for 6 months. He\u2019s probably in the belly of a mermaid by now. The reason he went missing was because of that burning waterspout. How does water even catch on fire? Now, calm down, Antala. Maybe it won\u2019t be...\u201d Antala\u2019s sentence was cut off by the sound of lightning that struck the water and caused a burned up squid to rise from the water as it coughed up several fish with human-like teeth into the succubus\u2019s rowboat. Antala gulped and then she reached the island where the lighthouse was. As soon as she reached the lighthouse and stepped off of her rowboat, the boat dissolved and broke apart, causing Antala to turn around in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala shivered. \u201cThe town had better pay me a fortune for this.\u201d\u2028\u2028 Antala ran into the lighthouse and then she saw the light was already on. \u201cThat\u2019s strange,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe the lightning kicked it on.\u201d Antala walked forward but then the light started to flicker on and off. \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Antala. \u201cNo!\u201d Antala flew to the beacon and pounded on the light until the bulb popped out. Antala screamed and grabbed the bulb so it wouldn\u2019t break on the ground. The succubus let out a sigh of relief. But her relief was short-lived because at that moment, a large branch flew through the window and struck Antala. In the process, Antala\u2019s grip on the bulb slipped and it fell into her mouth. The succubus gagged on the bulb and then accidentally swallowed it. \u201cOh no!\u201d Antala screamed and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young succubus got up and let out a moan. She then let out a hic. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said. \u201cI swallowed the bulb. This is...\u201d Suddenly, Antala\u2019s belly glowed blue and started to expand. Antala grunted and then flew back to the beacon as her belly rumbled and swelled. In 30 seconds, Antala\u2019s stomach was twice as big as she was tall and glowing bright blue. \u201cThat\u2019s... never happened before.\u201d Said Antala. As Antala was trying to figure out what happened, she heard a strange noise. The succubus flew to the window, her belly glowing bright as she saw the ship that was coming into the bay. It was....</span></div></div>",

It was an enormous ship that resembled a cross between a submarine and a Japanese junk, a type of ship used during the Edo period. The ship had several marks at the sides as if it had been facing rough seas. The cargo was all tied down and there was one piece of cargo that appeared to have been bolted down and was covered by the tarp. The crew were trying their best to navigate the cargo ship through the harsh storm. The lightning came down swiftly and echoed through the air right before several hail stones the size and shape of whales came down and one of them even fell and broke the anchor off of the ship, causing one of the sailors aboard to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment, the ship's captain came out. The captain of the ship was a grayish yellow-skinned Cthulu-like creature with spider-like tendrils for hands, five eyes (one of which was covered by an eyepatch) and large wings attached under his arms. \"We have our heading, men! We can't give up now!\" The captain looked up and spotted the light emitting from Antala's enormous belly. \"There's the light,\" said the captain. \"That's odd, it looks larger than I recall. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.\" Another member of the crew, an obese kappa woman with a red shell resembling a matamata walked up to the captain, clearly the first mate. \"Weren't we going to stop at the lighthouse first?\" asked the kappa. The captain nodded his head and then he opened up the tarp revealing that underneath, there was a large canister that seemed to contain a large and glowing aurora from the frigid North. \"They're running low on bulbs,\" said the captain. \"But this aurora we managed to collect from the North is guaranteed to shine for 100 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lighthouse, Antala was grunting and sweating as she attempted to hold up her enormous belly that was now so big it was poking out the lighthouse window and in the middle of the rain. \"How did this happen?\" asked Antala. \"I didn't think that light would expand inside of me. I'm going to have to wait until the sun comes out and then fly back into town to see a doctor about this. Whoa!\" A bolt of lightning came down and blew one of the rocks around the lighthouse into bits. On the ship on the ocean, one of the sailors, a male cyclops with a mechanical right leg and an arm ending in a metallic claw, looked up and noticed the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting worse, Captain!\" \"Turn the ship to starboard! I know a grotto to pass into town safely. We'll have to wait until the storm clears to head for the lighthouse.\" Unfortunately for the crew, nature doesn't always follow the plans of men or beasts and a large chunk of whale-shaped hail fell and landed on the tube containing the aurora, causing the glass to violently shatter and for the aurora to come out. The crew covered their eyes to shield themselves from the burst of light. The light flew up into the air and towards the lighthouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on out there?!\" yelled Antala. \"Augh!\" The aurora forced itself down Antala's throat and as it went down, her belly begun to glow both with the blue light from the lighthouse bulb and with the colors of the aurora that Antala had swallowed. Antala grunted and sweated and even panted as her stomach swelled up again and got so big that....</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, there were times when one of two things would happen: either a succubus gets greedy and starts taking other succubi's jobs, or a succubus doesn't realize that the soul was already going to be taken by another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW COULD YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was one of the latter times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I had no idea you were already after him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two succubi arguing were Antala and Shansa. Both had similar body shapes, but Antala had silver hair, gold eyes, and was 5'10'' with bat wings, horns, and a tail. In contrast, Shansa had blue hair, black eyes, and was 6'1'' without the features Antala had. The two were arguing over the soul of a businessman. Antala had taken the soul while the man was sleeping, but Shansa was already supposed to take it. So when she found out what Antala did, she was not happy. And Shansa was know for being angry all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN! IT WAS POSTED ON THE SOUL BOARD!\" Shansa screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overslept. All I knew was this man was losing his soul, but I didn't have time to see the board. I didn't know.\" Antala replied, really fearing for her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing Shansa was know for was cursing any succubus who pissed her off. One succubus accidentally spilled coffee on Shansa's chest, and Shansa cursed the woman with breasts the size of trucks. It took a month for the curse to wear off. Antala was worried about what would happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShansa looked at Antala, then at the soul she was holding, and got a wicked idea. \"Well, since you want souls so much, I've got the perfect curse for you. Do you like pregnancy?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala gulped. \"Uh, I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guess what? Now you can experience it yourself. You're going to get really pregnant. With all the souls you've already taken. TIMES TEN! And the best part, you're never going to give birth to them. EVER!\" And on that last yell, Shansa fired a beam at Antala's stomach, and then disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala stood there for a moment, frightened. After regaining her sense, she teleported back to her home world. After giving the soul to a nearby worker to drop off, she went back home, entered her room, and sat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala stared at the ceiling, still shook up. She had just been cursed by Shansa. She was going to be pregnant with all the souls she took, multiplied by ten. That meant she was going to be carrying 400 souls! She was going to be enormous. And Shansa said she wouldn't give birth. Antala was freaking out. Not only was she going to be enormous, but she would be that way for the rest of her immortal life. Thankfully, she wasn't showing yet, so maybe the curse was slow acting. She hoped that would give her time to find a way to break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she laid there, thinking, she started to get drowsy and, eventually, went to sleep. As she slept through the day and night, she didn't feel the warmth in her as her belly began to grow and grow fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Antala woke up, and mentally planned her day. She was going to head to the library to see if she can get rid of the curse. She tried to get up, but felt a weight pin her down. Antala was now scared. That could only mean one thing: she had already grown. She looked down to confirm her suspicion. She was right. She looked like she was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been summoned here by the Queen for something important, but she didn't know what. She just hoped she wasn't in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, two fairly muscular Guradian succubi walked in and motioned for her. She got up and followed them out of the waiting room and entered the Grand Hall proper. She was still nervous. Eventually, the two Guardians led her into the Queen's chamber. Oddly for a Queen, it was rather plain, with no extravagant decorations. The only notable thing was the throne, and on it was the Succubus Queen, Dazana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazana was about 8 feet tall, had red hair, green eyes, and like most Queen's, silver skin. Like the Guardians, she was muscular, looking like a professional body-builder. She had horns and a tail, but no wings. She was wearing a black one-piece swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanaza looked and saw Antala. When she did, she broke out into a huge grin and ran up to her, putting her in a powerful bear hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Antala! Long time no see!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore becoming queen, Danaza was Antala's roommate. She was known for being way too affectionate, hugging everyone she met. And with her muscles, her hugs hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good- urk!- to see you -ack! - too. You're - ow!- breaking my spine!\" Antala managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.\" Danaza said, letting Antala go. \"So you're probably wondering why you are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Antala said, while trying to realign her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been looking over your performance, and I'm happy to say you've done well enough for a promotion!\" Danaza said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala squeeled in joy. \"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. And best part, you get to pick your new position!\" Danaza beemed. \"So, what do you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother Summoner!\" Antala cried out before Danaza could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoners were responsable for bringing in new succubi. There were two kinds: Change Summoners, who brought new succubi in through magic, and Mother Summoners, who do the same, but with pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother Summoners were treated like celebrites. They always got benifits, and everyone adored them. And since succubi can choose their pregnancy length, they can be popular for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanaza grinned. \"Not a problem. Guardians, bring the Mother Drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Guardian came in and brought a cup with a green liquid in it. \"Drink this,\" Danaza said, \"And you'll instantly become pregnant! Just think of how many kids you want, and drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala thought for a moment. She then smiled. \"I want to be pregnant with...\"</span></div></div>",

In a shack on the lake infested by zombified alligators, Antala the succubus was busy trying to brew together a super spicy chili recipe. The young succubus was already in her apron and had tossed in some curry powder, crab apples and even an entire herring skeleton. The chili bubbled and turned purple. \"Hmm,\" said Antala. \"Not quite right.\" Antala wiggled her behind and her pointed tail as she made her way up to the spice rack and started to take down every form of spice in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact was that there was a chili cook off the next day and Antala had entered it. However, Antala was somewhat of a perfectionist. She was determined to win first place if she had to spice her chili with the soil from a grave. She did just that the very morning but that still wasn't enough to satisfy her hot sauce. \"Needs a few more jumping beans and perhaps some dragon berries.\" As Antala threw in those ingredients, the curry begun to smoke. Antala then sprinkled in some oregano, curry powder, garlic and everything else she found in the spice rack. With some spices, she didn't even bother to take them out of the bottles and the glass melted in the curry mess before the curry spewed out some sparks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala adjusted her glasses and then took a closer look into the curry to see fish bones crumbling to dust inside and screaming faces forming in the slop. Antala scratched the top of her head with her tail because there was something that was still bothering her about all the curry. \"There's still something missing,\" said the succubus as she stomped her hoof. \"I wish I knew what it is. What I need is to get more peppers.\" Antala left her shack, only to be attacked by a zombie alligator. Fortunately, Antala threw it back into the bayou and watched it sink to the bottom. \"Annoying things,\" muttered Antala. \"If they weren't an illegal ingredient, I would use them.\" Antala waddled through the murky water, carefully stepping over poisonous snakes as she made her way to a pepper patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patch had ghost peppers with literal ghost faces as far as the eye could see and Antala was picking them one by one. The ones that were oddly shaped, she threw away. The succubus was making absolutely sure that the peppers she picked would indeed by worthy of going into her chili. \"Good. Good. No good. Ugh! This pepper has gone bad!\" As Antala had her bucket halfway full, she let out a groan. \"I'm not sure it will be perfect even with these peppers. Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment, Antala saw a glowing blue light and waddled through the water to investigate when she gave a gasp. The blue light was coming from a ghost pepper that was bigger and thinner than the rest. Antala reached for it and the pepper burned her as she gave a grunt. \"That's odd,\" she says. \"I'm a succubus. I shouldn't be able to get burned. Unless.\" Antala focused on the pepper and realized it was no ordinary ghost pepper. Even without having tasted it, Antala could see it was much hotter than the average ghost pepper and decided that she had found the perfect ingredient for her hot chili.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was that the only blue pepper she found?</span></div></div>",

Maybe this one is the first bloomer. Well, now that I know this is the only pepper of its kind around, I guess I'm going to have to make this count. Antala took out a bag and placed the blue pepper in it. The pepper's heat was so intense that the bag had already begun to glow. Antala had to put the pepper in the bag in a special box and then put the box in her pocket as the box was already starting to heat up rather violently and letting off smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala knew that she had to get home fast, but she saw another zombie alligator going by and figured that she had no time for a fight that was completely unnecessary. So Antala opened her wings and begun to fly. As she did, the light from that blue pepper resembled a will-o-the-wisp. The intense flames caused an apparition of a phoenix appear and scared off all the birds in the area. Nearby there was another monster alone in the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis monster was a male ghoul resembling a humanoid horse with rotting green skin and jagged teeth and from the looks of it, a receding hairline. The ghoul looked up in the sky and his rotting jaw slipped. \"Great balls of fire,\" he said. \"It's happening. I've got to tell the town!\" The ghoul had clearly mistaken Antala for something else and jumped into his rowboat before he furiously begun to paddle out to warn of what he suspected of a great disaster. However, Antala didn't care at all about what she might have looked like from a distance. All she was thinking of was peppers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala arrived outside of her shack and walked inside to see smoke coming from her chili. Antala rooted around her fridge for more ingredients. \"I'm going to throw a few more ingredients in,\" said the succubus. \"I don't want that blue ghost pepper to overload the chili. Now, a little bit of this, a little bit of that...\" Antala tossed in an eye of newt, the tongue of a wolf, whiskers from a hairy crab and even an expired tube of mayonnaise... without even taking it out of the jar. The chili begun to burn brighter right before Antala turned her head. \"Well, well, well,\" said Antala. \"It looks good so far. But now, for the final ingredient.\" Antala reached into her pocket and took out the box containing the bag containing the blue ghost pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box had already caught fire and as Antala opened it, she saw that the bag she had kept the pepper in had burned into cinders. \"Holy cow,\" said Antala. \"Yikes.\" Antala sniffed the pepper and her eyes begun to water. \"Gee willikers.\" She said. Antala held the pepper and dropped it into the chili. As she did this, the chili erupted into a mushroom cloud shaped like screaming faces that laughed wickedly, causing the succubus to be mildly terrified. \"Oh my.\" She said. Antala gave a gulp and then took out a spoon for the chili.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before the spoon melted, Antala put the chili in her mouth and almost immediately, she wished she hadn't. It was so hot that her skin turned blue and her eyes watered before smoke blew out of her nose. Antala screamed and breathed blue fire as her belly bulged until it was....</span></div></div>",

The young succubus was busy eyeing herself in the mirror as she was wearing a new and expensive black dress with pearl earrings and a golden necklace that looked like it was made of skulls. Antala was laughing as she eyed herself. Antala was a very rich and very beautiful succubus. However, she was also very vain and that could get her into trouble at times. She was talking with her maid, Sarah, a werewolf whose body was half white and half black. Sarah looked at her boss nervously and then looked all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala was in fact, so vain that everywhere around her mansion, there were statues and paintings of her. The fact was that Antala could not get enough of herself. Even the other succubi found her to be obnoxious. \"Uh, madam,\" said Sarah. \"I don't mean to interrupt you.\" Antala just gave a scoff. \"Then don't,\" she said. \"You know how I don't like anything getting in the way of my me time.\" Antala even turned around and wagged her tail before she laughed and made an anime-esque face in the mirror. \"Oh,\" said Antala. \"I am one hot succubus.\" Sarah just shook her head at her mistress's vanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me rephrase that, madam,\" said the wolf woman. \"I don't mean to interrupt you, but remember, we have an appointment with Jean-Pierre Orin.\" Antala's eyes popped out of her head and she turned around, almost knocking Sarah to the floor in the process. \"Oh my gosh! That's right. I commissioned Monsieur Orin to paint a portrait of my favorite subject; marvelous moi. You were the one who told me what a great painter, Orin is. Now, I must see it for myself.\" Antala let out a noblewoman's laugh that made Sarah very uncomfortable. \"After all, we can always use more me around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Antala was with Sarah in a limousine and was heading for Jean-Pierre Orin's studio. Antala was preening herself as she smirked. \"A perfect shape with virtually 0% fat, flawless crimson skin and sparkling silver hair. Let's face it, Sarah. I'm perfect.\" \"Beauty is only skin deep, madam.\" Antala just gave a glare to signal to Sarah to shut up and it was there the limousine arrived at the studio. Inside the studio was the owner, Jean-Pierre Orin, a tall, lanky and hunch-backed salmon-skinned gargoyle with no horns, no hair and glowing yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mademoiselle Antala,\" said the gargoyle as he held up a painting that was covered by a tarp. \"I present to you what I believe is my finest creation yet.\" Antala let out a laugh. \"It had better be,\" said the vain and rich succubus. \"It's a painting of me isn't it. Now, chop, chop; let's see what it is.\" Jean-Pierre was proud of himself as he uncovered the tarp and revealed a painting that looked like a stylized version of Antala. Sarah looked at it and was very impressed. \"Magnifique.\" Said the wolf woman, prompting the painter to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala however, looked closer and saw a dot on the side of her face in the painting and let out a gasp before becoming enraged. \"What is that!?\" she yelled. \"Is that supposed to be a blemish?\" \"Well, Mademoiselle,\" said Jean-Pierre nervously. \"I decided to add a beauty mark to highlight your radiant skin.\" \"Beauty mark!?\" yelled Antala. \"It's a mole. I don't have a mole! Are you trying to make me look grotesque!\" Antala in her rage kicked the painting to the ground and startled the painter. \"If you think I'm paying for this trash, you have another thing coming. Come along, Sarah!\" Antala stomped away and Sarah followed after her in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what happened did not sit well with Jean-Pierre and he gave a hiss as he took out another canvas and paint. \"Trash is it?\" asked the gargoyle. \"I'll have you know that beauty is only skin deep. It's time somebody taught you a lesson, mademoiselle.\" Jean-Pierre chanted some strange words as he prepared to cast a curse on Antala.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Antala was a young succubus who was at that moment, flying over a large valley in the west. She was a marshal in the monster world who was going after a dangerous outlaw. Antala held up a wanted poster in order to get a good idea of what her target was. Antala's mark from the looks of it, was a man wrapped up in bandages like a mummy but with steam-punk goggles and a top hat and from the looks of it, two mechanical prosthetics for arms. Antala nodded her head and then she looked down to see a herd of cattle following men on horseback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" said Antala as she focused her super eyesight to find the brand. \"The brand that those cattle bear is from a ranch that ain't even on the same side of the country as here. Must be rustlers.\" Antala flew closer and saw that the man leading the rustlers was the very same man from her wanted poster. \"Got it,\" she said. \"There you are, Gradius. I finally caught you.\" That's what Antala thought, but Gradius knew she was coming and turned his head around like an owl, to the surprise of the succubus marshal. Before Antala could react, Gradius lifted up his gun and shot at the succubus, making a direct hit on her wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala let out a yell as her wing begun to bleed and she shrieked as she tried to fly. However, being 5000ft in the air and injured are hardly a good combination. Antala had to find a safer way to the ground. The cowgirl looked ahead and then she saw what looked like a large mountain. \"Bingo.\" Said the succubus. Antala flew to the top of the mountain just as her wing gave out and she let out a groan. she looked down to see Gradius and his gang getting away and growled. \"Dag gum!\" As Antala stomped the ground, she took a better look at her surroundings and saw that the entire mountain was covered in the sides with large spikes and at the bottom, the mountain was covered in jagged rocks that looked like they could collapse at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that the marshal realized where she was and gave a gulp. \"Uh-oh,\" she said. \"Porcupine mountain. The most dangerous mountain in the west to climb up, let alone back down again. Cowpokes have killed themselves even trying to get a quarter of the way up this death trap.\" This was true as underneath the foot of the mountain were the skeletal remains of monsters and humans that were too wedged into the ground to be pulled out. Antala gave a grumble. \"Getting down from here is going to take some thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala stayed on the top of Porcupine Mountain for 30 minutes in an attempt to come up with a way to get off the mountain when her stomach started growling. Antala gave a growl. \"Dag gum! I knew I shouldn't have skipped breakfast this morning.\" Antala then realized something and got an idea. \"I wonder.\" Antala took out a handful of dirt from the top of the mountain and then brought it to her mouth to eat it. Antala gave a grunt and then puts more dirt into her mouth as she begins her plan to eat the mountain. As she does, her stomach begins to bulge and her belt soon feels itself being pushed to the limit.</span></div></div>",

She just kept stuffing her face as if it was a plate of baked beans. The western marshal took scoop after scoop of dirt, stopping only to gag on the taste. But she worked through the discomfort and continued to chew through the mountain. At one point, several gophers came out of the ground and voiced their discomfort with Antala's insane actions as she took one handful of dirt. One of them even gestured that he was watching Antala before taking out a suitcase and running off with the other gophers. Antala blinked at what happened but then she shrugged her shoulders and got back to the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 40 minutes, Antala was feeling dizzy and had managed to swallow most of the dirt. However, instead of eating the last of the dirt, Antala just pushed it away with her boots. \"Ugh,\" groaned the succubus as she felt her large stomach that was groaning in pain. \"Bad idea, Antala. Bad idea. I can't believe I ate all that dirt. I wish I could've turned it into mud and washed it away. Dag gum!\" Antala paused and looked to see that she had made progress and from the looks of it, half the mountain was gone. However, she also felt guilty at what she had done and shook her head. \"I can't believe that I destroyed most of Porcupine Mountain. I can tell you that the mapmakers are not going to like this. But from the looks of it, I'm only 50ft up now, so more power to me.\" Antala gave a laugh and groaned because her stomach hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked down and saw something that really made her feel sick. There was nothing left of the mountain but the jagged rocks that made it impossible to climb down in the first place. Antala begun to cry as she saw that she had a lot of her work still cut out for her. \"This is just one of those days,\" groaned the cowgirl. \"Huh. Wait, who am I talking to? There ain't nobody around here. Oh. Now I feel even sicker.\" Antala gave a hiccup but then shrugged her shoulders as she took a small rock and started to break away at a larger piece of rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does Antala really decide to eat <i>rocks</i>?</span></div></div>",

One succubi in particular was a DJ in the succubus world. Her name was Antala and she had long silver hair, golden cat-like eyes and bright red skin. She was a DJ who absolutely loved to do what she did. Right now she was jamming it up in the White Hole nightclub. As Antala was playing loud J-pop music that echoed throughout all caves in the succubus world, the patrons of the nightclub were blue-skinned guardian succubi accompanied by the silver-skinned queen who was clapping her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everybody!\" yelled Antala. \"The next big hit is called Shining Roar. A divine tune that will prove even we have souls and hearts. Let's hit it!\" Antala played a tune that sounded more like it would be enjoyed by angels, but the succubi enjoyed it all the same and even the queen was hitting it up on the dance floor. She was giggling and clapping her hands as Antala smiled and turned her hat. Of course, the queen was not the only succubus of prominence. There was a golden-skinned succubus with long pink hair worn in pigtails resembling musical notes. She was dressed in a leather jacket with a pair of pants with bubbles all over them and a candy-cane striped shirt. There was only one type of succubi in this world that had golden skin. That tone of skin was reserved only for immortal goddess class succubi. This particular goddess was eyeing Antala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and then quietly walked up behind Antala while Antala was swaying from side to side. Antala\u2019s headphones were in and she was too busy jamming to notice the golden succubus right behind her. As Antala was DJing, the golden succubus tapped her back. Antala turned around and then gasped. The golden succubus just smiled. \"Nice beats.\" She said. Antala stopped the music and everyone turned and gasped before they all bowed down. \"Y-You, you,\" said Antala nervously. \"You are...\" The golden succubus opened her wings as they glowed bright. \"I am Symphoni, the succubus goddess in charge of music and I just love your music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala gave a blink. \"Wh-Why thank you, Your Highness. I'm... I'm honored.\" Before Antala could say another word, Symphoni grabbed her mouth. \"Hush,\" she said. \"Don't speak. I'd say that I love your music so much that I'm making you an offer. I want you to be my muse.\" Antala's eyes popped out of her head. To be a muse to a music goddess was a dream come true. The crowd was muttering to themselves and wondering if Antala would accept. \"It's really a sweat deal,\" said Symphoni as she made sound waves resonate in her hand that made the sound of a bell. \"You'll have control of all sounds, from the most wonderful orchestra, to the most shrill scream. So what you do say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala gasped with joy and nodded her head. \"Lay it on me, Symphoni.\" She said. Symphoni gave a smile and grabbed Antala's forehead before she cast a spell. For a brief moment, musical notes appeared on Antala's body and they all made different sounds. Antala smiled for the great honor that was placed upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Antala had no idea was that Symphoni's proposal would also give her an unusual power. This was intention as Symphoni knew there were dangerous villains popping up all around the human world<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: Both of these villains are OCs of the 12th Doctor. Not mine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmalgamation; Real Name: Matthew Crayn, a wrestler who was booted out of the professional circuit after her killed a wrestler. He took an experimental performance enhancing drug, which made him what he is today: a big, dumb muscle for hire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStormy Days: Real Name: Kyle Brokk, a meteorologist who was canned for being too boring. He got hit by an orange lightning bolt, which gave him the power to manipulate the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth these villains were laying in wait waiting to bust out of prison to go on a rampage that would require Antala to deal with.</span></div></div>",

It was a bright gold colored palace with instruments of all sorts hanging from the wall. Saxophones, banjos, ukeleles, harps, guitars, trumpets, all of which were making noise as Antala was taking full advantage of her new powers. Antala was snapping her fingers to make sounds ring through the temple as Symphoni watched. \"Oh yeah!\" yelled Antala as she twisted her cap. \"This is DJ Antala rapping through the realm of the protector deities. Oh yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymphoni giggled and then she heard the sounds of frogs croaking and kittens purring despite the fact there were no such animals in the palace at the moment. Antala clicked her tongue to make a chimney whistle, stomped her feet to make the sounds of a piano keys being played and then she snapped her fingers to make the sound of thunder. \"Hey, Symphoni! Check out my new beats! I call it the Sounds all Around.\" Symphoni smiled and giggled as Antala begun to play. However, Antala was unaware that her fun was going to have a price on her figure. Antala kept on making music until she heard a popping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked the succubus. \"That's crazy. I don't....\" Antala then looked down and gasped the bottom on her pants had popped off and her stomach was bulging. \"What's happening?\" asked Antala in fear. Symphoni shook her head. \"Oh, don't worry. It's just a side-effect to remind you to use your powers wisely. Overusing your powers causes sound to build up in your stomach.\" Antala poked her belly a few times and it made several sounds, such as the sound of a saxophone, the sound of a banshee's scream and even the sound of a birthday song playing. \"Okay,\" said Antala as her red skin turned redder than usual as she blushed. \"I guess I did get a little teensy bit carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymphoni then walked up and snapped her fingers and took out a motorcycle leotard that appeared to be decorated with musical notes. She smiled as she handed it to Antala. Antala held up the unitard and then in a flash the unitard appeared on her body. \"What?\" asked Antala. \"What's this?\" \"Antala,\" said Symphoni. \"I didn't just recruit you because of your beats. You do realize that the succubi of this world are only supposed to attack bad people, right.\" Antala nodded her head. \"I believe that's the whole deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSymphoni then cast a spell revealing dozens of criminals and crooks causing trouble all around the world. \"Well,\" said Symphoni. \"There is a higher abundance of evil and crime in the world than there used to be and it's getting too much for us to deal with on our own. Which is why I've decided to recruit somebody to act as a super heroine.\" Antala was surprised. She looked at her costume and felt as if she had died and gone to Heaven. But then she realized that she had a new gift and she needed to use it as responsibly as possible. After all, those villains weren't going to show any mercy.\" She gave a determined look as Symphoni approached her again. \"So, Antala,\" said Symphoni. \"Have you made your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntala turned and faced Symphoni. \"I've made my decision. All those bad people are causing trouble for innocents and I don't intend to let them get away with it. Count me in.\" Symphoni nodded her head and then held up a viewing screen. \"Wonderful,\" she said. \"This is your first mission.\" With that, Symphoni showed an image that depicted...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>Originally made and owned by The Twelfth Doctor (Non Canon).</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Under new management. Received from lwut: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/view/lwut2929\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/view/lwut2929</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere don't seem to be many good Belly Expansion stories or Succubus expansion stories on Writing.com. So now, we are going to change that. You are going to help a succubus get a big belly. But first, a few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This is belly expansion ONLY. So if you want to do weight gain, breast expansion, or other expansion that aren't belly, this is not the place. So if her belly fills with food, that food stays in the belly only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Although this is an expansion story, there is to be no sexual content. Sexual abuse in particular is not allowed AT ALL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No bodily fluids. That is just gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No characters under 18. That is just wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The main character is the only one who can expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. No male expansion or viewpoints. You can have male characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Nothing involving feet, tickling, farting, diapers, ect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. You can have death, but the main character cannot die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. No filling her belly with air. That is no fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. You can have her be topless, but panties stay on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Girl/Girl and Girl/Guy is fine, but no Guy/Guy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. If you're going to have romance, build it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. No instant expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. No matter what her belly fills with, it has to make her belly heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">No pregnancy</span> On second though, I'll change this rule. I'll allow pregnancy, but I will not allow birth. If you want pregnancy, make it permanent. This means I will let slight breast and butt expansion IN PREGNANCY CHAPTERS ONLY! If breast and butt expansion show up in any other chapters, I will delete them. Also, make the pregnancy happen by magic or scientific means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16. The main character cannot shapeshift or change gender. That would throw the flow of the story out the window. (In other words, no TF or TG.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n17. Please, please, please don't make Antala a stereotype. Try to give her some actual depth and character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n18. Please don't focus on only one expansion concept or story. Try to expand your horizon and add to the other stories. You may be surprised to learn what you can write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n19. And finally, please try to have good spelling, grammar, and give the story an actual plot. I would like a minimum of 2 paragraphs (unless it's an option addition)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Universe</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe World Itself<br>\r\nThe Succubus World resembles our world a fair bit. It has a yellow sun, green plants, and a similar atmosphere to Earth. The only difference is there is lava instead of water, and there are no animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Succubi<br>\r\nThe Succubus world has only one species: the Succubi. They come in various shapes and sizes, but they all have a few things in common. Succubi are always female: there are no male succubi. They all have unnatural skin colors, from the common red and purple, to the once in a lifetime gold and silver. Despite being the same species, they are not all blood related. Powers depend on the succubus, though they can all change their breast size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccubus classes<br>\r\nThere are six succubus classes<br>\r\n1. The Soul Takers: the typical succubus of legend. These succubi go out to take the souls of the living. Usually come in red, purple, or white.<br>\r\n2. The Makers: these succubi are responsible for maintaining the landscape, buildings, and machinery. Normally grey.<br>\r\n3. The Summoners: responsible for creating new succubi. This is done either through pregnancy or transformation magic. Summoners who use pregnancy are called Mother Summoners. Summoners who use magic are called Change Summoners. Usually orange.<br>\r\n4. The Guardians: These are the succubi who protect the world. They always are muscular. Usually blue.<br>\r\n5. The Queen: This is the succubus who rules the others. There is only one queen. Always silver.<br>\r\n6. The Goddesses: The highest class. They control the forces of nature and life. Always gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifestyle<br>\r\nSuccubi have a lifestyle much like ours. They live, play, fight, and die like we do. The only difference is they have a longer life span. The shortest a succubus can live is 10000 years. The longest is immortality.
