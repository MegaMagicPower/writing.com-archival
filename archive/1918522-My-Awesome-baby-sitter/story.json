            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>IAN, GET UP AND GET READY FOR SCHOOL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up with a start. I had been having a dream in which I was an actual baby wearing a diaper and sleeping in a crib, but now, I was in neither a crib, a diaper, nor the body of a baby. Instead, I awoke in the same bed that I went to sleep in the night before, my pajamas and my normal nine year old body. It was another one of those stupid early school mornings, and my mom was yelling at me to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that it was no use trying to avoid getting out of bed, I slowly rolled out of bed, grumbling at how I hated school. My dream had been kinda weird, but I couldn't help but miss it now that it was over. I couldn't even remember it that much, except that I was really small and that I was really happy during it, which could not be said for my state now that I was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least this was Friday, so I\u2019d get a couple of days to forget everything we would do during the school day. I groggily changed into a T-shirt and jeans before taking a quick look in the mirror. There I was, my somewhat skinny self, with my brown hair miraculously still in place after waking up (it came down past my ears all the way around my head except for my eyes since I wanted to be able to actually see during the day). After throwing on my socks and tennis shoes, I plodded down the stairs to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my mom and dad ate their breakfast and drank their coffee, I put some Frosted Flakes and milk into a bowl and began eating, still having trouble keeping my eyes open. It was a rainy day out, and it was early enough that it still looked pretty dark outside. As I crunched my cereal, I remembered that it was Friday, and I tried to make the most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mom,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I have Brian over tonight? It\u2019s not a school night.\u201d Brian and I had been best friends since I can remember, and we had gone over to each other\u2019s houses so many times we both practically had two addresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you forgotten already Ian?\u201d my mom asked me. \u201cI told you that your father and I are going out to a movie tonight, and Sandy is going to come over to baby-sit you tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd taking care of one little monster is all we\u2019re going to ask Sandy to do, I don\u2019t want to double her stress level by making her watch both you and Brian,\u201d my dad added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh, that\u2019s right,\u2019 I thought, since (like always) I had forgotten what mom had told me. Hey, I\u2019ve got other really, really important things to be remembering. Anyway, since dad was exaggerating me and Brian\u2019s behavior I felt I had to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Sandy loves coming over. I\u2019m her favorite kid!\u201d I retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, right,\u201d my dad said. \u201cI personally don\u2019t know how she puts up with you sometimes. Well, if you behave yourself tonight, then the next time we\u2019ll see if Sandy will agree to watching both of you. But knowing your little actions as of late, I don\u2019t know if that will happen.\u201d He gave me this little \u201cdad\u201d look as he said the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what he was talking about. It had been like, two months since I had done something bad. Ok, maybe it was one week, but you get what I\u2019m saying. Either way, I still felt pretty good. I always had a fun time when Sandy came over \u2018cause unlike all the girls at school, Sandy was actually a girl who was cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy had been taking care of me ever since I was a baby. I think she was around thirteen when she started baby-sitting me, and now she was like, in college, but since her college was really close to her house, she still lived there and still baby-sat me for some extra money. Anyway, she was kind of pretty, but she was really athletic, too. She always liked doing fun stuff, like playing soccer, going roller skating, and playing video games. She even took karate! The other girls that I knew (who all went to school with me) liked to do stupid things like play with dolls and you know, other girl stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got my backpack and went to the bus stop, I felt better knowing that no matter how bad school was that day, I\u2019d at least have a pretty good time that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the day dragged, I did get to see Brian and a couple of the other boys who were in my class, and it was eventually over. I spent a couple of hours at home watching TV and playing on my PlayStation 2, and then around 5:30, I heard a car pull-up. I went downstairs to our door to go see Sandy as soon as she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the person who dropped her off drove away, I saw her walking toward the house. She was wearing a white blouse and a pair of somewhat tight jeans, and her long brown hair blew a little bit in the soft breeze. But something was different about her; she was carrying something over her shoulder. As she got a little closer, I noticed it was one of those baby bags that people carry all the baby\u2019s stuff in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought that jumped into my mind immediately was that the baby bag was for me. I mean, why else would she have it? I started to get kinda panicked; I thought mom had told Sandy that since I had been bad recently that I should be treated like a baby. I really started to panic as she came closer and my heart began to pound in my chest as I got a picture in my head of my mom and dad holding me down while Sandy took out a baby diaper and taped it on me (although I will admit that for some reason I was kinda excited about the idea as well, even though I didn\u2019t know why).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking I ran out to Sandy as I felt a lump starting to form in my throat. As I ran up she said \u201cHey kiddo, how are you? Ready to have some fun tonight?\u201d (at the moment I was positive that she was referring to treating me like a baby).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately my voice turned strangely whiny as I eyed the bag and begged her, \u201cSandy, please, please don\u2019t dress me like a baby! I\u2019ll be good, I swear. I won\u2019t give you any trouble\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was cut off by Sandy bursting into a laugh. She had to cup one hand over her mouth to try to stop herself? What, did she find the idea of treating me like a little baby funny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of us could say anything, my mom came out the door and began to speak. \u201cHello, Sandy! Hey, what\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandy finally stifled her laugh, she said \u201cIan, you silly kid! This diaper bag isn't for you! I had to baby-sit another family\u2019s baby before I came over here, silly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt myself go pink as my mom started to laugh too. As I took in what she said I realized how extremely stupid I had just been and I felt like hitting myself in the head very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my mom calmed herself, she asked Sandy, \u201cWhat, the Thompsons\u2019 boy? I didn\u2019t know he was still in diapers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they wanted to potty train him, but he\u2019s having trouble, so they decided not to push him. These are Pampers size 6 that I\u2019ve got in the bag. I bought this bag since I baby-sit a few babies in the neighborhood anyway, and they just told me I can keep some of his diapers in here so I don\u2019t have to hunt for them in their house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow those are pretty big diapers!\u201d my mom said. \u201cI bet those might even be able to fit Ian!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d I said indignantly as Sandy laughed slightly. It was bad enough that she had to say things like that at all, but it was even worse in front of Sandy, especially after what I had just said earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like we would have found out before, since little man here was potty trained real early,\u201d Sandy said as she gestured towards me (Little man was a nickname that Sandy had called me since I could remember).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d mom said. \u201cBut I know you yourself have changed plenty of Ian\u2019s poopy diapers in the past, Sandy!\u201d she added with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOM!\u201d I said again as I felt myself blush even more. \u201cDo you have to say stuff like that?\u201d I don\u2019t know why she always felt she had to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Ian,\u201d Sandy said. \u201cYour moms just kidding\u2019. Besides, you were such a cute little baby that I never minded changing your poopy diapers! In fact, I still think you\u2019re kinda cute.\u201d With the last line she got me in a headlock and gave me a soft noogie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, cut it out!\u201d I said, but this time I was smiling. What she said didn\u2019t really comfort me, but I always liked it when Sandy played around with me like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, a few minutes later, mom and dad had gone, and Sandy and I went in the house, \u201cdiaper bag\u201d (as mom and Sandy called the baby bag) included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Ian,\u201d Sandy said. \u201cYour parents want us to stay here tonight, so I\u2019m gonna go order a pizza. Why don\u2019t you head on into the living room and decide what you want to do tonight? Oh yeah, and take the diaper bag with you. If its in the living room Ill be less likely to forget it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I said, feeling very funny as I took the diaper bag turned and walked into the living room. After I put it down against the wall, I decided to plop down on the couch and flipping on the TV. As I watched, I couldn't make myself think about what I wanted to do that night; my mind kept on drifting over what had just happened with mom and Sandy outside. As I eyed the diaper bag, various images kept on entering my mind; Sandy saying how she used to change my diapers, mom mentioning that those size 6 pampers could probably fit me, my imaginary image of me being forced into a diaper by Sandy again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more I thought about it, the more I began to fantasize about wearing a diaper again. I knew it was pretty silly; I was nine years old after all, and everyone knew that diapers were only for babies. I mean, everyone I knew would have died laughing if they saw anyone my age wearing a baby diaper. But despite this, I couldn't help but be filled with a desire to see what it would feel like to wear a diaper again. Suddenly, I remembered parts of the dream that I had had that morning. Soon, I was picturing myself lying down on my back, Sandy leaning over me with a diaper in her hand. In my mind, she remarked how I was such a cute little baby, and then before I knew it, I had a diaper taped snugly around my waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But it wasn't just wearing a diaper that was so intriguing to me. To make things even weirder, I had a desire to wet a diaper too. I just really wanted to know what it would feel like to just be able to let loose and feel the warm pee up against my legs and crotch. I could picture Sandy saying \u201cDid my little baby Ian go pee pee in his diapy? Alright, kiddo, lets get that diaper changed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy suddenly entered the room, and she startled me a bit as I was shaken out of my fantasy. She asked me if I what I wanted to do as she sat down, and she seemed to be surprised that I didn't have an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure acting funny tonight, Ian,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst you burst out and think I brought a diaper bag for you, then you jump when I enter the room, and now you can\u2019t think of anything to do when normally your head is bursting with ideas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, it was kinda, uh, a hard day at school,\u201d I said, forcing myself to keep my eyes away from the diaper bag leaning up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to satisfy her, though. We started watching TV and after a while the pizza arrived and we ate while we watched. Things seemed to be finally getting back on a normal track again. That is, until something unexpected began a turn of events that would lead to a very interesting evening.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After we finished our pizza and the drinks we had, we just continued to watch TV. Had we decided to turn off the TV right then, the evening probably would have just been normal. But this was not the case because during one of the commercial breaks, a diaper commercial just happened to appear on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the commercial was pretty simple, it had a pretty powerful affect on me. The mother in the commercial gave so much attention and love to the baby as she changed his diaper. In addition, the speaker in the commercial kept referring to how soft the diapers were, and they placed special emphasis as to how stretchy their diapers were. I myself had never actually been around babies, so I didn\u2019t know much about what it was like to be around diapers. However, the commercial seemed to draw me back to the time when I was a baby, and the diapers still seemed somewhat familiar. As much as I tried to seem uninterested, I couldn't keep myself from watching every second of the commercial very deeply and intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know if Sandy actually noticed this or not, but it may very well have been the reason that she decided to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, its amazing how far products have come!\u201d she said. \u201cThose diapers look like they could hold a lot. The stretchiness of those diapers looks pretty incredible, too. The ones you used to wear weren't nearly that flexible. I bet these new ones would not only fit a baby well, but they might fit you now, Ian!\u201d She even gave a small chuckle with this line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then laughed again and said \u201cI wouldn't even be surprised if they fit me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still don\u2019t know exactly why I didn\u2019t just laugh along with her and let the topic rest after that. I guess it was the affect the commercial had on me, the appeal of the statements she had just made, or that darn diaper back leaning up against the wall that I just couldn\u2019t keep my eyes from drifting to. Whatever it was, I just couldn\u2019t stop myself from pressing the topic even more; the desire to wear a diaper again just kept popping up in my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess it would be pretty neat to be able to put on a diaper again!\u201d I said with a laugh of my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow I knew right after I said it that I may have gone too far. Although she was still smiling, Sandy stopped laughing when I said this. She raised an eyebrow as she looked at me and asked, \u201cUh, why do you say that, Ian? Wouldn't it be kinda weird for a nine year old like you or a 21 year old like me to be seen with a diaper on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, right, of course,\u201d I said as I nervously laughed. \u201cIt would be pretty stupid. I mean, uh, I haven\u2019t wanted to wear diapers since I was a baby. I mean, uh, I haven\u2019t worn diapers since I was a baby, and uh, I don\u2019t want to now or anything. Its stupid.\u201d With this, I turned back toward the TV, trying not to look at Sandy. I felt myself start to go red again and I knew that she was still looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, right, whatever you say, Ian,\u201d she said. I could tell she was still laughing a little and even though she turned back toward the TV, there was a bit of a weird tension between us as we started watching TV again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one would ever know, and you could see what it would be like to wear one again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, I excitedly said \u201cReally?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d Sandy said. \u201cI knew that\u2019s what you wanted tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d I responded. \u201cNo, I was just kidding.

You can\u2019t fool me.

As she brought it over, I could tell she had been right; even though I knew nothing about diapers, I could tell that it would fit me no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and unfolded it a little, making sure to keep it up close to by body. She even grabbed my hand and made me feel the plastic cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was happening, a new wave of excitement washed over me. I was pretty sure that the last time that I had actually touched a diaper was when I wore them as a toddler, and the sight, touch, and especially smell of it made my body tingle with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy apparently noticed something in my reaction, because she looked me right in the eye and then said, \u201cSee? I knew it. Come on Ian, I won\u2019t laugh, and I definitely won\u2019t tell anyone. You can tell me. Truly, honestly, would you like to wear diapers again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about the way she spoke that made me feel that I couldn't help but trust her. I was really embarrassed about telling her that this is what I so badly wanted, but the look on her face was so sincere that I decided to just take the plunge and be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2026..uh, well, yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cIts just\u2026.I don\u2019t know, I just think it would be really neat to put one on again.\u201dA few minutes passed with neither of us saying a word, but then she began to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know, Ian,\u201d she said as she turned toward me again.

I was really embarrassed about telling her that this is what I so badly wanted, but the look on her face was so sincere that I decided to just take the plunge and be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2026..uh, well, yeah,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026.I don\u2019t know, I just think it would be really neat to put one on again.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She got up, still holding the diaper in one hand, and beckoned me over with her other hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go get you diapered right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow this isn\u2019t quite what I had expected. \u201cWait a sec\u2026don\u2019t you find this the slightest bit weird? I mean, I\u2019m assuming you haven\u2019t had the experience of diapering many nine-year olds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have to admit, I can\u2019t say I know many people who want to wear diapers that don\u2019t need them. But so what, you gotta try new things, right? I was scared to try bungee-jumping, but that was a great experience! I doubt putting a diaper on a nine-year old will be that big of a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made me feel much better about the whole idea. If Sandy didn\u2019t think I was crazy for wanting this, then it wouldn\u2019t be so bad. As a grin spread across my face, I excitedly said \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it!\u201d I then bolted past her and raced up the stairs to my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this caught Sandy off guard, she quickly chased after me. I heard her yell, \u201cWhoa, slow down little man! Wait for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped once I got into my room so I could catch my breath, but right after I got there, Sandy appeared in the doorway. She dropped the diaper on the floor, ran over to me, and playfully threw me down onto my bed. I smiled as she continued to wrestle with me, holding me down while I tried to escape her hold on me. She then smiled and said \u201cCalm down, little man! You gotta lie still if I\u2019m gonna get you into a diaper!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I my laughter calmed down, Sandy went over to get the diaper and threw it onto my bed next to me. \u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 you,\u201d she said. \u201cThis reminds me of when you were a toddler. It was quite a job wrestling you into your diapers every time I had to change you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis statement made me turn a little pink, but I had to admit that the image of Sandy struggling to put a hold my toddler self down in order to change my diaper was kinda funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I just want you to relax and let me handle everything,\u201d she told me. I tried to do this despite my sheer excitement of being put into a diaper again. Sandy left my shirt on but rolled it up so that my stomach and chest were visible. She then undid my jeans and slid them down my legs and off of my ankles. I felt pretty awkward, but I forced myself to stay relaxed. As she was doing this, it seemed as though Sandy was somewhat pleased to be doing this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sandy,\u201d I said. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019re enjoying this as much as I am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she responded. \u201cLike I said, even if you don\u2019t wanna hear it, you are a pretty cute kid. And I just think you\u2019d look even cuter wearing a diaper! Besides, it\u2019s like a bit of nostalgia for me; I\u2019ve seen you grow from a baby to a kid these past years, and it\u2019s kind of nice to see you looking, well, like a baby again.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I expected her to comment on getting a clear view of my naked butt in her face, but she said nothing as she slid the diaper underneath my raised butt. She lowered me down, and before I knew it, she was already pulling the diaper up over my waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I still felt somewhat embarrassed about the whole thing, I couldn't keep myself from watching what Sandy was doing. Sandy obviously knew how to change diapers well, because it took her no time at all to pull the sides of the diaper around my hips and tape up both sides so that it fit me perfectly. The feeling of the diaper around my waist was interesting; I have to admit that it felt funny, but it felt oddly familiar and very pleasing at the same time. The soft and snug feel of the diaper was very comforting, and somehow feeling the soft material up against my skin made me feel\u2026safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I felt it was on, I sat up and looked down at my diapered self to get a better feel for it. It fit perfectly; in fact, from my viewpoint, my lower half looked just like the babies that I had seen in those diaper commercials. The idea excited me greatly, especially since it was combined with the soft and secure feeling of the diaper up against my skin. I couldn\u2019t help but simply look at Sandy, smile and say \u201cThese feel\u2026well, really nice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d like it!\u201d she said. \u201cHere, get a better look!\u201d she added as she grabbed me by the wrist and led me over to the mirror in my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at my reflection, I was somewhat awestruck. I lifted up my shirt so that I could get the full view. The upper half of my body looked just like it always did, with my brown hair coming down around the sides of my head and my light blue Myrtle Beach shirt looking just as normal as ever. But from my belly button down, I looked just like a toddler. My diaper had a slight bulge in the back, and the cartoon designs on the front of it clearly made me feel little. Despite the fact that I still felt a little silly and embarrassed, I still found my reflection somewhat cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I still loved the feeling and look of the diaper, and I felt like I never wanted to take it off. Before I could take in more about my diaper, Sandy picked me up, placed an arm around me, and walked out the room carrying me on her hip (I was pretty light, I guess, plus like I said, Sandy was pretty athletic).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, little man, let\u2019s go back downstairs.\u201d Although I was caught off guard when she did this, I didn\u2019t object. I had no desire to put my pants back on, I was happy in only my diaper and shirt. Besides, it had been a while since Sandy had picked me up and carried me like this, and to be honest, I kinda missed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy put me back down on the couch downstairs, and then said, \u201cHow \u2018bout a little music, little man? You like rock music, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet I do!\u201d I said.</span></div></div>",

I had recently really gotten into listening to music, and I liked rock the best. I didn't really know the bands, but I liked a lot of the songs that I heard on the radio. Immediately I listened up, and they were playing one of my favorite songs. I got up from the couch and got into the song. Before we knew it, both me and Sandy were singing along with the music. We even danced and did a little air guitar. I was having a blast and the fact that I was wearing a diaper even slipped from my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, until Sandy suddenly stopped in the middle of another song, that is. She apparently got a case of the giggles and couldn't stop laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked giving her a puzzling look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ian, but I just realized, you used look just like you did when you were a toddler. You used to do the exact same thing; you\u2019d get up and dance to music in just your shirt and your diaper with a big smile on your face. And everyone watching would always say how adorable you looked and laugh. And it is true, you do look just adorable dancing around in your diaper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt myself really start to blush when she said this. For some reason, I didn't want to be wearing a diaper anymore. I just felt like a little baby and was very embarrassed at the idea of everyone laughing at me dance around in a diaper. I went over to the couch and sat down, a big frown spread across my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ian\u2026\u201d Sandy began, but I didn't want to hear it. I was nine years old, I wasn\u2019t a baby anymore, and I didn\u2019t want to have anyone remarking about how cute I looked in diapers. The more I thought about how I had these desires to wear diapers, the more I was bothered by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, little man,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn't mean anything by it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt tears beginning to form in my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby!\u201d I told her. \u201cI don\u2019t need diapers! I don\u2019t wanna be the cute little baby that everyone thinks is helpless and needs diapers! I\u2019m nine years old, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy put her arms around me and began to hug me. \u201cOh Ian, I know that,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you\u2019re not two anymore.

It doesn't matter. I know, I know I keep telling you how cute you look, but you\u2019re still nine, even if you do like the idea of wearing diapers. But so what? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing. I mean, I know tons of old people who forget what it\u2019s like to be young anymore, and let me tell you, they\u2019re no fun at all, they\u2019re just completely boring. You\u2019re still really young, but at least you can find happiness in remembering what it was like when you were younger. Most people just forget all of the things about them when they were toddlers, and you haven\u2019t yet. And I think that\u2019s pretty darn cool, personally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cYou did beat me in soccer last week, remember? And you\u2019re a pretty tough fighter, even if you are wearing a diaper,\u201d she added with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d I said. I then felt something; I had to pee. Automatically, I got up to go the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d Sandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the bathroom,\u201d I replied, not giving it a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow wait a minute,\u201d she said, as she grabbed my arm. \u201cWhat exactly do you think that thing around your waist is for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly remembered my diaper and felt kinda funny. \u201cWait, you don\u2019t expect me to uh, you know\u2026uh, in my, in my\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, your diaper,\u201d she said. \u201cCome on Ian, put up your dukes!\u201d she said and she lunged at me and playfully tackled me to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy automatic response was to fight back. \u201cOh, you\u2019re on now!\u201d I said as I began to smile and pummel her with my fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she started to tickle me, and I\u2019ve always been real ticklish. I was helpless to stop her, no matter how fast I tried to move my hands. Even worse, the pressure on my bladder had increased greatly, and I didn\u2019t know how much longer I could hold it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS..Sandy!\u201d I said between giggles. \u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re gonna m\u2026make me, p..p..pee myself!\u201d </span></div></div>",

Instead, my body just gave way; before I knew it, I started peeing without any ability to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the diaper did its job; instead of me feeling my pee trickle down my legs, I felt my private area and my thighs get warm and moist as my bladder emptied. To my surprise, it was the best feeling in the world; my laughter combined with the warm feeling made me feel extremely happy, and even any embarrassment I had about wetting myself didn't make me feel bad at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Sandy could tell that I had done it, because she stopped tickling me. \u201cThere, that wasn\u2019t so bad now, was it?\u201d she asked as my laughter died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though I was a little embarrassed to admit it, I told her that it actually felt pretty good.

I could hardly believe that Sandy had actually diapered me, and on top of that, I actually wet it. It was so amazing that I couldn\u2019t help but get excited when Mom told me that Sandy would be baby-sitting for me again the next Friday. And for the first time ever, when Mom asked if I wanted to have Brian over that night (I had been good for Sandy, and that was the deal, right?), I told her no. As much as I liked Brian, the thought of being diapered again was too exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week dragged on even more than it normally did, and by the time Friday rolled around I was bursting with excitement. I was not let down, because there Sandy was again with the diaper bag around her shoulder. Sandy even explained to Mom that she would probably have the diaper bag with her for the next few weeks because she was still baby-sitting the kid being potty trained (good cover story on her part).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt actually was kinda awkward when my parents left that night. I hadn\u2019t seen Sandy for the first time in a week, so there was a weird tension between our normal routine and the fact that last week had been very different, what with me being diapered and all. As much as I wanted to jump right back into where we left off the week before, I had trouble telling Sandy that I wanted her to diaper me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, little man,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d (it was weird, she said this almost as if the previous week had never happened).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, not much,\u201d I responded. \u201cIts been kind of a boring week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I was you,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only have I had a ton of schoolwork, but me and Chad have been having some issues.\u201d (Chad was her boyfriend).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though my mind kept thinking about diapers, I listened to what she had to say. However, at the end, I couldn\u2019t contain myself any longer, so I took the plunge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Sandy?\u201d I asked. \u201cDo you think, you know, if you don\u2019t mind, could you, uh, I mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said with a small laugh. \u201cYou want me to put you in another diaper, right?\u201d </span></div></div>",

Yeah, that\u2019d be great!\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, since I don\u2019t want to make a mess on the carpet, take off your pants and lie down on this changing pad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out this little mat thing and put it on the ground. I felt kinda weird getting naked again, but not as weird as the week before. As I took off my pants and underwear, I saw Sandy take out a diaper and a couple of other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay down on the pad feeling weird but also very excited. Sandy didn\u2019t unfold the size 6 Pamper right away; instead, she first took this small bottle that said \u201cBaby Lotion\u201d on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now this might feel a little weird, but babies should have lotion on them before they\u2019re diapered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the look on my face, she then said, \u201cOh come on Ian, I know you\u2019re not really a baby. But if I\u2019m gonna diaper you, we\u2019re gonna have to do it MY way, ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my head even though I wasn\u2019t crazy about the idea. I was beginning to feel more and more like a baby again. On the other hand, part of me liked this idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely pretty weird having Sandy put the baby lotion in her hand and massage it into my private area as well as my butt. But I knew that this is what she did to the babies whose diapers she changed, and plus it felt pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took out a little canister of baby powder. \u201cI don\u2019t want my little man to get a diaper rash, now do I?\u201d she said with a sly little grin. As she lifted my legs up and shook the baby powder on my butt I felt a great sense of joy; the baby powder smelled wonderful and I got another little jolt of excitement as I was reminded even more of when I was a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy then took the diaper and slid it underneath my butt. She lowered me onto it, sprinkled some more baby powder onto my front, and before I knew it, had fastened the diaper around my waist snugly. As I got up, I felt extremely happy and well, cute, just like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandy put away the baby supplies, she beckoned me over to the couch and patted it, telling me to sit down. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After I did so, Sandy looked at me seriously and began to speak. \u201cOk, Ian, listen up, because this is serious. Last week gave me a few ideas, and to be honest, I find you absolutely adorable in your diapers. But since Ill probably never get this chance again, and because I like you, I want your full cooperation tonight. The deal is, you do what I say, no questions asked. If you refuse, Ill tell your parents all about you wearing diapers again, and I\u2019ll act like you took them and wore them on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the shocked look on my face, and then said, \u201cI know Ian, but I really don\u2019t want to have to do that. All I ask is your full and total cooperation. If you don\u2019t want to do this, tell me now, and Ill take that diaper off of you and well have a \u2018normal\u2019 evening. Otherwise, the deal is on. So what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to admit I was kinda confused about all of this. What did Sandy have in store, and why was it so serious to her? I was definitely a little surprised as well, so I needed a chance to think about it. As cool as Sandy was, I didn\u2019t doubt for one second that she\u2019d tell my parents I had taken the diapers on my own, and they\u2019d no doubt believe her given my past actions. I was kinda nervous about giving Sandy complete control of me. But my diaper felt so good that I didn\u2019t want to take it off. And besides, it was Sandy, and I trusted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d I said. \u201cIll do it. You have full control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d she said. \u201cAlright Ian, remember, full cooperation, no \u2018buts\u2019. But don\u2019t worry, if it really gets to be too much for you, just yell \u2018Stop!\u2019, and the diaper goes off and the evening will be normal. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it,\u201d I said, feeling good that I had a way out, but feeling nervous that things could get so bad I\u2019d need to yell stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, lets start by changing your clothes. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said seeing the look on my face. \u201cThat diaper isn\u2019t going anywhere until it needs to be changed into a new one. However, I want you to take off your shirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I did this, I saw her pull an article of clothing out of the diaper bag: it was one of those one-piece set of pajamas for babies, which I later learned was called a footed sleeper. However, it was bigger than one for a baby; in fact, it looked just the right size for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis definitely surprised me. I mean, diapers were one thing, but now Sandy wanted me to wear baby clothes as well? Why was she so intent on this, and what was the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t have much more time to ponder it, however, since Sandy then told me to lay down again and relax. As I laid down in just my diaper, she told me to let her do all of the work, so I continued to relax as she began to put me in the sleeper. I felt kind of silly and even more like an actual baby, but our deal was still fresh in my mind, so I made no objection. And after Sandy zipped it up, I had to admit, I actually liked the feel of it. It made me feel warm on both the outside and the inside. I felt a smile go across my face as I imagined being little again, especially since I could feel the padding on my feet as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, Sandy had scooped me up in her arms and carried me, well, like a baby across to the couch. My legs were across one of her arms and my back over the other. As she sat down, she used one arm to support my head and I felt my body resting in her lap. I still felt a little funny but I was very comfortable as well. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While still holding me, I saw her reach into the diaper bag and pull out a baby bottle full of milk. She was still supporting my head with one arm and used the other hand to move the nipple of the bottle toward my mouth. As it came close, I pushed it away and said, \u201cHey! I don\u2019t wanna drink from a bottle like a little baby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ah ah, Ian,\u201d she responded. \u201cDon\u2019t forget our deal. I\u2019m in control here. And stop talking. Remember, babies don\u2019t talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026\u201d I began to say, but I was cut off as she pushed the nipple into my mouth. But I remembered our deal and just began to quietly suck from it. It was just normal milk, and even though it was hard to get out at first, I actually began to enjoy it. It was very relaxing, and I began to feel very warm and cozy as I felt the warm cloth over my body, Sandy\u2019s soft body that I was lying in, and the soft padding of my diaper on my butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes as I continued to nurse from the bottle, and I began to imagine myself as a real baby again. The feelings that I felt were so real and before I knew it I felt joy wash over my body. This was enhanced even more because Sandy begin to talk baby talk to me, saying things like \u201cNow that\u2019s a good wittle baby. Drink da whole bottle like a good boy!\u201d This was wonderful, and at that moment I didn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the bottle ran out, and Sandy took it out of my mouth. I opened my eyes and saw her reach down and pinch my cheek saying, \u201cOh, little Ian, you\u2019re just adorable.\u201d I felt a smile go across my face as she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach felt a little funny, but before I could say anything, Sandy already knew what to do. Before I knew it, she stood up, put me over her shoulder and began to pat my back. Soon after, I felt the taste of milk in my mouth as I let out a burp. Sandy had just burped me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then shifted me over to her hip. She reached into the diaper bag once again and this time she pulled out a pacifier. She popped it into my mouth, which for some reason I didn\u2019t object to at all and began to suck happily. She laid me down on the couch and I felt myself relax, allowing all of my baby feelings to just soak in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy then pulled out a little stuffed teddy bear and told me to hold it. I did so, and instead of feeling embarrassed or weird, I was just reminded of when I was little and used to carry around stuffed animals all of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lay there, Sandy sat down next to me and began to softly run her fingers through my hair. This soothed me even more, and by the look on her face, Sandy was enjoying it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then realized that I needed to pee. Remembering that I was diapered and how good it felt last time, with only a little effort I managed to get a little trickle going. Soon, I had completely let myself go and felt the warm moisture up against my legs and waist as my diaper filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy must have been an expert baby-sitter, because she already began to notice. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d she said in a babyish voice. \u201cLooks like someone has a wet dydee! We better get him changed!\u201d </span></div></div>",

I simply continued to relax as I felt Sandy undo my sleeper and remove my wet diaper. I got a little shock as I felt something cold touch my private area; Sandy had begun to clean me with a baby wipe! Within a short period of time Sandy had cleaned my entire butt and private area, and after quickly applying some more powder, she taped a new diaper on me and fastened my sleeper back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, she told me to sit up and take out my pacifier. She then began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d I told her. \u201cThis is amazing! Kinda weird at first. And I do feel a little silly to be sucking a pacifier and drinking from a bottle, but it feels\u2026.well\u2026nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d like it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you see, I don\u2019t think it would be as good if I didn\u2019t have control of you like that. It wouldn\u2019t be as real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I began to think about it, what she said was true. With Sandy in control of me, I didn\u2019t have a care in the world, just like a real baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cOur times just about up, little man. Time for you to go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy then helped me out of my sleeper and my diaper, and she put up all of the baby stuff as I changed back into my normal clothes. As the evening ended, I began to think about moms offer of having Brian over. My mischevious mind began to work, and suddenly my head was filled with an idea for my good buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sandy,\u201d I said. \u201cHows about next week you baby-sitting me AND Brian\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Mom told me that the next Friday night that she and dad would actually be spending the night away, and Sandy had agreed to sleep at our house and watch me until Saturday evening. When I asked mom if it would be all right if Brian came over too, she gave in and said that it would fine as long as it was fine with Sandy (hey, for two weeks in a row I had been good for Sandy, right?) I offered to call Sandy and ask her, and mom agreed. I thought a bit more about what Sandy and I could do with Brian, I called Sandy and let her know about my plans. I was a little surprised; not only was Sandy fine with all of my ideas, she was actually pretty excited about them. I don\u2019t know, maybe Sandy had found a new love for diapering nine year olds or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I talked to Brian about him coming over and spending the night that Friday, and like usual, he was happy to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that sounds cool,\u201d he said. \u201cSandy\u2019s always been cool when I\u2019ve gone over there in the past, even when we weren\u2019t really good for her.

We actually had some fun before Sandy got there, playing around on the computer and my PlayStation 2. And even when Sandy got there, the evening played out normally. My plans for Brian would take place the next morning, and even we were having so much fun with her that he never even brought up wanting to play a joke on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time to go to bed, after we got in bed, Sandy got the ball rolling for what we were going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Brian,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to make sure. You\u2019re not a bed-wetter, are you?\u201d (she had never watched him overnight, so it was a fair question).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked a little embarrassed to be asked this, and immediately responded by saying, \u201cWhat? No! Of course not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts OK,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are, its nothing to be embarrassed about. I just want to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really, I\u2019m not!\u201d he said, looking even more uncomfortable. I knew he didn\u2019t wet the bed, but if someone asked me, I would have felt weird too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, that\u2019s fine. But I\u2019m not washing wet sheets, so if I find out in the morning that you\u2019re lying, there\u2019s gonna be a big problem, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a bed-wetter. Its not gonna happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. Well, good night, boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left the room. Me and Brian started talking, and he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cShe just wants to make sure. She asked me the same thing the first night she watched me. And since you don\u2019t wet the bed, you don\u2019t need to think anything else about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, before I go into what we actually did to Brian, you might read it and think its pretty mean. But hey, he had embarrassed me at school a few weeks ago, claiming he didn\u2019t mean anything by it and that it was all in good fun. Well, this was just my way of getting him back, and it was also all in good fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after we talked a bit more, we got tired and fell asleep. However, about 8 o\u2019clock the next morning, I felt Sandy wake me up. She had used an alarm clock to get up, and she told me to keep quiet so I wouldn\u2019t wake Brian up. She had with her a bowl of warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn\u2019t bother with the whole dipping the hand in warm water gag. Instead, being very careful, Sandy lifted up Brian\u2019s blanket and lightly poured the water over Brian\u2019s crotch. Luckily he didn\u2019t wake up. As we both giggled, she told me to pretend I was asleep and get ready because she would be coming in to wake us up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lay back down and closed my eyes, I heard Sandy leave and then come back in and yell \u201cAlright, boys, I know it\u2019s Saturday, but you gotta get up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I acted like I had just gotten up, I felt Sandy yank my blanket off of me (I had slept on the floor and given Brian my bed). I gave a fake yawn as I looked over at Brian, who still held his own blanket tightly so that he didn\u2019t have to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Brian, you too,\u201d she said. She continued to speak as she pulled his blanket off to. \u201cCome on, if we have to get up\u2026\u201d she paused as she looked down at the wet spot around his crotch and on the sheets. I looked at her face and saw a look of puzzlement, almost disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian then looked down at the wet spot and a look of complete shock crossed over his face. He opened his mouth but no sound came out, and he looked at Sandy, then me, and then back at the wet spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBRIAN!\u201d Sandy yelled. \u201cYou TOLD me you were not a bed wetter!\u201d I began to see some anger in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026I\u2019m not!\u201d Brian said. His voice was shaky and I could tell he was embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d she said. \u201cWell, I have washed too many wet sheets in the past, and if you\u2019re going to lie to me, I\u2019m just going to have to punish you for it!\u201d </span></div></div>",

He actually sounded like he was about to cry. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sandy would not have it. \u201cI told you there would be a big problem if I found a wet bed. So you\u2019re just going to have to face the consequences, Brian. Ian, you come with me, and if you don\u2019t do as I say, you\u2019ll face the same punishment as Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was dead serious, and then she turned and left. I gave Brian a nervous glance and said \u201cDude, you never told me you were a bed wetter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian looked really upset and said \u201cBut I\u2019m not! I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t wet the bed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is the one thing Sandy is really, really serious about. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m can\u2019t disobey her, she\u2019s too mad. I\u2019ll have to do what she tells me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian looked a little scared now as he realized even I wasn\u2019t on his side. I then left the room and talked with Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though we knew we were being mean, we laughed a little about what had just happened. She asked me if I was ok with going on with it, and even though I felt bad for making Brian upset like this, I remembered very well how badly he had embarrassed me before, so I decided that I still wanted to mess with him some more. What I still couldn\u2019t believe is that Brian actually believed that he had wet the bed; I guess it had happened so fast that he didn\u2019t realized that it was water and not pee on his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as Sandy got ready, I went back into the room where Brian was. Looking nervous, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brian, but I\u2019ve got to help Sandy punish you. If I don\u2019t she\u2019ll punish me, too. So, I just have to say\u2026sorry\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian looked even more nervous, and I think he wanted to try and leave the room. But at that moment Sandy entered. She closed the door, and then said, \u201cWell, considering the clothes you\u2019re wearing now are a mess, we\u2019ll have to take them off. So take off all of your clothes right now unless you want ME to take them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian just merely said \u201cNo way! I don\u2019t have any other ones, and I\u2019m not getting naked here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sandy said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your other \u2018clothes\u2019. But if you won\u2019t take your clothes off, I guess I\u2019ll have to. Ian, get over here and help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Brian tried to make a break for it, but Sandy simply caught hold of his wrist and pulled him towards her. While she held him in place, I first removed his shirt, then his wet pants. As Sandy held him in his underwear, she remarked, \u201cWell, since you\u2019re not cooperating, I\u2019ll just have to have Ian tie you down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian struggled as hard as he could, with a look of mixed anger, fear, and helplessness on his face. But Sandy held him still, and I took a piece of rope that I had had in my room and tied one of his wrists to the head of my bed. I did the same with his other wrist. I tried to make it look like I didn\u2019t really want to do it. Sandy then let go of him, and we both looked at him trapped on my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing how he could now do nothing, Brian looked like he was about to cry. \u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d he asked weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little Brian,\u201d Sandy said as she took off his underwear. \u201cYour punishment will simply be fitting. If you\u2019re going to wet the bed, we\u2019ll just have to make it so that this will not be a problem anymore. Come on Ian, lets get ready.\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As we walked out of the room, Sandy and I just smiled at each other. Call me a horrible friend, but I kind of enjoyed taking control of Brian. I knew at the end of it all we\u2019d just tell him it was a joke, and for now, payback was all I wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, Ian, last chance to back out,\u201d Sandy said. I told her that I still wanted to go on with it, so she picked the diaper bag that had our supplies in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy and I went back into my room. Brian didn\u2019t really have any response to the diaper bag; well, until Sandy pulled out a size 6 Pampers diaper, that is. It took a few seconds for Brian to register what it was, but once he did, a new look of fear crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d he yelled. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wear a diaper! No, no, no, no! Someone help! She\u2019s going to put a diaper on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Brian, calm down,\u201d Sandy said as she began to unfold the diaper. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anyone can hear you anyway, and I\u2019d rather not have to gag you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brain heard the word \u201cgag\u201d he seemed to calm down. However, as Sandy unfolded the diaper completely and started to walk towards him, his reaction went from anger to pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, tears now in his eyes. \u201cPlease, please, please don\u2019t put that diaper on me. I\u2019m not a baby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you did go pee pee on yourself last night, and since babies do too, they need diapers. So, since you acted like a baby, I\u2019m going to treat you like one. I am a \u201cbaby\u201d sitter, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian then began to kick his legs furiously, but Sandy grabbed both of his ankles in one hand (admittedly, Brian wasn\u2019t the biggest kid). She asked me for a towel, and after I handed it to her, she put it underneath him. She then asked me for the baby powder, and I gave it to her, again trying to look like I was sorry for Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see him sobbing now as Sandy began to powder his butt and crotch area. The smell of the baby powder filled the room, and funnily enough, the twitching of Brian\u2019s struggling body made him look even more like a real baby. I even began to feel genuinely sorry for him, but I had decided that I wouldn't back down now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Sandy placed the diaper underneath Brian. She pulled down his legs over it, pulled it between his legs, and tightly taped both the sides around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d she said, dusting her hands off. \u201cThat diaper will make sure that the baby doesn't make any more messes on the sheets. But we don\u2019t want \u2018baby\u2019 Bwian to be hungry, now do we? You just wait, sweetie, Sandy will get you all fixed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy then left me in the room with Brian. There he was, lying on the bed with tears running down his cheeks, diapered just as much as he was when he was a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough his tears he said, \u201cIan, please, I\u2019m begging you, make her stop! I don\u2019t want to wear a diaper\u2026I\u2019m not a baby!\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But I just sadly shook my head and told him that I had no choice. Soon after, Sandy came back in, now with a baby bottle full of milk in one hand. This made matters even worse for Brian, and he then begged her not to make him drink it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy, however, would have none of it, and before either me or Brian knew it, she had shoved the bottle into his mouth. As he was forced to drink it, the tears continued to pour down his face, and Sandy just made it worse for him by condescendingly cooing him and saying things like \u201cGood baby, drink your whole bottle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had finished the whole thing, she took it out of his mouth and put it aside. Then, to my surprise, she just busted out laughing. Realizing that the joke was now over, I myself began to giggle. I mean, Brian really had looked kind of funny wearing a diaper and being bottle-fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we laughed, Brian look confused, but still embarrassed and as he sobbed, he asked, \u201cWhat, you guys think this is funny? Putting a\u2026a diaper on me, and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, Brian, you don\u2019t get it,\u201d Sandy said between laughs. \u201cThis whole thing was a joke that Ian and I came up with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said as I began to untie him from the bed. \u201cYou didn't really wet the bed, we just poured some water on you. And I just wanted to get you back from when you embarrassed me so bad a while back. I was trying to think of the best way, and I remembered that Sandy always had some diapers\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly remembered that I couldn\u2019t tell Brian about me wearing diapers. \u201c\u2026for one of the babies that she takes care of. We came up with the idea of Sandy being really angry with you for wetting the bed and forcing you into a diaper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finished untying Brian, he took all of this in. Relief spread over his face as he realized that Sandy didn\u2019t really think she needed to baby him. Once he fully took it in, he then got mad at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou jerk!\u201d he said. \u201cHow could you do this to me?! To your best friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man,\u201d I replied. \u201cDon\u2019t forget how horrible I felt after you embarrassed me last time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this didn\u2019t solve the problem, and he was still very angry at me. I didn\u2019t know what to do; I hadn\u2019t expected him to be this mad, and I began to feel bad about what we had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy sensed the tension between the two of us, but thankfully, she had an idea. Without warning and to my great surprise (and Brian\u2019s), she grabbed me and pinned me to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Ian,\u201d she said, her face about an inch away from mine. \u201cYour turn! Brian, get me another diaper!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw an evil grin spread over Brian\u2019s face as he now realized it was my turn to be diapered. After the extreme humiliation he had gone through, this would be sweet revenge for him. As he turned away, Sandy smiled at me and whispered, \u201cCome on, Ian, play along, this is your chance to be diapered while Brian is over, and it will make him feel a lot better. He\u2019ll never know you like it if you act like you don\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing her logic, I calmed down a bit. Even though I was kind of embarrassed to be diapered in front of Brian, I was also really excited because I didn\u2019t think that I would get the chance to wear a diaper this weekend. Plus I couldn't think of any other way to make him calm down. However, I knew that I couldn\u2019t let Brian realize that I liked it, so I tried to look horrified as I saw him come over with the diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy instructed Brian to take my clothes off. I kind of put up a fake struggle, and I even falsely begged Sandy and Brian not to do it. But then the inevitable happened\u2026Sandy powdered my butt and before I knew it I was in a diaper again. Brian was clearly enjoying himself and even joined Sandy in baby-talking me while she did her work. </span></div></div>",

They even tickled me and \u201cforced\u201d me to wet my diaper. Even though this surprised Brian, he loved it and used it as a great opportunity to say things like \u201cAww, wittle Ian wet his diapy and needs a change!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe logic behind all of this was beautiful. Although I admit it was hard to act like I was humiliated (because I was so happy), I loved every second of my baby treatment. I even think the fact that Brian joined in treating me like a baby made it even better. But he was having a ball making fun of me, too. Funnily enough, even though he thought he and Sandy were playing a joke on me, in reality, we were playing a joke on him, considering only the two of us knew that I was loving my babyish state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the joke could only last so long. Sandy put the game to an end, and after I got out of my diaper, I could tell Brian was much happier. He had forgiven me for what Sandy and I had done. We then both just laughed at ourselves and how funny we had looked in diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was about time for my parents to be back. Sandy made us swear that we wouldn\u2019t tell anyone about what had happened this weekend (not that we wanted to anyway). She then said \u201cBye bye my cute little baby boys,\u201d as she left us. Right after my parents walked in and had a brief talk with Sandy. She then left, and it was time for Brian to go too. After they had both gone, I just relaxed and thought about everything that had happened that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, just in case you\u2019re wondering what Brian had done to embarrass me so badly, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m telling you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Brian and I had our crazy baby-sitting experience, the week-end was soon over and I was off to school again for the week. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to mention anything about it to Brian, and he must have felt the same way because he carried on as if the whole thing had never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was fine with this at first; we still were \u201cnormal\u201d friends, and we continued to have a good time with each other and our other friends at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was that Sandy wouldn't be coming over again for a long time; she was really busy with her schoolwork among other things, and the few times my parents decided to go out over the next six weeks, they just had me stay over at Brian\u2019s or another friend\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't a big deal at first, but after the first couple of weeks, I started going through diaper withdrawal. I couldn't stop thinking about how happy I had been wearing and wetting diapers, and I even liked the thought of seeing Brian in one. My desire became continually strong, and it got to the point that I had trouble concentrating in school (which led to a couple of occasions of me looking completely stupid because our teacher would ask a question and I would be completely clueless as to what she was talking about). I began to feel like I was going crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made it that much worse is that I had no one to talk to about it. I wasn't able to get a hold of Sandy, and other than her, no one knew that I had worn a diaper since I was a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept\u2026Brian. But the fact that he never mentioned anything about it clearly showed that he was not interested at all. He might have even forgotten that the whole thing even happened. The idea of me even mentioning diapers again was weird, and for me to tell him that I actually enjoyed wearing them was simply preposterous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, I felt that if I didn\u2019t tell anyone about it, I would explode. I began to picture in my mind how I would tell him and how he would respond. I wondered if he would think I was really weird or stupid. I wondered if he would tell anyone else. Most importantly I wondered if he would still be my friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving it much thought, I finally decided that I would tell him. We had been best friends for so long that I felt I could tell him anything, and I trusted him enough not to tell anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I would be going over to his house again the upcoming week-end, I decided that would be the best time to tell him. I thought about it a lot that week, and I was very nervous and afraid that he\u2019d laugh at me or think I was really weird. Still, I stayed resolved to it, and realized that I couldn\u2019t back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that Friday evening came, I waited until after we had finished having dinner with his family to tell him. As we walked up the stairs to his room, I started feeling slightly sick to my stomach as I began building up my courage to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we got into his room and threw ourselves down on the floor, he noticed that I looked kinda funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIan, are you OK? You look a little sick or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a deep breathe in and said, \u201cLook, Brian, I got something I have to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot thinking it was a big deal, he said, \u201cOK\u2026go ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, its really really serious,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou have to swear that you won\u2019t EVER tell ONE single person about it.\u201d </span></div></div>",

A couple of seconds later he said, \u201cAll right, I swear, I won\u2019t tell anybody. We\u2019re best friends, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I remembered that he was indeed my best friend, I took another deep breathe, and said, \u201cOk, here goes. Remember about a month ago when you came over to my house, and Sandy was baby-sitting us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he recalled what happened, he smiled a little and said, \u201cOh yeah\u2026ha ha, wow, that crazy girl actually put diapers on us! Pretty embarrassing, huh? I tried to make myself forget about it, but I still remember how scared I was and how funny it felt to wear a diaper again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a knot beginning to form in my throat, I nervously continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know when she put the diaper on me? Well, that wasn\u2019t the first time that I had worn a diaper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it wasn't, doofus,\u201d Brian said to me with a smile. \u201cYou wore them when you were a baby. I did too. Everyone does. I think I even slightly remember back when we were in diapers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not what I mean,\u201d I said, feeling my nerves reach a peak. \u201cI actually wore one a few weeks before you came over. Sandy put one on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I never knew you wet the bed, Ian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you still don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t NEED them, for bedwetting or anything. I, well, I\u2026 LIKE wearing them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I saw his mouth drop, I felt it would be easier if I just kept talking. Before I knew it, I began blurting out all my feelings about diapers and being treated like a baby. Brian simply didn't say anything and looked like he was having trouble breathing as his jaw dropped and I launched into the story of how I had seen Sandy\u2019s diaper bag, how she had offered to diaper me, how I had loved it so much, and how the next week she had proceeded to treat me like a baby. As I continued, the knot in my throat became tighter and tighter and I felt more and more queasy. Brian\u2019s look of shock did not wear off, and I noticed my voice was very strained and nervous. By the end, I even noticed that I had tears in my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and that\u2019s where we got the idea to pull a joke on you and put a diaper on you. Sandy surprised me when she decided to diaper me, but I was faking when I acted like I didn't like it. I simply LOVED it, even though I still don\u2019t get why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finished, Brian just continued to look at me in disbelief. He opened his mouth to say something, but then closed it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to say, I just blurted out, \u201cYeah, I know, its really stupid and weird and you probably think I\u2019m a freak, but you don\u2019t understand, I\u2019ve been thinking about this for weeks and weeks and I just had to tell some\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Brian then cut me off, and to my great surprise I noticed that he had tears in his eyes. \u201cIan, I just simply don\u2019t believe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Here it comes,\u2019 I thought. \u2018He\u2019s going to lay it on me and say he doesn\u2019t want to be friends any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I soon realized that they were tears of joy, because he said, \u201cI never expected this. IAN, I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY! When Sandy powdered and diapered me, I was embarrassed, but a part of me just loved the whole experience. I loved the smell of the baby powder and the soft feel of the diaper. I even loved the helplessness of being tied down. But I didn\u2019t want you guys to know, so I acted really mad about the whole thing. But ever since then, it\u2019s all that I\u2019ve been able to think about. But I could never tell you. You\u2019d just think that I was dumb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot believing my ears, the nervousness simply drained from my body and a wide smile went across my face. It was at that point that I knew that Brian and I would be best friends for life. But it got even better, because Brian then said,</span></div></div>",

I was really nervous about it, but I was able to sneak them home without my parents noticing. I\u2019ve been wearing them every night and I\u2019ve even wet them! And getting rid of them isn't a problem; I just put them in the garbage can outside and the garbage man takes them away every morning. It\u2019s the best thing ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he got up and locked his door. He then went over to his closet. After he rummaged through it for a few seconds, he emerged with an opened pack of size 6 Pampers diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitedly I jumped up and said, \u201cWell what are we waiting for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA broad smile spread across his face and he said, \u201cOk, but me first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly took off all of his clothes while I got a diaper out of the pack and unfolded it. We had seen each other naked before, so it wasn\u2019t really that weird to see him naked. It was weird, however, for me to diaper my best friend. Being an only child, I had never diapered anyone, so it was new to me. But I soon figured out how, and just like that I had taped up Brian\u2019s diaper and said, \u201cThere! All done, mister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a sight. Brian always did look kind of young, what with his straight blond hair, skinny body, and blue eyes. To be honest, he actually looked a lot like a real toddler as he lay there in his diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, now let me do you,\u201d he said with a smile. Within minutes I had stripped as well and he diapered me. He even gave me a playful pat on my diapered butt and said \u201cThere you go kiddo!\u201d (hey, it\u2019s not that weird, football players do it all the time, right?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued to play around in our diapers. We first acted like babies for a bit, and when that got old, we watched a movie in his room. His parents came up to check on us at one point, but we simply put our other clothes on over our diapers and his parents never knew. Part way through the movie, I had to pee, so I naturally decided to go in my diaper (Wow, I even thought peeing in my diaper was natural). After I let go, I told Brian about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at me and said, \u201cWell, I guess we better change baby Ian into a new didee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just laughed, put on a babyish voice and said, \u201cUncle Bwian, will you pwease change me?\u201d I then smiled at him and put my thumb in my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d he said. I kept my thumb in mouth as he changed me into a fresh diaper, hiding the wet one in his closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I was changed, I noticed that he was wet as well, and I said, \u201cUh-oh, looks like someone else had an accident in his diapy, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just sheepishly smiled and said, \u201cMe go pee pee! Need a new diapy! Waaaaaa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I laughed I had him lie down and changed him into a new diaper too. Unfortunately, we heard his mom coming, and after putting our clothes back on over our diapers, she came in and told us that it was time for bed. As we got ready for bed, we decided to keep our diapers on. As I fell asleep that night, I couldn\u2019t think of a time in my life where I had been happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t get much of a chance to talk to Brian the next morning before I had to go, and since we didn\u2019t want to arouse any suspicion, we decided not to mention anything else about the diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks Brian and I were extremely careful about talking about our new common interest. Thankfully we got another chance to have fun in our diapers, and I even gave Brian some money to buy a couple of baby things like a baby bottle and a pacifier. I found an old teddy bear and baby blanket to take over to his house, too. We had a very good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully (and somewhat surprisingly), no one ever found out about all of this. And once Sandy\u2019s schedule lightened up, we convinced our parents to let her baby-sit both of us again on many occasions. She was shocked but delighted when she learned about how Brian liked diapers and being treated like a baby, and we had many fun evenings being babied by her.</span></div></div>",

But they were always surprised to hear that two kids who usually were the most troublesome ones on the block actually behaved and were \u201cas peaceful as good little babies\u201d when ever Sandy took care of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( The End).   <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",
