            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just another day for Ron Stoppable, which usually meant a trip to Bueno Nacho, a few quality hours spent with his bon diggety girlfriend, the one and only Kim Possible, and taking care of his adopted baby sister Hana, the world's cutest and sweetest little kid you ever did see...as far as he was concerned, anyway. Now, that wasn't always the case, in fact he hated the idea of having her around at first. She was...an intruder. His old bedroom had been converted into her nursery, and now he lived in the attic which his parents had turned into a room for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those paternal instincts kicked in eventually, she was just too darn cute to resist. And as the months wore on, she began to learn and grow and reach milestones at an astonishing rate. The term gifted, child prodigy would be a good way of putting it. She had already started learning words thanks to Ron's dedication to teaching her, and she was already quite the little athlete...of course, that probably had more to do with being a mystical ninja baby from the secret Yamanouchi Ninja School than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Ron was determined to do everything he could to help her become the best at pretty much everything. His brotherly love for her ran so deep, and seeing her smile was like a light in the high school senior's life. Life really couldn't be better for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for those who knew Ron, which Kim Possible most certainly did, since they'd been best friends since high school and now were dating...it was no secret that Ron tended to obsess over things. When Hana first arrived, he was obsessed with proving that the bag of flour he was supposed to take care of for his health class assignment was far superior to Hana. Then his next obsession was to teach her to turn a page in a book, as well as maybe dance along with a music video DVD for toddlers...which Kim wondered if Ron enjoyed more than Hana herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis latest obsession? Making sure Hana grew up big and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn health class, they were currently doing a crash course in how the human body develops from infancy all the way to adulthood. Which got Ron wondering about Hana. The last thing he wanted was for Hana to fall behind her peers. If anything, he would prefer for her to be ahead of them, the best and biggest of the whole baby bunch! So it was that every day for the past 2 weeks, Ron was measuring Hana to see if she'd grown at all. Hana, bless her, was oblivious as to what her big brother was doing, all she knew was that he loved her and took care of her, and she loved him dearly for it. Whenever big brother was around, everything would be ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you Kim, Han's almost a year old and she's only 2-foot-3. According to Japanese averages, a girl her age should be at least 2-foot-4!\" Ron exclaimed into his cellphone as he measured Hana yet again. \"She's below average KP! And I will not stand for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her room in her own house, Kim rolled her eyes as she listened to her boyfriend rant. \"Not everyone grows at the same rate Ron. It took you until last year to finally pass me up in height, and you're still getting taller now...which I will admit, is a nice little bonus for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try Kim, but I'm not getting distracted by your feminine flirtations!\" Ron declared as he let Hana go and she crawled away to play with Rufus, his pet naked mole rat. \"It's my duty as her big brother to do everything I can to help her not only catch up, but surpass her peers! No sister of mine is going to be below average!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, don't go off the deep end with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not gonna stretch her out or anything. I'm just gonna do a little research and see what I can do to encourage her growth is all. I would never do anything to hurt her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying you will, but you need to keep in mind that just because she's literally one inch shorter than average doesn't mean she's not healthy.\" Then Kim heard her parents calling for her. \"Gotta go Ron, remember what I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I hear ya. Do what you gotta do, love ya KP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too Ron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ron hung up the phone, he scooped Hana up in his arms, and the little tyke giggled and wrapped her arms around Ron's neck. \"Don't you worry kiddo, your big brother's gonna make sure you grow up big and strong. Now let's see if there's anything we can find to help give you a size boost!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Wade called in with a mission to check out a rocky mountain lair that he detected suspicious activity in, Ron felt the urge to bang his head against a wall. The times he was put between a rock and a hard place was more than he could count, and his mother had made it abundantly clear that Hana was not to go along on missions with him and Kim. Of course...there was that whole recon loophole...it wasn't like Ron had much of a choice. His parents were away for an actuary conference in Denver, and they wouldn't be back until late the next day. And leaving Hana alone was just not gonna happen, super ninja baby or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Han, looks like we're gonna have to take you on another mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrk, bad idea.\" Rufus chittered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I know it? But it's not like I can hire a babysitter! I AM the babysitter! Plus I'm not gonna leave Hana to some stranger, what kind of a brother would I be if I did that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was with great reluctance that Ron packed up the baby bag, strapped Hana into the baby carrier, and with Kim driving, they were on their way before they knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival to the location, the first thing they noticed was that the lair's roof had collapsed for some reason, and the building seemed completely demolished. \"Wade, you sure this is the right place?\" Kik asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the car's built in console, Wade nodded. \"No doubt about it Kim, that's where the energy signature's coming from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this place looks condemned!\" Ron exclaimed. \"Or...maybe haunted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm calling a definite maybe on the first, definite no on the second. Let's check it out.\" Kim led the way inside, as the teen heroes (plus one baby and one naked mole rat) were met with more debris and wires hanging from the ceiling. \"Whatever happened here, it must've been big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the football team had another one of their wild nights here.\" Ron suddenly felt Kim's eyes on him. \"N-Not that I would know! Because I don't go to those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, because the star running back never gets invited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do, but y'know, why spend the night getting drunk and breaking stuff when I can spend the night with the most beautilicious girl in the whole wide universe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim smirked. \"Good answer.\" They continued on their way, and they soon found themselves standing in the middle of a massive room, more trashed than the rest...but the real attention getter was the giant ray gun in the middle of the room, sparking with wires hanging out of it. \"Well that doesn't look evil at all.\" Kim scoffed as she activated her wrist Kimmunicator. \"Wade, think we found your energy signature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say you did.\" Wade said as he furiously typed away on his keyboard. \"It'll take me a minute to figure out what it was designed to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this thing is huge!\" Ron said as he walked around the ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, don't touch anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Kim, don't you think I know better by now?\" Ron rolled his eyes as he leaned against the ray's main console. \"Every time I push a button, something explodes. Well this time I'm completely hands off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Hana was not, as the little tyke strapped to Ron's back was taken in by the big red button in the middle of the console, and with Ron leaning back, she was able to reach it and press it, and the machine began to whir to life, causing Hana to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear! I didn't press anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kim saw Hana pressing the button over and over again, and she groaned as she grabbed Ron's hand and pulled him away. \"But it looks like Hana is picking up your Stoppable curiosity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kim,\" Wade exclaimed nervously. \"According to my readings, that thing's gearing up to fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone down!\" Kim shoved Ron to the floor and then dropped herself, just as the ray fired and a bright green laser whizzed just inches over their heads. \"Did anyone get hit by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think so...\" Ron said as he slowly got back up. \"Rufus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked mole rat chattered and gave a quick thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Hana?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon took off the harness to get a better look at his baby sister, and she seemed no worse for wear as she was still smiling wide eyed at him. \"She doesn't seem hurt or anything, are ya Han?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brudder!\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...that's a relief.\" Ron sighed. Then an alarm began blaring, and Ron shrieked. \"What's happening?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Self destruct!\" Kim shouted. \"Everyone out!\" As Kim dragged everyone out at full sprint, the ray blew up just as they made it to the doors, and they managed to escape unscathed. \"That does it. Ron, you know I love your sister, but from now on, if she's with you, I'm going solo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, might be for the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wade, did you get anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Kim, it blew before I could finish my scan. But I'll see what I can dig up and try to fill in the blanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim hung up, and as soon as everyone was safely strapped in, she drove her boyfriend and his baby sister home. \"I hope Hana's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you kidding? I think this kid's a thrill seeker. Takes after you I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hopefully not too much like me. I'll call you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, later KP.\" Ron watched Kim drive next door to her house, and then he went back inside to wind down after the mission. \"Man, that was too close. Guess we better get you all changed and ready for bed, huh kiddo?\" Ron carried the tyke upstairs to get her all cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware that while he had narrowly missed getting hit by the ray...Hana actually wound up getting hit instead.</span></div></div>",

Alright, I'm up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sandy-haired blond made his way downstairs, blinking several times as he tried to shake off the drowsiness. Last night's scare really wore him out, but now he had to get back to normal, and the first thing he had to do was measure his baby sister. One little distraction was rarely ever enough to shake him off from his obsession. When he reached the nursery, he already saw Hana in her onesie, and she was running circles around the ceiling. \"Aww.\" Rufus cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's cute, until you have to clean the footprints off the ceiling.\" He waited for the opportune moment, and then leaped up and snagged her before she could make another lap around the room. \"Gotcha you little troublemaker!\" He tickled her belly, and she laughed joyfully and squirmed in his cradling arm. \"You know what time it is, let's see if anything's changed!\" As they made their way into the kitchen where Ron was doing the measurements, he stood her up against the wall, helping her to stay steady. \"How is it you can jump 50 feet in the air, defeat an ancient evil mystic monkey, run around the ceiling like a race car around a track...and yet if I don't help you stand up, you fall over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally Hana had no idea what he was talking about, but he was making a funny face so she laughed and reached for him with her tiny hands. \"Brudder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Han, big brother's here to help <i>you</i> get big. Now let's see what we got here...\" As Ron made the measurement, in-between Hana squirming, he was finally able to make the mark, and his eyes widened when he saw where it landed this time. \"Whoa! For real?!\" Just to be sure, he measured her again...and then a third time...and each time, there was no mistake. \"Rufus, ruler me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tiny salute, the naked mole rat scampered off and returned moments later with a ruler which Ron quickly took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks buddy!\" As he put the ruler against the wall to see the difference between the marks, a huge grin spread across his face as he saw just how much of a spurt she had. \"Booyah Han!\" He exclaimed as he picked her up and held her high in the air while spinning in circles, the girl laughing the entire time. \"2-foot-7! That's a whole 4 inches of growth! Now you're above average! All the other babies are gonna think you're a giant! You'll be like...the queen baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrk, ho boy.\" Rufus rolled his naked mole rat eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although...\" Ron stopped spinning and thought for a moment. \"I did only look up the average size for <i>Japanese</i> babies...I wonder what the average size is for American babies...\" Ron held Hana out at arm's length to get a full look at her, as she kicked and squirmed in his grip playfully. \"Why stop there? You're already the world's cutest baby. Let's see if you can be the world's <i>biggest</i> baby! Nothing but the best for my baby sister!\"</span></div></div>",

In a stunning turn of events, our dear little Han isn't quite so little anymore!\" He stretched out his arms to put Hana up to Kim's face, and the girl giggled and squirmed in his grip. \"Seemingly overnight, my below-average baby sister has become an above-average 4 inches taller! And I even triple-checked the measurement to be sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim just blinked, her smile gone as she processed what Ron said. \"Well...that's...great Ron. I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guess? This is the best thing ever!\" Ron exclaimed. \"Hana deserves nothing but the best, and that means I need to do everything I can to make her become the best she can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron,\" Kim rolled her eyes. \"This is starting to remind me of the turning the page situation. Not everything with Hana has to be a step towards progress. Have you ever considered just letting her be her and letting her figure things out on her own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC'mon Kim, does she look unhappy to you?\" Ron held Hana out to her again, and this time the baby reached her arms out for Kim to hold her, which Kim accepted as she took Hana from him. \"Far as I can tell, that's one happy kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded cheerleader looked down at Hana, who was looking up at her with wide, innocent eyes. \"She looks as happy as ever.\" Kim admitted with a small smile. \"All I'm saying is don't go off the deep end. Just love her as your sister, not as a personal project. We don't need more Sacky incidents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon frowned and stared distantly at nothing, the flashbacks of all the poor innocent bags of flour that perished by his hands. \"Oh Sacky MCMXXXIII, how could you betray me so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Kim sighed hopelessly. \"You and your Roman numerals. You wouldn't have gotten caught with a bag of sugar instead of flour if you had just let the stupid thing sit in a corner for your assignment. Barkin wouldn't have known any better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, Sacky wasn't stupid! I loved her as much as I've loved anything...second, never assume Barkin doesn't know something.\" His voice lowered hauntingly. \"He always knows...somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim started to walk past Ron into his kitchen, with her blond boyfriend following closely behind. \"You should've just explained to Mr. Barkin what happened. In fact I bet if you'd just brought Hana into school instead of the flour, you might've gotten an \"A\" just because you had to take care of a real baby instead of a fake one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww man, now ya tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim shook her head with an exasperated smile, then placed Hana into her booster seat as she grabbed a chair for herself. \"Alright, enough about the past. Let's talk about right now. What's for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the thought of cooking, Ron immediately perked up. \"For you, me and Rufus, Le Ron Omelette, filled with freshly grated cheddar, ham, bell peppers and onions.\" Ron zipped over to the fridge, grabbing the ingredients necessary for his delicacy. \"And for my growing baby sister, a sippy cup of breast milk to start, then we'll experiment with a few new fruits she hasn't tried yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kim was shocked. \"Breast milk?! How-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how my mom gets it,\" Ron gave Kim a serious look. \"And I don't want to know either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim put her hands up. \"Point made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Ron then handed the sippy cup to Hana, and the girl eagerly began to drink it down. \"There ya go! Now you drink it all up, wouldn't want you to miss out on any of those nutrients! We'll have you growing taller in no time!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ron continued to bustle around the kitchen, preparing breakfast for him and his lady, Hana quickly finished the cup of breast milk, and moments later, she began to fuss, whining and struggling from her chair, which gained her some attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, how tight did you make the high chair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, about the same as always, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim got up from her chair to address the squirming child's problem, and saw that the restraints keeping Hana in the chair were squeezing her tightly. \"Ron! She's practically got no room to breathe!\" Scoffing, Kim loosened the chair to give Hana more space, and almost instantly she calmed down and reached out to Kim. \"There you go kiddo,\" Kim smiled as she took Hana's hands in her own. \"Ron wasn't kidding, you really are getting big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to her loving big brother of course!\" Ron grinned as he presented Kim with her omelette. \"Now you take this and get started while I get Han something else to snack on.\" As Ron handed off the plate of eggs, he went over to Hana and took the empty sippy cup and replaced it with a plastic bowl of small banana slices. \"There ya go Han, a terrific breakfast appetizer. If you still want more after, I'll even make you some scrambled eggs! After all, babies need plenty of protein to grow up big and strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let no one doubt your paternal instincts Ron,\" Kim rolled her eyes as she started on her breakfast. Almost immediately, her annoyance faded as the flavors of her boyfriend's food took control of her senses. \"This is amazing, as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got one great pitch KP, and I intend to use it as long as it keeps working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure it stays a healthy pitch. We don't need another Bueno Nacho fiasco.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we agreed to never speak of that again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you asked me not to speak of it again. I never said I wouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two lovers bantered back and forth, Hana smiled as she munched on her banana slices. Between bites, unbeknownst to the two teenagers in the room...Hana would coo as a warm sensation coursed through her young body. With each bite of food, Hana was spurting slightly bigger...her onesie starting to stretch to its absolute limit, as the sleeves began to squeeze around her wrists and the fabric around her feet began to show signs of tearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Hana had no way of comprehending what was happening to her, being less than a year old. But what she did know was that she was starting to feel tied down again, as the high chair was once more becoming too restrictive for her growing body.</span></div></div>",

We're not goin' anywhere.\" Ron watched his girlfriend bolt from the house, leaving him, Rufus and Hana alone. \"Welp, guess I better start cleaning up. No chef worth his salt would leave the kitchen dirtier than he started.\" He grabbed the plates and headed towards the sink, taking a quick glance at Hana before he got there.</span></div></div>",
