The top wasn't much to look at, except for the pretty face and green eyes, rather it was their bottom that gathered attention. Hips twice as wide as the skunk's shoulders and an ass so big that it requires at least two chairs to barely hold each cheek, as it was spilling over the edge with ease. With thick thighs to toss in with the mix, it would drive most men wild, but something about the anthro bugged Nick and he patted on the shoulder to gather its attention.<br>\r\n\"You're a dude, aren't you?\"<br>\r\nThe skunk looks at him for a while before cracking a smile.<br>\r\n\"Impressive! All guys would assume that I was a woman until I told them otherwise. Let me get you something,\" he says, getting the barkeep's attention to order a drink for Nick.<br>\r\n\"Name's Nick.\"<br>\r\n\"Chris. So, what's with you being here in this pub?\" He asks.<br>\r\n\"Just wanted a drink. What about you dressing up as a chick?\"<br>\r\nBlushing a bit, Chris soon replies.<br>\r\n\"As far as I could remember, I have always looked like a girl and because of that, I eventually decided to dress up like one,\" he answers.<br>\r\nThe two of you drink for a while as you both ask each other about yourself until you're both drunk and a growl comes from Chris's gut.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess it's my time to leave. Don't want to gas the place out!\" He giggles, catching Nick's attention.<br>\r\n\"What you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"I have to fart and I been told that they reek badly,\" he giggles.<br>\r\n\"Then, let me help you with that. Barkeep's, can I get some nachos and a glass of milk for my friend!\" Nick orders.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Chris asks, curious about the human's actions.<br>\r\n\"Trying to make you even more gassy.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my! But who will deal with this much gas?\"<br>\r\n\"You can leave that to me!\" Nick states, a thin smile on Chris's face.<br>\r\n\"Don't say I warned you or anything,\" he replies, just as the food arrives.<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before he devoured it all and asked for more, exceeding at least seven large servings before paying for the bill. Paying his portion, Nick joins up with Chris and both head to Chris's place. Walking behind the skunk, Nick could see his new friend's butt quiver a each step he took.<br>\r\n\"You know I could have eaten more if I had the money to so, but being an inventor doesn't pay much, so deal with it, sweetheart,\" Chris said, catching Nick staring at his ass and Nick could look back in disbelief at the thought of him eating more, as he ate a lot of food.<br>\r\nOnce inside of the home, Chris releases a massive fart from his ass, jiggling his rump. Nick takes a whiff of it and cringes his nose.<br>\r\n\"You're right about it being bad but nothing I can't handle,\" Nick said, before Chris's tail wraps around his neck.<br>\r\n\"No, you gotta get it from the source,\" the anthro said, pulling up his skirt, showing off some blue panties on his large butt, and pulling the human towards his bottom, just as he's about to rip another one, nose first.<br>\r\nThe fart came out loud and bassy, blowing back Nick's hair a bit. It was smellier than the last one, but Nick didn't mind at all, as he sniffed it all.<br>\r\n Releasing him, Chris turns around and says, \"Right now, I'm feeling...\"<br>\r\n </span></span></div></div>",

Your legs begin to tighten as your mind goes blank on things to say when you reach her. You body begins to fight itself as your penis begins to slide down your leg as it hardens, and your knees feel like they're locking as you force yourself closer, one step after another. It becomes harder to breath as you feel your chest tightening and your face turning red. The desire to make a sharp left turn and head for the bathroom is becoming an increasingly preferable alternative to talking with such a goddess in your present state. Yet all too soon your body bumps into her table. \"S.. sorry,\" you stammer and step back hoping she'll make the next move. She seems amiss to you as she continues to reading hunched over with her head in the pages. The bulge in your pants is just about table level as you stand there dumbstruck unsure of what to do next. *a-hem* you choke up as you clear your throat. Your unnamed goddess's eyes darts up at you and she asks in a sober voice; \"can I help you?\" You stand there for a moment more with your half empty bottle in hand and a very visible bulge in your pants before replying; \"is this seat taken?\" The fox doesn't reply but you take that as a silent \"no\" and cautiously sit down with relief as you feel the redness in your face mellow. \"I've stepped up to bat.\" You think to yourself as you take a swig of your beer and look over her over again. Without thinking you set the bottle back on the table but keep your eyes focused on her head as it pulls back from the book as she turns the page and slopes back into position. She start to read again seemingly unaware of your gaze on her. She repeats the act twice more as you continue to drunkenly stare at her - undressing her inch by inch in your mind. You almost have her bra off her luscious breasts when her eyes quickly glimpse up at you from behind the book. Her dark red eyes almost force a little gasp out of you knowing she caught you staring. You quickly look down at your empty bottle for a second before looking back up at her as you realize she was looking at you with...</span></div></div>",

Then you notice that her phone is still on the table. Not really sure what to do you grab it and hit the power button.

Squashed between her meaty arms were her voluptuous breasts, both bigger than watermelons with a thick helping of cleavage that was trying to spill out from her v-neck shirt. Pressing tightly up against the edge of the table was her massive stomach. The big ball of white and orange fur was as large as an exercise ball and stuck out several feet in front of her. Down below her thick hips and thighs were oozing out from under her in both directions, stretching her black leggings to the absolute limit and leaving no doubt in your mind they were as thick as the trunk of a tree if not more so. But just as easily impressive was her massive ass with each butt cheek larger than a bean bag chair. Barely leaving any room for her thick, fluffy tail to rest between the back of the seat and her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the gorgeous, obese, crimson haired vixen before you left you feeling rubbery in the legs, short of breath, and a distinct tightening sensation in the front of your pants. Only when you politely cleared your throat did the obese fox's eyes pull way from her book to look at you in surprise. Causing you to silently suck in a breath as your eyes fell upon two, breathtaking emerald eyes that were framed perfectly by her rectangular glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seat taken?\" you asked calmly but kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um, uh...no?\" said the fox confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I?\" you asked, gesturing to the open booth seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat fox's eyes darted between you and the empty seat several times before she replied. \"Uh, sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you scooted yourself into the seat, the vixen continued watching you with confusion and slight apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I ask what you're reading?\" you asked, pointing at her book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thumb still on her page, the vixen closed the book to read the front cover. \"It's called, 'The Celestial Trek',\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the cover reminded me of a book my roommate recommended for me to read once. I was curious to see if it was the same one,\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You read science fiction?\" the fox asked with genuine surprise and curiosity, adjusting her glasses and sweeping a lock of hair behind her left ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a bit actually,\" you said truthfully,\"You know, alot of the classics: Asimov, Bradbury, Fredrick Brown, Arthur Clarke.....But not that one, what's it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tells the story of a struggling human research colony inside the heart of an asteroid on the far edge of the galaxy alongside the alien locals who want to mine asteroid for space fuel,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's cool, does it have tentacle space-monsters and lusty, pink skinned alien queens?\" you said in jest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it has lusty purple skinned alien <i>kings</i>,\" corrected the vixen with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head back with a laugh. \"And how is it?\" you asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause as the obese vixen removed her thumb from inside the book and carefully closed both book covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horrible,\" she deadpanned, setting the book down and sliding it to the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence before the two of you burst out into a fit of giggles at the vixen's rather blunt book critique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bad huh?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the worst I've read, but certainly not the greatest,\" she said, brushing back more of her hair, this time with the lone strand of dyed pink hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Leo by the way,\" you declared, offering out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large vixen smiled warmly as she took your hand in hers to shake. \"Felicia,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Felicia, so what are you hanging around here for?\" you said, gesturing about the bar with a twirling hand. \"This place isn't exactly what I would call 'ideal' for quiet reading time,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox giggled with a playful roll of her eyes. \"It is to me. I have to escape from my apartment every Friday night because my roommate invites all of her environmental club buddies to design posters and plan fundraisers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's terrifying,\" you grimaced with slight horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?\" Felicia replied, giggling a little into one of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, hey, it could be worse,\" you said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia raised an eyebrow at this.\"What could be worse than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have my roommate, Mr. fashion magazine modeler and all his photography pals on photo shoot night,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the conversation devolved into a round of joyful laughter and snickering. This went on for several minutes before you were interrupted by the tall, gray furred wolf barkeep dressed in a green plaid shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a refill ma'am? And something for you sir?\" asked the barkeep with a bemused grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Felicia looked each other in the eyes. Both trying to size up the other. It was strange, the two of you had barely been speaking for ten minutes and already things were getting <i>familiar</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" the fox began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One beer for myself, another for my friend here, and a plate of greasy nachos for each of us. Sound good to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou directed that last comment at the obese, emerald eyed vixen whose growing smile threatened to make your heart implode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds excellent,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly three hours later, you and Felicia were having a grand time there in the bar. Happily trading favorite movies and TV shows, cheesy jokes, and a few embarrassing stories from life at college. The two of you progressively getting more and more drunk and silly with each round of drinks and greasy nachos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell to be fair, you had had one plate of nachos so far. Felicia, on the other hand, had three and was busy destroying a fourth. She kept trying to offer to comp you the bill, but you weren't having it. You were more than content to watch the obese fox happily stuff her face with her thick tail swishing back and forth, despite the appendage being stuck between the seat and her titanic sized rear. Not to mention noticing every now and again as tiny bits of cheese, toppings, and tortilla chips would fall from her mouth and land on top of her oversized cleavage that was trying to spill out of her shirt. Perhaps it was your alcohol addled mind, but the thought of licking all that cheese off her massive, furry breasts sounded incredibly appealing. The sound of someone belching a little derailed your train of thought and pulled you back into reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, that hit the spot,\" Felicia said happily, licking her lips before taking a good sized swig of her beer then promptly belching once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said, her face turning red as her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the vixen's visible surprise, you simply chuckled and flashed her a smile. \"Why are you sorry? Nothing wrong with a healthy appeitie,\" you said gently while snatching a tortilla chip loaded with toppings from her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hefty fox sighed and leaned backwards in her seat, placing both hands on her bloated gut somberly. \"Yes there is, no one should eat this much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I disagree, I think it's great for someone to be so comfortable with eating in today's strict society. Especially with someone with a heart and body as lovely as yooooouuuuu....\" you trailed off awkwardly, your face swiftly turning pale at your accidental confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I mean....uhhh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww thank you, I think your cute too,\" she said happily, closing her eyes and tilting her head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave the large fox a goofy grin in return, but on the inside, your heart was pounding in your ears. It was becoming harder and harder to contain your growing excitement. Here you were, sitting in front of a beautiful behemoth of a vulpine with stunning eyes, a heart of gold, and with good taste in pop culture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been other love interests before, both human and anthro alike, but none seemed to have come close to being the one you desired. But here, sitting with Felicia, you couldn't help but drink in every last detail about her. And there was a LOT to drink. The way she brushed back her hair as she listened to you speak, the dimples on her fat face when she smiled, the way her tree trunk thick leg comfortably rested against your skinny one under the table, the small spot of nacho cheese and beef resting on the left side of her muzzle....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hang on a sec....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Felicia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" said the fox with a giggle, her green eyes twinkling with drunken mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a little...\" you said, pointing at your left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a little food on your cheek,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small chuckle escaped your lips as you watched the vixen drunkenly place a hand on the right side of her muzzle in confusion, the alcohol clearly had robbed her of all normal brain function. Raising up slightly in your seat, you leaned over the table with a napkin in hand to help the drunk fox out. What you did next, you did without control. You just meant to help the obese vixen, a simple little courtesy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust politely wipe the nacho cheese and meat off her cheek and clean her fur with the napkin. Instead, you drew close enough to her pudgy face to gently lick the nacho toppings off before giving her a gentle, loving kiss on the cheek. Below you could feel the fat fox suddenly grow tense in her seat in response. Her swishing tail instantly becoming rigid and halting in it's movement. You were just about to nervously pull back to gauge her reaction, (and desperately apologize if need be), when unexpectedly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Drawing back away from the startled obese vixen, you couldn't stop the storm cloud of regret building inside your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Christ, Felicia, I'm so.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get much farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a snap the vixen's big, flabby arms swung out towards your chest where she could grab onto your shirt with a shockingly ironclad grip. Allowing her to yank you down hard, causing your lips to crash into hers with a sense of urgency you had never experienced before with anyone else in your life. That first split second of contact felt strange and alien, her long pointed muzzle and nose was awkward to manage. But when she gently tilted her head, you were officially a goner. Electricity danced and sparked across your spine and the edges of your skull while puff's of hot air from Felicia's huffing nose sailed across your face. It didn't take long for you to allow her tongue entry into your mouth, and for yours into hers. The sensation leaving the two of you moaning breathlessly into the other's mouth. She tasted of cheese and beer yet strangely the feeling only served to drive you even further over the edge. You even couldn't resist dragging your tongue over the surface of her pointed teeth, while Felicia took to nipping and sucking your bottom lip with a noise that sounded to your ears like that of a tiny growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your lungs began to cry for air, thus you reluctantly pulled away once more to plop down in your seat. Whereas Felicia, in all her girth, plopped down hard to completely shake the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sorry,\" you said breathlessly, your mind now completely shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia smacked her lips in smug victory, clear evidence she had enjoyed her bold little move. \"Yummy,\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless. The alcohol was certainly beginning to rear it's ugly head, nothing made sense now. You didn't know what was safe and what wasn't anymore with this vixen. Even now she was sitting there contentedly eyes closed, tail swishing happily, elbow on the table top with her fat face resting in one hand. Seemingly unfazed by the brief, yet intense make out session you both shared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia...\" you began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" she replied dreamily, eyes still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if take you out to dinner sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got her attention, both of her emerald eyes were focused intently on you now. The vixen blinked twice in surprise. \"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you nodded firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head slightly, but even in your drunken state you could tell she only half meant it. \"No you don't. Why would you want a big, bloated, blubbery, awkward, plain looking vixen like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is EXACTLY why I want you. Because you're a big, bloated, blubbery, kind, beautiful vixen, who I would kill for a chance to be with,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she said shakily, her eyes swimming with what was certainly tears of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently took her hand in yours. \"Absolutely,\" you declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments Felicia mentally debated with herself over your request. Through the lust and alcohol, you knew how serious this probably was for her. It was clear she already had some reservations about her size, thus building up confidence and the belief that was someone was genuinely interested in her AS WELL as her body was probably unheard of for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment however, things suddenly changed. A hungry look began to grow in the vixen's eyes as she took to staring you down like a predator on the prowl for some delicious prey. And you felt you were top pick on the chef's menu..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or is this where you sweet talk me just to get a taste of my ass?\" she exclaimed, but there were no malice behind her words, only sly seduction. She even wiggled her blubbery rump for effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you...AND your ass,\" you huffed hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to lean forward, you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But tell me, Leo...\" she began huskily, her hand squeezing yours, \"There is still one problem we have to decide right here, right now,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised one eyebrow in confusion. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so close now, her lips mere centimeters away. She reached out with her tongue to lightly lick your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My place or yours?\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answered her question with a kiss. Choosing instead to savor the experience of kissing this orange furred whale as much as possible before pulling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My place. Eveyone will be gone by now. So, how about dinner sometime? Next week?\" you asked again, eyes heavy with longing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to...\" she whispered happily, cheeks once again turning as red as her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled warmly, nothing could ruin this moment....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last call for drinks!\" announced the barkeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were quickly broken free from lust's grasp to notice the clock was fast approaching one in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want anything else?\" you asked the still blushing vixen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia shook her head. \"As nice as that sounds, I don't think I'll be conscious for more than hour if I do,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm in the same boat,\" you said, rubbing your temples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great difficulty, Felicia began to slide her massive form out of the booth, only for her to promptly get stuck toward the end. Try as she might, the booth refused to release the grip it held on her blubbery stomach and ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit!\" she grumbled. \"I'm such a fat ass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but chuckle. \"A very hot fat ass to be exact, here, let me help you,\" you said, rising to your feet to offer the vixen a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she smiled gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith gentle tugging, and a good deal of wiggling and wrangling, the heavy vixen was freed from her seated prison, giving you the opportunity to appreciate her entire obese form in all it's glory rather than underneath a bar table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget this,\" you said, handing her the sci-fi novel politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia accepted the book gratefully before turning and lifting one massive leg to take a step, only for her to quickly stumble forward and nearly lose her balance. Thankfully you managed to catch her by grabbing her left arm to keep her steady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a gentleman,\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever and always,\" you answered before belching a tad, causing the vixen to giggle uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you headed for the door, there was no mistaking the feeling of Felicia's flabby arm gently wrapping around your waist as you half carried the waddling, obese vixen. The little intimate act giving you the confidence to place your right hand on her wide, jiggling hip to pull her closer. Which only lead Felicia to wrap her tail around your waist affectionately as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking up the tab, once you were outside....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A short wet fart exited her the massive ass while she leans away from you and soon giggles, followed by your chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have been the nachos and here's the encore!,\" she says, as she squints one eye and opens her mouth while leaning away from you again, clearly drunk, before three short but loud farts rip out of her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely the nachos, as the horrendous smell had cheese and grease in it, but you didn't care, as you were drunk, though you coughed from it while you laughed at it, but it could of been the lack of air. Eventually, you reach her house, despite her swerving a bit on the road, and get out of the vehicle to let her out. Getting stuck a bit, the fox soon pops herself out, her belly bumping into you onto the ground. We both burst into laughter before Felicia picks me up and carries me to her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking it open, she drunkenly shouts, \"I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps heading down the stair are heard and you see irony in Felicia's roommate. Bearing wide hips in jean shorts and wearing a shirt with the eco arrow cycle symbol, the roommate was a chicken anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia, you're later than normal! My meeting ended a couple of hours ago!\" She questions her roommate, before noticing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo here, Hennah there!\" The vixen hiccups, earning a scowl from the hen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Hannah, not Hennah\" She retorts, but Felicia pays her no mind before planting her mammoth butt onto the couch, you right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Met Leo at a bar and hit it off well!\" The fox explains, Hannah nodding her head as she follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems drunk to me,\" she says as you lay on the fat fox's blubbery gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back to me after yo met him somber, than say your piece,\" Felicia says, starting to get a bit irritated at her roommate's bluntness, while Hannah shrugs her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpending some time with you, Hannah asks you question about yourself, while you drunkenly answer to the best of ability, which is surprisingly good for a drunk. Meanwhile, Felicia became jealous as you spent more time with her roommate and soon, she leans towards you, her tail stiffening, before releasing a long fart. You explode in laughter after the fox's fart ended while Hannah stood there in shock and soon, the smell covered everything, making the chicken gag, you coughing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia, what the hell did you eat? This reeks! Smells like you eaten that artificial food I told you to stay from!\" She coughs, while her roommate giggles drunkenly, the beer finally hitting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Hennah! We both know you like it!\" The vixen replies, taking pride in her gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I like it! That's gross than a few of my ideas for saving the planet, that I'll admit!\" Hannah says in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Completely false, girl! I'll show it by taking you to the source!\" Felicia exclaims, getting up and waddling towards the chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't you dare! I told you never do that shit to me again!\" Hannah says, as her roommate finally corners her to a wall, her belly pinning the anthro to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch me!\" The vixen says, as she...</span></span></div></div>",

With the magical force of physics known as gravity, the chicken slowly, but surely slides down the fox's gullet, her legs kicking in the air. You're watching this in awe as you watch the spectacle and cheer Felicia on as she does her thing, blush appearing on her face, despite her drunk state. A loud gulp is heard and the fat vixen starts swallowing her prey whole, her throat bulging out. The anthro was clearly freaking out, but having her arms pinned to her side, she could struggle in vain as she's brought deeper into her roommate. Past her chest now, Felicia make smooth progress until she reaches her roommate's rump, proving to be troublesome. Taking several swallows with little to no decline, you actually get a bit worried, wondering if you're going to intervene, but Felicia eventually gulps down, past Hannah's bum and hips, leaving her legs left. Stuffing down the thick thighs into her maw, Felicia slurps down the legs until her toes slip past her lips and Felicia sigh in victory. About to applaud her, the bbw soon releases a massive belch that shakes everything in the house, including you, and girlishly giggles. Now taking your chances, you applaud her on her task and rub her belly affectingly. Her belly only grew by a small margin and most people wouldn't assume there's a person in there, if not for the big bulges appearing on the surface.<br>\r\n\"Bravo, bravo!\" You praise her, Felicia patting her gut.<br>\r\n\"Why, thank you, Leo, but give some love for my assistant, Hennah!\" She said, lifting a leg to rip a mad fart and slapping her gut, jostling the contents around.<br>\r\nHer stomach soon burst into a fit of movement before settling into a muffled 'Fuck you!' and a lack of motion.<br>\r\nSitting on the couch beside you, Felicia rubs her stomach, burping once in a while before asking you something that may have made you nervous if you weren't drunk at the moment.<br>\r\n\"Would you like to-hic- to join her? Hic! It's-it's completely safe! Hic-promise you, Leo!\"<br>\r\nLeaning towards you, the fat foxgirl opens her mouth to show you her slick, wet throat, staring black at you like a literally pink eye with no iris and a tongue sticking out.<br>\r\nYou (not really) think for a moment, deciding on your move.<br>\r\n\"I do this al-hic-l the time! Don't leave - Hic - urp! - Hennah alone in there, Leo!\" She whines like a little girl, her tummy rumbling a bit at the idea of more food coming its way.<br>\r\nWhat do you drunkenly decide, you drunk?</span></span></div></div>",

Hence, you had no alarm, thus you had to suffer a mad scramble of showering, dressing yourself, double check luggage, redress yourself (Pants go OVER your underwear), double check tickets and paperwork, and pray to god traffic was light as you hailed a pricey taxi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked whatever gods that did or did not exist as you finally made your way onto the station platform. To the left was your train, gleaming in polished stainless steel and clean windows. A small smile graced your lips as you envisioned the comfy first class seats you had booked. Pulling yourself through a crowd of meandering humans and anthro's, you could just make out the bulldog train conductor standing in the train's doorway. The gray furred, white mustached canine had just placed a hand to his mouth to shout out the departure call, when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOMPH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of en eye, your body collided with something with enough force to send you tumbling to the ground with the grace and poise of an avalanche. Causing you to lose your bags, coat, and your dignity in that order. Clenching your teeth in agony, you delicately rubbed the spot on the back of your head which was surely forming a thick bump now. Tearing you from your pain filled thoughts however, was the sound of a voice who seemed to be in as much pain as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh shit...who did I hit?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still in too much pain to open your eyes, but the voice sounded...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides the glorious gut just begging to be hugged and filled, you could see wide hips, thick thighs and blubbery all packed into ill-fitting sweatpants, and on the edge, barely visible were the sides of his over-sized  rump, filling the seat. Travelling upwards past his gut again, you find his flabby stomach capped by a rotund chest, further stretching his shirt further. Actually you were pretty sure those could make some ladies jealous...mmmm...

Seizing your chance, you silently slid from your seat and squeezed up against the obese wolf in his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...?\" he began to say, but was quickly silenced as he felt both of your hands slide up underneath his shirt.

His embarrassed squeak's became low throaty purrs, his tail falling into a steady joyful wagging. The color in his eyes turning a shade or two darker with desire.

You were dancing your way to the beat of a hard rock group when you encountered a rather heavy set, but deliciously curvy cow woman.

She really seemed to have taken an interest in you, judging by the way she wiggled her massive hips thighs and whipping her to the beat of the drums in your general direction.

You were never much of a drinker, a fact your friends were always keen to remind you of, and this little tumble of yours would only serve to remind you why you preferred soda to alcohol in the first place.  Besides, it wasn't all bad. At least you landed someplace that was so nice and soft and warm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch were yer goin you blind idiot!\" shouted a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes snapped open in terror. All at once the memories came flooding back, the beer, the rock concert, the beer, you drunkenly crashing into somebody, the BEER. As you quickly lifted your face up to see who was your unfortunate victim, you froze in place as your eyes connected with those of a very familiar face. Staring back at you with eyes as blue as the ocean was the same anthro cow woman you had danced with at the concert. She seemed to have remembered you as well, judging by the way her jaw slowly fell open and the look of shock in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you,\" she said with a quiet gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh,\" you replied dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the cow's facial expression turned alarmingly suggestive. \"Normally ah like a man who's a bit forward, but this might be a bit much darlin,\" she purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brows furrowed. \"Wha..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you realized with great horror your chin was resting dead center in the cow's valley of softness. Squishing both sides of your face were two, shapely, furry balls of flesh that were undoubtedly her breasts. The sudden surge of mortification you felt was enough to practically levitate you off the cow's body as you stammered out a panicked apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!!! Ma'am I'm so so so sorry!! I didn't mean anything!! I'm not like that, there's no way I would e-e-ver!!\" you sputtered pitifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly, the cow had a look of slight disappointment on her face as she picked herself back up and brushed the dirt off of her arms and legs. \"There's no need fer hysterics sugah, ah know ah'm not the prettiest gal in the barn but there's no need to go breakin mah feelings cause of it,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly rejected tone in the cow's voice gave you pause. \"No, no! I didn't mean that, I meant I'm sorry for knocking you over. I wasn't saying you were bad looking, you're actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you finally took a good look at the cow you had knocked over. She certainly was the same cow from the concert. She had the same caramel colored hair that flowed down to her shoulders, the same cream colored fur with caramel spots, and definitely the same stunning pair of ocean blue eyes that nearly glowed in the faint light of the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also certainly the same <i>shape</i> as the cow from the concert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContained in a pair of makeshift jean shorts that were stretched to the point of near bursting was an ass and a pair of hips that were nearly as wide as a pickup truck. An ass and a pair of hips that gave way to two, thick tree trunk like legs that looked powerful enough she could crush boulders with ease under her hooves. Above her wide waist line were two globular balls of flesh that were a pair of breasts squished into a tight, blue plaid shirt that rested atop a large, pudgy stomach that spread out far enough to spill over the front of her shorts. She even had a pair of thick, meaty arms and a slightly pudgy face to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...quite the opposite actually,\" you finished honestly, your eyes lingering on the cow's shapely body longer than you intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, apology accepted sugah,\" she cooed with a southern accent. \"Nice to hear you have a taste for gals like me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so busy trying not to drool on yourself you missed most of the cow's reply. \"Hear w-what?\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexy cow girl blinked as well. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow girl placed both of her hands on her wide hips as she gave you an annoyed look. \"Are you messin with me?\" she asked pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pounding in your head increased. \"I don't even know anymore,\" you moaned with a wince as you stepped off to the side, \"Christ my head hurts,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay sugah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, yeah I'm fine, don't worry about it,\" you assureed her with a wave of the hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Sugah? Ah'm over here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your increasing embarrassment, the sexy cow girl was right. Lifting your head up back up, you blinked n confusion at the sight of a brown, wooden electric utility pole.Trying to save face, you calmly spun round to face the shapely cow, who had one eyebrow raised and a smug smile on her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, I knew that,\" you said embarrassingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Few watts short of a fully lit bulb are ya?\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to feel insulted....problem was, you were still quite drunk. \"Hey now, I take great offense to that!\" you said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow girl's smile only grew wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I had a few beers and a few spills. And while yes, I did crash into you, I did apologize for it. But if you're just going to stand there, acting all 'Miss sexy, high and mighty bossy cow lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou punctuated your drunken statement by lightly booping the cow on the nose with your finger. An act that caused the cow's eyes to widen and a deep blush to form on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then I want nothing to do with you! I bid you ma'am, good day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling confident you told off the sexy cow adequately, you smoothly turned round, took one prideful step forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only to run face first into the same utility pole from before. Your head struck the pole with enough force to create a ringing in your ears as you tumbled backward onto the ground in a heap. The world had only stopped spinning long enough to see your vision filled by the sight of a large belly, two massive breasts, and the worried face of the now kneeling cow as she leaned over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my lord! Darlin can you hear me?! Are you hurt?!\" the cow asked urgently as she gently cupped your face with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name? I'm Tyrell,\" you asked without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow girl was caught off guard for a moment before rolling her eyes and huffing a little through her bovine nose. \"Ma always said ah picked the crazy ones,\" she muttered quietly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to your delight, the beautiful cow girl simply smiled down at you with twinkling eyes. \"Mah friends all call me Cass,\" she said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling brightly yourself, you slowly reached out a hand toward her face expecting a handshake.\"Glad to meet you Cass,\" you said with a goofy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring your outstretched hand, Cass reached down to grab under your armpits to lift you to your feet with ease, (cripes she was strong!). You were just about to thank her when she oh so NOT so casually snuck in a quick squeeze of your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let me take yah somewhere so we can get ya looked at,\" she said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes ma'am,\" you said with a flustered squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so surprised by the cow's kindness and sexual forwardness you made no effort to protest or resist as she took your hand into hers to drag you away, thereby giving you an excellent view of her tail and massive ass as her wide hips swayed from side to side with each step. There was no use in denying it, there was something about watching those giant butt cheeks jiggle in those tight jean shorts that elevated your pulse and sent your heart a-fluttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so absorbed in...\"admiring\" the cow's body you didn't notice she was taking you to a....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And since this school was lenient on attire for Anthro students and staff, she only donned a red sky blue hoodie, since even as an Anthro Kangaroo, she could easily hide her lower girl parts. The shirt was their so her breasts weren't bare for all to see, even if they were covered in fur. But that didn't stop them from being completely noticed. Her breasts were, from what you could see, bigger then your head. But they didn't look out of place on her. In fact, they fit her figure naturally. Now, it was rumored by some at the school that Anthro Kangaroo does <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">(Female Roos are known as does, and males are known as buck, like deer are.) </font> Also had a set of breasts in their pouches as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself blushing as you stair at Nancy's.

The white mouse is barely big enough to rest her arm over the lip of your glass.  She is very curvy for her size and wears a lite green two piece bikini, and poses with one hand on her hip to show off those curves.  She was smiling before but now that you actually noticed she broke into a full grin, and she exclaimed \u201cHi\u201d.  You noticed her front teeth were filled down, but still kept somewhat of that rodent buck tooth.  It was kinda cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u201d  You said back kinda shocked by her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me be straight with you\u201d.  She dropped her large smile and seductive pose.  Folding her hand in front of her.  \u201cI\u2019m quit a massive Exhibitionist, and have a thing for crawling into men's shorts and getting them off.  And I would like to do that to you, right here, right now.\u201d  Once again surprised you numbly give your approval.  \u201cGreat! Now just stay quiet and don\u2019t move\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking no one is looking the little white mouse jumped into your lap and crawled up the left leg of your trunks.  You had decided to take a drink like you were about to before the little mouse appeared.  That was a mistake.  You nearly choked has she immediately stuck her hands under your foreskin. It was immensely difficult to keep your legs still.  Even putting down your glass was a struggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a quick glance down past your ereader you saw the mouse really wasn't noticeable in your trunks but the end of her tail was sticking out the pant leg.  Has she gently peeled back your foreskin and gave your head a long lick, you involuntarily gave a moan.  A quick scan around showed that no one was paying attention to you.  You leaned back further in your chair and hid behind your e-reader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little mouse however didn't slow down.  She kept rubbing and liking over your rapidly expanding dick.  The way she rimmed your urethra with her tongue was really driving you wild.  It seems she was caught off guard by just how big your dick grew.  Suddenly she was no longer just rimming your opening.  Your dick had expanded over the tip of her snout.  The sensation was too much.  You bit your lip in a futile attempt to stay quit, and your whole body was shaking.  The white mouse seemed to have caught onto your enjoyment.  Instead of pulling out she pushed deeper.  Now with her entire snout in your dick and licking your inner walls, it was difficult to think at all.  But something did come to mind.  A rather twisted desire of your own you have only gotten to indulge a few times before.  If you acted quickly it would be so easy to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She actually pushed back in herself!  Likely not guessing your true intentions.  With the gentle urging of your finger she slowly slid her entire head into your slit.  Your breathing was growing heavy, and ragged.  Her willingness was about to come to an end though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached down further, hooking two fingers around her waist, and pushed.  You could feel her squeak has her shoulders slipped in.  She was yelling.  It was impossible to hear her but the vibrations down your length was pleasant.  A few more soft pushes shoved a couple more inches of her into your dick, before you pulled your hand away.  You couldn't be seen fondling yourself for too long.  Although the pleasure was unreal right now the rush was keeping you more lucid than before.  A quick look around showed you hadn't gained any attention yet.  Another peek past your e-reader revealed a problem.  The little mouse's kicking legs were quite noticeable in the leg of your trunks. You raised your right knee.  That pulled your trunks tight and slightly away from the mouse.  Now her kicks were less noticeable.  Although the very top of her tail was still wiping about outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a couple of bikini clad vixens walked by.  You gave them a large smile and a nod.  They looked at you with disgust and hurried past.  The fear that they may of noticed sent ice through your blood.  But that didn't don't seem the case has they rushed over to a beefy guy not too far past.  With a sigh you settled back for the Long haul.  It was going to take a while for your dick to suck in it's unwilling meal on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you kept your reader up you weren't reading.  The sensations of your dick slowly working down the mouse was the only thing on your mind.  The feel of her breasts finally pooping in, forcing her forearms straight against her sides for consumption with the power of your dick alone, every word, every wiggle she made was orgasmic.  For the next half hour you laid there completely blissed out.  Then you realised she wasn't going any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow consumed up to her hips you couldn't go any further.  She had spread her legs, and your dick didn't have the strength to force them straight like a it did her arms.  She also wasn't moving or screaming right now, granting you very little pleasure at all.  Well now you had to do something.  Making sure the coast was clear, you quickly reached down into your pants.  She protested has you grabbed her legs, but you acted too fast, and shoved her in all the way to the ankles.  It was difficult not to let out a Yelp of pain. You knew it would hurt but, didn't think it would be that much.  The sphincter into your balls was especially sore after being so roughly violated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has been fun, but you can have more fun in privet, so you get up and head inside.  After everything that\u2019s happened your dick has gone soft.  The little mouse begins to struggle again, actually working herself out somewhat.  However her movements stimulate your dick causing it to stiffen again.  She would probably been better of not moving.  Though by the time you got back to your room she had managed to work herself out back to the hips.  Of course that didn\u2019t matter has the moment you shut your door behind you, you took off your  trunks, and your dick stood straight up halting all her further progress.  Her angry screams sent a shiver down your spine.  Taking a moment to sit on the bed you ran one finger up and down her soft legs, the other over the bulges she makes in your dick.  Savoring the moment of finally getting to touch her even if she angrily kicked at your finger, but you\u2019ve waited long enough.  You pressed her deeper.  Some part of you really wanted to savor this, but a bigger part just wanted her inside already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strength she still fought with was impressive given how long it has been.  Her struggles did nothing to slow you down however, and she continued to sink deeper.  Soon her head once more passed through your sphincter into your balls.  It was much easier to play with her body though the thin skin of your scrotum then your dick.  You stopped pushing her in when just her feet and tail where outside.  Taking this final moment to toy with your meal, until she pulled herself.  It was very surprising.  You watched stunned has she pulled her legs and tail in, bringing herself completely inside your scrotum.  Her plan was revealed has she now tried to reach back through your sphincter.  Being able to fit no more than a single arm back through she will have no more success than she did trying to push herself back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incredible sensation of her struggling, after everything was just too much.  You begin to fap quickly reaching climax, keeping just enough sense to prevent her escape.  Several splatters of your own cum land on your chest.  You laid on your back exhausted.  The feeling of the little mouse in your dick caught your attention.  She was trying to escape again, but few shakes of your limp dick, slid her back firmly in your balls.  You got up and quickly washed yourself in the shower.  It was difficult to go more than a minute without fondling your little mouse.  She seems to of finally exhausted herself.  Soon enough you do get yourself cleaned, dressed and on your way back down to the pool.  Your seat was still open so you get comfortable again.  Close to the onset of evening you are again approached by someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were all wearing bikinis.  \u201cSir\u201d the brown mouse called your attention back to her \u201cwe haven't seen our friend in a while, and last we knew she was coming over to talk with you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir friend must be the white mouse currently sealed in your balls.  Although the brown and striped mouse don't show anything the black mouses averted eyes and figuring leads you to suspect they knew what their friend was going to ask you about.  That gave you an idea.  \u201cWhy yes I do believe your friend did come speak with me\u201d you said in the most charming voice you could.  The little white mouse seemed to have heard you.  \u201cAnd well after our fun out here we went up to our room to continue\u201d this was a big risk having no idea what the little mouse would normally do \u201clittle gal tukkerd herself out so I let her rest while I came back out here to get some more sun.\u201d The little white mouse definitely heard what you were saying has she was now screaming and struggling again in your balls.  Though even you couldn't hear her only feel it.  You crossed your legs squeezing her between your thighs to silence her just in case.  The three mice also seem to buy your story so you press on.  \u201cIf you want I can take you three up to my room to see her\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would appreciate that sir\u201d.  Not only did they buy it they agreed to let you carry them up there since this place wasn't well suited for micros.  Once up to your room you acted quickly.  Before the three could react you marched into the bathroom, and dump them all in the shower before closing the door after you.  With them now firmly trapped you casually turned the shower on while they angrily yelled up at you.  \u201cBut I brought you here to see your friend.\u201d You then dropped your trunks, the little white mouse clearly visible inside your scrotum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all gasped at the sight.  The striped one stepped forward \u201cyou better let her out right now!\u201d She stood up to you shaking her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh but that would be so rude of me\u201d you said dropping to your knees then grabbing the striped one.  \u201cI mean if I did that who would keep her company after I locked you three in there\u201d.  The striped one really started to struggle now.  The other two rushed behind you to the door but you knew they had no chance of opening it.  You brought the striped one up to your face \u201cand screen all you want, no one will hear you over the water.  Then you began to stuff her legs into your dick.  You had so much pre already leaving she sank up to her waist almost instantly.  Then you remembered her red bikini but not too late to remove it before sucking her down this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now you shoved her down to the elbows then spun around, letting the other two watch has you sucked her in.  She was helpless now has your dick rapidly pulled her in on it's own, her mad thrashing only edging her deeper.  It was nearly has entertaining to watch the expression of the other two.  Finally the snout of the striped one slipped below sealing her entirely in your flesh.  Now having lost your patience you forced her deeper with thumb and forefinger, hastening her trip to your balls.  The two within thrashed and became entangled together has you turned your attention on the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown one tried to shield the black one behind her.  A pitiful gesture has she couldn't even protect herself.  She barely resisted has you picked her up and removed her bikini.  Without finesse you shoved her head into your dick.  You just wanted them inside you so bad.  With one hand you shoved her deeper with the other you felt over the bulges she made in your shaft.  Soon she too was sealed within your scrotum.  Your eyes fell on the last black mouse shivering between your legs.  Something about her stirred up something slightly more gentle in you.  You gently scooped her up and brought her to your face.  \u201ctheir is nothing to be afraid of, my scrotum is not a.bad place to live, and no harm will come to you inside.  Now why don't you take off your clothes and join your friends\u201d?  She never once looked at you but nodded, and began you strip.  She was slow and hesitant, but eventually she was naked, sitting on your hand.  You set her on the floor before you, and pushed the head of your dick down toward her silently instructing her to crawl in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared for a few moments before walking up and running her hands over your glands.  Then she slowly eased one hand into you.  She played with your pre between her fingers before a tug from your impatient dick tolled her to get on with it.  Easing her other arm inside, you groaned in pleasure. When both arms were almost fully consumed she didn't hesitate to take a big breath and push her head in.  Soon after her breasts slipped in she was no longer able to reach the floor to push herself deeper, so you let go of your dick letting rise vertical and allowing gravity to help her.  She adapted and basically began to swim down your dick on your own.  Forcing the little mouse down your shaft had been incredibly fun, but there's something about forcing one to slip in themselves that was so much better.  You refrained from touching yourself at all while she was going down, and it was taking all you had not to do that.  It was some relief when she finally did reach your balls.  With all four of them sealed inside they were struggling less has well.  Your dick was still painfully hard and you spent several minutes in the shower, getting your sense back while refusing to touch yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your mind was finally clear enough you turned the shower off, and stumbled out.  The weight between your legs just felt so damn good, and your sack bumping back and forth between your thighs sent tingles up your spine.  Flopping onto the bed you got out your phone to distract yourself.  Roughly two hours later you were still rock hard, but it was finally time.  Your masterbating really set the mice going again as they bounced around your balls.  It was near moments before you climaxed spraying cum onto your chest again.  This time even though you hadn't held onto your dick none of the mice left your scrotum even an inch.  \u201cThe sphincter has sealed behind you\u201d you gloated over your prey \u201cyour locked in there, and it's impossible to escape no matter how much you struggle or no matter how hard I climax you will remain in my balls until I unlock it.\u201d You possessively rubbed over your prisoners, earning a punch from one of them.  You chuckle.  Some green in your cum caught your attention.  It's the white ones bikini.  Glad that made it out, and it reminds you.  You head back into the.shower to clean up and collect their discarded bikinis.  Now what to do with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The little white mouse then withdrew her muzzle and gave a final French kiss to your dick.  She then crawled under your dick onto your scrotum.  She played with your balls for a bit, sloshing them back and forth massaging them, and just feeling their weight.  When she tired of that she shifted around, laying herself out under neight your dick.  With amazingly skilled hands and feet she rubbed over your dick.  It felt amazing, and you had to bite your lip not to moan.  Then she wrapped her arms around your shaft and hugged her upper body to it.  You did your best not to squirm has she rubbed her upper body over your shaft, nuzzling your tip, and rubbing her hands in underneath your foreskin.  Now she lifted one leg up over your dick now completely hanging from your shaft.  The other leg was on your thigh and began to push herself up your shaft, and let gravity pull her back down, while finding her hips on your shaft.  You couldn't control your heavy breathing now has she pumped up and down on your shaft.  The world around you faded away has she pumped faster and faster, it's a good thing you're pretty quiet.  Finally you do reach climax.  The little white mouse lifted herself up to ensure your cum splattered over her chest first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid there in bliss, reader forgotten on your abdomen.  The feeling of movement in your trunks brought you back to reality.  A couple wet oats to your thigh was probably the mouse's single she was ready for you to return to your room.  You got up and headed inside.  The fluid slowly crawling down your thigh pushed you to hurry.  The little mouse had no trouble holding onto them mess interior of your trunks has you walked.  Infact she entertained herself by tickling your balls with her tail while you walked.  You managed to get back to your room without drawing any attention.  When there you walked to the sink and pulled your waist bad away slightly.  The mouse needed no prompting to climb out and onto the counter rubbing against your semi hard dick on the way out.  You seat a small stream of warm to pour out of the faucet for the mouse before stepping into the shower to clean yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen finished cashing your cum off yourself and your trunks you hung them from the shower head to dry and stept out.  The mouse was benst over under the stream cleaning her ears, and possibly not so consequently waving her ass in your direction.  Hearing the shower door open she looked back and smiled seeing you.  \u201cGlad to see someone isn\u2019t very bashful\u201d.  She turns the faucet off herself shaking her hips in the process.  \u201cNow their is no reason to let the fun end so soon, so since you have done a massive favour for me can I do one for you?\u201d  Immediately you thought of what you wanted to do before, to stuff her down your cock.  If she agreed to it then nothing's wrong, but what if she was repulsed by it?  The opportunity for anything more with her could be shut forever.  What do you say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She doesn't respond right away, in fact she doesn't react at all.  She just sat their staring up at you with her feet killing over the edge of the counter.  \u201cWhen I took a liking to big folk has my mother called you, she kept warning me that eventually one of them was going to gobble me down\u201d she smiled and looked down.  \u201cDidn't realize their dick would hunger for me too\u201d she gave a brief laugh.  \u201cSince your asking I trust it's safe\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes absolutely safe\u201d you assure her \u201cI have done this a few times before\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks it over a bit.  Tilting her head back and forth, eyes flicking back and forth between your eyes and your dick.  Just the thought that she might say yes was getting your dick hard again.  \u201cAlright let's do it\u201d she stands and begins to stretch \u201cjust know I have to meet up with my friends in a few hours\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's okay I can't keep you in more than a few hours anyway\u201d.  When she asked why you continued.  \u201cWell there's.this sphincter in-between the dick and the sack that is very easy to push through going in\u201d the white mouse made a noise of comprehension has she began strip.  \u201cBut from the sack do to lack of a solid base it's not possible to force it open\u201d.  You don't know how much the little mouse was actually paying attention has she did her best to put on a show removing so little.  \u201cS, so it takes about two hours for the schinter to tighten back up after something's been through it.  This is called being locked.  Once locked there is no way to get anything out of the scrotum other than to shove something else down and unlock it, and I didn't bring any keys with me on this trip\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little mouse really doesn't seem like she cared about anything you just said.  Now naked she become you to come closer.  \u201cEnough talk I see we are both getting worked up so let's just get straight to it\u201d.  You stepped forward, delivering your dick straight into her open arms.  She hugged your dick to her chest pre starting to run over her, has she stroked over your dick before lifting it up to her face and kissing.  Lips locked with your urethra she pushed and sucked sticking her tongue down your dick. No longer needing to hold yourself back you leaned over the counter and moaned.  The mouse watched you the whole time, and giggled when she finally let go.  \u201cEnough for play\u201d.  Suddenly she lifted a leg and stuck it into your urethra to the knee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a started crying you jerked back nearly pulling her off the counter.  \u201cEasy, it\u2019s very sensitive\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww poor baby\u201d she half mocked you.  She beckoned your arm closer, so you obliged and she used your hand to lift herself.  Inserting her second leg went much slower, not just because she was being more gentle, but also because it was much tighter.  Once both legs were into the knee she let go of your hand and pulled herself in up to the hips has if she was pulling on a dress.  She giggled looking at herself nearly half consumed by your dick.  Has she was looking over her shoulder at the bulges she made on the underside of your dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing impatient you flexed your dick.  She let out a little eep has she was dragged deeper, before giving you a scowling look, and getting back to it.  It was clear she wanted to remain in charge, even though she was feeding herself to your dick.  She proceeded to work herself deeper by shifting her hips back and forth, holding her hands above her head has if dancing. Grounding again you had to grab the counter to keep yourself under control.  You could see the amusement in her eyes has she stared up at you, ginormis smile plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of your dick came up underneath her breasts and began to push them up.  The little mouse decided to okay with her breasts.  She groped and squeezed them, making a few half hearted attempts to force them inside.  It probably wasn't the most efficient way but damn if it wasn't a show.  When she started to pinch her nipples however you felt she had got a little too far off course.  You flexed again.  Although you didn't manage to drag her any deeper, the massive rise and fall of your dick in the process did remainder of what she was doing.  No matter how much she grumbled about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her breasts now past the lip there was little that could be done to slow her descent.  Has your dick started to close in around her head she said \u201cby the way my name is Evalin\u201d and then she was gone.  Nothing but her arms remain has she was rapidly consumed.  You snerred.  Grabbing her hands you stopped her descent.  She aqurimed has best she could in the tight passage of your dick, legs already splashing around in your balls.  You were sick of her arrogant and cock sure arritude. You may have played her game before, but now she was nothing more than a bulge in your dick.  Now she played your game.  With long slow motions your plunged her in and out of your dick, but never letting even the tip of her snout break free again.  Your other hand was firmly clasped around her form, squeezing her even tighter has she slipped through.  She writhed and squirmed to the best of her ability, hands clutching at your thumb, but it was your time to have fun now.  Unfortunately you couldn't last long.  Very little cum made it round the mouse to dribble over her hands and onto the floor.  You let go of her hands and she effortlessly plopped down into your sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was exhausting.  It took everything you had to make it to the bed before collapsing, cupping your balls to try and ease the ride for your little passenger.  Once you got your breath back you noticed your little mouse wasn't moving.  Gently with one finger you pokked at what had to be her head.  It was a great relief when her hand touched your finger through your flesh, and she then gave you a couple reassuring pats.  You patted your sake back laying on the bed.  Your little passenger did similar reclining at the bottom of your sack.  \u201cEvalin uhh.  You might be worth keeping round\u201d.  Being to exhausted to stay awake you grabbed your phone and set an alarm to go off in an hour and a half.  Plenty of time to get her out before it's too late.  With that you quickly feel asleep, to be awakened by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was obviously tall, and just as obviously fat, which was only further emphasized due to her height spreading her weight out. Her book had to be practically propped atop her breasts due to the fact they were so large that most of her view below them was bound to be blocked; there were four of them as well, as was common to about half of the bovine anthros, though these were particularly large. Even though those mounds ate up most of her torso, you could just make out the plush belly hiding beneath. Meanwhile down below, her legs were crossed, emphasizing the soft thickness that gave her a soft seat even on the hard soil beneath the grand old tree. The clothes she wore were somewhat tight and mildly revealing, giving you the feeling that she took some pride in her softened body, rather than trying to hide it away beneath much more conservative and baggy clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were looking her way for so long that you nearly tripped and slammed to the ground. Only just managing to catch yourself, you cast a quick glance around, but were relieved to see that no one gave any obvious sign that they had seen you virtually starring at the other woman, nor the face-plant that almost resulted from the distraction. You stood there to recover a bit, with your hands on your knees and feeling the drops of sweat trickle along your body. To everyone else, you just looked like someone recovering after a spot of exercise, enjoying the first little trace of autumn\u2019s coolness breaking the iron grip of summer than held the city, the same as many other people. Inside though, you were experiencing one of the most extreme cases of butterflies in your stomach that you ever had, and felt an irresistible compulsion to go talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting your breath back \u2013 at least partially \u2013 you stood up as tall as you could, before ambling over to her. As you started to get closer, you saw more details, like the silky black-and-white spotted fur across her body that peaked from her clothing, and the black hair tied back in a braid extending nearly to her round butt; the wavy length was so dark that it almost looked blue. Looking upon the thick locks, you felt a sudden desire to run your hands through her hair, and grab a hold of the twin curving horns sprouting from the sides of her head, feel those luscious mounds pressed against you, and\u2026You shook your head to clear away that thought, you could feel your already flushed cheeks growing warmer, as well as a matching surge of heat further down as that little fantasy just started to form.</span></div></div>",

Judging from how fast she would flip to the next page, she must have been quite a quick reader or really liking the book. Now that you were much closer, the sheer size of her breasts made your heart flutter again. You actually had to pause for a moment to recover before taking the last few steps towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven standing over her, she didn\u2019t seem to be at all aware of you. Despite all of the other smells wafting through the air, you now noticed a new light floral scent that seemed to be coming off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit longer of loitering around in the hopes that she would notice you, you cleared your throat just loud enough that you hoped she would hear you. Turns out you were correct, but she had to have been quite engrossed in her book because she jumped from shock. This sent a wave of motion rippling through her fleshy frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness, you scared me,\u201d she said after recovering, looking up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was silky and there was a mix of accents that you couldn\u2019t quite place. It didn\u2019t even make her hard to understand at all, it just added an exotic sounding edge to her words.

Keeping a finger tucked inside, she closed the book up and started to move it down beside her. As she did so, you happened to catch a glimpse of a small portion of the cover, though most of it was still covered by her hand. It was the author\u2019s name that happened to really draw your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing what you were looking at, she asked, \u201cOh, are you familiar with this book?\u201d while moving her hand to give you a better view of the cover.</span></div></div>",

There was a delicious ripple to Stephanie\u2019s soft form as she walked, one that was extremely noticeable in the heavy breasts that pulled the negligee taut. Her hips and rump were not to be outdone though, causing the lower hem to flare wide around their combined girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie looked down at her soon to be lover, a blush still coloring her cheeks as she swallowed heavily. Rose reached up and traced a finger up along the curves that graced the other, lingering a bit longer as she came to the side of the dragoness\u2019s breasts. Rose eventually continued the journey the last little distance so that she could reach behind Stephanie\u2019s head. With a tender care, she pulled the dragoness towards her. The negligee stayed on for perhaps a few seconds longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lips met as Rose ran her hands through Stephanie\u2019s hair.

The woods were absolutely beautiful all year round, and the hiking trails were just long and difficult enough to be a great way to stay in shape. Unfortunately, nobody else seems to share your enthusiasm. As the city grows more and more bustling and modernized, nobody is interested in the forest anymore. You hardly ever run into anyone hiking the trails, and you can never convince your friends to accompany you on your treks. The solitude can be nice, of course, but sometimes you\u2019d appreciate having someone to talk to. Thus, you joined a weekend hiking meetup club online in the hopes of finding other people who just want to relax and enjoy nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re standing in the parking lot at the entrance to the trails, and as you sort through your wallet to pay for parking, your heart sinks when you realize there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone else around. You had shown up a few minutes late\u2026 could they have already started without you? Eventually, though, you spot a bear woman standing next to her car, apparently doing warm up stretches. You think you recognize her as one of the people who said they\u2019d be coming, though you didn\u2019t know why she was alone. Didn\u2019t half a dozen people say they\u2019d be coming? Still, you tentatively approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear was sporting an incredibly, one could say, <i>robust</i> figure. She was an odd mix of pudgy and athletic; she had the toned, muscular arms and legs of a bodybuilder, and yet, she still had wide bulky hips, and a big round belly she proudly showed off beneath her crop top. She was so burly, she could easily be mistaken for a man if it wasn\u2019t for her huge breasts which her sports bra could barely contain. Combined with the fact that she was solid 2 feet taller than you, and she was well and truly an imposing figure. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou\u2019re here for the meetup, right?\u201d</span> She smiled widely when she sees you walk up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cY-yeah, sorry I\u2019m late,\u201d</span> you say, a bit confused as to why there aren\u2019t more people here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I was just worried that I might have to go it alone again,\u201d</span> she said. She seemed sort of excited just to see you. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cLast time I came to one of these things, literally nobody else showed up.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d</span> you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYeah. I guess it didn\u2019t help that it was in february. By then, people are already giving up on their new year\u2019s resolutions,\u201d</span> she said, bitterly. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cFolks just don\u2019t appreciate the great outdoors, anymore. They just get addicted to the hustle and bustle of the city. The woods are too\u2026 <i>quiet</i> for them.\u201d</span> She suddenly looks a little embarrassed. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh! Look at me, flapping my gums. Sorry about that. Let\u2019s get down to brass tacks - my name\u2019s Suanne,\u201d</span> she said, offering her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cVincent. Nice to meet you,\u201d</span> you said, reaching out to shake her hand. Once again, you were impressed by her size; her hand was almost twice as large as yours, and her powerful grip showed off her incredible strength. By the time the handshake concluded, your shoulder was sore. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cYou know these trails?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cLike the back of my hand. I\u2019ve been coming here since I moved to this town,\u201d</span> she grinned. You decided to grab a map, although Suanne apparently didn\u2019t need one. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI\u2019m feeling the Hollow Rock Falls trail today. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful at this time of year.\u201d</span> That trail\u2019s about five miles long, up and down the various slopes of the forest. A proper workout, for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cSounds good,\u201d</span> you nod, but stand in place, confused, when the bear starts walking towards the trail. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cHey, shouldn\u2019t we wait for everybody else?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns, turning to you. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTrust me, hun, they\u2019re not coming. They\u2019re probably all lounging around on their sofas right now,\u201d</span> she says. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSome people just want to convince themselves they\u2019re the outdoorsy type, but when it actually comes down to, y\u2019know, <i>going outside</i>, they just come up with excuse after excuse\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit taken aback by her cynicism, but you figure she probably has a lot more experience with this than you do. \u201cUh\u2026 alright,\u201d you said, and you hesitantly followed the bear as the two of you started down the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in silence for a while. Even though you were walking relatively briskly, with her long stride, you knew the tall woman could easily outpace you\u2026 but she seemed to intentionally walk slowly, so the two of you were side-by-side. Eventually, she spoke up. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSo, let's get this out of the way,\u201d</span> she said. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTell me; do you mind me flapping my gums during our trek? I like to chit-chat while hiking, but if you just want to listen to the birds, I can totally shut up.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine. I mean, chatting is sorta the point of the meet up, right?\u201d</span> You reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cGuess so,\u201d</span> she shrugged. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSo, \u2018Vincent\u2019. How long have you been living in Perlshaw?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cThree years,\u201d</span> you reply. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cMoved here from Myrefall.\u201d</span> Myrefall is the town with the the highest population of anthros of any town in the state. A charming town, to be sure, but the longer you lived there, the more it seemed like a dead end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cNo shit? Me too,\u201d</span> she nodded, surprised. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201c<i>Ugh!</i> I miss it. Such a beautiful town. You didn\u2019t happen to go to Rutherford, did you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cNope. Granite Hills.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAh. My little sister went there,\u201d</span> she said. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cShe still lives over in Myrefall, actually. She sends me photos from around town all the time, and it makes me <i>sooo</i> jealous!\u201d</span> Her belly heaves as she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cHm,\u201d</span> you mumble, thoughtfully. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cSo\u2026 are you not liking it in Perlshaw?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUm. I mean, I don\u2019t hate it here, but it wouldn\u2019t have been my first choice. Just doesn\u2019t feel like home, you know?\u201d</span> She said. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI don\u2019t dislike humans, of course, but I don\u2019t really seem to fit in with them. They always seem a tad nervous around big gals like me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cHuh. Well, I get along pretty well with humans, I guess. Pretty much all my friends are humans, at this point,\u201d</span> you reply, <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cbut it can get annoying to always feel like the odd one out, just cause I\u2019m a fox. I\u2019m usually their only anthro friend, so they always treat me like I\u2019m some kind of novelty, you know?\u201d</span> The dating pool was also quite limited, too, though you opted not to mention that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOooh! I know <i>exactly</i> what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour or so, your hike continued on in much the same way, the two of you making small talk and learning a bit about eachother while you both enjoyed the same outdoors. As the two of you became more familiar, you couldn\u2019t help but notice Suanne\u2019s stories slowly getting a little more raunchy. And there was one \u2018topic\u2019 in particular that always seemed to come up:</span></div></div>",

                "... happy story",
                "... sad story"
            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The stories she told seemed to all involve food somehow. Additionally, during her stories, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for her to go off on a long tangent describing what she ate that day, in excruciating detail. You knew grizzly bears are said to be obsessed with food, but you always figured that was just a stereotype. At one point, after a full minute of her describing the juicy taste of some hot dogs she had at a barbecue, you interrupted her. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cYou really like hotdogs, huh?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019ll have you know I was the national hot dog eating champion of 2015.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201c... the what?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou know what an eating contest is?\u201d</span> You nod. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell, a few years back, your\u2019s truly won the heavyweight hot dog eating national championship! And my competitor in the finals was a hippopotamus, too, so I really had to give it my all. To win, I ended up having to eat <i>hundreds</i> of hotdogs in ten minutes, buns and all.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cJeez! Hundreds?\u201d</span> You almost gasped in disbelief. After all, she wasn\u2019t even that overweight. She had a fair share of blubber on her, but overall, she was pretty fit. Then again, she was pretty large, at a little less than 8 feet tall. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI just shoved, like, a dozen of them in my mouth at a time and swallowed them. After two hundred or so, I already felt like I was about to pop. But the way that smug hippo gloated\u2026 I just knew I couldn\u2019t let her win! So I just kept eating faster, and faster...\u201d</span> She excitedly recalled the story. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhen I heard them ring the bell, it was like I snapped out of a trance. I looked down, and my belly was like\u2026 this big!\u201d</span> She hovers her hands a solid 8 inches or so over her gut, and you shiver as you imagine what her round belly must\u2019ve looked like stretched out so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cWow. Were you, like... okay?\u201d</span> You raise a brow. That just couldn\u2019t be healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, yeah. I just had to nap all weekend, and I was right as rain,\u201d</span> she nods. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI didn\u2019t even gain much weight! I\u2019m a carnivore, you know, so I\u2019ve got a pretty powerful metabolism. To maintain this size, for example, I need to eat at least, like, 20,000 calories a day.\u201d</span> You nod, thoughtfully. For some strange reason, you were fascinated by the bear describing all the food she eats. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIt gets especially bad during the fall. Like, even though I don\u2019t hibernate, I still feel the urge to eat as much as I can, you know? It\u2019s, like, primitive.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cHow do you afford all that?\u201d</span> You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIt\u2019s not that expensive to buy meat in bulk,\u201d</span> she laughs. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI mean, if you think I eat a lot, you should read up on how much elephants eat. Or whales!\u201d</span> She starts rambling something about elephants, but at this point, you were hardly listening. For some reason, you were feeling a little\u2026 \u2018excited\u2019. You didn\u2019t know if it was just because this was the first anthro woman you\u2019ve talked to in months or what, but more and more, you\u2019re catching yourself staring at the bear woman\u2019s beautiful body. But you weren\u2019t ogling her sizeable chest or round hips; for some reason, you were more interested in her belly. You\u2019ve never really been in to larger woman, but for some reason, she was suddenly striking you as gorgeous. Of course, to avoid looking like a total creep, you kept this to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, hey, here\u2019s a funny story. So my sister dabbles in gardening, and she wanted to go to a harvest festival a couple weeks ago to show off some of her veggies. And I came too, cause, like, free food, right?\u201d</span> She says as she walks along. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cShe was so excited for the festival, but there was one rabbit guy that was just ruining it for her. You see, apparently, if left alone, watermelons just never stop growing. Just get bigger and bigger till they die. So this guy had this crazy, huge, one hundred pound watermelon, and he treated that damn thing like it was his child. It was, like, the thing he was most proud of on Earth.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cReally? A watermelon?\u201d</span> You chuckle, raising a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI know, right? Anyway, he was showing it off to everyone, as if he was hot shit just cause he watered a fruit for a while. I could tolerate that\u2026 but then he started badmouthing everyone else. Almost made my sister cry when she called her zucchinis too small,\u201d</span> she explains. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAt that point, I was seeing red, right? So before I even knew what I was doing, I grabbed that damn watermelon straight out of his hands, and swallowed it whole!\u201d</span> She starts laughing uproariously at the memory, while you stare at her, uncertain whether or not she was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cYou <i>swallowed</i> it?\u201d</span> You asked. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cLike, the whole thing?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYup! All in one gulp,\u201d</span> she smiles. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThat dude absolutely freaked out, cause God forbid anyone harm his precious watermelon. He even tried to reach down my throat and grab it! Which, needless to say, got him kicked out by security.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cHeh! That\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201d</span> You chuckle nervously. You don\u2019t know why the thought of the bear swallowing such a huge meal whole was exciting to you, nor the thought of a rabbit reaching his arms down her cavernous throat. You really didn\u2019t know what you were feeling right now, but for some reason, there was a question you just had to ask. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cCould you have swallowed him, too?\u201d</span> You ask, making it sound like you were joking, although you were genuinely morbidly curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, yeah, easily,\u201d</span> she nods nonchalantly, as if that was the most normal thing in the world. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cIt was almost hard not to, with the way he was practically crawling down my throat.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cO-oh\u2026\u201d</span> You said, your heart sinking in your chest. Was she really capable of swallowing entire people? Why the hell did that excite you so much? You wanted to drop the subject completely\u2026 but there was something you just had to know. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cYeah, well\u2026 he\u2019s a rabbit. They\u2019re pretty bite sized, I guess,\u201d</span> you say, trying to sound natural. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cI mean, you wouldn\u2019t be able to swallow <i>me</i>, right?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as she given you a big, toothy grin, her lips spreading to show her sharp, white fangs. You only realize now just how huge her mouth is. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell, that depends, hun. Would you want me to?\u201d</span> She starts laughing at the look on your face, giving you a clear view down her dark throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to snap out of your trance. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cUhh! W-well, I mean, uh, ah\u2026 n-no! Of course not!\u201d</span> You stutter assertively, swiftly walking ahead of her to hide the growing tent in your pants. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cNever in a million years! W-why would you even ask?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face softens down to a warm smile. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cRelax! I\u2019m just messing with ya,\u201d</span> she chuckled, giving you a light, playful punch in the arm. You took a deep breath, trying to calm down and wipe that conversation from your mind. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cNow, enough of me yammering on. Why don\u2019t you tell me about yourself? You\u2019ve been quiet this whole walk.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving cooled down a bit, you sigh and turn back to her. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUh...\u201d</span> She asks. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell, what brought you to Perlshaw?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story of how you came here was quite a...</span></div></div>",

Going through the reams of paperwork before you was proving about as thrilling as watching a competition between paint drying and grass growing. The rampant heat wasn\u2019t helping matters either; you had the front door open to let in the slight breeze to the front of the store, but that did little to cool you in the cramped office-cum-storage room at the back. You had come back here to get away from the constant cacophony of a busy city day \u2013 vehicles grumbling, people shouting, numerous songs pouring from all directions \u2013 but you were starting to think that may have not been such a great idea; at least out there, the noise might have kept you awake. Blinking your eyes several times, you tried to focus on the order sheet in front of you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just started to reach for your pen when you had to stop and adjust your shirt. You thought you had struck a compromise between comfort and professionalism, but now you were thinking that you might have swung a bit too far from the comfort end anyways. The garment clung to your body due to the heat, which only further added to your discomfort. The sticking was especially prevalent around your bust, but considering how many of your tops were already tight around your weighty breasts, it wasn\u2019t too surprising. In the shadow of your breasts though, your belly wasn\u2019t spared either, but that may have had more to do with how it was more than bit doughy now. In truth, your weight had been steadily creeping up ever since even before you took over Alexander\u2019s Literary Emporium from the previous owner and your former boss, Bravon Alexander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started working here partway through high school and continued with the job through college, when Bravon announced that he would be retiring and wanted to know if you wanted the store. All of those late nights of study and eating mostly fast food had left your already above average hourglass shape even curvier. But the addition of sitting around most every day going through the paperwork had started to turn your weight gains up to eleven. You wouldn\u2019t consider yourself fat by any means yet, but you were definitely heading past the curvy stage and closing in on it. While you thought you might have been more concerned about this by now, to your surprise you actually sort of liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou long dexterous fingers played with your pen between filling out the papers at the top of the stack. You were so engrossed that you practically jumped out of your skin when a loud shout was followed by a tremendous clatter. Hopping out of your seat you ran through the connecting door into the store proper, wondering the whole time what had happened. Darting along the aisles, you soon found the cause of the commotion: a dragoness standing near a pile of fallen books. You froze in your tracks upon seeing her, briefly stunned by her beauty.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was obvious what happened: her extra wide hips had brushed into one of the shelves of books, taking out practically the whole row and dumping them into a pile on the floor. A portion of your mind was able to figure this out, but far more of your mental sharpness had fled you as your thoughts focused almost entirely on the dragoness before you. Her hips were truly stupendous, looking more that easily wide enough that you wouldn\u2019t be able to wrap your arms around just one and touch on the other side, and you could easily see her mammoth rump even though she was facing towards you. Her stomach dropped down across her thighs and extended far enough out that she probably hadn\u2019t seen her toes without looking in a mirror in a very long time. You kept getting drawn to her breasts though, each a luscious fleshy orb distended under their own weight, pooling atop her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was obviously very confident in her weight as well, not burying her body beneath layers upon layers of clothes despite the heat, she instead was wearing a top that was loose and flowing but still displayed her myriad curves and had a plunging neckline that exposed nearly a handspan of the canyon of her cleavage, while the sleeves only covered the rounded flesh of her upper arm, leaving her meaty lower arms exposed. Her legs on the other hand were packed into calf-length jeans that just served to emphasize her rump and hips. Her face looked gorgeous with luminous jade colored eyes, plump lips, and just a hint of makeup\u2014in your opinion, she didn\u2019t look like she needed much if any makeup. All in all, you found that she looked stunning even despite how distressed she looked about knocking some of the product to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on boss, we should help her out,\u201d you heard someone say, finally piercing the veil around your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now did you realize that you had been staring at her, though no one seemed to have noticed. What felt like an eternity to you had apparently only been a few scant seconds. Shaking your head to clear the cobwebs, you saw that it was Marcus, the young man that worked the register up front. The mop headed blond started to move past you, but you saw someone waiting to check out, the fox somewhat distracted by the commotion. You directed him to head up and help that customer out, while you stayed here. You weren\u2019t about to pass up a chance like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to try and get your breathing under control as well as to help focus so you wouldn\u2019t start staring again. Once settled as much as you could, you quickly stepped closer. The dragoness quickly apologized for the accident, though you briefly got another thrill from how sweet and musical her voice sounded to you. Giving another quick shake of your head, you told her that it was just an accident, and one that was easily fixed. The two of you quickly started to pick the books up, though you also spent some time organizing them as well. You kept getting distracted each time the dragoness would bend over; facing towards you, her breasts nearly spilled out of her top, tempting you with their obvious softness, and when she was facing away from you her butt was often displayed directly at you, almost as if inviting you to bury your hands in the bulging expanse. It was all you could do to push the thoughts aside and keep yourself as composed as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose to the end, you were sorting more of the books on the shelf with the dragoness watching you, when she tucked a stray lock of her long red hair behind her ear. She then asked, \u201cDo you work here or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that. I\u2019m the owner,\u201d you responded, glancing sideways at her, where you saw such a blush spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! I\u2019m sorry about all this. I feel like such a klutz: I come into this lovely little store and knock half of it the ground, and then the owner has to help the whale clean up.\u201d She buried her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, like I said before it was an accident and look\u2026we\u2019re done cleaning up already,\u201d you soothed her, sliding the last book into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose it wasn\u2019t too bad, but it still feels like I should do something to make up for the trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026maybe\u2026would you like to go out for a cup of coffee?\u201d you managed to say without betraying too much anticipation in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arched an eyebrow at that. \u201cA coffee\u2026? In this heat?\u201d Now it was your turn to blush, while you tried to come up with something else to say. She beat you to the punch though and continued, \u201cHow about this instead: I\u2019ve got to get going right now, but maybe we could go out and have dinner tonight\u2026please, it would be my treat. Think of it as a way for me to make up for causing this mess and making you clean it all up\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took every ounce of willpower not to let your mouth drop open in shock. This wonderful looking woman was asking you out, what incredible luck. You managed to stammer out \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, almost reducing you to a puddle on the floor. \u201cAll right, you know the restaurant over on 5th; it\u2019s at the end near the boardwalk.\u201d You nodded before she continued, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we meet up there say around eight-ish?\u201d Again, you nodded. \u201cSee you then I suppose.\u201d She smiled again before turning and walking away, giving you a fantastic view of the twin hills of her butt bobbing up and down like two massive metronomes set in direct opposition to each other. Her long and thick tail almost caught on another bookcase, but she managed to avoid it this time instead resulting in what you thought of as a playful slap across you. She walked up to the register and paid for a pile of books that you hadn\u2019t seen her grab, too focused on her. When she went outside into the broiling heat, the dragoness met up with someone else, a slender cheetah that had been waiting more than a little impatiently, busy on her phone nearly the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that you making all that noise earlier?\u201d the cheetah asked. You didn\u2019t hear all the dragoness\u2019 response, just a bit about knocking some books off the shelf, but the other spoke up again, \u201cGod, Vanessa Golde knocking over something yet again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them continued to talk but quickly passed beyond you being able to hear anything except the busy city street. You had lost the ability to understand anyways, too lost in whirling thoughts based on the name that the cheetah had said; surely the dragoness couldn\u2019t be <i>that</i> Vanessa Golde, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recovered a short time later, dismissing any thoughts about who this Vanessa Golde was, and returned to your work. The rest of the day passed in a heady blur, unable to keep images of the dragoness from floating through your mind. After closing the shop at seven, you dashed back home and quickly showered before changing clothes. The Night Rose wasn\u2019t an ultra formal restaurant, but it also wasn\u2019t exactly a place to wear sweat soaked semi-casual wear either. You opted for a loose flowing blouse with just the top two buttons undone, and a knee length skirt that hugged your plush cheeks. By this time, you were cutting it close to get back to the restaurant, so you went as fast as you could \u2013 and maybe even a little beyond at times \u2013 to try and get there. Unfortunately, due to traffic congestion as well as construction, it was closing in on nine by the time that you got parked and darted for the restaurant. The day\u2019s heat had thankfully broken, and there was a cool breeze sweeping in from off of the water making it a relatively pleasant night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seemed like half the city if not more had come down to take advantage of the cooling air down along the coastline. You pressed through the heaving crowds, eyes flicking every direction in the hopes of finding her. Then, as if by magic, a slight opening appeared and through it you saw the dragoness. She made a space for herself at the railing overlooking the pounding surf below. Seeing her standing there made you feel more than a little underdressed. The dragoness looked magnificent in a flowing dress that managed to highlight her every curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opening started to close up again as the people continued on their way around you. You managed to force your way through. She didn\u2019t seem to notice you at first, and instead went on staring out across the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m late,\u201d you stammered out, hoping your voice was loud enough for her to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been as she turned to look at you with a smile curling her lips. \u201cOh, there you are, miss bookstore.\u201d You started to ramble on about the traffic and everything, hoping beyond belief that she would accept your explanation. She cut you off though, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. I understand.\u201d Even those words in her voice sent your heart aflutter. \u201cCome along now though, I\u2019m starting to get a bit hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she started to move off. You happened to notice the two hotdog papers she threw away when she thought you couldn\u2019t see them. You gave no sign that you saw that, but wondered how hungry she could be after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness plunged through the crowd with far more ease then you experienced. You were able to follow right along by keeping to the wake that she opened. No matter how much you tried, you couldn\u2019t keep your eyes away from that bobbing rump before you, taunting and tempting you with every step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer path soon led to The Night Rose, the namesake rose depicted on a star speckled sign above the door. Only a few moments later, the two of you ended up seated in a secluded booth. You didn\u2019t complain at all when she asked to move the table more your direction. Even before she sat down, you could see how her girth would have ended up flowing onto the table. She asked you a bit about the bookstore and how you liked working there. You did have to comment that you hated all of the paperwork that became a necessity. After some further small talk as you both looked over the menu, the waiter came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to open your mouth when the dragoness got in first. She rattled off quite a list of food: a steak with mashed potatoes, pork chops on a bed of rice, along with a salad with chicken. Then she turned to you and asked what you wanted. You were stunned for several seconds. She had the hot dogs a short while ago, and then she was going to order all that? Your heart thundered in your chest, you didn\u2019t think she could get any better. You shook it off though, and placed an order for a bowl of shrimp scampi with pasta. The waiter gave a quick nod before returning to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the dragoness, you noticed she had a blush creeping into her cheeks and she was fidgeting with her hair. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t scare you with how much I ordered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour throat went dry. \u201cScare me? No, not at all,\u201d you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed rather unconvinced, but let the matter drop. As quiet settled between the two of you again, you started to hear some of the comments drifting around your booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see that whale of a dragon go by?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope there\u2019s enough food left in the kitchen after she gets done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could she let herself go like that? And why is she even going out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth, and now realized that you had heard similar derogatory comments during your time behind her on the boardwalk. Too lost in the sight before you, you hadn\u2019t registered you heard them till now. Bringing your attention back to the table, you found your dinner companion fiddling with her drink glass, looking like she wasn\u2019t paying any attention to the words around her. Then you saw the tightness of her face and she kept her eyes planted on the table beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look very pretty tonight,\u201d you blurted out, regretting how stupid you sounded as soon as the words let your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze snapped up to you, her eyelids fluttering. \u201cTh-thank you,\u201d she said at last, a slight smile on her lips, though there was something that said she didn\u2019t believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to say something else, but the food arrived. The dragoness\u2019s smile became wide and genuine as she took in the feast before her. You twirled some of the pasta and speared a shrimp, bringing it to your mouth. The forkful froze as you took in the sight before you. The dragoness was like a machine, moving fast but without any wasted effort. Food vanished into her mouth, without a spilled drop or crump escaping her gnashing teeth. All of her worries seemed to be so far away as she demolished the steak and potatoes before moving onto the pork chops on their bed of rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forced yourself to tear your eyes away, and focus on your own meal. It didn\u2019t last long though as you returned to staring at the dragoness. On and on she went, more and more food vanishing down her throat with such practiced speed and ease. Despite already well past the point that most people would have been sick to their stomach, she continued to eat. She even made sure each plate and bowl was left without a trace of the food that once graced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she sat back with a burp escaping her lips. Then she seemed to come back into herself. Her face went beet red as she looked up at you before burying her face in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to see that! I shouldn\u2019t have ordered that much and I definitely shouldn\u2019t have eaten everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d you sputtered, glancing around in the hopes the two of you weren\u2019t making as big a scene as you thought you were. Unfortunately, there were plenty of eyes turned towards your booth. Nothing you could do about that though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on, \u201cThis was supposed to be a nice little dinner to repay you for the trouble at your bookstore, and then I had to ruin it. Letting my stomach get the better of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t ruin it. I like\u2013\u201d you started to say before you clamped a hand to your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou what?\u201d she asked, moist looking eyes boring into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face burned. You were sure she could see the blush through the fur on your face, but there was no going back now. \u201cI liked it,\u201d you admitted, and then the words started to spill from your mouth. \u201cWhen I first saw you, I thought you were gorgeous, and my opinion hasn\u2019t exactly faded after seeing you eat like that.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You went about your daily rituals anyways before checking on the painting you had worked on the day before. It hadn\u2019t dried yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou next grabbed a quick breakfast before hopping on your computer. There were a few emails from various galleries, including those that had some of your work on display as well as some that showed some interest in doing so as well. Your heart skipped a beat when you saw one from Jade. Jade Campbell started out as just another online purchaser of some of your paintings, but developed into something much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessages, emails, and calls had passed back and forth between the two of you since she first contacted you. Standard questions about one of your pieces shifted to include interest in several others, before taking on a much more personal content. Despite the connection that had formed between the two of you, you had never actually seen her, not even in a picture. She was also reluctant to describe herself in any specific way. From the small bits you managed to piece together, you got the sense that she may have felt embarrassed by herself in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that she had perhaps overcome that though. According to her latest message, the bovine was ready to meet with you in person. She was inviting you downtown to a restaurant that you had only seen in passing. She apologized for the short notice, but hoped that you could have some time to do it tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of meeting her was more than a little thrilling. The next thought you had was that you didn\u2019t have anything that would be suitable for such a place. You fired off a response confirming that you wanted to have dinner with her. Then you wolfed down the rest of your cereal, before getting dressed in a hurry and rushing out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, you slipped in through the door at Solitude with only a few minutes to spare. The host gave you a once over as you walked in. It was obvious that the bear was thinking that you looked out of place. Your new dress hugged your curves in a wonderful fashion, but it was clear to anyone that you were not used to wearing such finery. His demeanor brightened when you managed to say that you were here to meet Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led you through the door beside him and into the main part of the restaurant. It looked like you were expecting: dark wood paneling, cozy and subdued lighting, and plenty of high class decorations in every direction. You couldn\u2019t help but gawk at the wealth on display around you. You were doing reasonably well selling your paintings, but you never had a chance to ever come to a place like this on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA worrying thought kept popping up no matter how much you tried to swat it away: what if she was planning to try sticking you with a bill you had no chance of paying? You shook your head; no, Jade wasn\u2019t like that\u2026or at least you didn\u2019t hope so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour worrying was shoved aside as the bear stopped at a secluded booth tucked away out of view of most of the rest of the restaurant. \u201cYour guest has arrived, madam,\u201d he said to someone out of your view behind the wall of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you, William,\u201d Your breath caught in your throat as you heard that voice. It was the voice you had heard so many times before, imagining who was on the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour table, ma\u2019am,\u201d William said while motioning towards the table before retracting his steps back the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran your hands down across your dress, making sure that there wasn\u2019t any major wrinkles and whatnot. Then you turned towards your hair, done up in an unfamiliar braid. You didn\u2019t want to find it caught in the dress or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jumped out of your skin when Jade asked, \u201cAlexandra, are you there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you managed to croak back. Clearing your throat, you tried again, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, did she sound nervous too?</i> you wondered. There was something to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shake of your head, dismissing that thought. Satisfied that you weren\u2019t a complete mess, you took a deep breath before stepping forward around the edge of the booth. Jade looked at you with a smile as she saw you. It was brief, but you were sure the smile looked a bit tight for a moment. You hoped she found you at least halfway decent because you thought she looked downright gorgeous.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAh, there you are, Alex,\u201d the cow sitting in the booth said with a wide smile as she tucked away a small book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, here I am,\u201d you replied with a half-stifled nervous laugh. You regretted it in an instant, wishing you hadn\u2019t sounded so stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade gave a quick glance up and down across you. She might have thought you wouldn\u2019t notice in the dim light and shadows, but you always did have great eyesight even in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou pictures didn\u2019t do you justice,\u201d she said after finishing her appraisal. \u201cThey were superb naturally, but are nothing compared to seeing you in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartway through your correspondence, you built up the nerve to send a few pictures to Jade. You hoped that might help encourage the cow to do the same back. It hadn\u2019t worked out that way of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you stammered as you took your seat across from her. You tried in vain to smooth any wrinkles that formed from that act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it,\u201d she said with a wave of her hand, and that smile still curling her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then busied herself with taking a drink from her water glass. You took this chance to check the curvy cow out yourself. Hair as dark as the midnight sky except for a blue forelock fell around a face that you thought was quite model worthy. The most striking aspect f her face was the dazzling eyes, each a luminous green orb that shone like expert cut emeralds. Her hair continued to spill in thick waves around shoulders bared by her dress. While you felt and looked out of sorts wearing your dress, Jade wore hers like a second skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no doubt in your mind that someone had done a spectacular job of tailoring the dress to suit her so well. The sparkling fabric highlighted the gorgeous black and white fur that the dress shown around the dress. It hugged weighty breasts and exposed a tasteful glimpse of what you thought to be a fantastic amount of cleavage. You couldn\u2019t see them due to the table now, but you knew from your first view of her that her dress flared around hips were sure to be exquisite. A small part of your mind imagined what her butt had to be like. Meanwhile between the top and bottom of her hourglass lay a plush belly peeking between the overshadowing bust and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, you found Jade to be breathtaking. Far better than the worst fears your mind continued to dwell on no matter how much you tried to fight them away. She was even better than you had hoped of dreaming of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how is your latest painting coming, Alex?\u201d Jade asked, snapping you back out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-fine, its fine. Checked it this morning, hadn\u2019t dried yet. Came out looking better than I was hoping. Wasn\u2019t sure that the shade of blue I used was quite right, but it seems to have worked out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarvelous,\u201d she responded with another smile that sent your heart aflutter. \u201cWhat\u2019s this one again? A forest scene, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and doe into a bit of an explanation, feeling a bit more at ease talking about your art. Jade listened with rapt attention that broken only when a waiter came by with a bottle of what you thought looked like a very expensive wine. The tidy young man let Jade check the bottle over before pouring her a bit to sample. When she expressed her satisfaction, he proceeded to provide the both of you with some. He left the two of you alone again as soon as he finished. You never had much experience with wine before, but found the taste rather pleasant even so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation soon picked up where it left ff. After that came Jade expressing her admiration for the paintings she already purchased. She had already done this but admitted that she wished to repeat them in person now that she could. You couldn\u2019t prevent the blush that crept into your cheeks as she went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe return of the waiter brought an abrupt end to her continuing praise. He asked \u201cMs. Campbell\u201d if she would like her usual. You almost missed it, but still managed to pick up the slight hesitation before she agreed. She also seemed to drop her eyes to the table during that quick moment. You shook any concern about that as you felt buoyed by the wait staff knowing her name and order. This added a strike against your earlier paranoia. You stumbled over your words when the young man turned to you, too lost in your own head. Jade let out a delightful sounding giggle as you scanned the little menu and gave your own order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the waiter nodded and left, Jade returned to complimenting your previous paintings. The conversation soon turned to possibilities for your next work. You admitted that you didn\u2019t have much idea yet, but expressed hope that inspiration would strike. You said this even though you thought that inspiration was sitting right across from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore small talk followed after this. You couldn\u2019t lie; you were enjoying being with Jade very much. You were hard pressed to think of a time when you enjoyed yourself even more, even with those worries nagging at the back of your head. Jade seemed to be having a good time as well. Even still there seemed to be something nagging at her. You couldn\u2019t quite put your finger on it, but your earlier thought that she was somehow embarrassed about herself seemed the piece most likely to fit. You hoped that the embarrassment wasn\u2019t about meeting you at last instead. That concern continued to eat away at you until\u2026</span></div></div>",
