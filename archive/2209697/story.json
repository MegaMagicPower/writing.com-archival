Y'all have a nice summer, now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna Higgins' fifth-grade class rushed out of the classroom, thundering feet exploding past her as they all fought to get out the doors! Her cheerful message of farewell deaf on their ears! Deaf on the ears of everybody, except for two enormously fat boys who were panting and waddling between the desks, heading towards the classroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-m-M-Missy Higgins...we...gotcher...somethin'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was so busy watching the students rushing out the doors that she hadn't noticed that there were still two children left! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she said, and turned around, when she realised where the voices were coming from. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole and Porter Boggs waddled heavily up to her desk. They wore bright yellow, and sky blue polo-shirts and khaki cargo-shorts. Printed across their clothes were huge, red block letters, which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"GOBBLE 'TIL YOU WOBBLE!\"</b> and <b>\"LET THE STUFFING COMMENCE!\"</b>. Miss Higgins chuckled when she read them. The clothes were very tight on both boys, and their bellies were poking out the bottoms of their shirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the twins pulled out a large box of chocolates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this is for you!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww! Thank you, boys!\" she said sweetly. \"Awww! Oh it's so big!\" she said, and smiled. \"Thank you so much! You two have a lovely summer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessum!\" they said. She watched the two porcine pupils ploddle their way out the door, and waddle down the corridor towards the entrance, stopping at their lockers on the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...you think...she liked it?\" Porter asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayup!\" Cole wheezed, as he collected his bag. The boys slammed their lockers shut and other departing students watched them as they headed towards the entrance. Outside, a large blue cargo van was parked. Painted on the sides in bright yellow letters were the words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"BOGGS BAKEHOUSE CAFE\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Aunt Liza!\" Cole panted as he approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys!\" she said. \"I'm waitin' on your cousin! You ain't seen him have you? Never mind, he'll be here soon enough. Y'all hop in the back, I'll give you a lift home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! Thanks Auntie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys slid the doors open and heaved themselves on board. Liza beeped the horn loudly, and Bubby came waddling heavily down the steps, his footfalls slow and awkward, his huge belly straining against the white T-shirt he wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-c--comin' m-Momma!\" he panted. As he approached, other students followed behind, watching his almost glacial progress... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>But...Who are you??</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being 10 years old and weighing 470 wasn't easy for Bubby, as it took about 14 minutes for him to waddle to the school entrance, while it took Cole and Porter 7 minutes and the rest of the kids well..less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't quiet either, as you can hear when a  500lb mountain of a boy take one step and stop every 30 secs. Bubby would start sweating like a dog, at the littiest movement whensoever. It always caught the attention of other schoolmates and sometimes teachers to watch someone his size helplessly waddle. But being so big at an early age, Bubby was always used to the attention and didn't faze him one bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving himself into the passenger seat of the van, Bubby had to catch his breath while wiping the seat off his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting kind of fat, ain't ya?'\" said Porter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you barely made it before me!\" heaved Bubby<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, children behave.\" said Liza <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" said the children<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to go back to the shop!\" said Cole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right! Imma eat me some cakes, shakes, donuts, tarts and more! said Porter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo.. a snack?\" said Bubby<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laughed at the joke when Liza annouced \"We're here\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were excited to be back at the shop and they when they saw their best friend, Riley waiting for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley was the twins' best friend and schoolmate of Bubby. After moving from a different city, Riley attention was caught by the twins' massive girth and so befriended them thus starting close friendship with them. But being around nearly 400lb twins for about the beginning of the school year was bound to had some changes. Riley just was a stick with blond hair and below average weight for his age but after being around the twins for so long he eventually gained a bit of weight. From being a stick, to average weight, then to currently overweight at 200lbs with a double chin, moobs, and tightly fitting XL clothes, Riley made a drastic transformation over the months, but compared to Cole and Porter who are 400lbs  with triple chins, moobs the size of watermelons and extremly tight fitting polos, he is still a stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took ya so long?\" asked Riley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was ol' chubby back here keeping us waiting\" said Porter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up!\" said Bubby<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whatcha wanna do? asked Riley</span></div></div>",

The house was enormous - as it would be, since it was an old warehouse. On the ground floor, next to the garage was a large indoor pool. It was once the mechanics shop of the old warehouse, and the floor was smooth, grey concrete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you boys doing!?\" came a female voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma! Riley's come to play with us!\" Porter shouted. \"We're going swimming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Alright sweethearts! You be careful around that pool, and no running!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, momma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins waddled heavily upstairs and stripped out of their clothes before taking out their swim-shorts. Riley had to help both twins get dressed, since they were far too fat to do it on their own. He tugged their shorts - one red, one blue - over their enormous buttocks, and let the overstretched elastic snap into place, before pulling on the spare pair of white shorts which they'd given to him. Riley might've put on a bit of weight since meeting the Boggs Twins, but the shorts were still a bit loose, and he had to tighten the draw-strings quite a bit to stop them falling off! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole reached up for something on the shelf of his bedroom and lifted down a large, model boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, you guys! Let's go!\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hurried downstairs and waddled through the house, past the kitchen and the pantry and laundry, and into the pool-area. Huge glass windows let in oceans of light, and the pool was sparkling light blue and inviting! Riley watched the twins jump in, their huge soft bodies wet and glossy in the water. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Ranging from cherubic chubbiness to bed-breaking hyper-obesity, the Boggs Family celebrates all aspects of greed, gluttony, feeding, obesity, weight-gain and shameless, hedonistic pleasure! Follow them as they gorge, glut, and gobble their way through life, from meal to meal, and weigh-in to weigh-in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>But, who are the Boggs Family? Let's find out together... </u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma and Grandpa Boggs</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAged in their late sixties and early 70s, grandma and grandpa Boggs live at \"Sugar Loaf\" - an enormous antebellum plantation mansion in the Deep South, near the banks of the Mississippi River. Grandma loves cooking and feeding, and grandpa enjoys nothing more than a lazy day on the porch, or munching on his favourite candies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeights: 350-400lbs each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir children are: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>...Daniel Boggs and Marlene...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing in at 450 and 300lbs respectively, Daniel and his wife run the Hog's Trough Diner, in the sleepy Mississippi town of Sandy Creek, where dishes are cheap, the portions gigantic, and the food is deep fried in lard! The diner, and the motel next door, double as the town's truckstop, and function as one of the most popular meeting-places in town, thanks to their delicious and fattening food! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>...Warrick Boggs and Liza...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing 300 and 250lbs respectively, Warrick and Elizabeth 'Liza' Boggs run Boggs Bakehouse Cafe, just a few blocks from the Hog's Trough Diner. Focusing largely on cakes, tarts, pies, cookies, cupcakes and sweet, sugary treats, their greatest pleasure is baking and creating, fashioning all kinds of delicious, sweet and calorific treats for the neighbourhood! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>...Barlow Roundley and Susie-May...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of Grandma and Grandpa Boggs' children is Susie-May Boggs, married to her husband Barlow Roundley. They run the Sugar Loaf Candy Emporium on Main Street! A hit with schoolkids of all ages, their shop is busting with ice-creams, chocolates, sweets, candies, toffee, and all other kinds of junkfood! What they don't have ain't worth eatin'! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>The Boggs Boys</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boggs Boys are the fattest kids in town, and probably the entire country! They are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Horace \"Pigdawg\" Boggs</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 13, going on 14, Pigdawg is the oldest, and fattest, of all the Boggs boys. Weighing in at 805lbs, and standing 5'7\", 'Pigdawg' has dark blonde hair and soft, deep blue eyes. Insatiably gluttonous and barely mobile, Pigdawg spends most of his days behind the grill at the Hog's Trough, frying up food for the locals, and stuffing his face on the leftovers! His enormous size means that he's almost always naked, except for his greasy, sweat-drenched apron, and white garrison cap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boscoe \"Bubby\" Boggs</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour years younger, 'Bubby' Boggs is 10 years old, and 530lbs. He has chocolate brown hair and brown eyes. Like his cousin Pigdawg, Bubby is barely mobile. When he's not at school, breaking furniture and gorging himself at the cafeteria, Bubby spends most of his time on his phone, behind the counter at his parents' bakery, serving customers, and sneaking leftovers when he thinks nobody is watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Roundley Twins</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least, are Cole, and Porter Roundley - named after their mother's favourite songwriter, the Roundley Twins go to school with their cousin Bubby, and spend their days off behind the counter of their parents' ice-cream parlour and candy-shop, serving customers and stuffing their faces. The twins are eight years old, and already weigh 460lbs each! They have light brown and blonde hair, with green, and blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
