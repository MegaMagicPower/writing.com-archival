Who will win the throne of Armello?</i></span><br>\r\nThe world of <b>Armello</b> is a world right out of fairty tales - the kind of world parents tell their children about in bedtime stories to fuel imaginations of adventure and mysticism. Or at least, it used to be. Back then, the four clans lived in harmony, and society was held together by the <b>Wyld</b> - a magical energy that permeated all things, harnessed to create all sorts of wondrous technologies and spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that was before the dawn of the <b>Rot</b>. A horrible disease that infects the very earth, opening up giant black sores in the land and causing nature to wither away into ash. It once intrigued warlocks, as many felt they could harness its incredible power - but that power comes at the cost of complete madness in anyone infected with the disease. By the time it had spread through the land, it was already too late to stop it. In fact, it had already infected the noble <b>King</b>, turning him into a mad tyrant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs resources wither away and the Rot closes in, the four once peaceful clans now feud with each other, each looking to protect their own lands and ways of life no matter the cost. Amidst all this, you're lingering somewhere in this wide kingdom.. but where?</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, River\u2019s knack for enduring the wilderness alone indefinitely certainly contributed to her ongoing survival\u2026 but it was her patience that allowed her to get the job done. The patience to rage wars of attrition that can last for years, and the patience to wait, near motionless, for the perfect time to eliminate a target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this patience that\u2019s allowed her to lie on a ridge above the village of Caershire, nearly motionless, for almost a week now. A group of bandits nearby have proven\u2026 particularly bothersome for her, and they\u2019ve seemingly been plundering villages in this valley one by one. In her eyes, it\u2019ll only be a matter of time before they come for Caershire\u2026 and when they do, she\u2019ll be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf idly rubs her engorged belly as its squished against the gut, currently churning away at a feral deer she had hunted down yesterday, her powerful stomach having already converted its body mostly to chyme. Compared to many of the gluttonous citizens of Armello, it was rare that River would stop for such a large meal, which left her with a rather skinny and slim form, with most of her thickness coming from raw muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held that bow in her paws as she weathered the cold, ready to nock an arrow at the first sign of a disruption in the village below\u2026 and sure enough, a disruption was coming. Over the horizon, a band of silhouettes was descending slowly down a hill towards the village, and it wasn\u2019t hard to tell just who, exactly, they were. She grimaced, sliding an arrow onto the string of her bow as she watched them approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBandits and outlaws\u2026 thieves and conmen. All animals that have been ousted from the other clans, and have thus made their living on the road, their only allegiance being to their own self-interest. She grimaced as she watched them descend upon the village, already loading some supplies into their wooden wagons\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as a rabbit woman who tried to fight back against the bandits was lodged, slowly, down the throat of a drooling wolf outlaw, cooing as she curled up inside his pudgy belly. Across from him, a rat woman was plopped right down on a small wolf\u2019s snout, rubbing her backside against his nose and threatening to suck him right up her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver could only take a deep breath. She wanted to dispatch every one of these bandits\u2026 but this arrow was meant for someone in particular. She froze up as she finally saw the one she was looking for. That damned, charismatic fox who led this little band of outlaws. Scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet had apparently swallowed the wife of the village alpha, bulges forming wildly in her big, round, fluffy tummy as she squished the alpha with her belly, teasing him about how she\u2019ll be gurgled away into chyme and added as pudge to her fat ass. The width of her figure already made it obvious just how often the vixen engaged in such\u2026 hedonism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, River was patient. She knew she might just have one chance at this. It had to count. The wolf held her breath as she pulled the bowstring back, clenching one eye shut as she focused entirely on the vixen, waiting for the perfect moment to loose her arrow, able to imagine its exact trajectory into the vixen\u2019s long neck\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could let the arrow fly\u2026 she suddenly felt the sting of sharp steel pressing against her neck! \u201cAh, ah, ah! Not so fast!\u201d She heard a smug, feminine voice smile from behind her. One of the bandits had snuck up on her\u2026 managed to press a dagger against her vulnerable throat. How could she have been so sloppy? \u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, I recommend you rethink this little plan of your\u2019s~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, River mentally debated the pros and cons of sacrificing her own life if it meant she could finally kill Scarlet. But no\u2026 she knew she had to relent, as much as she hated it. She let the bow string slowly slide back into position, the arrow that was destined for Scarlet\u2019s neck instead falling uselessly to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing she knew, she was being pinned on her back on the ground, knife against her throat as she glared up at her attacker; a wild-looking weasel woman! \u201cGood girl!\u201d The weasel smiled, licking her lips as she looked over her catch\u2019s sylphlike body. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re that ranger I\u2019ve heard so much about? You don\u2019t look so tough\u2026 hell, with a body like your\u2019s, I\u2019d think you\u2019d make a better whore than a warrior~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled at the weasel\u2019s crudeness, but knew she could muster no counterattack. All she could do was lay there in defiant silence as the weasel\u2019s hands travelled along her body, groping her freely as the bandit seemingly giggled in unrestrained glee\u2026 before gasping when she felt beneath the wolf\u2019s belt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! Wow, packing a lil surprise under there for us?\u201d The weasel\u2019s shocked expression soon morphed into one of deviously delighted surprise. \u201cLooks like you and Scarlet have more in common than I expected~\u201d River was blushing, now, trying not to let her expression change as the weasel groped and kneaded her large, soft, fluffy balls\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, while her rump was exposed, River made sure to have armor that thoroughly covered her crotch. After all, that fat sheath and surprisingly big, round balls served as an incredibly obvious weak point enemies might exploit. And besides\u2026 somewhere deeper down, poor River was slightly ashamed of her rather \u2018unladylike\u2019 anatomy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019d be exploited, though, as the weasel freely cut through her armor with her dagger, and started openly groping those fluffy balls, as if trying to coax River\u2019s cock out of her sheath. She was openly blushing now, averting the bandit\u2019s gaze. With matters only growing worse as the jeering outlaws gathered around up on the hill to see what all the commotion is about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake way! Make way! I\u2019ve got to see this!\u201d Suddenly, the outlaws were interrupted by a booming voice. They parted like the red sea to make way for the imposing figure of their leader, Scarlet\u2026 the vixen smiling deviously down at the blushing wolf as she trotted forward. \u201cOooh, my! If it isn\u2019t my old pal River, in the flesh! We really must stop meeting like this, you know~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close, Scarlet was massive. Even more massive than last time River saw her. Her huge, thick hips were shown off freely, her belly jiggling slightly with her every step, her entire body doughier and softer than anyone River\u2019s seen before. It seems that the vixen really has been subsisting on a daily diet of squirming villagers, shoving them up that huge, fat ass or just churning them away into pudge in that fat belly, like she was doing to the alpha and his wife at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should take her out where she stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. I must be patient.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiver could only blush as the vixen came closer. Unlike the wolf, Scarlet had no compunctions about showing off the absolutely massive, pendulous balls squished up inbetween her thick, fat thighs, which audibly sloshed with every step she took, the sound of what remains of all those she\u2019s gurgled up into cum in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, River was getting a faceful of bulging fox belly. Her ears were immediately filled with the sound of gurgling and sloshing, as well as the muffled protests of the two wolves tightly curled within the fox\u2019s gut. \u201cOh, were these the villagers you were trying to protect, dear?\u201d Scarlet giggled, jiggling and shaking her belly with her hand while pressing River\u2019s face into her gut with the other. \u201cSorry, but me and my friends here were just passing through for a snack. Didn\u2019t mean to be such an inconvenience~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Be patient, River.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about them, though. They\u2019re just getting to become part of all this~\u201d She cooed, running her hands over her curvaceous body as she teased the captive wolf, biting her lip at the thrill of having River on her knees before her. She turned around, slapping a hand against her absolutely massive ass, groping and jiggling a cheek right before River\u2019s eyes. \u201cLiving their whole lives just to end up as another layer of pudge on my ass\u2026 what better way is there to go~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t long until River was being smothered once again. She could only let out a huff as her face was worked deep into that dark abyss between those huge, fat cheeks, each moulding around her head as her snout was pressed up against that stretchy tailhole. \u201cCome to think of it, now that I have you here\u2026 maybe that would be the perfect little place to fit you~? I always figured you were meant to end up sliding up my ass~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Patience.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, River\u2019s snout was mercifully freed from the embrace of that fat vixen rump\u2026 which was good timing, as the wolf herself was starting to come unsheathed at getting squished by the vixen\u2019s sheer, undeniable softness. Not that what follows would be much better, as River opened her eyes to see Scarlet\u2019s thick cock looming before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out another muffled grunt as her face was pressed into those big, thick balls, as Scarlet gently moved her hips, her voice growing more shaky and aroused as she smothered the wolf with her fluffy balls! \u201cOf course\u2026 from the moment we first met\u2026 I must confess I\u2019ve been fantasizing about slipping that scrawny little body of yours right into these\u2026 tight, churning balls\u2026 by the goddess, I\u2019d love to gurgle up a powerful ranger into nothing but a nice load~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, River paid attention to all that was around her. And from what she could tell, the other bandits were clumping together, fascinated by the spectacle of it all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2026 now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her opportunity was clear, she finally jumped back from Scarlet when she least expected it, harnessing the perfect moment to use one of the few spells she knew...</span></div></div>",
