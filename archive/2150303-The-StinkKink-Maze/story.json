He was the biggest star of them all...one of the best! Fans would throw themselves at him, some even begging to be knocked out by his lucky socks and cleats! He was loved by everyone...Until it was found out that most of his victories came from shady deals and doping. He was stripped of all his awards, and now the world hates him. Adrian is here because his fortune is running dry, and this prize can put him back on top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStench: 7 (Specifically feet)<br>\r\nSensitivity: 7<br>\r\nEndurance: 2<br>\r\nLikability: 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh as you hear the spectators boo you. It's nothing you haven't heard before, but it still makes you cringe whenever you do hear it. After a bit more fanfare from Putrina, the massive doors open and you head on in! Your nose is immediately hit by the funky stench hanging around the maze. Maybe this wasn't the best idea...ah well, too late now! As you take your first steps and head left though, you regret your decision even more because you have already...</span></div></div>",

You try to run, but before you can even take three steps, the floor gives way beneath you! You let out a scream as you fall down into a pit, only to hit a pile of pillows on the bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Putrina giggle and speak to the audience as the floor closes back, leaving you trapped in darkness. <b>\"Ooohh! Looks like Adrian's off to a pretty rough start, folks! Our fine foxy friend has just fallen into a stink pit! Now for those of you who are new, allow me to explain. The stink pit will start to fill up with a randomized stench. Every second, the smell will get thicker and thicker, and it'll keep filling with stink for five minutes! If Adrian here manages to last five minutes, he'll be released from the trap! If he faints, he'll still be let out, but he'll be nice and vulnerable for our guardian friends to find him!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou audibly gulp as you hear a hiss from inside your pitch black prison. No doubt that sound means the stink is being dispensed! You take a curious whiff, only to immediately regret it! You fall back on your ass and whimper as you clutch your sensitive canine nose. Ugh! The room is being flooded with a rotten, eggy stink that could only be farts! You start to tear up from the horrid stench and are about to breathe through your mouth when you remember that mouth-breathing, unless neccesary after strenuous physical activity, is grounds for an automatic knockout! You'll have to relinquish hold of your nose if you want to breathe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that it'll be worse if you hold your breath and gasp for air later when your lungs can't take it, you bite the bullet and take your hands from your nose. As you breathe in again, you let out a soft whimper at the horrific smell. It really is getting worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Oooh! Poor Adrian doesn't seem to be handling this very well!

By the second minute, you're only just barely hanging onto consciousness. You know you can't make it at this rate. Trying to stay awake is only going to prolong your torment. You brace yourself and take a deep sniff of the fart haze surrounding you before passing out cold.

Your eyes start to water and burn while your nose also does the latter. You choke and wheeze on the horrid, skunky reek that fills your lungs with agony each time you inhale! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk girl walks over to you with a smug grin and plants a foot on your snout. O-oh fuck, her feet might actually stink worse than her spray! The awful, cheesy stench makes you lose what little balance you had, and with a soft push, the skunk girl rolls you on your back. <b>\"Heh, told you my spray would have you reeling! Now, about that wiener of yours...\"</b> Oh fuck...she was serious about that!? You feel her warm, filthy foot press down on your sheath and start rubbing. You let out a whimper and squirm a bit, but you're in no condition to resist her! Her footwork is fantastic, and soon your cock emerges from your sheath. A few strokes later, and you're fully erect and moaning softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the skunk girl doesn't want you to forget why she did this.

Welcome to your first challenge, Laundry!\" you heard Putrina's voice say. \"And, you just happen to be on laundry duty! Before you isi the maze's personal laundry machine! It's programmed to 'wash' our employees' clothing. As long as this machine remains functional, the route ahead remains locked. Your goal, to advance, is to unplug the washer! But be warned... this machine is still hungry for filthy clothes.\" At the end of that sentence, you saw a pair of dirty shorts fall from the cieling, and right in front of it. At that, it opened its \"mouth,\" and you heard a vacuum noise, right as the shorts are sucked up into the throat hole. You then see the shorts fall into that stomach covered by the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's one place for filthy clothing to disappear to! Just imagine, getting pulled into a tight tube, sucked down or up, and forced into a cramped space filled with a broth of musk, sweat, and filthy clothing!\" At that description, you audibly gulped in fear. \"A cycle usually lasts 30 minutes, and that's how long you have to spend within the washing chamber if you get caught. Be careful!\" At that, the speakers shut off, and you were left to deal with the machine. Your only way out appeared to be throug it. Looks like you've gotta get to that plug fast!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you go forward, you notice the walls are decorated in red hearts. There's another turn, and you go forward. However, ahead of you awaited your first challenge. The hall ahead looked to be about 5 yards long. Along either wall, instead of there being, well, \"a wall,\" there were \"kissing booths\" set up into each wall, leaving you enough space to walk between. There were enough stalls to span the length of the hallway, and your way out of here appeared to be a turn into whatever's next. Each stall read \"Free Kisses\" or \"Get a Free Sample,''' and each stall hosted a different person wearing lots of makeup. You saw the likes of red foxes, large horses, zebras, cows, bulls, and jackals, each wearing eyeshadow and lipstick. Though there were a lot of ladies, you were positive some of them were male. You heard speakers turn on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Mr. What's-his-name has made his way to his first challenge! The Kissing Hall!\" you heard Putrina's voice say. \"Here, we got a few poor people desperately seeking out a kiss! And how kind of our contestant to allow them the opportunity! Our 'trappers' are going to try and capture our victim, and plant a powerful smooch on whatever part of him they wish! He'd better be careful, though. A few of our kissers don't know a thing or two about hygiene.\" You audibly gulped at that statement. So, you'd have to run through these guys, and hopefully avoid a kiss. Now, you might've had enough room to walk between them, but there's no easy way to avoid there grasp. One person in a stall could reach over to touch the opposite stall. Maybe you could find an easier path-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back to consider a different path, but you could see a curvaceous, white cat coming towards your path. She bore red lipstick, and seemed to look upon you hungrily. You realized a retreat would likely make you another person's victim. It was either through the Kissing Hall, or winding up in someone's grasp. You had to power through!</span></div></div>",

A simple smooch isn\u2019t scary in the slightest. Emboldened, you decide to just try and make it down the hall as fast as you could. As you entered, the anthros in the booth teased you by loudly smacking their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you passed by, they all shouted out little taunts, striking sexy poses as if in an attempt to seduce you. <i>\u201cC\u2019mon, baby! Don\u2019t you want a smooch? It\u2019s free!\u201d \u201cFor a cutie like you, I\u2019ll give ya one right on the lips~\u201d \u201cY\u2019know, I wish we didn\u2019t have to do just one! I\u2019d rather smooch you allll over!\u201d</i> You shudder, trying to ignore their relentless teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t seem to be reaching out to grab you, so you figured that all they did was try and seduce you. Quickly, though, you realized that their teasing was just to distract you! While you were enraptured for a second by the sight of a particularly busty anthro, another one suddenly grabs you from behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spun you around, only to reveal that your captor was a tall, voluptuous jackal, with unbelievably plump, fill lips coated with a copious amount of <span class=\"clred\">red</span> lipstick. You squirmed in her grip, whimpering and trying to break free. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be like that, darling! A little kiss never hurt nobody, right?\u201d You were completely helpless to resist as she leaned forward and placed a huge, loud smooch right on your cheek!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recoiled when she kissed you\u2026 but to your surprise, it only lasted a few seconds, and once she was finished, she let you go. \u201cThere you go, sweetheart! That wasn\u2019t so bad, right?\u201d You were surprised! You expected there to be some kind of horrible twist, but it seemed these anthros really did just want to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought they were harmless, though, you took another step\u2026 and realized how tired you suddenly were. Each step you took seemed to take more effort, and your movements were ever so slightly more uncoordinated and sluggish. Quickly, you realized that the jackal\u2019s kiss had drained you of your energy somehow! Did these trapper\u2019s lips have some kind of magical effect?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you were slower, it was a lot easier for the trappers to catch you. You manage to dodge a couple of them, but it wasn\u2019t long before you get snatched again. Your new captor was a vixen with the same ridiculously curvaceous body and full lips that the jackal had, although you can\u2019t help but notice her lipstick is <span class=\"cviolet\">purple</span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you squirmed and struggled with twice the vigor as she hugged you close, her huge, pillowy breasts pressed up against your chest. \u201cAlways nice to get my hands on a real cutie like you,\u201d she smirked, her arms wrapped tightly around you. \u201cPucker up, pal!\u201d You could only brace yourself before she leaned forward and planted a huge kiss right on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held it for a few seconds, before finally breaking away and letting you go. You immediately stumble dizzily away from her, feeling a little weird. It didn\u2019t take you long to notice the tent that was slowly forming in your pants. You were getting turned on! That vixen\u2019s kiss must\u2019ve had some sort of aphrodisiac effect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, not only were you sluggish, but you were constantly distracted, unable to resist the urge to ogle the perfect bodies of the very anthros who were trying to capture you. Part of you wanted to let them capture you, fantasizing about all these gorgeous ladies passing you around and smooching you all over. You had to keep your head in the game, though! You couldn\u2019t fail in the first room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou powered forward, doing your best to ignore your licentious impulses. Still, it didn\u2019t take long before you noticed one of the trappers had a particularly huge rack, and you were mesmerized by the sight for a moment\u2026 which one of the other trappers used as an opportunity to grab you from behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you were wrapped in a bearhug by a shire horse. At first, you though they were just a flat-chested mare, but you quickly realized he was actually a very feminine stallion! It was hard to tell at first because, just like the others, he had long hair, was wearing a ridiculous amount of lipstick, and of course, had alluringly full lips, although this time with <span class=\"clblue\">blue</span> lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to run around wearing all that in the maze, bro,\u201d he said in a deep southern accent, gesturing to your simple outfit. You did notice many competitors going through the maze naked, but you had opted not to, not wanting everyone watching to see your nude form. \u201cLet's get you out of that stuffy outfit, why don\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to protest, but before you could, he pulls your shirt right off, tossing it to the side. You immediately yell for him to stop, and he hesitates. \u201cYou wanna keep your pants on? Well\u2026 if you say so\u2026\u201d He said, seeming genuinely confused. Suddenly, though, he remembered what he grabbed you for. \u201cOh yeah! The kiss. I almost forget.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward, and planted a kiss on your chest. For some reason, feeling his lips on your chest made you shudder even more than the previous two kisses did. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that he was a guy. With that, he smiled, patted you on the back, and let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braced yourself for the terrible effect that that kiss would have. At first, it seemed to have no effect at all\u2026 but then, you realized everyone was getting stinkier! Your nostrils were suddenly filled with the body odor of all the trappers in the room. Wait\u2026 no, on second thought, they weren\u2019t getting stinkier\u2026 your nose was getting more sensitive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the effects of the kisses were really getting to you. You were tired, horny, AND grossed out. You didn\u2019t know what you wanted to do most; sleep, fuck, or throw up! Your confusion made it almost impossible to avoid getting kissed by more trappers, and with each smooch you suffered, the effects you were feeling only grew worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you realized that it wasn\u2019t just the kisses that were doing this to you; it was their lipstick! Each smooch left a big, clear lipstick stain on you, and depending on the color, this had varying effects. The <span class=\"clred\">red</span> lipstick made you drowsy and sluggish; the <span class=\"cviolet\">purple</span> made you horny and unfocused; and the <span class=\"clblue\">blue</span> lipstick made you more sensitive to even the most minor stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your face, neck, and chest were completely covered in lipstick stains. You could\u2019ve sworn that over half of the trappers had managed to land a smooch on you. This whole thing has been a disaster! No matter what you did, you couldn\u2019t seem to get these stains off\u2026 but you noticed a bucket of water on the other end of the hall! You just had to make it to the end\u2026 but there was one more challenge in your way\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last trapper was in a booth separate from all the others. Probably because it was absolutely huge, to match the size of its owner. She was a ridiculously curvaceous zebra, who was about 7 feet tall, easily towering over you! She had the fullest lips of all, with a thick coating of <b>black</b> lipstick. You didn\u2019t even want to imagine what that does\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThis has been an embarrassing performance so far, I gotta say!\u201d</i> Putrina\u2019s annoying voice piped up again. <i>\u201cWhat\u2019s-his-name here better get his head in the game if he wants to get past Dalia! She\u2019s the head of the trappers, so if she gets her hands on him, there\u2019s no limit to how much she can kiss him!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood ran cold. All the other trappers could only kiss you once, but this zebra lady could smooch you as many times as she pleased! And judging from the lustful look on her face, she was prepared to take full advantage of that fact. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, competitor? Don\u2019t you want a kiss?\u201d She said, running her hands over her curvy body and showing off her gorgeous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was intensely alluring to your horny mind, and part of you just wanted to let her dominate you. On the other hand, her stench was perhaps the most offensive to your sensitive nostrils; it was like she hadn\u2019t bathed in days! Plus, you were so tired, you didn\u2019t know whether you could dodge her attempts to grab you. All of these factors made it seem like your chances of success were grim...</span></div></div>",

For, once you turned, you saw her turned around, butt planted on the counter of her stall. The way she sat, it squished up, making her rump appear plumper than usual. Curse that purple lipstick! You were unable to get your eyes off of that butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, you saw her smile a sort of judgmental smile. As if she expected her plan to work, but she feels sorry for you that it worked. Either way, she reached back, wrapped an arm around your neck, and pulled you towards her. She lifted you up, and, strangely, planted a loud smooch on your knee. Just as quickly as she planted her lips, she removed them, leaving behind a black, lip-shaped mark. Then she tossed you backwards, further away from the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, bad move, bud!\u201d Putrina taunted. You groaned and tried to get up, but the knee she kissed felt weird. You couldn\u2019t flex it, bend it... it was stuck! Your entire leg was stretched outwards!

So, you went right, then to that branch, and went a couple of yards forward, until it turned right towards another room, blocked off by a door. After that turn and you crossing into the room, you felt something wet and sticky beneath your feet. You looked down, and notice the floor of this next room was coated in rubber. Before you could consider further, the door behind you closed, and you could swear the stickiness crept further up your feet. Then, you heard Putrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! Lou-ser found himself in a sticky situation!\" she said in a very exaggerated tone. \"Welcome to the Rubber Trap! Here, the floor is covered in a layer of special rubber-like substance. This stuff's been known to suck onto any unfortunate soul that touch it, and wrap itself up around their unfortunate bodies. We're able to manipulate this substance so that, lucky Lou-ser, they won't be completely smothered in the rubber. No, that wouldn't be fun for our guards here~\" At that, you noticed two other people in the room. On one side, you see a lynx wearing a rubber suit akin to the substance on the ground, save for a zipper from her large breasts down to her pussy. It was already partially zipped down, revealing her bust to you a little. Opposite her was a wolf guy in a similar suit, with a zipper going from his muscular chest to his bulging groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our guards here have been given special suits that allow them to wade through the room at a leisurely pace.

You'd just have to struggle through the rubber-stuff, and hopefully move hard enough to escape the rubber's grip.</span></div></div>",

She achieved moderate success in professional boxing, but found it to be less exciting than the underground bare-knuckle boxing rings she excelled in at home. When she was recruiting for Stinkkink, she thought it was the exact kind of high-stakes game she\u2019d always been looking for. Sure, she\u2019d usually be disinterested in weird porn things like this\u2026 but this seemed like the perfect opportunity to show these weirdos what a real badass is like! In preparation for her appearance, she has stopped showering, which, combined with her daily workouts, has given her a room-clearing body odor. She only has a bit of training with farts and such, but her sweat is very powerful. Her powerful offense is betrayed by her lack of defense, however. She has no experience with enduring the stench of others, and it\u2019s likely she has severely underestimated her opponent\u2019s smelliness...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<b>Stench:</b> 9<br>\r\n<b>Sensitivity:</b> 2<br>\r\n<b>Endurance:</b> 5<br>\r\n<b>Likability:</b> 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, man.

You were standing around the locker room, talking to a friend of yours, who seemed to be doing his best to persuade you not to step foot in the maze. Apparently, all of the previous contestants have suffered horrible fates. <b>\u201cYeah, sure, they stink.. but hell, stinking\u2019s easy. I just went without showering for a month and I already stink like hell.\u201d</b> You chuckle. <b>\u201cYou know what\u2019s NOT easy? Taking an uppercut to the jaw.

They could tell you were critically underestimated the trials that awaited you\u2026 but before they could convince you to drop out before it was too late, you noticed somebody walk in. It was a little mouse lady carrying a clipboard, and judging by her formal pencil dress, she must be one of Stinkkink\u2019s staff. You knew what this means. <b>\u201cYeah\u2026 yeah, but\u2026 hey, I\u2019ve really gotta go. Sorry, man. Just keep your on the TV and stay tuned. I\u2019ll do just fine. Don\u2019t worry about it. Okay, good\u2026 mhmm, yeah, goodbye\u2026\u201d</b> Eventually, you hung up on your friend, tucking your phone away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you were done, the mouse woman stepped forward. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cMrs. Zakia?\u201d</span> She asked, and you, of course, nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s your time to shine. Right this way, please.\u201d She turned around and started walking down the hall, and you stood and followed her. Being backstage at Stinkkink was actually kind of incredible. Compared to the dinghy trailer parks you grew up in, this place looked like some sort of advanced, sci-fi complex. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI must ask that you store all of your possessions here temporarily. They can be retrieved after you emerge from the maze,\u201d</span> the mouse said, leading you to a big, secure-looking safe. With a shrug, you obliged and locked your stuff inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the mouse led you even deeper into the complex. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cNo, I must remind you that once you enter the maze, there is no going back. Anything can happen in there, ranging from stinky, to sexual, to potentially even lethal,\u201d</span> she warned you, her voice sounding quite serious. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cI must also remind that you that in the event of your failure, you agree to endure whatever punishment is decided for you, up to and including death or enslavement.\u201d</span> You could tell she was trying to scare you\u2026 but you had your head in the game! It was way too late to back out now! Besides, you were convinced that you had nothing to be afraid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cNow, this is just a tip, but you should know that there are no dead ends in the maze. All paths will lead you towards your objective,\u201d</span> she said. <span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cWhat we are testing here is your endurance, not exactly your navigation skills, although those will be useful as well.\u201d</span> You were hardly listening at this point, feeling excitement well up in your chest as you followed her through the complex. You could hear a crowd cheering and laughing loudly down the halls! It reminded you of your boxing days, and filled with the anticipation to leap into the limelight once again. The mouse woman sighed, seeing you weren\u2019t taking this serious, before finally pushing open the door to the stage\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gawk out, surprised. Putrina was standing there onstage, casually telling jokes and such to entertain the humongous audience. They weren\u2019t particularly funny, but the audience was still laughing uproariously for some reason. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201c... and so I said to him, why would anyone want me to NOT sit on their face? And get this; he says, he says\u2026 oh. Uh, hold on a minute,\u201d</span> she stops when the mouse walks up and whispers something in her ear. With that, she sits up, adjusting her dress. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAh! Ahem! Alright, folks. Next up to bat, we have a bare-knuckle boxer from the fine state of Kascium. She\u2019s rough, she\u2019s tough, she stinks to high hell; ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for...  Zakia!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took this as your cue to walk onto the stage, revealing yourself to the crowd. They cheered for you as you smiled out at them, chuckling as you flexed and posed for the adoring audience. You were wearing nothing but a sports bra and a pair of boxer shorts, content to show off your toned pecs and perfectly sculpted body. They crowd cooed at the sight of you. You did look pretty tough! Maybe you\u2019d fare better than all those scrawny contestants they\u2019d had so far. Once you were done posturing for the crowd, you take a seat across from the curvaceous skunk lady. She seemed to be wearing something that subdued her stench, which was fortunate, because otherwise, everyone in this room would be unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you draw closer, she\u2019s struck by the stench of your overwhelming BO. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhew! Why, you reek even worse than some of my guardians!\u201d</span> She leans back, waving her hand in front of her face in an over dramatic fashion. This elicits some more laughter from her adoring fans. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhat\u2019s your secret?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cUh\u2026 well, I just stopped showering. I work out a lot, so, y\u2019know, that really builds up a sweat\u2026\u201d</b> You shrug. <b>\u201cMy stink\u2019s not really going to matter too much, though, in the end.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cReally?

It's simple; anybody who messes with me in that maze is getting knocked out!\u201d</b> You insisted. Overcome with excitement, you stand up out of your chair and start shadow boxing the air, impressing the audience with your powerful-looking punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutrina giggled at your enthusiasm. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh! Looks like we have a robust contestant here, folks!\u201d</span> She said, and you beamed a bit at her compliment. With that, she put one hand on your shoulder, and turned to the crowd. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNow, y\u2019all know the drill. Do you have any 'requests' before she heads on in?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know exactly what she meant by \u2018requests\u2019. You expected them to ask you questions, or even ask for autographs or something. You didn\u2019t expect them to start shouting out the lewdest things you could imagine! Some were calling for you to flash the waiting crowd; others wanted you to drop trough and moon them; still others wanted you to make out with Putrina right on stage. You were absolutely taken aback by their behavior! <b>\u201cW-what is this?\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you were confused, Purtina leans forward and whispers, trying not to be noticed. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou should probably whip your tits out or something,\u201d</span> she advises. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIf you put on a good show now, the audience will be more likely to help you out later.\u201d</span></span></div></div>",

You were one of the most powerful people you knew; you were definitely not something to be ogled by a crowd! The crowd\u2019s excitement quickly turning to booing when you flipped them all the bird. <b>\u201cYou weirdos want to see something obscene, eh? Well, here you go!\u201d</b> You laughed loudly, amused by the shocked and appalled looks on their once horny faces. <b>\u201cYeah, you heard me!

You had gotten the crowd really riled up, which means that the ratings were going to be incredible when you finally got your comeuppance on live television! The meaner, more controversial contestants were always the ones who bring in the big bucks. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh! Those sound like fightin\u2019 words to me!\u201d</span> She cooed, excitedly gesturing to the entrance of the maze. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou talk a big game\u2026 but why don\u2019t we see if you can back it up, shall we?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blind bravado was deflated a bit when you looked down the darkened hallways of the maze. The crowd was urging you to step inside, but for some reason, you hesitated. Guess there\u2019s really no going back now, is there? You try not to show any fear as you step inside, and turn around to watch the huge, concrete doors at the entrance of the maze slide closed. Eventually, the doors slammed together, and the loud cheering and jeering of the crowd was completely silenced. You were alone. You stood there for a while, looking at the maze, pondering your next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you were alarmed by the sight of a small robot flying through the air down the hall! You were blinded for a moment when it shined a spotlight down on you, but when you looked at the robot, you realized it was actually a giant camera, recording your every movement! <i><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAnd it looks like our latest contestant has officially entered the maze! There\u2019s no going back now!\u201d</span></i> Putrina\u2019s voice emanated loudly from a loudspeaker on the side of the robot. You stood there for a moment, dazed and confused. <i><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh, she looks a little lost! What happened to all that bravado, dear?\u201d</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat line caused you to jump into action! You couldn\u2019t let anybody think you were a coward! You started strutting down the hallway of the maze with as much confidence as you can muster. The cold, concrete walls all around you were huge and blank, and the maze didn\u2019t have a roof; instead, you were treated to a full view of the beautiful nights sky above. It was actually kind of cool looking, but you couldn\u2019t get distracted. You had to keep an eye out for any potential threats! Meanwhile, as you walked, the robot followed along behind you in the air, recording your progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh! There she goes! Making her way towards the first branching path!\u201d</span></i> Putrina announces. Sure enough, you soon have to choose between two hallways; one on the left, and one of the right. <i><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNow, since you\u2019re just starting off, I\u2019m gonna give you a little hint. Down THAT hallway is a stench challenge -\u201d</span></i> the robot shined its spotlight down the hallway to the left -  <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cand down THIS hallway is a more sexual challenge -\u201d</i></span> the robot shined its spotlight down the hallway to the right. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cThey\u2019re both pretty stinky, though, so you better be ready!\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider it for a moment. Your nose wasn\u2019t that accustomed to stench, so the sexual challenge would probably be easy; but then again, that would just be giving that perverted audience exactly what they wanted.

You\u2019ve stunk like hell for weeks, and you\u2019ve gotten used to your own BO. How could anyone else\u2019s be worse? With that in mind, you head confidently down the hallway to the left, prepared to face whatever trials awaited you. Of course, it was one thing to think about noxious smells, but once they were actually assaulting your nose, it was a different story entirely. Your bravado thus faded once you travelled farther down the hallway, and a terrible stench overwhelmed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused when you find the hallway blocked by a big olympic-sized swimming pool, complete with a single, huge 10 meter tall diving platform! More notably, though; it was the grossest damn pool you\u2019ve ever seen. The water was murky and green like a swamp, and the entire thing smelled like farts. In fact, as you\u2019re standing there, an immense, green bubble floats up out of the water, rising high into the air before popping, sending noxious green gas everywhere! You gag and cough at the spectacle! <i><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAre you wondering what those bubbles are? Well, trust me; you don\u2019t want to know!\u201d</span></i> Putrina laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cTrust me, though; you DON\u2019T want to get caught in one of them!\u201d</i></span> She warns. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to want to make it to the other end of the pool as quickly as you can! Hope you\u2019re a strong swimmer!\u201d</i></span> You sigh. You\u2019re definitely not a strong swimmer, though you can probably make it to the other end of the pool at a moderate rate. If you wanted to truly beat this challenge, however, you should probably use the diving board for an easy head start. You didn\u2019t like the idea of jumping from such a tall height, but you also didn\u2019t want to look like a coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, there you were, 10 meters over the swamp water, preparing to jump into the disgusting pool head-first. This was going to absolutely RUIN your outfit, but you hear that the maze provides a change of clothes at each rest stop. With that, you get into position, and hesitate for a while\u2026 before finally diving it! Landing in the deep, warm water from that height knocks the breath out of you, and you linger around underwater, disoriented for a moment. Despite your better judgement, you can\u2019t help but open your eyes\u2026 and through the murky water, you can see two, reptilian eyes staring back at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crocodile woman in this pool! From the surface, she was completely invisible in the murky water, but just from getting a glimpse at her, you can tell she\u2019s absolutely humongous! You let out a little squeal which is completely drowned out by the water, as you swim up to the surface, gasping as you try to thrash towards the other side of the pool. The idea of there being a massive reptile in the pool that you can\u2019t see was terrifying to you! You never knew when she might strike! Hell, she might be beneath you at this very moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swim through the swamp-like swimming pool as fast as you can, constantly fearing the gator girl\u2019s attack. Suddenly, there\u2019s a rumbling from below\u2026 and one of those huge bubbles rises from the water! To your horror and disgust, you realized that those stink bubbles were actually the gator\u2019s giant, magical fart bubbles! You try your best to avoid it, but to your surprise, the massive stench bubble somehow envelops itself around your body, bit by bit. Soon, you were trapped inside the stench bubble as it rose up into the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a squeal as you\u2019re lifted higher and higher into the night sky, trapped in the green, magical bubble. Or at least, you try to squeal; but when you try to take a breath, you realize the only air you have to breathe was the gator\u2019s flatulence! The air in here was the absolute worst thing you\u2019d ever smelt! Worse still, somehow the bubble seemed to be damn near solidifying around you, the walls squeezing down around you and trapping you in a bubble made of pure farts. Panicked, you try to scratch at the walls before its too late\u2026 and sure enough, the bubble pops, and you fall back down into the pool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately emerge from the water, gasping for fresh air! That was insane! You had no idea how any of that was even possible. All you did know was that you had to make it out of this pool as fast as possible! You feared that just swimming on the surface, though, would make it easy for the gator to catch you in another bubble. Maybe if you swam down below, you could evade them\u2026 but then again, the gator herself might just snatch you down there...</span></div></div>",

Of course, you weren\u2019t. A reptile like her was at home in the swamp, and you, on the other hand, were hopelessly out of your element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the robot continued shining its spotlight down on you, illuminating your desperate attempts to escape from the pool. The audience watching over the video feed was laughing their asses off, watching the once overconfident hyena start panicking and freaking out at the first sign of adversity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you swim, you hear another rumble underwater, and soon, another huge bubble floats up from the water just a few feet away from you. For a moment, you assume she missed; but you quickly realize she was just taunting you! Trying to make it clear that she could capture you any time she wanted, and there was nothing you could do about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, just as you were about to escape from the pool, you lifted your head from the water to take a breath, only to realize there wasn\u2019t much air to breathe! Your eyes shot open, to see only the night sky through a blurry, shiny green filter. As you floated up into the air, you realize you were trapped in another fart bubble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOh no, no, no, no!\u201d</b> You said, immediately panicking. Yelling was a bad idea, however, as you quickly used up the fresh air in the magical \u2018bubble\u2019. Soon, all you had to breath was the noxious gas of the alligator\u2019s flatulence! You coughed, gagged and sputtered as the bubble floated up into the air, feeling the horrible stench stinging your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you felt the walls of the \u2018bubble\u2019 start to solidify again! Every second you spent trapped in here, the bubble became harder and harder to pop. You try scratching at the walls, but you were just too drowsy to really muster up any solid resistance. All you could do was squirm around as the bubble floated higher and higher into the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you were completely trapped inside the noxious fart bubble! Of course, that didn\u2019t make any sense at all\u2026 but Putrina\u2019s magic was known to be as powerful as it was confusing. You weren\u2019t about to question the logistics of it; all you could think about was the horrible stench that was assaulting your nostrils, depriving you of any fresh, clear air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the bubble reached its peak, and you were given a clear view of the maze from up above. It was actually rather beautiful up here, although your view was obscufated by the blurry green bubble. Of course, as it \u2018solidified\u2019, the bubble started drifting downwards, back towards the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOh, and it looks like Zakia is already down for the count on this one! Losing to the first challenge is DEFINITELY not a good way to start off  a run! I\u2019m not seeing much hope for this one, folks!\u201d</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panicked a bit at the bubble sunk beneath the water, thinking you might drown or something somehow. Hell, you hardly knew what was going on. Luckily, even as you drifted down into the swamp and your entire vision was taken up by green, you could still breathe, although all you had to breathe was rank fart fumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there, wriggling and whimpering, trapping in a magical fart bubble beneath the swamp. How the hell did you get into this mess! As if to add insult to injury, your look up to see the tall, busty crocodile lady\u2019s huge face looming over you, a smug smirk as she admires her little \u2018captive\u2019. Yeah, yeah, she trapped you with her fart. Real funny. Laugh it up, lady. You swear, if you ever get out of here, you\u2019d deck that alligator...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, she started batting the bubble around through the water! You let out a little yelp as you started getting rolled around in the stench bubble. Not only were you drowsy and disgusted, but now, you were dizzy, too! Your yelps are completely muffled by the thick swamp water as the gator bats the bubble all around, treating it like a toy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her playing around stops, and the bubble sinks to the bottom of the pool again. By this point, you were far too dizzy and disoriented to try and escape, or even to stay awake. Having to subsist solely on fart fumes to breathe was taxing on your health, as you can imagine. With a little sigh, you feel the last of your energy leave you, and you slowly slip into unconsciousness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><span class=\"cred\"><i>Lives Remaining: 4/5</i></span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up some indeterminate amount of time later, waking with a start as if from a night terror. In fact, that\u2019s what you wanted to imagine the day\u2019s events as being; just a bad dream. Unfortunately, you had no such luck. You were sitting on the other edge of the pool, now, still covered in swamp water, stinking of farts and nursing a headache after what had happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up\u2026 only to yelp in surprise to see the alligator leaning up out of the water! Now that you saw her in all her glory, without being obscured by the blurry water, you realized just how massive she had to be. She must be about 12 feet tall or something! <span class=\"clgreen\">\u201cHey, sugar. Just wanted to say, thanks for having a swim. It was fun~\u201d</span> With that, the gator gal disappeared beneath the water once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered as you stood up. While that stench torture had been miserable, the humiliation on live television was even worse. With that, you continued down the hallway, noticing that your clothes are still absolutely drenched in stinky water. You travel down the empty halls, still reeling from the humiliation, until you come across another branching path...</span></div></div>",

You stop for a moment, trying to come up with a plan in a split second. You had to think outside the box. The bubbles rose, so maybe\u2026 if you swam along the bottom of the pool, you could avoid them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat option had its own host of difficulties\u2026 but it was worth a shot. With that thought, you dived deep below the murky green water until your hands were touching the floor. Then, you basically crawled along the floor of the pool, kicking off with your legs to build up momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated it, but you occasionally had to peek an eye open to check for that humongous gator chick. Sure enough, there she was, just a few meters away, looking a little surprised to see you down here. She was expecting to simply torment you from below, but instead, you had opted to face her on her own turf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you didn\u2019t have nearly the lung capacity she did. It wasn\u2019t long before you had to submerge and gasp for air. While you\u2019re up, you can hear Putrina\u2019s voice saying something, but you ignore it. You only took a \u2018break\u2019 for a few seconds before continuing, and yet still, when you dived back down, you found the gator had repositioned herself, and was now waiting for you down below!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you realize what she had planned, it was too late. Before you could react, the gator girl grabs you with her big, scaly hands, pulling you down to the bottom of the pool. Your scream, which would\u2019ve gone unheard in the water anyway, was further muffled as your snout was pressed up inbetween the alligators tits, as she holds you tightly against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her, seeing the big, toothy grin on her huge, long snout. You didn\u2019t know what she had planned, and you didn\u2019t want to know. With a determined look on your face, you reached back\u2026 and punched her right in the snout! The water dulled your punch, so it didn\u2019t really do anything damage, but it was enough to make her let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was clutching her snout in pain, you immediately swim back up to the surface of the water, thrashing through the water as quickly as you could. You could just tell the reptile was approaching you from down below. Almost there\u2026 almost there\u2026 just a few more meters\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you finally grabbed the other end of the pool, you felt the alligator grab you by the ankle from below, and try to pull you under! After punching her in the nose, she probably wanted to give you a faceful of ass or shove your snout in her armpit or something. You couldn\u2019t let that happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold onto the side of the pool for dear life, kicking at her hand with your free foot. Unfortunately, the massive gator was just too strong for you, and it was beginning to look hopeless. Suddenly, though, Putrina\u2019s little robot swooped down! <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cHey! She made it to the end of the challenge! You\u2019re supposed to leave her alone!\u201d</i></span> Putrina shouted, sounding outraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the little robot fired an electrified charge of some sort into the pool! Somehow, it didn\u2019t zap you, but it did stun the alligator, causing her to lose her grip on your ankle. Seizing the opportunity, you rolled out of the pool in a single moment, before booking it down the hallway as fast as you can, terrified that the gator was going to climb out of the pool and chase you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t seem to be the case, though, so all you managed to do was wear yourself out. Eventually, you leaned against a nearby wall, panting and exhausted. The little flying robot soars over to you. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! Some of my guardians can get a little carried away sometimes!\u201d</i></span> Putrina\u2019s voice reassures you. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cYou got to the end of that challenge fair and square. Good job, newbie! Unfortunately, the next one might not be so easy\u2026\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was good, at least. But you were starting to grow a little nervous about this maze! Apparently, with Putrina\u2019s magic, literally anything was possible! You were going to have to keep a cool head and think outside the box if you were going to complete these challenges. You take a break there for a moment, getting your bearings, before continuing down the winding hallways of the maze. Sooner or later, you come across another branching path...</span></div></div>",

Next to it, there was a big, square hole in the ground that seemed to lead down into complete darkness, Silent Hill style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cBet you\u2019re wondering how to open that door, huh? Well, the key is hidden away somewhere in here; a pit stuffed with 1,000 kilos worth of sweaty ol\u2019 gym socks\u2026 all donated by members of our lovely audience! Yep! It\u2019ll be like finding a key in a stinky, stinky haystack,\u201d</i></span> she laughs. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cCareful, though! The last guy who crawled in there\u2026 well, the stench sorta drove him nuts. We still haven\u2019t been able to convince him to come out. All things considered, he\u2019s probably deranged, unpredictable, and extremely smelly. So\u2026 watch out for that!\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot turns to shine its light on the hallway to the right. There, you beheld a huge, fancy monastery-looking building, with all sorts of magical trinkets and artifacts. On the roof, there was a big sign showing an ancient-looking old fox man, with squinting eyes and a big bushy beard, surrounded by unbelievably busty anthro women of all shapes and sizes writhing on the ground in orgasmic bliss. In big red letters, it read; <i>Behold the might of Aqazohr, the Sex Wizard!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cYou think that sounds difficult? Well, wait till you see what the amazing Aqazohr can do! Our resident warlock is a mystical kama sutra known throughout the lands! Not only is the very air in his monastery a potent psychic aphrodisiac, but with his telekinetic powers, he can overwhelm you with pleasure without even lifting a finger!\u201d</i></span> She explains. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cIf you don\u2019t think you can handle all that, you can try just knocking him out. Sure, he\u2019s physically weak\u2026 but if you lay a finger on him, you\u2019ll awaken his golems! And trust me when I say that, if one of his golems gets their hands on you, you\u2019ll be walking funny for a week!\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there for a moment, considering your options carefully. Both of them sounded\u2026 absolutely awful, to be honest. There was no turning back now, though, so you had to pick the one that was least likely to humiliate you. Eventually, Putrina starts bitching at you to hurry up, so you\u2019re forced to choose...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, you begrudgingly decided that the hallway on your right was your safest bet, even though you definitely weren\u2019t looking forward to whatever kinky trials these weirdos and perverts had in mind for you. You step down the darkened hallway, only to eventually realize it was modelled after a\u2026 graveyard? Well, that wasn\u2019t very sexy. You stand there for a moment, confused, wondering exactly what the challenge here was supposed to be. The moment you cautiously stepped foot onto the dirt of the graveyard, suddenly, the doors of the various mausoleum started sliding open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the mausoleums, emaciated-looking furries with blank, glowing green eyes emerged, moaning like ghosts. They were all wearing nothing but tattered rags, and kept their arms stretched out in front of them while they walked for some reason. You immediately hid behind a nearby gravestone, peeking over at them. You noticed a wolf woman slowly stumble past, whispering something under her breath. When you strained your ears enough, you could hear what she was moaning. <span class=\"clgreen\"><i>\u201cCoooockkks\u2026. cooockkkss\u2026.\u201d</i></span> What the hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cAh, yes! Some of you in the audience might remember these anthros as some of our former contestants!\u201d</i></span> Putrina\u2019s voice perked up over the robot\u2019s speaker again, as it shined its spotlight down on the \u2018zombies\u2019, disorienting them. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\u201cThe poor dears ended up getting hypnotized, but their minds couldn\u2019t handle it, so they sort of\u2026 snapped. Now, sex is literally the only thing they can think about!\u201d</i></span> Indeed, you noticed some of the \u2018zombies\u2019 jerking off or blowing eachother, but most of them seemed to stumbling around in a daze, desperately searching for somebody to fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cBetter stay quiet now! They\u2019re slow, but there\u2019s dozens of them! And trust me; you don\u2019t want to get caught by the horde!\u201d</span></i> You shudder at the thought of getting gang-banged by an entire horde of these brainwashed fools. Not only is the blank, mindless look on their faces not very attractive, but they also stink like death! Luckily, they seemed pretty dim-witted and weak, so it would probably be easy to sneak around them, and even beat them in combat if you have to. You just had to make sure they couldn\u2019t take you by surprise, or outnumber you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try sneaking around the outer areas of the graveyard, but you soon find your path blocked by a wolf \u2018zombie\u2019 who was leaning against a nearby wall. As you grew closer, you realized he was stroking his hand up and down his surprisingly length, pink shaft, his tongue hanging from his mouth as he mindlessly jacks off. You flinch a bit in disgust. There seemed to be no way to sneak past him without him seeing you, so it seemed you were going to have to knock him out. Luckily, he wasn\u2019t very observant, so you were easily able to sneak up behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly reach forward and pull him off his feet, wrapping your muscular arm around the neck and locking him in a sleeper hold! He let's out a little grunt, but to your surprise, he doesn\u2019t even try to resist you. In fact, he just keeps jerking off! As the wolf slowly slips into unconsciousness, he let's out a little gasp, and sprays a prodigious amount of cum all over the ground in front of him. You gag a bit, as you let the unconscious wolf fall to the ground. <b>\u201cUgh! Nasty...\u201d</b> You whisper to yourself, disgusted. Were these really what remained of some previous contestants? How could they have been reduced to\u2026 this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, before continuing to sneak around the graveyard, taking care not to accidentally step in that canine\u2019s jizz. You manage to sneak halfway through the graveyard with ease, taking advantage of these brainwashed \u2018zombies\u2019 lack of intelligence. You grew too overconfident, though, and started getting reckless, not checking corners as thoroughly as you should have. Suddenly, a zombie you passed by without noticing grabs you from behind! <span class=\"clgreen\"><i>\u201cTiiiiitttsss\u2026! Tiiiiiitttsssss\u2026!\u201d</i></span> The brainwashed feline moaned, his manhood poking you in the back as he wraps his arms around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately spin around and elbow him in the face, and the \u2018zombie\u2019 falls to the ground, unconscious. Still, his shouting alerted the others, and you can already hear the other zombies moaning loudly, realizing there was a non-zombie in the graveyard. You can hear them shuffle steadily towards you from all around, and you start to get a little worried. From this spot, they probably have you surrounded on all sides\u2026 you are, however, fortunately next to mausoleum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to fight the horde, you can step into the mausoleum; the entrance is tight, so you\u2019ll only have to fight one zombie at a time. If you want to flee, you can try climbing onto the roof of the mausoleum and jumping from rooftop to rooftop, but if you slip and fall, you\u2019ll fall directly into the horde! You only had a few seconds to decide on a plan as the horny, hypnotized \u2018zombies\u2019 close in...</span></div></div>",

A scrawny, bookish lad, he's currently looking to get into college, but has no means of getting the money together without going into debt. When told about the maze, he was hesitant due to his sensitive nose and high libido, combined with his lack of physicality, but eased out when he learned that the audience can help a competitor if they like him enough.

You nearly went blind and deaf from the bright lights and the roar of the crowd respectively. You see the host, Putrina, standing by a door waiting for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, introducing our newest competitor, Rick West.\" She announces while you approach her. \"It's rare that we get a human to compete in this little contest of ours. Now then, this is normally the part where I send you in so you can get started, but I've been looking over your file, and I have to say that you are probably not going to last long in this little game. So, I feel like pulling out something a little special for you. I call it the 'pity trade'. How this little gimmick works is, you can 'sell' up to four of your five lives. For each one you sell, we'll give you  $50,000 even if you lose. But, since you'll have less lives to work with in the maze, you have a higher chance of losing early on. Take your pick. Will you sell?\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>Welcome to the StinkKink Maze, with your beautiful skunk hostess, Putrina Malodori! The nastiest, smelliest adult gameshow in existence! The prizes are immense, but so are the punisments for losing! Do you have what it takes to stay awake and keep it in your pants in the rankest place on Earth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules are fairly straightforward. If a contestant can make it to the end of the maze before losing all your \"lives,\" they win! If they lose all five lives, they lose! There is no time limit, and there are rest stops! The maze is full of traps, pitfals, and \"guardians\" all perfectly able to render contestants unconscious with stench! The audience is also welcome to join in on the fun! At every rest stop, the audience can vote to help or hinder the contestant with a variety of options. Contestants could end up with a stun gun, or buried under a pile of stinky socks at audience discretion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLives are lost in one of two ways. Either by passing out from stink, or by reaching an orgasm. Lives can be gained if a contestant manage to stink out one of the \"guardians\" patrolling the maze, but that's a rather difficult thing to pull off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a contestant loses all of their lives, they are brought to the Room of Judgement where our lovely hostess will spin the Wheel of Punishment to determine what the loser must endure! The ten possible fates are listed below:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. A full-body skunking from Putrina!<br>\r\n2. Life as Putrina's slave!<br>\r\n3. A new job as a maze guardian!<br>\r\n4. Getting petrified and made into a maze decoration!<br>\r\n5. A whiff of Putrina's sneakers, guaranteed to make you forget the past year!<br>\r\n6. Another go at the maze!<br>\r\n7. Being turned into clothes for Putrina!<br>\r\n8. A nice, long, brainwashing, ending with you becoming a slave to a guardian!<br>\r\n9. An entire day's worth of post orgasm torture!<br>\r\n10. Death by farts in the Stink Box!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContestants may come from all walks of life, even some light offense criminals may compete for the prize of early parole! At the start of each episode, we will show you a stat card for the current contestant with the following information:<br>\r\nName:<br>\r\nSex:<br>\r\nSpecies:<br>\r\nA Small Bio:<br>\r\nAnd the contestant stats, which are rated on a scale of 0 to 10:<br>\r\nStench: (The stink potential of the contestant)<br>\r\nSensitivity: (The contestant's ability to handle stink, higher means more succeptible)<br>\r\nEndurance: (How long the contestant can last before an orgasm lower means less time)<br>\r\nLikability: (How much aid the audience is willing to give you)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last thing, some guardians in the maze have green, softly glowing irises. These guardians are considered \"elite\" and should a contestant lose their last life to one, there is no punishment wheel. The elite decides their fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, only one elite guardian has been found by contestants, the Stinx! The Stinx is a huge Sphinx woman who at first, won't seem to smell at all. In actuality, she's enchanted her body so only a direct sniff will give someone that knockout stink! And when we say knockout, we mean nobody has ever stayed awake past one sniff. The Stinx will ask a contestant three riddles. If they get the first wrong, they'll be knocked out by her paws. If they get the second wrong, they'll be made to faint from her breath. If they get the third wrong, she will gas them out. If a contestant gets all three riddles wrong, the Stinx will keep knocking them out until no lives remain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's all for now! Tune in tomorrow for the first episode of the StinkKink maze!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaannnd now for a few author notes: Potential contestants can be human or anthro animals while guardians can be the same, or can be feral animals or mythological creatures like Sphinxes. No Pokemon this time unless there's a real big demand for it! Also, while some other kinks will be allowed, stink should obviously be the main focus, andas always, I don't want scat, watersports, or gore in this.</td>",
