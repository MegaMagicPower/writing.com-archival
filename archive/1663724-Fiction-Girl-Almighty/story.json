He now lay upon his bed awaiting the event that comes to all but, for him, the coming would be all too soon. He requested that Tohru be in his attendance for his final birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the day came Akito requested each member of the zodiac in turn to be with him. His last experience with Tohru had been a revelation for him and, with his role in the Sohma curse, found himself in communication with the gods and the deceased (in Shintoism they are almost one and the same). Now he wished to give each one a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Yuki he had a deep apology for the treatment he was subjected to as a child. For Hatsuharu he bore a warning about controlling the beast within the man. For young Kisa he had an apology as deep as Yuki's and praise for her dedication to Tohru. Momiji received a verbal quip with regards to his attitude and also a wish that his mother would remember and accept him for who and what he was. Hatori received part of what Kisa had received and part of what Momiji had received. Ayame got a quip and a half-serious caution as to his use of words around women. While the one who carried the horse was with him Tohru was whispering a variety of prayers on behalf of Akito. Hiro was given an apology and a warning about the treatment of others regarding etiquette and such things. Ritsu was a struggle due to his constant fretting but, in this instance, Akito remembered the story of the wizard of oz and so gave him advice about being courageous. As the one bearing the rooster listened to Akito now Tohru talked with the three she lodged with about the whole event. Then Shigure had to hear Akito, who thanked him for his advice and his capability of listening. Kagura was informed that marriage between members of the zodiac was not compulsory and that true love was to seek the happiness of the one you love. Kyo, the last of the zodiac, was informed that, while he was still not officially in the zodiac, he was welcome in any Sohma household and the isolation of the cat would not be as it used to. Then it was Tohru's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Honda,\" He addressed her as she sat next to his bed, \"For centuries the curse of the zodiac has taken the head of the Sohma family every time he reached thirty but, now you share this knowledge, things will be different. Transformation shall still be but... choice... love...\" Tohru didn't quite understand but she was already mourning for him. \"Miss Honda, the next head shall not die at thirty. They have chosen you... to... lead... Sohma... zodiac.\" Tohru was gobsmacked but she could not press for more information on this as those were his last words. A deep sigh was all that came as Akito lost all strength.</span></div></div>",

As she slipped into dreamland things started to happen. A gentle voice seemed to rouse her, whereupon she found herself floating in a black abyss with a shining figure looking at her. When she got used to the brilliance Sakura gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother?!?\" She breathed. Nadeshiko gave her daughter a nod. \"Where am I? How come I can see you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything will become clear.\" She answered. \"The fact is there's something you must know about yourself.\" Sakura gave her a bewildered look. \"Kinomoto Sakura,\" Nadeshiko whispered as she came closer, \"You are God.\" Sakura seemed confused and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't be.\" She returned. \"How can an ordinary schoolgirl be a god?\" She seemed uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just <i>a</i> god.\" Nadeshiko answered. \"I've been tasked with revealing your fate. When you wake up your full potential shall awaken too; you'll have self-control on par with the power to alter reality, you'll understand when the time comes. The fact is you must do one thing when that happens.\" Sakura looked even more confused. \"You must travel back to the very beginning of time and instigate the creation of all possible universes; just laying down the circumstances that'll ensure the propagation of the realities will be enough. Then you'll be at liberty to take the reins to our own universe.\" Sakura stared in shock, not sure if she could really believe that she was a deity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long Sakura stirred from her slumber and gradually sat up. Glancing at the clock she found it was still only midnight, but she felt something within herself. It was true! Now she could not only sense but also see spirits and had nothing to fear from them, her self-control was very strong indeed as it coupled to a burning sense of morality and she could now tell just how powerful she'd become. She possessed enough power to essentially wipe all of Tomoeda from existence, even ending any trace of the residents as easily as brushing away a speck of dust. It was frightening to think that everyone she knew could lose all they were just because she willed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Sakura felt a clear reassurance that she could undo any damage perpetrated and her morality and self-control could readily keep her might in check. Right now she had a task at hand. For a moment she wasn't sure how she could travel back to the beginning of all time, but a tingling sensation led her to the solution. She disappeared from her room like a flash</span></div></div>",

Upon reading the name 'Windy' out loud a great wind swirled around the basement and scattered the remaining 51 cards to the four corners of Honshu, and then the book's cover glowed and an ambulatory cuddly toy who called himself Cerberus (Ke-ro-be-ro-su) emerged. Next he told her what his role was and fretted upon discovering the absence of all 52 cards from the book, whereupon Sakura showed him the Windy card that remained in her hand and then was prompted to explain where the other 51 got to. This did not bode well with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sakura finished her dinner later on she took her share of dessert upstairs, telling her brother that she'd eat it while studying. In her bedroom she found that, despite his best effort, Cerberus could not locate any of the missing cards. In the next few minutes she learned that each of them held intense magical power and, unsealed and masterless, they would do whatever they pleased and perpetrate chaos throughout the world. Worse still a prophecy dictated that, if their seal broke, a catastrophe would befall the Earth. Then Cerberus demanded the last thing she expected, that she take on the task of recovering each and every one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an argument regarding Sakura's self-belittlement and Cerberus's 30-year long snooze he finally got to summon the key of the seal and persuaded Sakura to grb it upon its transformation into a staff.

Now Sonomi asked her to start making tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have time to walk to school, mother?\" Tomoyo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Sonomi considered, \"You'll be there with minutes to spare before homeroom starts. As long as a bodyguard accompanies you to the gate.\" Tomoyo was slightly disappointed as she wanted to try apparating from one place to another without being seen. Then she realised that she could stop people from remembering things or saying anything they could so she accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Tomoyo do to the bodyguard once she apparates?</span></div></div>",

And by 'unforeseen' I mean COMPLETELY FORESEEN!\" With that he pushed a button and sealed Perry inside a metal box before pressing a few more buttons, which produced a screen showing Perry inside the box and a microphone allowing for direct communication. \"You know, I figured every time you escaped traps like this it was because I left an opening big enough for you to exploit. Now my video/audio link will allow me to show you what's going on without your being able to reach outside of your quarters.\" Inside the box Perry looked at the screen and listened to his nemesis go on about this. \"Anyway I was thinking 'Doof, why are you not taking control of the tri-state area? Why do you always fail?' And it came to me in a flash. 'No one wants you to! Only an omnipotent being could accomplish this!' So, behold...\" He pulled a rope lifting a tarpaulin off a large metal ray gun, \"My deitinator!\" Perry's eyes went wide as he wondered what it did and how it was to be used. \"With this I shall become the all-powerful lord of the tri-state area! You see, Perry the Platypus, the deitinator reads off the probability of all possible outcomes of a situation and implants the ability to choose exactly which outcome will occur into one person. That person shall be me! Furthermore the power required to implant this ability is enormous so it can only be used once, after which the electro-magnetic buffers will overload and the deitinator will either short out or explode. Fortunately I will be able to focus the electrical shock of the explosive blast directly at your cell.\" With that Doofenshmirtz began the startup procedure while Perry hurriedly looked around for a convenient escape route that was characteristic of Doofenshmirtz's traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion is, what's going to go wrong for Doofenshmirtz?</span></div></div>",

Though the sun was below the horizon of Equestria She could still scan the world with such ease and detailed analysis it'd break the heart of the most ardent totalitarianist. She was looking over pony after pony who had some key connection to Her even if they themselves didn't realise it, their very psyches were being read like books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Luna was currently sitting upon the Royal Throne but She too was not actually concerned with the room around Her for the night was a quiet time in many parts of Equestria and She had another duty that held greater significance at this time, to watch the dreams of Her subjects. Normally She'd look in on many different ponies' dreams and only concentrate on a smaller number if She detected a potency be it emotional, psychological or even how lucid or vivid a dream might be. Nevertheless it'd only take one word from an awake pony in Her corporeal form's earshot and Her focus would shift as She saw fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia was performing an examination on Her subjects. She and Her Sister had discussed a delicate subject during dinner about who or rather what They were and if anypony in the world deserved to know the truth, especially in light of the results of previous revelations to Their ponies. Now Celestia kept Her mind spread across the world in search of anyone pony or otherwise who could not only take the information but also keep it to themselves if need be and avoid abusing such knowledge (for want of a better term). She had managed to narrow it down about an hour after midnight. The six ponies who had wielded the Elements of Harmony were an obvious choice and did indeed have clear aspects that not only made them eligible but quite possibly gave them the right to know, other candidates were the three fillies known by the residents of Ponyville at least as the Cutie Mark Crusaders for they were anomalous and were suffering for it so there was a possibility to give them a purpose in life. Still others presented themselves: Zecora the herbalist, Pipsqueak the young colt, even Lyra and Cheerilee could be considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia wrote out every pony eligible and why before deciding to practice the sweet ritual known to most as 'sleep'. As She settled down into Her ultra-huge bed She knew She had only a few hours before She had to rise again and raise the sun. She'd have to talk to Luna about who on the list should know.

I request that you and your friends come up to Canterlot and hold an audience with my sister and I at any date of your choosing, within the next month would be preferable. There is something we wish to talk to all of you about; something that could rock the very foundations of all that you knew and may even blow your minds if you're truly unprepared for it. However I feel confident that each of you can grapple with it in your own ways. Gratefully yours, Celestia.</i> She set the quill down and, in light of there being no one else around, merely thought the letter away through Spike's magical connection to Her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Twilight received the letter she immediately went round Ponyville to inform her friends, which led to them all gathering in the library to talk about this. Eventually it was agreed that Saturday would be the day to go and so Twilight dictated a letter back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Princess Celestia,\" She recited, \"We are all most honoured by your request and some clearly feel ready to down tools and gallop up to Canterlot right now.

Twilight had brought some books to pass the time and Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie had a few board games with them but, eventually, Twilight found that she couldn't get into her literature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, girls?\" She addressed the others. \"Is there anything we could talk about? As friends I feel we need to be a bit more open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are open with each other, aren't we?\" Rarity replied. \"What more could we talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's abou' religion?\" Applejack suggested. \"Since we're gonna have an audience with the Princesses Ah reckon it's time we understood where each o'us stands on the subject of a higher power.\" After a couple of minutes it was agreed to discuss what their views were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been an agnostic as long as I can remember.\" Twilight told them. \"There could well be a power beyond what sits in this world but until I can be absolutely sure I'm sitting on the fence as to whether there is or not. It could be that it's all a question of mathematics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Twi.\" Applejack answered in an amused and sceptical tone. \"Mah family's long been Celestialist and until somepony shows me otherwise Ah'm gonna stick with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Rainbow Dash shrugged. \"I've never really given religion much thought. I guess I actually agree with you on this one, Twilight. There could be a god or something that made sure we'd exist but since they aren't strollin' round doing things even a unicorn's incapable of I'm gonna stick with maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know much about religion but I've come to consider Dualism to be the most apt faith.\" Rarity told them. \"Of course I don't actually practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly fillies.\" Pinkie Pie blurted out. \"Surely Fausticism is the one true faith. The Almighty Faust wrote the universe and gave the world shape. How come so many ponies can't see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because we literally can't, Pinkie.\" Twilight pointed out. \"Fluttershy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Um...\" She answered hesitantly, \"Well I've come to think that Animism must be the closest to the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Twilight summed up, \"Rainbow and I think there could be a god but until proof comes to support either answer we're staying on the fence. Applejack believes Princess Celestia's the one true god, which leads me to wonder why you don't seem to react too much like she is when in the same space as her. Rarity thinks that both Princesses Celestia and Luna could be gods but hasn't yet decided if the Dualist movement is right. Pinkie Pie believes that the one true god is the unseen Faust, who's traditionally depicted as either a red maned alicorn or as a mythical primate. And Fluttershy believes that god's in all things, which makes sense for her to believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Twilight.\" Pinkie Pie interjected. \"The term is 'humanoid'.\" Twilight glanced up sceptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Faust exists and really is so powerful then portraying it as anything would be moot as it could take on any form it likes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long the train finally came into Canterlot station and the ponies made their way up to the...</span></div></div>",

Twilight and Rainbow Dash exchanged an apprehensive glance before curling up on the floor in a penitent fashion while Pinkie Pie simply leapt right into Princess Celestia's face after her over-long gasp finished and began to ramble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh.

To think all this time you could've just wiped us from existence like wiping some crumbs off your face and you just stood by and let us go all crazy and trash your own palace.

Are both of you in charge of everything or do you have some kinda divine demarcation? Hey!\" She returned to Celestia. \"Does that mean that you <i>are</i> the Sun? Which of you's gonna judge our souls when we're all dead? Can you pop over to the afterlife whenever you like?\" Considering that the revelation had only just occurred Celestia decided to mute Pinkie Pie and let her get it off her chest; since she was still in Her face She lifted Pinkie over to where she was sitting a moment ago and waited until she noticed that she was making any sounds and began gesticulating at Her. Celestia gave Pinkie Pie her voice back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll answer any questions you have as long as they're not too probing, for there are things that must remain unknown until mortality runs its course.\" She told them, Her gaze lowering to the five prostrated before Them and sighed. \"Please don't grovel. This is but one of the reasons why we rarely ever reveal this fact to mortals.\" Twilight was the first to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me, Princess.\" Twilight suddenly looked horrified, fearing she wasn't addressing Her properly anymore. \"But Rainbow and I are <i>agnostics</i>! Or, at least, we were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Twilight.\" She replied. \"I know what each of you believed until now. But don't blame yourselves for what you choose to believe. In fact there's some truth in each of them.

Little action was seen from Her although they weren't sure if She lifted a leg before they suddenly found themselves in a vast edifice with walls of gold, arched windows looking out into blue sky and a carpet so intricate it looked more like a painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a basic template of the kind of residence we can create, gloves-off, without it being mind-wrenching to any of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Basic?!?\" Rarity cried out as she fainted, a chaise longue appearing out of thin air to catch her. Unlike her standard fainting couch this was made of platinum and the red plush was replaced with mauve and felt like a thin silk sheet over pure air. These facts made her gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Art thou in good health, dearest mortal?\" Luna asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why God-Princess Luna.\" Rarity replied. \"Did you do this?\" A nod came back as an answer. \"Such honour, to be allowed to rest on such an exquisite creation of a power that I can't even begin to contemplate. I really must prove myself a worthy as possible. How about a temple? I shall labour day and night to build the best temple to Goddess Luna I financially can and quit the fashion industry to be your priest and live on grass and water.\" Before she could continue she was lifted up into the air so as to catch her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't go overboard!\" Luna declared. \"Thy skills lie with fashion and the use of gems. Besides 'tis no harder for us to manifest a chaise longue like that than it is for thee to stitch together a handkerchief. If thou genuinely feels a need to make something as a focus for the worship of us then a simple shrine within thy home shall suffice.\" She set Rarity back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to think of it,\" Rainbow Dash remarked, \"Would it be too blasphemous for me to ask that we can all have some seats?\" Celestia laughed in a cheerful manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" She answered. \"Feel free to request any kind of seat you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm gonna stick with a cloud.\" Immediately she found herself falling back onto one. \"Whoa. Mad weaving, Princess. Goddess. *humph* Can ya give us a ruling on what we should address ya as?\" Celestia shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use 'Princess', 'Goddess' or just plain 'Celestia'. As long as it's not too formal or too familiar we're comfortable with your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, ya sure are more liberal than Ah imagined, Princess.\" Applejack commented. \"Could ya possibly spare a worm like me a cushion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sooner said than done.\" Celestia giggled, pointed behind Applejack at a simple orangey-brown cushion. Applejack smiled with a hint of embarrassment and sat down. \"As easily as you can take a step can I make such a simple object.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah guess ya could wipe Sweet Apple Acres off the map like a pile o' sand.\" She laughed, clearly getting the hang of seeing her god as another pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Applejack. The valley in which Ponyville sits formed out of a single hoofprint.\" Everypony stared now, prompting Celestia to treat this as a minor slip of the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Princess, was it really one of <i>your</i> hoofs?\" Twilight asked in wonder. Celestia nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was millennia ago, before Equestria was even conceived. Could we put the full story of how I left that print on ice?\" They nodded, none of them yet willing to tempt Her into doing something drastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I... have a chair shaped like one of your horseshoes, Princess?\" Twilight blushed, whereupon she found herself in what was comparable to a dog basket in the requested form. She laughed at this. \"I guess I am your dog in a way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, could I get something filled with punch?\" Pinkie Pie asked, jumping up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easily.\" Celestia answered, creating an easy chair based on a water-bed but filled with a summer fruit punch. \"Although I fail to see what difference it'd serve having it full of punch rather than water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punch is sweeter than water.\" Pinkie answered. \"It makes a good source of an emergency drink.\" Celestia cocked an eyebrow, failing to see where this loopy mortal pony was coming from since she should've realised by now She could make an urgent drink appear out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy,\" She turned to the one pony left, \"What kind of seat would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I couldn't ask a god...\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little pony,\" Celestia lifted Fluttershy's chin with Her hoof, \"It's my pleasure to just think into existence whatever seating you'd most like, for you proved yourself worthy by being able to wield the Element of Kindness and return my sister to her former self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, can you see everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wish. Most of the time I forget anything that I'm going to encounter in my corporeal form anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, could you perhaps replicate my favourite chair from home?\" The instant Fluttershy finished, before she could even say 'if that's okay', she found herself sitting in what was an exact replica of that very chair. \"Oh... my.\" With that done Celestia and Luna manifested Their own choices of seat and manipulated the edifice so everypony was sitting in a circle.</span></div></div>",

Therefore we'll have a question and answer session right here, away from all other life.\" The six ponies glanced at each other as though they could debate telepathically even though this wasn't really the case. Finally Twilight voiced the apparent decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We accept your decision, Princess.\" With that they began. \"Come to think of it how was it that Nightmare Moon didn't just obliterate us?\" Celestia and Luna shared a look that spoke of sorrow and possibly regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, do you have any idea where I was when Nightmare Moon escaped?\" She checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Twilight mused, \"I assumed from all the events that you were trapped on the Sun by Nightmare Moon.\" Celestia shook Her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I temporarily erased the form you see before you and focused my efforts into restraining Nightmare Moon's power so she would be unable to destroy any of you directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is more,\" Luna added, \"At the time we were more influential underneath the dark shell and so could hamper the efforts of our demonic side from within. Nevertheless before we were exiled we had brought about the deaths of many, though the consumption of the nightmare could not reach any land beyond life and so our sister had to handle all judgements of mortals' souls and we had spent most of our first year back to our true self visiting our victims to see if they might forgive our misdemeanours and offer us a chance of penance.\" The goddess of the night now sobbed with deep regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor super-powered filly.\" Said Pinkie Pie. \"Tell you what, wherever I end up once I kick the bucket I'll go round everypony who died around that time and see they give you another chance to be their moon god again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thy willingness for self-sacrifice is commendable, Pinkie Pie,\" Luna replied, \"But don't trouble thyself with the burden of pardoning us for an afterlife is a place to either pay the dues of thy sins in life or to kick back and enjoy eternity however thou wishes. We are the one responsible for such actions as we spoke and so it is our responsibility alone to seek forgiveness and perform any penance necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

I'm the god of light, earth, fire, rain, silence, thunder, blades, flowers, strength, erosion, buoyancy, magic, battle, cycles, music, size, glass, projectiles, confectionery, birth, soap, walls, motion, speech, security and clouds.\" Now Luna began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we are the goddess responsible for darkness, air, water, flight, shadows, trees, sports, illusion, defence, time, storms, age, stars, sleep, puzzles, memory, speed, mountains, change, cold, justice, metal, snow, dreams, sand and synchronicity.\" There was a mixture of awe and confusion amongst the ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But aren't rain, water, clouds and snow all under the same umbrella?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the simplest levels, yes.\" Celestia explained. \"But cloud formation has been my responsibility because clouds and rain usually form through evaporation and evaporation is pretty much an effect of the Sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you the Sun or not?\" Pinkie blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a sense.\"  She answered. \"The Sun is a part of me just as what sits here is a part of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about when our time's up?\" Applejack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death is an unfortunate necessity of life.\" She answered. \"It is actually the seventh element of harmony, but it is not associated with the other six because it's not typically viewed in a positive light. At any rate the judgement of the souls of the dead lies with both of us as well as the Element of Death and the process is almost completely impartial; of course it was just me and the Element of Death for a thousand years or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considerin' what ya said earlier, Princess Luna.\" Applejack continued. \"Ah take it that y'all can visit a pony's afterlife whenever it takes ya fancy.\" Luna nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a fair amount of effort to cross over.\" She informed them. \"We have no need of sleep so we typically spend our sleeping periods either visiting ponies in their dreams or going over to the lands beyond life.\" Who asks the next question?</span></div></div>",

You see I don't actually possess a womb as you'd understand it; the whole thing about his being my grand-nephew actually stems from a little fun I had with his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather; later on, when he went with a mortal mare, they had foals but he bragged about my choosing him as a concubine and declared that one of his foals was my issue. Of course his spouse wasn't too pleased but didn't say anything, believing that I'd damn her for challenging what she thought was my divinity, and it sort of got a bit out of hoof.\" Half of the ponies now stared in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I hearing right?!?\" Rarity cried out. \"One of the two greatest powers in existence actually committed a carnal sin?!?\" Celestia sighed and raised a hoof, eliciting a terrified swallow from the mare in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because I'm a god by the standards of mortal life,\" She replied, \"Doesn't mean I don't indulge in forms of entertainment that are characteristically corporeal. About six thousand years ago I had six husbands and eight wives along with liaisons with over a hundred of each. The fact is taking on a corporeal form that typically bears sentience even among the nearest mortal equivalent allows us to experience new emotions, see creation in new ways and thusly develop our personalities.\" There was a pause. \"And please don't think you'll be smitten just for being curious as to our ways. We're not that kind of deities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me get this straight,\" Rainbow Dash checked, \"You were both around for almost as long as reality, but didn't have bodies until ten thousand years ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thy deductions are near the mark but misguided.\" Luna answered. \"We began as self-aware concepts, essentially more intelligent versions of the elements of harmony, but as our existence progressed we developed and took on some new senses of purpose. After complex life was created we manifested in forms familiar to organic creatures now and again both for our own entertainment but also to aid in dealing with Discord. After our final confrontation with him, aided by the elements, the following that had developed among the ponies of Equestria among a number of other factors meant that we felt obliged to take on nigh-permanent corporeal forms and become both religious and political figures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the short version of how we came to be who we are now.\" Celestia explained. \"Equestria is currently the only nation of the world where we rule directly, as what had been termed royalty; all other sapient beings are presided over in a more indirect, religious manner where we are known by other names and have different physical representations.\"</span></div></div>",

There may be a point when I'll let a few other members of your family know that I really am a god and then explain that they've muddled some parts of the doctrine, so to speak. Secondly if any of you come up with ideas that only we could realise, then don't be afraid to request an audience with us to discuss the options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Luna acknowledged, \"If we disagree with thy concepts then we shall provide some explanation as to why but still commend thy efforts and if we agree such an idea will be carried out within a month's time of receiving it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirdly,\" Celestia continued, \"Though our power within this universe is as close to omnipotence as makes no odds for anyone other than ourselves we also have lesser god-like influence in some other universes where we may take a break and... well,\" She smirked, \"<i>Let ourselves go</i> as well as the power to generate pocket dimensions where our powers are well and truly omnipotent; there may well be times when we'll ask any or all of you to join in, though you are well within your rights to refuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beginning to realise what my Smarty Pants doll must have felt like.\" Twilight jibed, at which Celestia giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except that a normal doll doesn't receive compensation for being played with.\" She returned. \"Any loss of business or similar will be reimbursed with extra bonuses if you find our style of games a bit too intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that risk abuse o' the system?\" Applejack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when you can instantly tell if somepony's trying to pull one over.\" Celestia answered with a wink. \"And finally, don't think for one moment that any effort you make to entertain us in more mortally-conventional ways would be unworthy; I can't speak for Luna on this one but I'm more than happy to experience simple everyday celebrations whenever I can spare the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... that is, I personally...\" Luna added, \"Find joining in with such simple non-magical pastimes to be a most delightful way of getting in touch with the mortal mind-set.\"</span></div></div>",

Think back to your days on the rock farm, Pinkie, they were the extreme form of this where the idea of 'fun' was sinful, except that it was no longer taboo by your time, it was just how they always did things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's leave that behind for now.\" Pinkie Pie declared. \"What say we all agree to being part of your toy box?\" There was a general sense of ambivalence in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Pinkie,\" Celestia ventured, \"Though we both appreciate your sentiment, we are morally obliged to avoid just whisking you away simply because we feel like it. Instead what would happen is that each of you would be sent an invite for a 'special holiday' and you'll all be at liberty to decide whether you can truly spare the time, in light of the fact that the six of you alone know truly what we are.\"</span></div></div>",

Another transformed into a doorway leading back to her quarters. \"Anypony wishing to experience this adventure, please step into the magical portal.

Twilight gave Celestia a slightly uneasy look before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, every time we were together you had the power to not only destroy me but make it so I never existed?\" The princesses exchanged a concerned frown before Celestia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only as you can perceive existence. Truth is, were I to try and obliterate you from history it would leave you as a primitively-minded spirit swirling in a state of limbo, waiting for another chance to exist.\" An awkward pause descended on the space before Celestia gave Twilight a reassuring hug, during which Twilight wondered if Celestia had actually moved from her seat or had actually been in two places at once for a split-second. \"Do not dwell on what I can do. Should there come I time where I would try to destroy you, my sister and the elements of harmony would surely reduce such power to a meagre killing blow typical of a powerful unicorn.\" Twilight then, despite Celestia's earlier statements, kissed her hoof before departing through the portal following her friends. The godly sisters gave each other a momentary look that had them passing a series of feelings before vanishing from the room. The room itself also vanishing in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and her friends were whisked through a wild prism of colour to a world that the princesses had made only minutes ago.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Celestia sat in her room looking over some of the friendship reports Twilight and her friends had sent. It was a bizarre mix of morality and naivete as they both showed strong compassion and virtuosity and at the same time unnecessary stubbornness and pride, amongst other things. Everypony in Equestria knew that she herself was the most powerful being in the land, which could sometimes be a bother as they behaved like she was completely untouchable when they beheld her in pony, and yet there was still behaviours amongst her little ponies that made it look like an immortal power was pure speculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPonies were still liable to pride and envy and some were even greedy; it all made her feel distant and lonely, even the company of her sister, Princess Luna, couldn't suffice for the absence of new faces. Always there were special ponies who she'd take an interest in and attempt to become reasonably familiar with but, sooner or later, their sands would run out and would have to go to that astral plain where she and her sister were truly all-knowing, all-powerful, all-seeing and everywhere at once. It was a state of existence beyond the understanding of mortals and even those who had been in that land beyond life for thousands of years couldn't wrap their minds round the idea, especially since Luna and herself were also going about their royal business back in Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes she was tempted to bestow somepony with the kind of power that she and her sister possessed constantly and, even more often, to grant them immortality in the world of the living. What always stopped her was the fact that nearly everypony under her sovereignty was too susceptible to abusing such power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bearers of the Elements of Harmony were the only ones who seemed to have any real chance, but there was no certainty about it; if she could just find out how they'd wield such power at least it would be an interesting diversion. Celestia thought long and hard about this: how to test them in omnipotence without making them aware of such judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still up, Cell?\" A familiar voice interrupted; she turned round to speak with Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking,\" She answered, \"About the fact that we're the only ones who can enjoy each other's company. Even though you have returned, Luna, I can't help but think about the possibility of introducing some other ponies to our perspective.\" Luna frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are aware that we must never do something like that unless we were certain that such a pony could handle themselves morally and responsibly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am. In fact, your being here has given me some inspiration. You are the one who has control over dreams, right.\" Luna nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, it would be impossible to check everypony's dreams in one night and repeating the spell may yield different results in ponies who had dreamed such a thing before.\" Celestia smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't thinking on doing it to <i>every</i>pony, just the bearers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight and her friends?\" Luna checked, Celestia nodded. \"It might work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why not, Luna? You in for a bit of dream-walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hand on, Celly, some loose ends have to be tied up first.\" Just before she left she added. \"Meet me in my room at ten o'clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" Celestia teased.<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was not surprised when she found Celestia on her balcony, staring at her stellar artwork, when she entered her room bang on ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you intend to investigate their potential, Celly?\" She asked. \"Is it your intention that we each take one at a time or are we going to visit each of them together... or is only one of us going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Celestia's choice?</span></div></div>",

I haven't probed a pony's dreams for 1,275 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Luna declared. \"Due to the nature of the dreams We shall focus purely on the humble town of Ponyville.\" With that she closed her eyes and concentrated upon the town in question and the task at hand. Rising slightly off the floor as her horn began to glow her forehead creased in the focus. Finally a strong blue flash shot from her horn and out towards Ponyville before she settled back down on the floor. \"It's all yours now, dear sister.\" Celestia smiled and responded with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind me 'dossing down' in your room for tonight.\" She was just about to initiate the 'astral projection' spell when Luna interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doss-sing down?\" The look on her face said it all. \"When did such a term come into use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It came about during the Assimilation of Capridia.\" Celestia answered. \"After a few centuries some capridian words crept into the Equestrian language as colloquialisms. 'Doss' was originally their word for 'sleep' but we've come to use it in the manner of temporary residence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Luna deduced, \"When a pony stops at an inn during a journey they 'doss' there?\" Celestia smiled with a touch of humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They 'doss down' there, Luna.\" She corrected. \"These days just using the word 'doss' means to indulge in activities restricted to a bed or similar space.\" Luna blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see no problem with your body resting here.\" She recovered the thread and Celestia resumed her spell. Luna timed her move precisely so when Celestia's magic reached the peak of the spell she moved in as the mind and spirit separated from the body, stablising the shell of Celestia's form and letting it slip gently onto the ground. Having shifted her sister's legs and head into a comfortable position she looked up. The astral form of Celestia was outside the perception of all normal senses, even magic could perceive no more than a vague shadow, but as a fellow-goddess Luna could identify Celestia's presence floating halfway to the ceiling. \"Good luck on your travels, dear Celestia.\" Small tears formed in her emerald eyes as her love for her sister bubbled up in the presence of all of Celestia's transcendental aspects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the Princess of the Night, Celestia knew the reason for Luna's tears but, even though they were both on par in their divinity, she couldn't communicate with Luna directly unless her sister decided to go astral herself; instead she projected a small portion of confidence to reassure her that she would be back by morning. A shift in Luna's features changed the subliminal message from 'I love you, Celestia. I don't want to lose you ever again.' to 'See you later. Be back in time for breakfast.' With that the invisible form of the Sun Goddess slipped out of the palace (not bothering with the balcony) and made for Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia mused over who she should visit first. Twilight was the obvious choice but her proficiency in magic meant that she could disrupt the Princess's examination for all the ponies, let alone herself. But still the chance was fairly slim. One pony she didn't want to start off with was Pinkie Pie, whose nature was so bizarre even She couldn't totally explain it. Who shall she examine first?</span></div></div>",

Predictably Twilight was asleep in her bed.

In reality she was in a new dream, though one that would be more lucid than usual. The sun was up and Twilight generally felt rested though groggy from rising.

A lovely sun rise greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like its going to be a wonderful day, time to wake Spike!\" Twilight said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut merely thinking it Twilight suddenly found herself in front of Spike, Spike rising slowly from his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up!

Ah could do all 'er chores and mine.\" As Celestia watched and listened she knew that she had missed the first part of the dream, wondering what it would mean when she came to the other ponies. Still it was interesting to see Applejack utilising such power in a mediocre way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom came cantering up to Applejack. \"Goodness gracious, Applejack!\" She declared. \"How did yer...?!? Wait, y'are Applejack, right?\" The farmpony emitted a slight laugh, lifting her hat without even touching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me all right, Apple Bloom. When Ah woke up this mornin' Ah could feel a strange but kinda delightful tone within mah bones. At first ah couldn' place it but when ah went t' make the bed it just instantly went from slept in t' made. It weren' till ah did a few try-outs at breakfast tha' ah realised that ah've somehow bin endowed with the power o' possibly ten unicorns or so.

Apple Bloom gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis,\" She asked, \"Where'd they all go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should be in the apple cellar.\" Applejack answered and thought for a moment. \"Would yer like t' go and have a look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" Apple Bloom replied. She just started off for the cellar when there was a sudden flash and the scenary around them changed from the bright open orchards to a dull dim-lit interior. Celestia had no trouble in keeping up with them as she would automatically link in with any scene in the dream where Applejack was. \"Oh wow, Applejack! You really made 'em all come here in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Applejack squeaked. \"These magical powers seem t' be developin' by the minute.

Now what next?\" Applejack asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...  as far as I can tell you've both our chores but.... could you get me a cutie mark? I'm sure with your new super powers you could zap one on!\" Applebloom pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Apple Bloom we both know that's not how cutie marks work!\" Applejack scolded. \"I could just zap one on, but what would be the point? Your cutie mark is a reflection of your strongest talent, and a guide for where to go in life. If I bypassed that process it would just be a meaningless picture on your behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom's head sagged in disappoint, but she seemed to understand what Applejack was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could help me try out some Cutie Mark Crusader ideas!\" Apple Bloom said with sudden eagerness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Because those always end so well...</i> Applejack thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I keep telling you, the best way to get your cutie mark is to chasing after random ideas and just focus on what your good at! Though like the rest of us its probably something Apple related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want an apple cutie mark! And I already tried and failed at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack sighed. \"I went through that phase to, but once I found my roots I had no problem getting a cutie mark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've helped out on the farm, sold apples and did every apple related chore I could think of, and I still got no cutie mark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm that is a tricky one...\" Applejack admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So could you help me try out ma list?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think this is the best way....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleassseeeeee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack sighed. She couldn't resist Apple Bloom when she made that look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but nothing dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Thank you Applejack your the best sister ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom ran to fetch her list. Applejack had a bad feeling about this... but how could she say no?</span></div></div>",
