You find the spacious emptiness comforting and warm, like a womb. You're unsure how long you've been here, but you feel as if it has been a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch your arms and legs and yawn. You feel like you've just woken up from a long nap. Everything feels fuzzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a few times and shake your head. It's a very strange sensation for sure, yet you feel familiar with it. In fact, it's less like a fuzzy feeling and more like a tugging feeling all over your body. It's not painful at all, very gentle in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few moments to feel it out, you decide to move, or float, in the direction you're being \"pulled\" to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move further and further into the white nothingness, the tugging feeling gets stronger, or maybe clearer. You can only assume that you're getting closer to the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time, the sensation reaches what feels like its climax. It changes from the feeling of being pulled and instead into a warm hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA figure slowly fades in before you. A small white dragon, slightly shorter than you. It's arms are wrapped firmly around your sides and it has its cheek resting against your chest. It seems satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think I'd find you first, Lost Soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dragon removes its arms from around your sides and steps back a bit, looking over your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Poficent. I'm a Resplendent Soul. Do you have a name you go by, or are you still undecided?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dragon tilts its head at you, seemingly eager to learn more about you. Though this opens up a bit of a conundrum for you. Your name has been the last thing on your mind since you've \"woken up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoficent notices your confusion and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright if you don't have a name yet. I didn't come up with one until a week after I woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon reaches out one of its clawed, scaly hands to you in a friendly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come with me for now and we can worry about that later? Assuming you want to of course.\" Poficent gives a small smile after saying that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the dragon in thought.</span></div></div>",

You're not quite sure why you both shook hands. You weren't exactly making a deal or anything. At least, you hope you weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your hand drop to your side and watch as Poficent turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might wanna cover your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your vision is completely overcome with an even bright white light. You can't see Poficent in front of you, nor can you even see your own hands covering your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think your eyes are about to burn out of their sockets, the light fades and you are in complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blindly reach your hands out in front of you and grab onto something hard and smooth with each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, those are my horns. Here, let me make it a little brighter in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a faint <i>fwoosh</i> as a small fire flows out of Poficent's mouth and lights a few candles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you remove your hands from the dragon's horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have some light, you can see the details of the room, or rather, the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not just your typical dank, wet cave. It fairly well furnished and clean looking. You know, for a cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoficent idly scratches their side as they sit cross-legged on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm sure you probably have at least a few questions, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. You feel like a newborn baby, to be perfectly honest. An explanation would be pretty nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, take a seat wherever you like and feel free to ask as many questions as you need. We've got all the time in the world, Lost Soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoficent places their hands in their lap and watches you as you walk over to what looks like a chair made out of rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in the chair and are pleasantly surprised to find that it's much more comfortable than it looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoficent fidgets with the scales on their leg as they patiently wait for you to ask your questions.</span></div></div>",
