You begin to stir with an audible groan, before flinging a pillow over your head to block the light.  Anything for just a little more rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drift back to sleep with ease, but awaken to a sudden ringing noise nearby just a few minutes later.  Grumbling tiredly under your breath, you rub your eyes and slowly sit up, stretching both of your arms as you let out a loud and drawn-out yawn.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hi Roran...\" says the familiar voice, which causes you to cringe.  You were never one for having enemies, but if you had to pick one person you trusted the least, it would be Kim.  Whenever she greeted you with that tone in her voice, it was always a sure sign that she was up to something.  Perhaps looking to trick or manipulate you, even blackmail you in some way.  You could practically hear her sly grin through the phone.  You mutter a swear under your breath, wishing you'd checked your caller ID first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Kim?\" you say, clearly not thrilled to hear from her.  You tried to sound as if you're in a hurry, but failed to mask the sleepiness in your voice.  Kim answers, feigning disappointment in a very cute manner as she always did.  You hated to admit, she was damn good at it. \"Aww, you don't sound happy to hear from me... And here I was, calling to be nice and invite you over.\"  You knew she was just trying to get in your head, but that didn't make it any easier.  You can't help but picture her signature pouty face that always made you weak in the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing a nervous lump in your throat, you retain your composure. \"Listen, you can't fool me anymore.  Even if I didn't know you were up to something, why the heck would I want to come over after all the times you've humiliated me?!\"  \"Well....\" she replied, her confident tone making you uneasy.  \"You're coming over one way or another.  I'm sure you wouldn't want certain... photographs being posted all over the school walls now, would you?\" \"What photos?!  You're bluffing!\" You snap.  Kim simply replies with a confident giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you wished she were bluffing, you could only think back to a few months earlier, when a fellow classmate arrived at school only to find a variety of embarrassing photographs of him up and down all the hallways, plastered on random lockers.  The poor kid was traumatized and had to transfer out a week later. Nobody ever found out who was responsible, but you knew it was Kim.  Her smug, satisfied expression practically confessed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short moment, you groan in frustration under your breath, realizing you had to comply.  Kim, knowing she'd won, cheerfully says \"Great! See you in an hour!\" before hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready dreading to find out what the day brings, you sigh and get up, going about your usual morning routine.  You shower, get dressed, eat a quick cereal breakfast, brush your teeth, and so on, before heading out the door nearly an hour later.  Unfortunately for you, her house was only a short walk away, and you arrive at her doorstep right on time.  You weren't exactly eager to find out what she wanted, but there was no turning back now.  You reach a hand up to ring her doorbell, but before you can, the front door swings open and you're greeted by...</span></div></div>",

You couldn't help but yawn, still recovering from your sleep as you got up and wandered into the kitchen. \"Oh hi Katie.  What's up?\" You said, trying your hardest to not sound tired.  You spot some donuts on the counter and quickly grab one, taking a bite.  Normally you'd wait till after the phone convo, but you're starving since you'd slept through breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, you sound like you just woke up... You haven't forgotten our plans for today, have you?  You said you were coming over for our Mario Kart re-match at 10 this morning..  It's almost 9:50!\" You nearly choke on your food, realizing you'd completely forgotten.  You didn't want to disappoint her, since she's the only girl you know who actually enjoys video games.  \"No, of course not!\" You say, trying your best to speak with a full mouth, unintentionally spitting crumbs everywhere.  \"I was just finishing breakfast, I'm heading out the door right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!

You take a quick shower, brush your teeth, dry off and throw on some clean clothes in no longer than 5 minutes, before you run out the door.  Luckily she only lived a few blocks away, but you'd still have to haul it to get there on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you reach her doorstep, you're completely out of breath.  Panting for air and hunched over with your hands on your knees, you reach up and ring her doorbell.  Before you even have time to remove your finger from the button, you hear the door swing open in front of you.  You look up to see Katie in the doorway, giggling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she's just a friend, you've always found her extremely cute.  Whether she knows that or not, you were never sure.  She has long, thick red hair that she'd normally kept in a ponytail, but today she left it messily draping over her shoulders.  She has pale skin, and a fair amount of freckles on her face, especially on the bridge of her nose.  She's fairly tall, standing a few inches taller than you.  She wore a loose white t-shirt and a pair of jean shorts, which hugged her thick athletic thighs nicely.  She wasn't skinny by any means, being a bit on the curvy side, but she was still in great shape as she was pretty active in sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you gonna come in or not?! We don't have all day.\" She playfully grabs your arm and pulls you inside, practically dragging you as she led you down to the basement.  She'd always had a perky personality, but for some reason she seemed unusually excited this morning.  You couldn't help but notice her grinning to herself, in an almost mischievous manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around once you reached her basement.  It was a very cozy, dimly-lit area with a large couch and a few sofa chairs positioned in front of a big screen TV.  On it was the title screen for Mario Kart, as she'd already had the Wii turned on with 2 controllers ready to go.  You eagerly plop yourself down on the sofa and grab a controller.  Just then, Katie suddenly steps in between you and the TV with her hands on her hips, looking down at you with a smirk.  \"Before we start, I was thinking... We've been played this same old game so many times now.  What if we made a bet with each other, to make things more interesting?\" She raised an eyebrow as she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..  That sounds fun actually, sure why not!\"  You say, scratching the back of your head lightly \"What would we bet though?  I was in such a hurry, I left my wallet at home..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie bites her lower lip, before responding.  \"How about... we do best out of 3 races.  If you win, I'll bake those cookies you love any time you want, for the rest of the month.  And if you lose, well... I get to do whatever I want to you...\"  You didn't like the way she was smiling at you.  You reply, \"Hmm... I don't know, that last part of the bet is pretty vague.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, afraid I'm gonna beat you again?\" She grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Don't get cocky, you've beaten me once and only once this past month!  Fine, you're on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yays cutely and plops down next to you, picking up a controller before saying, \"And remember, a bet's a bet.  You can't back out now.\"  You nod in understandment, and the two of you start the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the race, you stayed in the lead.  You couldn't help but smile to yourself, knowing all the delicious cookies you'd be eating soon.  From time to time you'd taunt her, reminding her of all the baking she'd soon be stuck doing, but she just shrugged it off, seeming strangely confident.  Finally, just as you near the finish line, you get nailed from behind with a shell and can only watch as she speeds passed you, winning the round.  She lets out a loud \"Ha!!\" and elbows you in the side, obviously payback for all your gloating.  You grumble under your breath \"Fine, that's just one... It's still best out of three...\" She sticks her tongue out at you, clearly excited about being 1 race away from winning the bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get ready to start the second race, curiousity gets the best of you, and you ask, \"So erm... what exactly are you planning to do, if by some slim chance you do win?... Not that you're going to.\"  She turns to look at you, biting her lip again before saying \"Well... you remember that time a few months ago, when I'd had too much to drink, and spilled my most secret erm.... fantasy to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, wh-...\" You go a little pale, starting to realize what she's implying. \"Why?\"  She simply pulls a tiny box out of her pocket and waves it teasingly while flashing you a toothy grin, before putting it away and winking at you.  You couldn't help but think back to the last time you'd seen it.  It was a few months before, she'd called you in a panic with a serious problem.  To make a long story short, her dog ate something it shouldn't have, and supposedly had shrunk and disappeared in her room somewhere.  You thought she was pulling a prank on you until you found it... sitting under her bed, no larger than the size of the bug.  That's when she first showed you the little box, full of pills.  She said she must've dropped one on the floor, where the dog later found and ate it.  For the next few days, she had to feign sadness after convincing her parents that it ran away during the night, at least until the effects wore off and it \"mysteriously\" returned to the doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts flash forward to a few days later, the two of you were leaving a party at 4 AM, and you decided to walk her home.  She was pretty wasted at the time, and you let curiousity get the best of you, by asking why she had the strange shrinking pills.  And that's when she opened up to you as a vorarephile.  She spilled every little vore fantasy she thinks about, every possible way it can be done, every entry way she'd want to vore someone through.  She'd left you speechless, as you'd never heard of anything so twisted and bizarre as vore.  It took a while to sink in, but you were okay with it, and promised to keep her secret as long as she promised to never try to fulfill her fantasy on anyone without their consent, knowing nobody would be crazy enough to wish something as horrible as vore upon themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your thoughts as you notice her staring at you lustfully.  \"Well you DID agree to our little bet... so it's not exactly without consent\", she says with a cocky grin.  This whole bet was just a loophole for her, and it was clear she couldn't contain herself any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to think of a way out of the situation, you glance at the stairway, knowing it's the only exit.</span></div></div>",

You barely make it two steps before she sticks a leg out, tripping out and sending you flat on your chest.  Before you have a chance to get up, you feel her weight press down on your back as she straddles you, pinning your wrists above your head in the firm grip of her hands.  Regardless of how helpless a position you were in, you still try to squirm free.  \"Ah ah ah.\" She says, playfully. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.  If you try to break a bet, you automatically forfeit, silly.\"  She giggles to herself as you stop struggling beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!  Just let me up, I'll be good... You only got lucky with that first race, you know...\" You say hopefully.  She slowly climbs off of you and sits back on the sofa.  As you get up, she pulls you into her lap with your back against her chest, wrapping her thighs around your waist and folding her legs firmly in front of you.  \"Just to be sure..\" she says.  You knew there was no getting away from her now, as those countless days playing volleyball and softball really paid off for her leg strength.  \"Should we get started?\" she said as she ran her fingers through your hair playfully, the tips of her fingernails brushing across your scalp and sending a shiver down your spine.  Normally you'd enjoy it, but you knew she was trying to distract you.  You pick up your controller, before taking a deep breath and saying \"Ready when you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second race begins.  The two of you play with everything you have this time, and you're too focused and nervous to taunt her at all.  For the first half, she is pretty much in the lead.  Her thighs seem to tighten around you as her excitement grows.  After every trick she uses against you to keep ahead in the race, you can hear her chuckle or giggle to herself, or occasionally saying \"You're mine!\" in a taunting manner.  In the second half of the race though, you took the lead, and she became quiet.  You were finally able to relax a bit, smiling cockily to your self.  You kept this up for the rest of the race, and could hear her breathing growing nervous and heavier so close to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finish line was finally in sight, and just as you were about to celebrate, you heard that dreaded sound as your kart gets pummeled by a shell.  \"Gah!\" is all you can say as she breezes passed you, winning the race yet again.  The color drains from your face, and you know you've just sealed your fate. \"Yes!\" she shouts with excitement.  You stare at the dreaded \"Player 1 Wins!\" message blinking on the screen in disbelief, before you suddenly feel her hands reach your mouth from behind, one quickly holding your mouth open while the other tosses a pill in.  Before you can react, she pushes you over on the couch and climbs on top of you, straddling your stomach as she stared down at you with a broad, devilish smile, one of her hands clamped tightly over your mouth. \"That's it.. just swallow.  You're mine now and you know it, so there's no point in resisting.\" She says with a giggle.  You hated how cute she was, even when she had your life in her hands.</span></div></div>",

Before you know it, you're shrinking before her very eyes.  From your perspective, she seems to be growing larger and heavier as she stared down at you, your clothes starting to feel loose.  The process was agonizingly slow, and you knew it'd be a few minutes before she could get on with the next part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lie there helplessly pinned beneath her, she slowly begins to remove your clothes and toss them aside.  \"You wont be needing these anymore.\"  Once she'd removed your boxers, she stops and blinks for a moment, noticing your hard member, and starts to giggle with a hand over her mouth.  \"Well I'm flattered, but don't think it'll get you out of this.\" she says, laughing a little at your embarrassment and flushing face.  Even knowing you're about to be snuffed out inside of a giant girl, you still couldn't help yourself.  Finally you muster up some courage to speak. \"H-how exactly do you plan to... do this?  I mean... which way will I be... er.... you know.\" You trail off, knowing she'd understand what you were getting at.

At this point, you weren't much more than a foot tall.  She no longer had you pinned down, but instead she simply towered over you as you were backed up against the arm rest, knowing you had nowhere to run at this point.  You had to admit she always had a very cute nose, but you know that's not going to make this any less gross or awful for you.  It was a little long, thick and fleshy, but not overly so that it would appear unattractive to anyone.  Your gaze travels from the tip of her nose, up along it's freckle-covered bridge, which you knew you'd soon be trapped inside and disappear into.  You couldn't help but shudder at the thought of it.  As she looked down at you, her nostrils seemed to flair ever so slightly, almost in a hungry manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bites her lower lip with excitement as she watches you shrink, before saying. \"Welp, I'm sorry to say, I'm sure it'll be gross for ya.\"  She snickers.  \"But just be thankful, as there's much worse places I could be putting you...\"  She brings her face closer to you. \"And have thought about putting you, so many times...\"  By the time you stop shrinking, you're only an inch tall.  With a satisfied smile, she picks you up between a thumb and finger and sits up straight, lifting you right up beneath her nose.

You shudder, wishing you had free arms to wipe some of her sticky saliva off of yourself.  \"Mmm... to make your trip a little easier.\" She smirks.  You can't help but notice her nostrils flaring very slightly in anticipation in front of you. \"Well... since you've been nice enough to sacrifice yourself to make my fantasy come true, I figure I'll do something for you in return.

Suddenly the string slowly being to draw itself in, lifting you ever so slowly towards the dark abyss above.  You could tell Katie was smiling, pleased with herself.  You couldn't figure out how it was possible.  Before you can think on it too hard, she senses your confusion.  \"I guess now's as good a time as any to tell you...\" She says. \"You see Roran, I'm a witch.  Well... in training that is.\" You listen nervously, staring up as the string continues lifting you towards that dark orifice, not meant to sustain human life.  You start to notice all the hair now visible as your head neared her nostril, causing a shiver to run up your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues, \"I found an ancient book a few months ago on vorarephilic dark arts, and I just knew from the minute I opened it that I just had to try this on you... I'm sure you're wondering why I chose this unusual, gross method out of them all.  Well... it's because this is the only method that will allow me to absorb not only your body, but your soul as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying!\" You shout, hoping she's bluffing.  She simply laughs, a wide grin appearing on her face before she responds, \"Oh, am I?  Well, you'll just have to wait and find out then.\"  You begin to struggle knowing now's your last chance to get free of the string, your head already beginning to enter her nose as her nostril flared with hungry anticipation.  She continues, \"I know this seems like a disgusting way to go, but I think you'll enjoy it in the end...  You'd best accept the fact that you're mine, and you'll be nothing more than a part of me in a matter of minutes.\" She giggles, scrunching her nose above you teasingly.  Just then, your head and shoulders slowly slide inside, the last light you'll ever see being blocked out as her fleshy nostril was a little tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all too much for you, and you begin kicking your legs and screaming as you're drawn in further, the tickle of her nose hairs creeping down over you and making it an even more distressing experience.  From the outside, you made a vague bulge within the outside of her fleshy freckled nose, which distorted slightly from your struggles.  Soon, your arms and chest were gone from sight, with the rest of you soon to follow momentarily.  Katie found herself growing excited by your muffled screams, and quickly slides one of her hands into her panties.  Slowly she starts rubbing, pleasuring herself to your cries and helpless struggles.  \"That's it... Scream for me, don't stop squirming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe that a body part so soft, cute and delicate was about to devour and absorb you, both body and soul.  Soon your hands and waist are pulled into her, followed by your legs, which then became constricted in the soft tunnel along with the rest of you, leaving you no longer able to kick them.  Losing hope, you decide to stop struggling, but that quickly changes when you notice how slimy the walls around you were becoming, seeming to be coated with more and more mucus, the further you went.  Realizing how disgusting this really is, you get your second wind and resume struggling and screaming.  At first, your struggles can be noticed from the outside of her nose, the faint bulge occasionally moving beneath the freckled flesh.  But soon, the bulge slowly vanishes into the bridge of her nose, any sign of your presence there vanishing deep inside her forever.  She couldn't help but giggle from your movement, scrunching and wiggling her nose from time to time. \"Ehe... That tickles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to gag from the disgusting feeling of being coated in slimy mucus from head to toe.  The fact that it was so warm didn't help any.  You'd completely lost track of how deep you were, when you suddenly come to a stop.  You tried to move, but the slick passage was too tight.  Soon you begin to get a strange feeling, and notice the walls around you were beginning to glow.  You could hear Katie's breathing growing heavier, and knew she was pleasuring herself at the thought of your position.  The more she did though, the brighter the passage grew.  After not long, all of the flesh around you was illuminated with a dim blue, and you tried your best not to pay attention to the oozing mucus you could now see dripping down the sides around you.  As this goes on, you're gradually overcome by a pleasant feeling from head to toe.  As the feeling grows, you notice it's much like an orgasm, but all over your body.  You groan with pleasure, almost in sync with Katie, and you realize it must be her pleasure passing on to you somehow, through her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squishy walls around you soon start to shift, pressing and rubbing against you in a massaging.  Normally this would terrify you, but you didn't care as you were too lost in the blissful feeling.  The mucus that coated you began to glitter as the blue illumination grew brighter.  From the outside, the bright blue glow was visible, lighting up at the top of the bridge of her nose, between her eyes.  You could tell she was nearing her climax now, and you felt like you were nearing some sort of full-body orgasm, 50 times more intense than anything you've ever felt.  Finally, Katie lets out a loud moan, and you feel yourself engulfed in an explosion of pleasure.  You cry out in complete ecstasy, just as the walls around you all seem to squish against you at once, drawing you into them.  As this happens, there's a bright flash of light around you that remains throughout the experience.  You could feel the squishy walls drawing you in, merging with you, but you didn't care.  The feeling was far, far too wonderful to ignore.  As the climax neared an end, you could no longer feel your body, completely lost in euphoria as what you could only assume was your soul seemed to be engulfed by her own, dissolving away as if she were feeding on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her climax came to an end, the light quickly vanished, and there was nothing left of you.  Your body was now a part of her, to be distributed wherever she desired.  Your own soul now hers for the rest of eternity, strengthening her witch abilities so that she may easily live out her fantasies on more unsuspecting victims.  With a sigh and a satisfied smile, she drifts off to sleep with thoughts of how she'll take her next victim.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a sigh, you mutter under your breath \"Feet first.\" before looking down, feeling a little defeated by having to choose your own demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie scrunches her nose with excitement. \"Feet it is!\"  She tosses her hair behind her shoulders and lays back on the couch, dangling you over her face by the string.  She reaches down and picks up another piece of string, and proceeds to tie it tightly around your ankles.  Holding you over her nose, she can't help but tease you a little first, her free hand reaching down and slowly rubbing between her legs as she was growing excited.  \"Just think. In just a moment, you'll be sinking feet first into here...\" She places a finger tip near her nostril, and slowly traces it up her soft, freckled nose. \"deeper and deeper... until no visible part of you is left.  Your squirming might still be visible at first, but not for long.\" Her finger traces along the bridge of her nose, up to where it ends.  She grins up at you as you dangle there, unable to move.  \"You'll soon vanish inside of me, never to see the light of day again.\"  She seemed to be growing increasingly excited with every sentence.  \"After that, well... we'll see.  You may get stuck in my nasal passage, left to drown in whatever slimey contents you'll run into.  Or maybe I'll manage to swallow you down my throat, leaving you alive and squirming inside of my belly.\" She giggles, lifting the bottom of her shirt to expose her soft belly, giving it a teasing pat.  At this point, you were wishing she'd just swallow you instead.  As bad as that still sounded, the thought of it seemed much better than what she was describing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squirms anxiously, and finally says the words you've been dreading.  \"Well it's been fun.  Now in you go!\" She then leans her head back over the edge of the couch, and dangles you helplessly over one of her nostrils.  It was apparent now that she was planning to let you sink in with the aid of gravity.  You wish your ankles weren't bound, maybe then you'd have a chance to stop your ascent, if only for a moment.  All you could do now is hopelessly stare down and watch as your feet approached the dark confines of one of her nostrils, which flared faintly as if it were anxious to accept you.  You could make out plenty of hair now, and feel a gush of hot air each time she exhales, which both caused you to shudder and begin squirming.  You try to shift your weight in order to swing away from her nose, but you're already too late.  You could feel the tickle of her nose hairs under your bare feet, which slowly traced up your ankles and calves, and passed your knees as you were lowered further.  You wanted to beg her to stop as you watched your feet disappear into darkness, unable to see what awaits, but you couldn't get the words out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver so slowly, your legs, waist and hands disappear down the fleshy tunnel of her freckled nose.  You could feel your feet, followed by your legs brushing against the hairy, moist and soft walls as they began to envelop you.  Once you were in up to your stomach, you groaned and squirmed a bit more as you could feel the nasal passage walls growing slicker and stickier, not to mention warmer, the deeper you descended.  As the soft edges of her nose crept up your chest and shoulders, you realize she'd already let go of the string, letting you sink in with the aid of gravity much like you would in quicksand.  As hopeless as your situation seems, you struggle anyway, not realizing you're only speeding up your demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie reaches down and picks up a small hand mirror from the floor, lifting it over her face.  She giggles and says, \"Hehe... look up, little one.\"  You look up to see the reflection of yourself, nothing more than your head and shoulders visible outside of her nostril, the rest of you trapped within the thick freckled walls that would soon draw the rest of the way in.  Her eyes pierced you, her expression making it clear how much she was getting off on this.  The whole situation is unbearably humiliating for you.  One she'd had enough of teasing you, she puts down the mirror and sniffs lightly, causing you to slide in until your head disappears from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything becomes dark now, aside from the dim light above your head.  You can feel yourself slowly sinking deeper and deeper, the squishy walls that encased you becoming so slimy that it made you want to gag.  You look up and see light from the oval opening of her nostril, which now seems to be a good 4 or 5 feet above you.  You were sure that by now, your squirming would no longer be visible from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what feels like an eternity, the light from the opening disappears from your sight, and you can tell the slimy tunnel is starting to curve inwards.  The soft walls have grown so slimy that you're now coated from head to toe in mucus.  You feel gravity shift suddenly, and realize she must have sat up.  But to your surprise, you're still being drawn inward at an agonizingly slow rate.  The soft mucus-coated walls that encased you seemed to move and shift as they made squishing noises all around you, almost as if it were working you deeper much like a snake would.  You couldn't help yourself, you began to gag and shudder every so often.  You knew it would be gross, but the feeling of hot, sticky mucus working its way around you felt far more disgusting than you'd ever imagined.  You think to yourself that if by some miracle you got out of this, you'd spend hours without leaving the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not quite sure where you are this point, at least until you come to a stop at what feels like a steep drop, just in front of your head.  It was a little more spacious now, so there was no longer a tight tunnel to work you the rest of the way in.  You sigh with relief, careful not to move as you didn't want to send yourself down the decline, knowing just what awaited below.  You only get to rest for a few seconds, before you feel a sudden gush of air, accompanied by a loud snorting noise that boomed all around you.  \"Oh no..\"  You're suddenly pulled from where you lay, and forced head first into what felt like the soft back of her throat.  You're helpless to stop it with the strings still binding your firmly, and you feel yourself sliding downward along what you could only assume to be her slick throat.  Finally, you land on something that felt bumpy and a little firmer, which you seem to stick to for the moment.  You realize it's the back her tongue!  You can feel the back of her throat hungrily pulsing to accept you, right in front of your face.  You tense up, afraid of slipping down, especially now with her foul breath overwhelming your senses and giving you a small taste of what awaits.  It reeked of a bad combination of omelettes and orange juice.</span></div></div>",

You realize she's opening her mouth, and get a sudden hope that she's about to pull you out.  That hope quickly fades you though, as you feel gravity shift again, causing you to start sliding head first into her pulsing throat, getting strands of warm saliva all over your face in the process.  You realize she only opened her mouth to give you a good look down her throat before she sends you there, the walls of it quivering with anticipation for you.  Finally, everything goes black again, and you feel the throat muscles tense up around your upper half, pulling you down.  In a matter of seconds, your whole body was being squeezed downward fairly quickly.  You were relieved that there wasn't as much mucus this time around, only saliva, but your relief quickly fades as the foul smell from below grew more and more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you feel yourself come to what feels like the stomach's sphincter, and come to a stop, but only for a second.  Before you know it, it widens open and starts squeezing you through.  Instantly you're struck by the the most acrid, powerful smell you've ever encountered, causing you to gag and try to hold your breath.  The sphincter squeezes your chest, followed by your waist and legs as it squeezes you through, before dropping you straight down.  Luckily you land on your back with a *plop*, on what feels like mushy partially-digested food.  The heat and humidity in the stomach was overwhelming, it feels like you're in an oven.  Unable to hold your breath any longer, you gasp for air and immediately choke and cough from the acrid stench again.  You try to roll out of the disgusting thick slop, but realize you're slowly sinking, as if it were quicksand.  You start screaming as your legs sink underneath, followed by your waist, stomach and chest.  But to your relief, your feet reach the bottom and you stop sinking once it's over your shoulders.  You notice Katie giggling after hearing your screams, and patting her belly a few times, causing your surroundings to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to get used to the smell, but just enough that you weren't gagging anymore.  It was still difficult to breath.  As you sit there up to your neck in chunky thick stomach matter, you can't help but notice how deafening her stomach is.  You can hear gurgling and churning all around you, along with Katie's heartbeat, and you start to feel a little motion sick from the motion of her stomach.  Occasional strands of bile drop from above, sometimes landing on your head and causing you to squirm more.  This goes on for a few more moments, until you notice something horrifying.  Your skin was beginning to tingle all over, even itching a bit in some places.  Reality sinks in as you realize Katie left enough air in her stomach for you to breath for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought things couldn't get any worse, you're suddenly thrown from where you sat, and tossed around her belly.  She must have been shaking her stomach, trying to torture you!  You couldn't help but scream as this happened, wishing the torment would end.  As much as you screamed, you still couldn't drown out the sound of Katie's laughter.  Finally, the strings that bound you come lose, likely with the help of the stomach acid, but it didn't do you any good as you couldn't get any footing.  She kept this up for a few more minutes, making sure to get you completely covered in her stomach bile, before growing bored.  Exhausted, you plop yourself down and lean back against the wall, panting for air, the sweltering heat taking a toll on you.  Now your skin was beginning to sting, the pain growing worse with each passing second.  After a while, it becomes unbearable, and you begin to scream again, cursing Katie for being so cruel as to keep you alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Katie could hear your muffled screams coming from her belly.  The feeling of control and power excited her so much, she sprawled herself out on the couch, slipping one of her hands down into her panties.  Her breathing grows heavy as she fingers herself at a slow pace, listening to your cries of agony.  Once she could hear her stomach kick into full gear, gurgling and churning around you and drowning out your voice, she nearly climaxed.  She then kept her hand still for a moment to let her self come down, before starting up again, wanting to draw this out for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour or two, your cries grew fainter and fainter, and she decided it was time.  She started rubbing her clit more frantically, and is suddenly hit by the strongest orgasm she'd ever felt in her life.  She moans loudly, squirming around in place with her toes curling up.  Her orgasm was so intense, even her stomach seemed to tense up, squeezing you and mashing stomach matter all over you.  This goes on for a good 10 seconds straight, before she finally relaxes and tries to catch her breath, her tongue flopped out of the corner of her mouth like a satisfied puppy.  Totally content, she drifts off into a deep sleep, leaving you at the mercy of her unrelenting belly.  Soon you follow, passing out once you'd used up all the oxygen.  All that was left was the sound of her belly gurgling, breaking you down in order to be absorbed, and become nothing but fat on the belly that so hellishly snuffed you out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're overcome with the sudden realization that you'll soon be submerged in whatever foulness lies inside, never to see the light of day again.  In desperation, you begin struggling between her fingers.  \"Please, don't put me in there!  Anywhere but there!\"  Hearing your begging, a broad smile forms on Katie's lips, which caused the dark nostril that loomed over to you to widen slightly.  And with that, she tightened her grip on you and thrust you inside up to your elbows, with your arms pinned at your sides.  Her nostril bulged slightly to accept you, as it was a bit of a tight fit.  You immediately start to scream, but your muffled cries were barely audible through her soft nose.  She then releases her fingers from you, the flesh of her nose holding you firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon feel her fingertip press firmly against your legs, and start to slide you deeper into her nasal passage.  You cry out again, disgusted by the feeling of nose hair brushing against your face, some of them covered in globs of mucus that smeared over you.  As you feel your thighs being engulfed by the fleshy walls and vanishing from the outside world, you notice the walls around you are growing slimier, coating your body in ooze which clung to you like glue.  By the time you're in up to your knees, you begin to gag, your surroundings only growing worse as you inched upward.  You try to squirm, but you had no room to move, the slimy passage hugging you too tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you feel your captor's fingertip force your feet the rest of the way in.  Not yet satisfied, Katie presses her finger up her nose a little ways, making sure you were firmly tucked inside, before removing it.  This far in, you find the squishy walls and mucus that clung to you to be uncomfortably warm, the air ahead of you becoming much like a sauna.  The heat in combination with the foul environment made this a living hell for you.  But just as you thought things couldn't be any worse, Katie smirks to herself, getting an evil idea.  She starts scrunching and wiggling her nose, causing the fleshy walls to squeeze and rub against you, churning her glue-like snot all over you.  With each scrunch of her nose, she could hear a faint, muffled scream from within.  You begin to retch as hot mucus drips through your hair and down your face, your arms pinned too tightly at your sides to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good minute or two, Katie grows bored of torturing you and decides to finishing things.  She tilts her head back a bit, tossing her hair back over her shoulders, and begins to sniff.  You can't help but cry out, feeling a sudden shift in gravity, followed by a pressure change that made your ears pop.  You then lurch forward, sliding further into the slick, dark tunnel.  It takes you a moment to realize what's happening, and to your despair, the soft walls hug you far too tightly for air any air to pass, denying you any cool breeze from below as your environment only grew more uncomfortably hot.  You cry out again as you're dragged deeper and deeper, not knowing what lies ahead.  On the outside, your muffled screams gradually fade away, the bulge in her nose disappearing into the freckled bridge between her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you're soon forced into a spacious cavity, no larger to you than a small closet.  With a splat, you land on your back in a hot pool of mucus.  You sigh with relief, at first glad that you're no longer being sucked through one of the most horrible places in Katie's body, never intended for human life.  But before you have time to think, you can feel the sphincter-like opening at your feet beginning to close.  A feeling of dread washes over you, and not wanting to be trapped forever where you lie, you pull yourself upright and try to make a dive for the opening.  To your surprise, the thick snot clings to your back and jerks you back into your resting position as if it were stretchy rubber cement, just in time for you to feel the exit seal shut beneath your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout in frustration and pound a fist against the membrane wall above you, but let out an \"Eep!\" as the walls contract against you in response.  The soft, wrinkled surface of the lining seems to squeeze and massage every part of your body, secreting mucus as it did so.   You cough a bit, trying your hardest to keep any foul substances out of your mouth.  Just then, your surroundings appear to stretch for a few seconds, only to contract again, even more mucus oozing through unseen pores.  As disgusting as this was, you may have learned to enjoy the feeling if it weren't as hot as an oven inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process continues to repeat itself as the mucus content seems to pool around your legs.  You try to pull your feet out of the muck, but only manage to slip, falling into a kneeling position with the substance up to your waist and elbows.  You try to get back up, but strands cling to your arms and legs some like kind of liquid rubber, drawing you further into it.  You were helpless as the mysterious cavity kicked into full gear, churning you around without mercy as the wrinkled flesh compressed against you.  You noticed you're losing feeling in your limbs, and your skin begins to tingle all over.  You think to yourself, \"Oh no... It's dissolving me!\"  Your struggles grow weaker, and finally come to a stop as you start accepting your fate, no longer able to feel most of your body.  You can't help but be relieved the process is painless, unlike being in a stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were submerged up to your neck, you feel your eyelids growing heavy from exhaustion, lack of air, and the effects of the tar-like slime that worked away at you.  At this point, you had no idea how much of you had been dissolved into more mucus.  You could hear sloshes and gurgles all around you, beckoning you to sleep.  Shutting your eyes, you can't help but think of how humiliating it is to meet your end in a girl's cute and seemly harmless nose.  And with that last thought, you drift out of consciousness, nothing left for you to do except dissolve into the same gross snot that plagues Katie's nose.</span></div></div>",

Glancing over at the clock, you can't help but let out another sleepy yawn.  \"9:55... there's no way I'll get to Katie's on time.\"  You sigh under your breath.  \"Ah, what's another 10 minutes.  I don't think she'll mind...\"  You hobble back to your room and plop down on the bed for a quick nap.  In under a minute, you're out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken some time later to a strange feeling on the back of your neck, as if you're being watched.  You blink tiredly and glance over at your clock.  \"Oh no... it's after 11 AM\" you think to yourself.  Just then, you hear someone clear their throat in the room.  Surprised, you turn to see who it is, and there you see Katie standing at the foot of your bed.  She was wearing her long red hair in a ponytail, as usual.  Her clothes were fairly simple, a white t-shirt and a long pair of jeans that hugged her curvy, yet athletic legs nicely.  She stands a few inches taller than you, making her one of the tallest of your friends.  She had a fairly pale complexion, aside from the cute freckles that were scattered across her face.  You always did find her pretty cute, though you did your best to keep it a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her arms folded across her chest, and she didn't look pleased. \"K-katie!\" You gasp, surprised.  \"How did you get in here?... er... I swear, I was just on my way over, and... I guess I dozed off...\"  You go to sit up, but realize your wrists won't budge.  You look at each of them, realizing they're both tied firmly to your bed posts with thin rope.  \"What the... What is this?!\"  You tug at them, trying to get your wrists free, but they won't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walks next to you, before sitting herself down right on your stomach, her legs draped over the side of the bed.  She begins running a hand through your hair, which would've been enjoyable if it weren't for her icy stare.  \"Roran, you know how much I hate it when you leave me waiting.  And yet, here you are again.  I guess I see now how little our friendship means to you, and for that...\" She re-positions herself, lifting a leg over so that she's straddling you in a kneeling position.  She grins, before finishing her sentence.  \"I think you should be punished.\"  Just then you hear the front door of the house open, and some body walk in.  \"Ah, and there's my help now!\" She smiles, almost seeming a bit eager now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punished?! You can't be serious, how are you going t... Wait, what help?  Who's in my house?  Katie, this isn't funny...\" You say, growing a little nervous.  Just then, the bedroom door opens, and in walks Stacey.  She was one of Katie's best friends, and an absolute bombshell.  She had long, wavy, dirty blonde hair that reached a bit passed her shoulders, and had the body of a model.  One of her features you noticed the most though, was her smile.  She had a somewhat wide mouth with very prominent front teeth, but they were the whitest, most straight and perfect teeth you'd ever seen.  Even when she wasn't smiling, her mouth seemed strangely sexy, and you always had a hard time not staring whenever you talked to her.  On the downside though, she always was a bit of a mean person, and you never did get along with her.  This time though, something about her smile made you feel uneasy.  \"Hey Roran, thanks for having me over..\" She winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie suddenly blurts out to her friend, \"You grab his legs and take care of his feet, I'll do rest.\"  Katie then turns her attention back down to you, and grins. \"You know.. you never should have told me how ticklish you are.\" Stacey happily walks over to your feet with a smile on her face, as if she'd been wanting to do this for a long time.  She climbs onto the foot of your bed and straddles your legs, her back facing Katie's.  She grabs your ankles, and holds them tightly together.  Knowing what comes next, you start to twist and turn, squirming to get your legs free, but it's no use.  You could swear you heard Stacey giggle from behind Katie.  \"Oh no...\" You say out loud, feeling completely helpless.  \"Look... maybe we can talk this ov-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!\" Shouted Katie.  The two of them immediately start to tickle you all over without mercy, Stacey was being especially unforgiving against the soles of your feet, your most sensitive spot.  Meanwhile, Katie worked her fingers all across your stomach, your rubs, and most of all, your arm pits.  You burst into a laughing fit, squirming uncontrollably from their unrelenting torture.  Seconds felt like minutes, and you didn't know how long you could take it.  You begin begging them to stop the best you can through your laughter, but this only seemed to bring a satisfied smile to Katie's lips.  After what feels like an eternity, though likely no more than a minute or two, you have tears welling up in your eyes from laughing so hard.  The only thing you can do at this point is try and work your wrists free.  After a couple minutes, the ropes start to loosen, but you can hardly breath from all your laughter.  Finally, after 4 or 5 minutes of this, the two of them stop.  You lie there, panting to catch your breath \"Oh... oh thank god.\" You gasp out.  Katie leans up close to your face with a broad smile, and says \"What, you think we're finished?  Oh, this is only the beginning.  We plan to keep this up for... well over an hour.\"  The two of them giggle, especially after seeing your eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beg, \"P-please.. no more.  I've learned my lesson, I'll do anything you ask from now on I swear! Just let me go..\"  Katie smirks, and replies \"Tempting, but... I don't believe you.  Ready for round 2?\"  Out of desperation, you manage to rip your wrists free from the ropes and manage to shove Katie against the wall at the side of your bed.  She falls against it with a loud *thud* and swears loudly, rubbing her head.  You then manage to jerk a foot free, and shove Stacey off the foot of the bed before she can react.  Not wanting to stick around when they're angry, you don't hesitate to jump off the bed and try to make a break for it towards the door.  But before you can take a single step away from the bed, you feel Katie's grab against the back of your shirt collar and forcefully jerk you back against the bed.  You try to pull free, not caring if your shirt gets ripped, but her thighs suddenly wrap around your neck at the edge of the bed. \"Ack!\" You choke out, trying to pry them loose with your hands, but it's no use.  She then keeps one leg straight, but bends the other around your neck to hold you in place, making a sort of 4 figure with her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey gets up and storms in front of you looking like she's ready to throw a punch, but she stops herself and gazes down at you, a smirk of amusement creeping across her face as she watched you struggle, enjoying seeing you so helpless.  Katie then says to her, \"Alright Stacey, we've had our fun... I think we'd better go through with the rest of our plan.\" Stacey smiles broadly and nods.  You try to ask, \"What plan? What are you doing to d-gagh!\" but Katie quickly cuts you off by squeezing your neck with her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Stacey closes her eyes and starts chanting in some language you'd never heard before.  You quirked an eyebrow, not sure what she was doing, but you're quickly distracted by Katie as she teasingly starts running her fingers through your hair.  \"I hope you're ready for this\" She giggles.  You start nervously wondering what she means, before realizing something strange.  As Stacey chanted, a small ball of light began to form in front of her, growing brighter as her chanting continued.  You didn't know what it was, but you didn't like it.  After a full minute of this, her chanting finally stops.  She opens her eyes and gazes at you one last time with a devilish grin, before moving her arm with a quick motion, sending the ball of light straight at...</span></div></div>",

Without a second to spare, she starts throwing off her clothes, stripping naked.  Your jaw drops as you watch, still not entirely sure what's going on.  All you knew for sure was the girl had an absolutely stunning body, beyond everything you've imagined.  Once she'd removed the last article of clothing, her entire body seemed to start glowing, emitting a bright blue light.  Before you knew it, her figure appeared to be growing in size before your very eyes, growing taller and taller at a shocking rate.  Once she'd reached the ceiling, she simply got on her knees and still continued to grow.  You're so overwhelmed in shock by what you're seeing, that you never even notice Katie release you from her grip and hop off the the bed, moving to the doorway where she's out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Stacey stopped growing just as the bright light vanishes.  By then, she barely had room to move, her legs spread apart and seeming to surround most of the room.  Katie looks at the two with a satisfied expression, and says \"I'll give you two some privacy... and Stacey? Have fun.. I know how long you've wanted this.\" And with a wink, she walks out.  You quickly look up at Stacey, slowly coming out of your shock, and manage to ask \"Fun? Wait, what are you up to..\" You look at her cautiously as you inch back onto the bed behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey stared down at you with a hungry gaze, slowly running her tongue over her lips.  A loud rumbling sound suddenly fills the room, and it takes you a moment to realize it's coming from her stomach. \"Oh! Excuse me..\" she chuckles, rubbing a hand over her belly.  She then leans her face close to you, causing you to crawl back into the corner, before she speaks.  \"For as long as I've known you, I've hated your guts... That I'm sure you know.\" Her hot, smelly breath washes over you, and you try your hardest to ignore it.  But the smell of a gross combination of bacon, eggs and orange juice was a bit overwhelming.  \"But what you don't know... is what I've fantasized about constantly, since the day we met.\"  She smirks, before continuing.  \"I'm what you'd call a vorarephile.\"  You suddenly get a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach.  You've heard of such a thing on the internet, but you never paid it any attention since it seemed pretty harmless... or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend Katie was kind enough to give me this opportunity, to make my fantasies come true.\"  She licks her lips again, seeming to grow excited now as one of her hands trails down between her legs.  You glance towards the door, wondering if you could make a break for it, but one of her feet completely blocked the exit.  She begins to slowly teasing her clit with her fingers, as she continued talking.  \"Nothing excites me more than the thought of you, small and helpless, struggling as I swallow you down, whole and alive\"  She bites her lower lip. \"Once you're in my stomach, it wouldn't stop there... I'd swallow some air for you, to keep you alive and squirming for as long as possible while my stomach churns away at you.\"  She moans softly. \"Ohh... I do hope you scream for me.  And believe me... you'll want to.\" She grins at you, enjoying your frightened expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stops teasing herself with her fingers, and clears her throat. \"Now then, I think we'd better...\"</span></div></div>",

She then brings the foot of your bed level with her mouth, and gives you one last teasing smile, showing off as many teeth as she can before licking her lips.  \"Goodbye, Roran... I hope this is as unpleasant for you as it is in my fantasies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she begins lifting the bed slowly, tilting the foot of it down towards her mouth.  Still facing her with your back towards the bed, you try to push yourself back and away from her mouth using your hands and feet, but this quickly proves unsuccessful as the sheets come loose, sending you back down towards her.    You gasp and fling your hands up over your head, just barely managing to grab the top edge of the bed with the tips of your fingers, stopping your descent for the moment as the bed's incline steepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Work in Progress]</span></div></div>",

The period is already more than half over, so you decide it might be better for everyone if you didn't show up at all. Rather than embarrass yourself and waste the class's time, you hang around in the halls until the period is over. You know you'll get in trouble anyway, but at least this way it can be dealt with over email, and you might not even have to deal with your extremely strict math teacher, Ms. Hayes, face to face. However, once you think you're in the clear, you turn a corner and nearly bump into the very person you've been trying to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Hayes puts her hands on her hips and stares down at you. \"And where have you been?\" she asks, her voice as cold as ever. \"Cutting my class?\" Ms. Hayes's long nostrils flare in anger, reminding you of the school's general opinion of her. Most of your friends agree that 29-year-old Ms. Hayes is hot, if you're willing to ignore her ice-cold personality, short temper, and large nose. Ms. Hayes's nose is easily big enough for the student body to make fun of, and rumor has it that she has a special punishment for anyone she catches making fun of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am, I...\" You try to explain yourself. You thought you were being courteous by not interrupting the class, but clearly Ms. Hayes has other ideas. \"Come with me to my office,\" she said, turning away and walking down the hall. You know you could have tried to make a run for it, but now that she wanted to deal with you personally, that would only make it worse in the long run. Ms. Hayes leads you to her office and offers you a drink of water. Knowing better than to refuse, you take a sip before she has to repeat herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you hope to accomplish by coming to school so late? Did you want to just skip my class, or all of them?\" Ms. Hayes asks, sitting down at her desk. She gestures to the chair in front of it, actually offering you the choice to sit down. You sit, not wanting to take your chances. However, you are starting to get fed up with her questions. \"I didn't mean to skip any classes,\" you say, taking another sip of water. \"I was at home. I-\" You try to explain that you slept in, but Ms. Hayes cuts you off again before you can. \"And what were you doing at home?\" You have finally had enough of her questions, so you snap back at her without thinking. \"Maybe you should keep your nose out of my personal life!\" You only realize what you actually said once it's too late. However, Ms. Hayes strangely doesn't seem offended. She simply takes your cup and pours you some more water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, have another drink,\" she says, handing it back to you. Not wanting to make her any angrier than she must already be, you take the glass and drink again. Within seconds, you begin to feel light-headed, and then you pass out. When you wake up, you don't know how much time has passed, but you can tell that you're no longer in the chair you were sitting in. Where are you?</span></div></div>",

The ground under you is soft and warm, but it still doesn't indicate where you are. Your train of thought is suddenly interrupted by Ms. Hayes clearing her throat. You jump at the sound, as it seems much louder than usual. As you happen to look up, you nearly scream at what you see above you. Ms. Hayes is staring down at you, but she's huge! Whatever you're sitting on is right in front of her face, but something's not right. Ms. Hayes looks like some sort of giant before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you awake now?\" she asks, her voice as stern as ever. \"Y-yes,\" you reply, still shocked and confused. \"Good. I was getting tired of waiting. I'm sure by now you can tell that things have changed. More specifically, you've shrunk.\" Finally, it hits you. You realize that you're sitting in the palm of Ms. Hayes's hand! \"What? How?\" you stammer, unable to think clearly enough to ask anything else. \"I'm sure you've heard that I have a special punishment for anyone who makes fun of my nose. It's true, and you're about to find out what it is,\" Ms. Hayes says, bringing you even closer to her face. Her large nose is right in front of you, giving you a true appreciation for how huge it really is. \"What is it?\" you asked, sounding nervous. Ms. Hayes smiles and lowers you away from her face slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing too terrible. If you do what I tell you, everything will be fine. You'll eventually return to your normal size and you won't remember anything that happened. Well, you'll remember one thing: never make fun of my nose.\" You almost sigh with relief, but you remember that this is Ms. Hayes you're dealing with. If you make it look like it's not so bad, she'll find some way to change your mind. \"Put simply, I just need your help with cleaning something.\" You swallow, feeling afraid now. You've been in her class long enough to know that when Ms. Hayes says \"put simply,\" something horrible and complicated is bound to follow. \"What do you need help cleaning?\"</span></div></div>",

Before you can react, he shoves you forcefully back into the locker and pins you there, both fists tightly gripping your shirt against your chest.  \"Where do you think you're going, twerp?  Skipping class again, are we?  I don't think so.\" He said, his tight grip lifting you an inch or two off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ch.. Chad!\" You stutter out. \"I wasn't! I was just... Ow, damnit, put me down!\" You cry out, just before he slams you against the locker again, looking down his nose at you and leaning in close enough for you to feel his stinky warm breakfast breath waft against your face.  \"Oh, I don't think so.  Not after last week... Remember what I said?  If I ever caught you trying to weasel out of a beating in P.E. again, I'd make you pay.\" An unsettling, almost predatory grin spread across his face, showing off his braces and making your stomach knot.  \"I'm your worst nightmare, kid.  And you're gonna wish you never crossed paths with me.  Now... let's make sure nobody ever finds you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at him with a confused and fearful expression, unsure what he meant by that.  You can't wonder about it long, however, as he surprises you with something totally unexpected.  Keeping you firmly pinned, he slips a hand down into your pants and underwear and grips your cock, giving it a squeeze.  You gasp and begin struggling and kicking, feeling horrified and disgusted as he began fondling you, teasing your member and causing it to twitch and slowly stiffen. \"CHAD! WHAT'RE YOU D-mmmph!\" Your protests were cut short as he let your feet touch the ground again, his hand lifting from your chest and sealing over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... Just relax, let it happen.  One way or another, you're going to be mine.\" He said as he began stroking you, your cock now hard, against your will.  You groan, feeling utterly humiliated and violated, and you couldn't help but look down.  Just then, you notice something unusual, and your eyes flash wide.  With every stroke, his hand seemed to glow within your pants, and only then do you realize the strange tingling sensation over your entire body.  Frightened and confused, you look back up at him, only to meet his widening grin, as if he were reading your thoughts.  \"That's right...\" He spoke softly and slowly, letting his words sink in.  \"The moment you cum... you're going to shrink and shrink, until you're nothing but an inch tall bug in the palm of my hand.\"  It sounded too crazy to be true, but you couldn't help but remember odd stories of people with unusual abilities, said to be living among us in secret.  And the glow and strange sensation made his words all more believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kicked into another wave of frantic struggling, whimpering against his hand as you tried to shake your head.  It wasn't long before you could feel yourself edging closer to a climax, the pleasurable sensation getting the best of you and causing you to go still and groan.  \"That's right... just give in.\" He said, looking down his nose at you in a dominant manner.  \"Now to decide how to make you disappear.  Hmm...\" He drifted into thought for a short moment, his hand still working away at you and causing you to writhe around as you tried to resist that imminent orgasm that would seal your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he smiled again and peered back at you, his broad grin showing off two rows of glistening teeth beneath braces.  \"Ohh, I know just where to put you...\" And with that, he...</span></div></div>",

You suddenly shuddered, feeling sick. \"Oh god~\"  You couldn't tear your eyes away, staring up into those almost pitch-black nostrils, the entrance speckled with hair in disgustingly clear detail given your size.  As you stared, he reached his other hand up and inched you between thumb and finger, lifting you closer to that horrible fleshy tunnel where no one would ever find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes~\" He said, excitement sparkling in his eyes.  \"Now I'm feeling generous, so I'm going to give you a choice.\"  A glimmer of hope rose up in you.

We're from the Girl Scouts of the USA, and we'd like to sell you some cookies for a fundraiser we're having.  They're $4 per box, and we have chocolate chip, thin mints, peanut cr-\".  Cranky from being woken up and eager to get back to bed, you decide to interrupt them.  \"Look, it's too early for this.  I don't want your stupid overpriced cookies, they're not all that great anyway.\"  Just as you're about to slam the door on them, you notice their expressions suddenly turn...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You see the girl eagerly holding out a near-empty candy bag, waiting for your contribution.  She was wrapped from head to toe in an extremely long, white strip of fabric, which covered her everywhere except for her eyes and mouth.  You had to admit, someone did a damn good job of her costume.  You couldn't spot any ends to the fabric, or even tell if it was multiple strips, or just one long piece that made up the entire thing.  Most impressive, though, was the fact that what seemed to be a 12-year old girl could trick or treat all day without the costume unraveling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, knowing you'd forgotten to buy candy, and every kid who comes to your porch today, starting with this mummy, will be leaving disappointed.  \"Sorry kid, I didn't buy any candy..\"  The girl's eyes go wide. \"What? N-no candy?  But it's Halloween!\"  The kid's eyes narrow, and her expression seems to grow angry, before she speaks again. \"You'll regret this, mister!  Don't you know what happens to people who break Halloween tradition?!\"  Tired, you start to grow impatient with the kid complaining, and blurt out \"What are ya gonna do, get all your little friends and toilet paper my house?  Get lost little girl, there's plenty of other houses around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to shut the door on the girl, but you stop as she suddenly lifts one of her appendaged hands and points it at you.  You quirk an eyebrow at him for a second, wondering what the strange kid's trying to do.  You're about to shut the door the rest of the way, but before you can, long strips of long mummy cloth stretch out from within the wrappings around her hand, and dart right towards your ankles.  You gasp and jump back in surprise, but only manage to tumble and land on your back as the long bandage already binds your ankles firmly together.  The girl quickly steps inside your house and slams the door shut behind her using her foot, still holding her hand towards you.  You look down toward your legs, and to your horror, the cloth bandages are coiling their way up your legs and thighs at an alarming rate, wrapping you up in a mummified cocoon as they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to snap out of your shock over the situation, you shout at the girl. \"Hey little girl, stop!  I'll buy you candy!  I'll go get some right now, just stop this!\" You start to panic, the wrappings already working their way up your stomach.  You look back up at the kid, only to see her smirking down at you with her piercing green eyes.  You didn't know what was more unsettling; the anticipation in her grin, or the way her eyes seemed to glow all on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry out in fear as the bandages snatch your wrists and pin them firmly against your sides, cocooning them just like the rest of you as they work their way up your chest and elbows.  You try to struggle and break the bindings, or at least squirm away from the kid, but the wrappings are far too tight and durable. Once they'd completely covered your shoulders and started their way up your neck, the girl straddles you, pinning your shoulders to the floor with both hands as she licked her lips over. \"Soon you'll learn the true meaning of Halloween...\"  You start to shout and cry out for help, but you're too late.  The bandages are already wrapping your face up, including your mouth, leaving only your eyes exposed.  As much as you tried to shout, you only managed to get out a few muffled noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the process comes to an end, leaving you completely mummified beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[WIP]</span></div></div>",
