As you regained your senses, you noticed that you aren't in your room anymore, but somewhere else, somewhere different. Not only that, but you realized that you have shrunk in size, being only a measly 3 inches tall based on the surroundings of which had a chair next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and had a think to yourself, trying to remember the last thing you did as well what happened before you ended up in this situation. After thinking for a bit, you remembered what happened. You were playing Pok\u00e9mon Platinum, but this wasn't just a normal start to finish run of the game, you were doing a challenge run in which you were going to beat it but with a team of Lucario's, as you wanted to give yourself a challenge of beating a Pok\u00e9mon game with only one Pok\u00e9mon, and Lucario was the one you picked randomly out of all of the choices you made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent some time breeding a Lucario you trained to max level for eggs which would hatch into Riolu's, picking out the ones with good enough natures and put the others in the PC for later to send off to other players in the more recent games at a later date. It took some time, but not as long as you thought it would, ending up with 6 Lucario's on your team all ready at a good level for the start of the game and moves learned to transfer over in which you did shortly after getting your other game ready with the random wild Pok\u00e9mon you caught to be traded over for the Lucario's. Shortly after starting the adventure, before you got your first gym, you started to feel funny, like you were starting to get a headache, not only that but you started to see that the game generally during battle would go and say how the Lucario wants to see you in person. At this point, you knew that you might as well stop right then for now and get some rest, you got yourself ready to go to bed, but before you could get to sleep, you started to feel more off as your body started shaking as if you were cold, but before you could react, a flash of light flashed though your window startling you only for a portal to materialize right above your bed and then sucked you in without warning. The force of the portal sucking you in caused you to pass out almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all coming together now, you were going to do a run of a Pokemon game with nothing but Lucario's, and now you are tiny somewhere after being sucked into a portal, the only difference is that you don't feel that bad headache anymore, you sit down where you are and sighed to yourself, \"What am I going to do now\" you said to yourself, you have no clue where you are, your tiny and not only that, you are in great danger due to your size as anything could crush you like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trail of thoughts gets interrupted by a loud piercing noise coming from being you, which caused you to leap in the air in shock, only for you to bolt around quickly to see that it was from an alarm clock, but something close to it caught your attention even more than the alarm clock, it was a Lucario, and by the looks of things, he was waking up from his sleep. You noticed the Lucario's eyes slowly opening up and how he is laying on its bed, its likely to spot you. You had no other option but to hide somewhere, anywhere out of his vision, who knows what he is like, being in his room, he could think you are an intruder or some kind of pest. You've read enough stories about scenarios like this to have a hunch where this was going to go. You made a dash towards the closest thing you could hide under, a bedroom cabinet, it had a gap at the bottom where you could hide until he has either left the room or you find some way to get out alive, as you got closer to it, you turned around to see if he has spotted you yet, and with your bad luck, it looks like the Lucario has as he has fully awoken from his sleep and seemed wide awake, that was the last thing you need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap\" you thought to yourself as you continued to dash your way to your hiding place, but one thing you heard was the Lucario go, \"What even is that thing there\", based on its voice, you could determine it was Male. You just made it to your hiding place before the Lucario got off his bed to see what it is, with the last amount of breaths you had you moved as far away from the area you came from so the Lucario couldn't reach you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought the Lucario would probably not have noticed you, but you heard the Lucario say \u201cIs it me, or did something go under there?\u201d From what you could make out of it, the Lucario is a male one based on his voice. From the gap of the cabinet you were under, you saw the Lucario make his way towards where you were, all you could do is think to yourself how this can get any worse as well as this probably wouldn\u2019t happen or even be less than likely to happen if you were smaller, but that would cause even more problems as well in some ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to go and hide behind one of the legs of the cabinet that was facing the wall in a way that would make it harder for the Lucario to spot you, the Lucario got to the area you were hiding by and started to look under it.  You didn\u2019t want to look behind where you were hiding as that could easily give away your hiding location. Unknown to you that would last long as Lucario would know you were there by sensing the Aura being generated by you. You hear the Lucario say, \u201cI know your hiding, you can\u2019t go hiding forever, you have to come out sometime\u201d. He\u2019s right, you have to come out sometime, but not now you thought. You then continued to check around the gaps from where you were hiding to see if he has moved away, which seems like it but before you could move somewhere else, the cabinet started to move, you froze only for about three seconds before making a leap towards where it got moved to, but before you could move any further, you were grabbed by the Lucario, you let out a noise of shock as soon as the Lucario grabbed you. \u201cGot you\u201d you hear the Lucario go as he pulled you from under the cabinet. You closed your eyes and began fearing for the worse for what he has in store for you, as he pulled you closer to his face, you hear him say \u201cHey there, what is a little thing like you doing here\u201d, you slowly open your eyes and saw in front of you the Lucario that was looking for you, judging by his facial expression he had, he seemed to be\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

HOW ELSE CAN I GET THE FULL SCENT?\" he replied, moving one foot to the heel of the other to pry it off. As soon as you heard the gigantic POP sound, the room immediately filled with a noxious odor resembling cheese and sweat. <br>\r\nLucario notices the change in your facial expression and chuckles heartily.<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU KIDDING, BOY? I DIDNT EVEN TAKE OFF THE OTHER ONE AND YOURE ALREADY GAGGING?...WELL I GUESS I CANT EXPECT MUCH.

Taller than average but nowhere near fifty feet.\" She replied worridly. \"For your first question: No clue what so fucking ever. For the second: I probably shrunk when I was teleported here.\" You reply as if this was a normal, everyday occurrence. \"You act like you have done this before.\" She notices. \"I can assure you that I have never been to an alternate universe before and the shock will probably hit me in anywhere from three minutes to three hours from now.\" You reply, once again, nonchalantly. \"I don't believe I ever got your name, Miss----\" You paused for her to answer. \"Jackie. But people who know me well call me \"Rackie\" sometimes.\" She replied. \"Nice to meet you Jackie, and if you don't mind, why do some people call you \"Rackie\"?\" You inquire. \"You would know if I didn't see you before I got my shirt off.\" She replied, slightly blushing. \"Oh, well then.\" You say. Jackie was going to ask more questions but she was interrupted by a loud growl. \"Was that your stomach?\" You ask, starting to get worried. \"Yeah. I guess it's lunch time. Oh, and don't worry about me eating you or whatever. You seem like a nice guy.\" She said reassuringly. \"So, uh, shall we get something to eat?\"</span></div></div>",

You sit up and see a giant picture frame.  You then decided to look at the picture and see two Lucario's smiling while hugging each other.  You felt kind of happy for those two Lucario's, you aren't happy at what happened to you.  When you turned around you saw a giant Lucario smiling at you.  You were frightened by this and felt like you were going to faint.  When Lucario saw this he reassured you, \"Wait don't fall I won't hurt you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt his voice was calm and you spoke to him, \"Uhhh, who-o are yyy you?\"  You shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Luke the Lucario.  I'm your caregiver.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked by this, her caregiver, what was he talking about!  You then asked him why you're here, why are you caring for me, and HOW DID YOU GET SO SMALLLL!!!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe expected you to answer these questions and told you.  \"I found you when I was walking home after my date.  When I was walking home I saw you on the ground. I picked you up and saw that you were helpless.  I decided to take you home to help you.\"  He said.  You remembered that photograph of two Lucario's. So that's him and that girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you or got a tiny bed for you to sleep on.  I didn't know what to do with you, until I decided to make you my child.\"  You felt shocked by this and asked him, \"Child?!  Why are making me your child?\"  He then said, \"We'll my girlfriend named Violet told me about having children.  I agreed to this idea except we've never had children before.  And when I saw you maybe me and Violet could take care of you like a child.  Sure it's strange but you could help us on taking care of a child since you are eight.  And once we know how to take care of a child we could use have a child of own and you could either leave or stay with us.\"  You thought about this looking at the photo thinking, sure you could help them but you still have to figure out how to get back home.  You then said....</span></div></div>",
