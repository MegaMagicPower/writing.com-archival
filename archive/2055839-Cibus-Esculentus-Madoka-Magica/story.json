It will be updated as necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Oriko Mikuni:</b> Without the threat of Kriemhild Gretchen, Oriko has no reason to hunt down Madoka (who isn't even involved in Extra Story or Sadness Prayer).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kirika Kure:</b> While Sadness Prayer isn't licensed here yet, I do understand that that story is supposed to explore how she and Oriko became friends in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yuma Chitose:</b> Her role as a red herring for Kyubey (away from Madoka) in the original story is obviously moot. In Extra Story, Oriko saves her from making a contract with Kyubey, but only after meeting her at a park first, followed by a vision where she dies from an heart attack courtesy of her abusive mother Mako. It is still possible for Kyubey to find her on his own while she's still alive, but while she might don the same outfit that she wore originally, her powers are likely to be different if Mako is still alive and Kyoko never got involved with her, since she will most likely wish for Mako to be nice to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sasa Yuuki:</b> All we know about her is her jealousy of everyone who is better than her in some way or another, which is exactly why she has the power to brainwash such people into doing her bidding. Sadness Prayer is supposed to involve her, so we might learn more about her when that comes out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Komaki Asako:</b> Appears only briefly in Extra Story. Is stated to be killed in Sadness Prayer by Kirika, who doesn't yet know of her friendship with Oriko, but that was during a fight over a Grief Seed. Naturally, that fight wouldn't have taken place in this story, due to the lack of Grief Seeds or even Soul Gems in existence. (Let's remember that Cibi are meant to be devoured, not necessarily driven to despair, since they don't become Witches unlike Puellae Magi.)</span></div></div>",

It will be updated as necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Pleiades Saints:</b> Would have most definitely banded together the same way as in canon, making their wishes all together at Michiru's suggestion. The experiments, however, are specifically the result of Michiru becoming a Witch, and therefore cannot happen. There might be different experiments, though, if they were to find out their real purpose as Cibi, i.e. as food for Esurientes, to enable them to spawn and give off energy that Incubators harvest. The person I commissioned claimed to have some vague ideas for what kinds of experiments could take place, but couldn't really put anything together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kazumi Subaru:</b> The only Puella Magi thus far who absolutely cannot exist in this story, being a clone of Michiru explicitly containing Witch anatomy. As a Cibus, though, Michiru might assume the same outfit that Kazumi wears for most of the manga, but the new attire she gains in the end is pretty much ruled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kanna Hijiri:</b> Absolutely would exist, being a product of Niko's wish involving an incident from much earlier on. Her own wish (to be able to \"connect\" to others without their knowledge) was specifically the result of realizing her own artificial nature, realizing where it all stems from, perceiving her whole life as a massive lie, and seeking revenge on Niko and her fellow Pleiades. That, however, could only happen if she were to ever spot Niko somewhere in the first place, and even then, not only would Niko be less recognizable due to weight differences, but Kanna would have to make different plans should she still identify her as a clone of herself. No Soul Gems or Grief Seeds means that the anti-Witch-system experiments cannot take place, which in turn rules out the creation of Evil Nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yuuri Asuka and Airi Anri:</b> Only one of them can be a Cibus, depending on whether or not the original Yuuri is dead (in which case, Airi would wish to assume her identity from then on). While the original Yuuri's wish would also remain the same, the actual circumstances are open. If Airi even knows about the Pleiades Saints at all, she most likely will not seek revenge on them, since she only did so canonically for having killed a Witch-ified Yuuri. Things could be as different from canon as Airi herself making her wish and then taking out whatever consumed Yuuri herself, it might not even happen in the same place, and whether the Pleiades even got involved at all is also open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ayase/Luca Souju:</b> Unless anything ever gets spun off from Kazumi Magica, all we will ever know is that she/they collect Soul Gems. Not only do those not exist in this story, but we don't even know what their actual wishes were, or why they collect Soul Gems, let alone would we know how different they'd be in a world without Witches or Soul Gems, or if they'd even make contracts with Kyubey in the first place.</span></div></div>",

However, in truth, she was brainwashed into it by Kagari, who wanted to avenge Tsubaki, whom Suzune killed because <i>she became a Witch</i>. While Tsubaki would still have put Suzune's well-being over her own (and whether she's still alive or not in this story), Kagari would not have become evil, Suzune's canonical victims would still likely be alive (provided they weren't eaten or didn't die some other way), Matsuri would still remember Suzune (if they had still met to begin with), and no one has any reason left to go after Suzune or Kagari. (Since Kagari's actual wish remains unknown, though, she probably would still have the power of illusion and mind-manipulation.)</span></div></div>",

In exchange for one wish, they then become extremely fat.  This type of fat consists of an extreme muscle growth with an outer layer of fat to cushion said muscles,is very firm and plush (rather than loose and flabby), and cannot be lost in any way.  Its initial purpose is to strengthen them to fight flesh-eating monsters called Esurientes, but its true purpose is to make them more wholesome as food than regular people or animals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with increased weight, Cibi also produce some kind of hormone that Esurientes need in order to reproduce, something which other beings are not capable of producing nearly as much, and which female humans are more suited for producing.  When an Esuriens consumes enough of this hormone, it then bursts into spawn and creates the kind of energy that Incubators seek to combat entropy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Characters are to be kept as consistent with their canon counterparts as actual events will allow for.  No arbitrary changes to anyone's character, powers, wishes, where they live, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all canon outside of Madoka Magica, I have written a LiveJournal entry describing how different characters would be from their canon counterparts due to certain circumstances.
