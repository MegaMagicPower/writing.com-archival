She is a living paradox, being both hyperactive and lazy as well as having an undying loyalty towards her family and friends, especially Ryuko, despite not being the most hard-working or strong as some others. Due to her questionable awareness of the world around her, it probably will not be easy, if not impossible, to get her to crack under pressure, not that it wouldn't be fun to try. What should happen to her for this story?</span></div></div>",

She waits for her filled up stomach to deflate back to its normal size, which it eventually does. However, after ten seconds, which is more than what it usually takes for her to revert to normal, she sees that her belly, while no longer huge, is still sticking out of her clothes and has become rather flabby. She pats her belly and watches it jiggle like rippling water with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" she acknowledges this without further thought. Her curiosity quickly gets to her, though, and she runs over the scale her portly father would sometimes use, ignoring or not even acknowledging how out of breath she feels by the time she gets there. She steps onto the scale and finds that she has suddenly gained ____.</span></div></div>",

Usually, she would spend time with those she considers to be her closest buddies, but it has been unnervingly quiet and calm with everyone else happening to be on their separate ways today. She sighs and hopes that a familiar face will return soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, she sees someone she recognizes fondly pass by whom is unaware of her presence. She holds back the urge to make a sound, having the sudden thought of giving her buddy a surprise hug. She remembered how Ryuko would often dodge whenever she tried this with her knowing. She runs into the unsuspecting person and tackles them from behind with open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the deed should be done as she tightens her embrace. However, Mako quickly finds that, without any warning or reason, her arms appeared to have melted and merged with the other person's flesh. Mako tries to get herself free, but her entire torso had become glued into place. Regardless of any attempt to escape, she is slowly sinking into the other's body, something that, judging from their horrified facial expression, is not their intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the -?\" they cried, unable to finish the sentence. It turns out to be ___.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tries to push her off, but doing so only gets her even more stuck onto the other's skin than she already was. In fact, struggling has actually resulted in her flesh melting and sinking into Mako's own flesh. Any clothing getting in the way happens to shed away like dandruff. \"How the Hell are you doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako gets up with Nonon attached to the front of her body from the back. Due to Nonon being much smaller than her despite being arguably older, what used to be her limbs have already comfortably merged with Mako's limbs. All that is left of the miniature musician is her chest and head lying underneath of Mako's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" the air-headed brunette remains stunned and relatively silent. By this point, their clothing has completely fallen apart and left them nude. Nonon aggressively nudges her neck, that being the only body part she has left that she can use to move, in a desperate attempt to surface herself from Mako's quicksand skin. Despair finally kicks in upon the sight of her small breasts melting into Mako's breasts to give them a more firm shape. Both girls get strong tingling jolts and almost moan in pleasure from the nerve endings of their most sensitive areas becoming one as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody help!\" Nonon squeals with absolute terror. What was left of her sinks and drowns inside of Mako's neck to never be heard from again. Mako falls over from the sudden shift in balance with the other girl being gone and her body regaining human shape. Just when things seems to have finally settled down, Mako gets one last surprise with ...</span></div></div>",

Just asking what should happen next seems like lazy writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Do not make any chapters that end the interactive. If someone can keep the story going, then let them keep it going. If a narrative concludes in a \"beginning to middle to end\" fashion, then simply allow people to make a sequel or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) The entries you make can be concise, but they must get to the point as soon as all necessary questions are answered. There are too many chapters in other interactives that would have characters getting age regressed and then ask what specific age they will become instead of what whether they are turned into a baby or a little kid or whatever. As soon as the characters, setting, and circumstance has been established, I want everyone involved to get right into the story instead of wasting good chapter space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Don't be intimidated from the content rating. I simply made it this way to allow more artistic freedom. That said, I will apply some standards regarding said rating. If I find anything I deem inappropriate or get notified for anything that is deemed as such, I will have to take necessary action in order to remedy the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) By adding content to this interactive, you consent that I have the right to edit or delete your work if it breaks any of the other rules or if the grammar is just that bad. I will not penalize people for grammar and spelling mistakes and will leave minor errors alone unless you wish to request me to fix your own content for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, as usual, please feel free to contribute and enjoy.</td>",
