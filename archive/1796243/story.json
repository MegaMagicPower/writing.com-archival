(in this story line you don't know nor do you care what is in this tomb just as long as you get paid, the giantess is HUGE surprise to him and the dig team.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nchoice two: An activist group (yeah i'm going to be consistent) has heard that whatever is in that tomb is a WMD that the government wants it's hands on. you expect a large amount of resistance on your way to the main attraction.
