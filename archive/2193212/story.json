            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twas a dark and stormy night in the kingdom of Nook. The light of the moon long since smothered by the think black clouds. Thunder and lightning reined as did the hard rain fall and violent winds. While most would stay in their homes and avoid the storm, there were those who chose to venture out and spend their time elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan's they called the place. A lonely little establishment only good for getting drunk and attracting the worst kind of company. It was a home for lowlife's and scum. No different than bandit camp. The place seemed packed tonight though, the usual conversations filling the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner sat behind his bar cleaning glasses as usual while his 'customers' continued to get drunk of their rocker. Needless to say it was kind of funny. As a man with nothing to do but serve swine, this was the best kind of entertainment. As the night continued on the conversations grew louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Tommy? Tommy... I am speaking to you. Did ya hear the word?\" A drunkard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What word?\" Tommy answered as he downed his wine. The remnants sliding down his scraggly beard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did ya hear that Goldcheier is in town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goldcheier? Who the hell is that?\" Tommy spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drunkard was dumbfounded. \"Ya been livin' under a rock or somthin'. Elizabeth Goldcheier is supposed to be some big shot knight or somthin'. I heard she took out a bandit camp of thirty men all by herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman taking on group of thirty men. Impossible. It sounds to me you finally hit your limit. You're more booze than man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tellin' ya it's the truth. She packs a helluva punch with big hammer of hers\" The drunkard explained. \"I also hear she's as beautiful as she is deadly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy finally looked interested as he finished his wine. \"You don't say? What's she look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drunkard grinned. \"I hear she's a tall one that one. Blonde and has the roundest tits you've ever laid eyes on. Mmm. Curves in all the right places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy burped. \"Sounds like my kind of woman. The dames in Nook are far too plain. Mostly small brunettes with even smaller assets.\" Tommy paused before continuing. \"Anyway. What's a lady like that doing in crapper like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. All I heard is she's lookin' for somethin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's intrigue was at an all time high. \"And what would that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drunkard was about to answer before the wooden doors of Ryan's began to open. Anyone not passed out from the alcohol turned their heads to see an unusual sight. A tall blonde with curves to die for, wielding a giant hammer that was even bigger than she was. She looked so beautiful but out of place. Like flower in a garden of weeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll were silent as she strode in like she owned the place. Here she was, an armed woman surrounded by the less than noble folk of society. How strange. She walked up to the bar where Ryan awaited her like he did so many. The older man whistled when she leaned against his bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get you ma'am?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"something strong.\" she answered. Ryan nodded before pouring her a cup of his strongest ale. She guzzled it down in seconds. \"Not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan couldn't help but smile when he saw hers. She was about to throw down some coin before he stopped her. \"First one's always free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How generous of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pa raised me to be a gentleman.\" Ryan grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He raised you well.\" The woman smirked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did what he could. Might I ask your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goldchieier. Elizabeth Goldcheier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan. Ryan De Leon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she stated her name, a few people twitched. So this was the Elizabeth Goldcheier? The thirty man slayer. The rumors weren't kidding when they said she was beautiful. She practically put all the ladies of Nook to shame. Why was someone like that here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth knew she had garnered more than a few stairs, but chose to ignore them for now. Business first, entertainment later. \"Perhaps you could help me with a little something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on how little this something of yours is?\" Ryan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for someone. The Queen of Ravens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan gasped. \"The Queen of Ravens?! Why would you be looking for her. You got a death wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth grinned. \"Nope. But I have a promise to keep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that's the case. I might've heard something.\" Ryan teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could reveal the information however, a few of the clientele decided to make their presence known. \"Eh little lady. I'm also looking for the Queen of Ravens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Said another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bitch owes me a lot of money!\" another shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see there's a bounty on that woman's head and I aim to collect. All of my boys and I do. So why don't you be a good girl and step aside and let us have that information?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth turned towards the group of drunk bounty hunters with a grin. She heaved her hammer over her shoulder before staring at the group. There were quite a few of them and this was quite a cramped space. A fight here was sure to be messy, then again what fight wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, could she really give up this information. If she did she'd loose her chance to find the Queen, then again she could always tail these guys when they went to go find her. They seemed like the selfish types to not inform anyone else. But at the same time she didn't need a group of thugs landing on the Queens doorstep. She clenched her hammer tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, Decisions.</span></div></div>",
