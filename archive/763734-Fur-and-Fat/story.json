You\u2019re a big eater, you could handle the five, can\u2019t let good food go to waste after all. You tap your foot paws on the floor impatiently. Wishing the stupid microwave would have some overdrive feature to speed up the process. But, you being a patient beast got what was coming to you. Putting them in two at a time, you take the first batch out. Thankfully there was also some soda in the fridge. But this much to eat, with soda, this early in the day? You begin to have second thoughts. But then brush it off. Your quite slender, some pizza this early isn\u2019t going to hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the first two boxes like nothing, you get to work on the other two, then the last. By the time you finished them all, you feel rather content. All those rumors of beasts bragging to eat a whole box were true, you just had five, but they were rather insignificant. The slender crust and simply not enough cheese cannot compare to the actual restaurant product.  Wishing to revel in such a thing, you sit in with your elbow on your small round table. Pondering on how to make enough money to actually live out your dreams of engorging yourself and pleasurably indulging in the fruit of your labors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take out the boxes to be thrown away you spot something. A coupon like object with big bold words on the side of the box. Holding it up to your face you take closer inspection of it. Suddenly your furry face explodes with glee when you read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations! You are the winner in our all you can eat sweepstakes. To claim your all you can eat pizza supply for a year, simply take this coupon to your local Fred and Jerry\u2019s pizza parlor.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow grand, your favorite pizza joint, and all you can eat for free, what could be better? But hold on, this pizza was almost expired. What if the sweepstakes is no more? Well, only one way to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading outside and turning the keys to your car, you drive quickly in great anticipation to Fred and Jerry\u2019s. The minute you step into the store you run across the room and present the coupon at the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me! Is this coupon still valid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ferret turns in shock at the sound of your voice. Cautiously he takes the coupon from your paw and calls over another ferret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey uh, Carl. Is this coupon still valid. It says its expired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, no, no its not. I remember this, the bosses said they would never disappoint the lucky customer to find this during the sweepstakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! At long last, I could finally reach my dream! \u201cSo, when do I receive my lifetime supply,\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, well\u2026whenever you order I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take everything you have right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferrets looked on in shock. \u201cEr, do you really need that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there stunned at the embarrassment of your request. But quickly think up of an excuse. \u201cUmm, its for my family, yeah. I have a big one, and we\u2019re having a party too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh that makes sense, let me help you with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what would the bosses say about us giving away free food,\u201d rebuked the ferret who took the coupon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh its okay, Fred and Jerry own the biggest pizza joint in the world. They can buy billions more where these came from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019ll need billions for me, you thought manically in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon loading up and heading out you carried all the pizzas back up stairs to your apartment, laid the boxes beside you on the couch, and set about gorging yourself while relaxing and watching TV. The perfect relaxation combo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a bite out of the first pizza, you laugh. \u201cThis is going to be a great year.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two months of heaven had passed since you sent in the coupon. Tens if not hundreds of pizza boxes stacked atop of one another, littered the room of your apartment along with soda bottles. Last night was a particularly wild night. It was your movie night, which called for an extra ten boxes all for yourself. As you gorged on the cheesy delicacies you always kept a paw to your engorged belly. Giving it a hearty slap each time it sloshed and burbled every time you would laugh at your favorite comedy. It was as if your squishy furry stomach laughed with you. Then as soon as all the boxes were depleted and you were content, you went to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleeping peacefully with a paw to your bubbling now rather over plump stomach, you snored. It was another Saturday just as the same over two months ago since you won the sweepstakes. Two whole months of non stop gorging and coursing, sitting inside the house, relaxing and living the good life had caused you to bump up to a staggering two hundred and eighty pounds. But even that wasn\u2019t enough. You wanted to reach the big three fifty. To the point where your foot paws would disappear under your soft fat bubbling swell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now your foot paws were visible, one laying on your bed and one lazily hanging on the edge; swinging to and fro. The previous nights meal had left you bloated and tired. So you groggily traveled to bed, a paw messaging a groaning belly and another bent hanging onto your plump waist. Then you collapsed on the mattress, your vociferous stomach churning its contents around. But as good as all the pizza was, you were looking for a little variety in your life. Thankfully you worked at home on your computer, and the money meant to be used for groceries grew more and more since you always had free pizza and no need to shop, except for larger clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm rang loudly in your ears and you toss the sheets in fright. \u201cNine O\u2019 Clock, geeze,\u201d you complain, forgetting to turn the switch off since you didn\u2019t work on Saturdays. Well, now that you were up how about some breakfast. As you always have since your win you always ordered three boxes of pizza a day, but saved them only when you felt a tiny bit peckish. Which of course was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter warming two boxes up you quickly get to work on them, eating two slices at the same time. Shoving as much cheesy goodness into your mouth to slide down your gullet only to finish the journey by plopping down inside you churning stomach. It only took about four bites to finish one, then you got to work on the next while watching the morning news. A reporter was doing a documentary on your favorite ice cream shop you used to go to as a kid. It was their eightieth anniversary, and they were selling two vats of ice cream for only three dollars. What luck! Just the type of variety you\u2019ve been looking for. You had plenty of money and haven\u2019t been out that much. So what better way to enjoy a nice sunny Saturday then buying and enjoying some ice cream. You quickly grabbed your vest on the way out the door, and dashed for the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drove down to the shop you noticed a large line of customers. Many of them quite fat, and some thin. You would expect so many bulky and chubby consumers would come for the same event as you. But you had something they didn\u2019t, a lifetime supply of pizza at your disposal. Getting out of the car you scoot your way to almost the front of the line. Bumping into many other fat customers who\u2019s waists and stomachs bumped into you, but you managed to get a good way in. In front of you was a enormous fox whose titanic belly made yours seem insignificant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at first from his intimidating size, but bravely tapped his small chubby left arm. \u201cUmm, excuse me?\u201d You call in a silent tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox turned his head around as best he could with his massive gut turning with him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind if I, go in front of you, I\u2019ll make it worth-.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahahahahaha.\u201d He roared in laughter, his corpulence wobbling up and down. \u201cAre you serious, why would I let you cut.\u201d Smacking his bubbling swell, he lifted his massive gut and released it in mid air, allowing it to bounce and nod up and down, as if gloating about his size. \u201cEveryone of us has been waiting in this line forever, and I plan to get every bit of ice cream this place has to offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, that\u2019s quite selfish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made him laugh some more. \u201cHaven\u2019t ya ever seen a fat fox before, we\u2019re the definition of selfish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn\u2019t refuse to back down. \u201cListen, I have at my disposal a lifetime supply of pizza. Not just any pizza Fred and Jerry\u2019s. Any amount you want, any toppings you want. I don\u2019t care if you take all the ice cream for yourself, but please let me go in front of you and you could have as much as your heart desires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large foxes cavernous stomach growled in anticipation. But he gave it a smack which sent waves of fat vibrating all around his overfed stature. \u201cShut up, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d His stomach seemed to have thought for him as it continued to groan. Then he looked at you suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I know you\u2019ll keep your promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took out a pen and small notebook. \u201cJust give me your address and I swear you\u2019ll receive as much as you want free of charge.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox smiled and licked his lips. \u201cFree of charge eh. Oh I always loved Fred and Jerry\u2019s, ever since I was a kid.\u201d You smiled as you related to that, then the fox continued. \u201cAlright, deal, I want twenty boxes, five cheese, five pineapple, five combo, and five mushroom sent to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wrote down the address, you thank the fox and he steps aside. His large stomach sticking out and pushing against you as you moved through. You couldn\u2019t believe how soft and squishy it was when you moved between him and another beast. He must of at least have ten layers of fat stacked one on top of the others. While proceeding the large gut gurgled again at the feeling of you touching it; the fox even chuckled. The idea of being like that was quite thrilling to you. Having a titanic, gloppy, burbling belly such as his would be just what you always dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drift into a fat day dream, the ice cream vendor, a female rat who too had significant girth, addresses you. \u201cHello,\u201d she says in the sweetest voice you\u2019ve every known. \u201cHow may I help you today,\u201d she says wearing a large jolly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take 2 of every flavor you got.\u201d Unlike the ferrets back at the pizza parlor, the fat doe shook with merriment. Cuffing her paws to stifle a giggle while her jolly frame wobbled under her apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, is something wrong,\u201d You ask, chuckling yourself along with this sweet lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, nothing at all. I just get excited when someone orders so much. I tell you I\u2019ve been giggling all day from all the large globe-like patrons we\u2019ve had ordering plenty. Oh I love this job, I love the ice cream here ever since I was tiny. Everyday after school I would come here, I could never get enough of it. And it makes me so joyful that others share the same enthusiasm I have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn\u2019t really call it enthusiasm, just a joy for gluttony and over eating. And to hopefully obtain your goal of a titanic like burbling, bubbling, soft, gloppy, amount of fat such as that of the fox behind you. But you didn\u2019t really intend to burst her bubble. Two raccoons of equal size came with the shipment and loaded it onto a small truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be sixty four dollars,\u201d her smile growing ever pleasantly. You hand her the money. \u201cThank you so much. Just take the boys to your home and they\u2019ll follow you with your shipment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she replied. \u201cI hope you enjoy the cookie dough ice cream. That was my favorite, I might have some myself when I\u2019m on break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood for her, the sweet gal. But now you had what you came for, and lucky too. As soon as you drive away, the enormous fox waddled his way to the counter. His massive gut groaning and burbling, wobbling and jiggling like a tank of gelatin to and fro on his way there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how may I help you my fine fellow fox?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resounding smash, he leaned all his weight on the counter and gave a conceited smile, churning his grotesquely over blubbered belly contently. \u201cI\u2019ll take all of it, every single last scoop down to the almonds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unlike the many times that day. The plump doe exploded in uproarious laughter, with the fox vociferously joining her. Each ones corpulence bouncing with mirth. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The day you got back was certainly a day to remember. No sooner when you shut the door to your house did you lay bucket upon bucket on your table and chugged as much ice cream as you can down your gullet. Spoonless and wearing a conceded grin, you would you allowed chunk after chunk of ice cream to glop into your pudgy belly. After 10 buckets of rich flavor, you would moan in ecstasy while rubbing your burbling swell with a free paw; licking any sticky remnants of ice cream from your face and claws. The contents within you would slosh about upon giving it a hearty smack. Running your paws across a soft layer of furry fat made you crave for more glutting; so you finished up as much ice cream as you could and order more pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, on Thanks giving day, you prepare a large table meant for ten other beasts, all for yourself. You waddle from the door to the kitchen with boxes of fresh prepared food quickly, anxious to get on with the upcoming feast that night. Managing a 350 pound frame was deemed an exciting task, and with much more belly to fondle and hug, you only wanted to grow much larger. This was the point you had dreamed about, the point where you finally had enough body to love for hours on end. You ordered the food via computer with some more unused money meant to go toward groceries. Finally bored with pizza, you hoped that the Turkey with extra stuffing would prove a formidable foe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything finally set up, stuck your stomach out as much as you can, gave it a few hearty slaps and words of encouragement, then sat down to commence with the feast. Turning on your TV for entertainment, you recline in your chair while chewing away at a whole pie; not bothering to cut it up first. The thanksgiving day parade always excited you since you were a kid, mainly because all the food that was on display on the floats or the floats themselves. Much of what was on TV was right in front of you on your massive kitchen table. Distracted by the spectacle, your stomach groaned for more eating to be had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter glutting down 3 pies, your decide to go for the mashed potatoes, rice, biscuits and garlic bread. Being the voracious beast you were, you stacked your plate high on them, and uncontrollably cram the food into your mouth by the pawfuls. But what is a feast without any drinks? So, you pop the cork off some old whine you also ordered and start to guzzle it down. Unwittingly, you don't think about the intoxicating effects and get rather woozy. With the last bit of liquid escaping your lips, you sway to and fro; buzzed and with a sloppy grin on your face. Suddenly the food looks more appetizing than when you first saw it. Finishing up the remainder of the whine and letting out a content hiccup, you lose yourself in the feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes you have stuffed most of the mashed potatoes and garlic bread down your gullet and rested a paw on your bloated belly. Feeling it burble ominously and grow with every massive swallow until it was all done with. Only allowing your stomach to settle for a moment, you get to work on the desert. Cakes, pies, turnovers, flan, sweet bread, cinnamon roles, all of it was gloriously glutted in massive quantities. Never using a napkin to clean up after yourself, you instead would use your tongue or digits to lick or pick up any cream or jelly that landed on your massive swell or was splattered all over your face. You crammed the more bite sized meals by fives into your mouth, allowing your cheeks to expand. Only chewing five times, you swallowed, allowing your throat to feel a sharp pain as a bowling ball slid down your gullet. But this didn't stop you. You continued with the rest of the delicacies until you begin to feel terribly bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a slight groan, you looked to your belly. It certainly was bigger now than when you started; at least five inches bigger. But looking back to your feast, there was much more to be had. Ignoring your stomachs groaning and bubbling, you rapidly polished off three more apple pies. Grabbing the pink box full of donuts, you kept eating, not allowing your stomach to rest. Three boxes of a dozen donuts, two buckets of chicken, another bottle of whine, and a whole salmon all found a home within your cavernous stomach. The more you drank, the more dizzy you became, and the more you would feel to engorge yourself. Having been over glutted twice, maybe three times over, you give your stomach a content slap. The round bulge seeped onto your knees and stretched your sides. Never have you eaten this much before, and never had any amount of pizza pleasured you to this extent. Every slight movement you made to reach for the next morsel was greeted with you groaning and your belly gurgling. But the best part of the feast hadn't come. There was still the turkey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntimidated at first by its size, you gulped. Was there possibly anymore you could fit into your titanic belly. Your paws were barely able to wrap around it. You were practically a slave to it. Unable to stand up because of its massive size and your bulging waist. Not to mention that it pressed your legs down so moving wasn't much of an option. It must've added another 50 pounds on you. But it was what you wanted, and it was pleasurable. The tingling sensation sliding your digits across your massive swell was euphoric. Each layer of fat, each expanding inch was what you dreamed about. Giving another hearty pat, you allowed your glut to slosh around before dragging the turkey over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be my crowning achievement\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatter on that night, the lights were off, the table was filled with empty dishes, and the turkey-boneless, and not a scrap of stuffing left. Over by the couch, a titanic fur ball slept, you. Richly lounging with a heavy leg on one arm of the couch and another dangling, you laid with a paw to the remote and another barely resting on a titanic balloon large enough to fit 3 other creatures in there. Your massive belly never stopped groaning and bubbling since you finished off the turkey. And with a conceded grin resting on a second chin, you close your eyes in a blissful slumber; continuing to stroke your overly gorged, overly glutted stomach. With every breath your belly would slosh, and every stroke your stomach would purr happily. Soon you felt compelled to run both your paws across your fat grossly distended flesh. Giving a final content pat, you giggled at having your nights gluttony tickling your insides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope the after Thanks Giving feast is just as good as today,\" you yawned as you drift off into sleep. Continuing to glut yourself without abandon in your dreams.</span></span></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's five months later after your thanks giving feast, April, to be precise. The trickling of rain knocks like pebbles on your bedroom window. But it didn't disturb you, you, a gigantic ball of fur resting on a small bed. You didn't bother using any of your blankets, since they were too small to cover your whole body anyway. Your fur and fat was more than enough to keep you warm anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of your life only consisted of two things: eating and sleeping. The fatter you got, the lazier and uninterested you became in usual daily assignments. Walking was becoming a drag, combing your fur was a hassle, it took you a good ten minutes to get up from a couch because you thought, \"why can't I just stay sitting and eat?\" Though, it'd be a lie if you said you weren't interested in <i>anything</i>. You were sure there was something out there you still found fun. Something you could still do in your current obese state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you open your eyes and look to your clock. 12:30 P.M. It read, another 12 hours of sleep down the drain after another all nighter. You scratch your monumentally large belly--well, scratching what surface you could. Then stretching your plumped up limbs, you shift yourself to the side of your bed. Rocking back and fourth, you gather enough momentum to lift yourself up, resting atop a heap of blubbery fat. It felt good to view your girth again, but, your view was limited by your enormous belly. So, you heaved yourself up, and waddled your way over to your closet mirror; gazing upon your impressive visage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, you were enormous. Possibly as fat as the fox on that day of the ice cream sale; heck, perhaps you were fatter. 500lbs never looked so good on any beast. Your head had sunk into your body, which marvelously sloped down and curved in all directions. Your arms, plump like a roast, could barely wrap themselves around your chest area; at least your paws were still able to easily grab morsels to cram down your throat. Your thunderous thighs trailed down to the smallest footpaws. So few did hind legs like your\u2019s get the privilege to lug around such a wonderfully sculpted body. And finally, the piece de resistance, your enormous, soft, squishy, pleasurable to the touch, lard filled belly. You couldn\u2019t resist but run your paws across your furry flesh. Such a well sculpted frame, well rounded and only going to get rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave your enormous gut a few blithe slaps in many directions, causing you to giggle as the tip of your claws tickled the surface. It was fun being such an enormous size; having so much to love and play around with. So much to pat, and hug. But most of all, how much food would be able to fit inside it. Spending a good 20 minutes admiring yourself, you then waddled over to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo another beast, your home would be a cardboard jungle, but to you, it was home. Stacks upon stacks of pizza boxes filled the room; too much for you to count, or even care about counting. Every second wasted meant a slice of pizza that wasn\u2019t eaten. Your large bulky waist would knock over some of the boxes and get in the way of you moving around, until you finally reached the door. Outside was at least 20 pizza boxes; your daily breakfast you ordered the first time you woke up. You got out of bed now, but you first woke up earlier in the day, looked to the clock, and went back to sleep. Licking your lips, you made five trips from door to couch picking up all the pizzas by fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen finally able to eat, you would just pig out. Glutting a whole pizza like it was a sandwich; not even separating the slices. You would sit their on your couch, gobbling pizza after warm pizza. Granted it took much chewing to finish one, you didn\u2019t mind. The gooey cheese coupled with delicious sauce which would melt in contact with your tongue. And the rich, soft crust, adding into the flavors of pepperoni. It was all so delicious, and enjoyed for about 30 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the 20 boxes of pizza adding to the pile scattered around the room, you rested your paws on your belly. Now more round and stuffed, you tried shaking it about. But your massive corpulence only allowed an undulating motion as so much fat was shifted throughout your massive body. The sloshing and burbling of about 60 pizza slices bumped your over filled stomach into other organs, which churned pleasantly, giving you a wonderful inner body massage. The delectation of the message caused you to shake more vigorously, and with every pleasurable impulse, you would slowly melt into your couch. Your legs slide down to the floor, your head drifts off into a blissful state, your belly protrudes further into the air and makes contact with your cheek; the fervent gurgles groaning close to your ears. Your paws, like that of a bakers knead your glorious stomach. Finally, this was were you\u2019ve always wanted to be. Now in this state of bliss, getting fatter was only a more pleasant though. Only this time, you\u2019d like to change your approach. Pizza was dull, and there was many different varieties still out there. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided that no matter how much food you'd cram down your throat, you'd never be satiated for long enough. Huffing and puffing, hauling yourself up off the couch you walk over to the phone, shuffling your jiggling, massive thighs past each other. A few more steps, and you'd reach the blasted thing. Wheezing a little, you reached the counter where the phone was adjacent to a few pizza boxes... some of your income these days being from a combination of eating contests, web modeling for plus size fans and the recycling profits from all the cardboard. You hefted your belly up, grabbing it in handfuls and squeezing it, and you smiled at how doughy you've really become. You heard from a source from your online colleagues that there was a \"fat farm\" someone was running. A place where fatties such as yourself became completely enraptured in gluttony in order to please adoring fans who'd watch your growth and splendor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the free pizza was definitely not coming to a shortage any time soon, it was inevitable that you'll become far too far to move eventually. Just waddling over to this very phone was already taxing enough at your size, a hefty 500 pounds. Your curves were still wobbling from the ordeal. With your tummy rumbling again and thinking with your belly, you grabbed the phone and dialed the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, thish ish the *munch* Fat Vat Farm, Elora speaking. How may I help you?\" The girl on the other end sounded quite heavy, and obviously eating something. A good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi... I'd like to enroll in the program, as a farm fatty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shure, jusht forward ush your... *huff* contact detailsh pleash, and we'll arrange everything shtep by shtep.\" You thought to herself, if her speech is already that impaired, just how fat was she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were excited none the less, and over the course of half an hour you forwarded them the necessary information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll shend you a... *urp* pickup to the airport shoon, have a nice *huff* day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was beating fast, and your stomach was growling in anticipation. You shimmied over to the couch, your entire body shaking, your belly and lovehandles swaying with each movement. Stuffing yourself with a few more slices of pizza, you sat and waited for the next few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the contacts came to your house, there was a well dressed, strangely lean hyena stepping out of a vehicle with two butlers flanking him. The Hyena looked at you and smiled, and took your hand and politely kissed it as you answered the door, heaving yourself. \"Greetings... you must be our new applicant. Pleasure to be of acquaintance.\" You were rather charmed by this Hyena, who was fairly attractive by your books despite being so thin. \"Fellas, lets escort our most beautiful applicant to the vehicle. With a snap of their fingers, the two butlers, who were rather immense in size, literally heaved your heavy, blubbery frame onto a moped with shocking strength, and escorted you to a rather large sized limo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll overview the contract inside dear, but I think you'll find us most accommodating. With Fat Vat Farm, you won't have to expend a single unnecessary calorie with us, and you'll be in the lap of luxury. The agreement is mutually beneficial... there is a large amount of patrons for our business and we don't wish to disappoint them after all with thin models.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lapped it all up... you were fascinated by this dazzling Hyena, how they described the place and the terms and conditions were most agreeable. A health waver was needed to be signed and agreed to, in that extraordinary weights may be achieved but you had no problem with that. You wanted to be doughy and fat, constantly well fed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigning it, you were taken to a complex with lavish quarters... on the dot call in servants, constant and varied food and most interesting of all, access to the \"fat vat\" itself, which was in effect a network of tubes that pumped some sort of filling into the subject's mouth, and sped up digestion through some sort of chemical process, meaning little to no waste and complete conversion of calories into fat. The others there all varied in size... some small, some rather large, but the largest seemed to have whole rooms to themselves- you did not know how big they truly were, as their quarters were off limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And so you dug in with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first course was a rib platter, with a side of potato salad and fries. The pork was juicy, falling off the bone, and the sauce was sinfully sweet and smokey. The salad was equally rich and decadent, and while the fries were nothing to write home about, they still were pretty good. You all but cooed with each succulent mouthful, and knew you'd have to come here again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour second course was their tuna fish tacos, and Mexi-fries, or tater-tots as most people would call them. This place really didn't skimp out on the portions, as the platter had four full sized tacos on it, and the heap of Mexi-fries was as tall as the meat part of the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you'd even ordered your third course, you were starting to pant lightly from the tight feeling developing in your stomach. Still, there was no way you weren't sampling their ginger beef and fried rice platter, and at least some of their desserts. You were grateful you'd worn one of your longer shirts, as you'd undone your pants and loosened your belt, leaving your belly with room to expand without worrying about your pants hitting the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate of fried rice was enormous, and you were definitely feeling your binge by that point, as it was a struggle to force it all down. You certainly gave your server a start after that, since you then ordered three desserts- a slice of peach cobbler, a slice of chocolate cake, and one of their house eclairs. This time, the cooing wasn't in your mind but audible, as you chewed and swallowed each delicious, sugary mouthful, your long tail curling in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing your first (enormous) meal of the day, you carefully got up. Your belly hurt, but it was a good hurt, and you gingerly made your way to the counter to pay. Your coupon proved to be well worth it, as your meal should have cost almost forty dollars, but only came out to $4.98, after tax. You were so pleased with the service, you left an extra-large tip at the table before making your way to your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou belched as you remembered, rubbing your poor, suffering tummy. Perhaps you'd have been fine if you'd stopped there, but you certainly didn't stop at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you got home, you switched to your sweat pants, and took a well deserved nap. When you awoke again, it was nearly nine o'clock, and despite how much you'd eaten not three hours before, you thought you might be a mite peckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well,\"</i> you thought, <i>\"I wanted to use all of today's coupons anyway. And besides, whatever I don't eat can be tomorrow's lunch.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you'd called Leo's Pizza and ordered two large deep-dish pizzas. You checked yourself out in the mirror while you waited. Your belly still looked a little bloated from your earlier binge, but it was nowhere near as hard as it had been, for which you were rather grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang, signalling the arrival of your food. Giving the cute fox dropping it off a generous tip (though if they noticed you, they certainly didn't show it), you put the boxes on your coffee table. Popping in your favourite movie and grabbing a coke from the fridge, you sat down for dinner and a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, you paid very little attention to the movie, instead focusing all your efforts on your pizza feast. Leo's Pizza was quite honestly the best pizza in town, but you seldom ate their due to the cost. But with the two larges for a medium deal, it was more then affordable, and you happily chowed down. Everything was perfect- the meat, the crust, the cheese, even the grease on top was simply excellent. You simply chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed, and chewed and swallowed, loving every tasty morsel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, the first box became noticeably empty, so you moved it aside and dug into the second one. When that one somehow also emptied, you felt you needed dessert. Willfully ignoring the pain in your gut, you slowly made your way to the kitchen. Grabbing a bowl and a spoon, you took the ice cream out of the freezer. You then promptly thought better of the bowl, and took the one gallon pail and the spoon with you to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite by bite, you scarfed down the ice cream one spoonful at a time, ignoring your tummy's pleas for mercy and your mounting brain freeze. Before you knew what you'd done, your spoon was scraping the bottom of the pail. Looking up, you saw that your movie was over and halfway through the credits, and like a thunderbolt, everything you'd just stuffed into your tiny, furry body hit you all at once with a mighty groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out another mighty belch as you finished reminiscing. As you continued to rub your drum-tight belly, you thought <i>\"Maybe a better question is <b>how</b> I ate that much food.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were rather disappointed in yourself, and not just because you ate so much you nearly made yourself sick. Since you'd eaten all that pizza, you now had no leftovers for tomorrow. As you drifted off to sleep, you thought, <i>I'll just check the coupon book tomorrow. There's probably something in it for Sunday, after all...\"</i></span></div></div>",

Restaurant meals, delivery places, grocery store treats, and all at such a discount that your food bills had shrunk to nearly nothing. The portions were nothing to scoff at, either, generally starting at large and approaching the level of absolutely ridiculous. Even with your herculean ability to eat, there were times you couldn't finish your meal, and had to save it for leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd made a habit of bringing many of your discount goodies to work with you. Your job in data entry was anything but exciting, but made for a good place to snack on your many treats. The boxes of snack cakes were easily your favourite, and it was rare that you didn't bring a case and finish it over the course of the work day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you predicted, you never needed to pack a lunch, simply eating at whatever restaurant the coupon book had for each day. You only had one problem with that, and that was the need to finish off everything you ordered, which was often quite considerable. You had gotten leftovers from lunch the one time, and left them in the breakroom fridge. By the time you'd gotten off work, though, your doggie bag had disappeared from the ice box, and of course no one knew what had happened to it. After that, you always made sure to fit it all in your cavernous belly, even if it left you sore afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weekends, though, were by far the worst of your days of gluttony. Between several restaurant and take-out sales, and the need to finish your leftovers before they spoiled, you basically spent the day eating full pelt, minus your naps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this over the course of the last month had a few obvious results. One, your stomach was forced to stretch out, allowing you to eat more. Two, as your stomach's capacity increased, your appetite was following suit, meaning you had to eat larger portions more frequently in order to feel full. Three, and perhaps most obvious, was that you were starting to gain weight. What first alerted you to this fact?</span></div></div>",

You'd been a little over zealous with the coupons, it was true. But you'd always been a big eater, and the high price of food had often seen you go to bed hungry. Therefore, wasn't it right that you got to enjoy it while it lasted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that attitude was catching up with you now. Slowly but surely, you'd watched your shirts and work pants grow tighter, and get retired one by one. And as you looked at yourself in the mirror, it was painfully clear that this shirt had seen its last day, at least until you lost some weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buttons were clearly straining to hold together, and grey fur was visible in the gaps in the cloth. The skin tight cloth did nothing to hide your developing side rolls and love handles, and as you turned and looked over your shoulder, you could the beginning of new back rolls. Your belly had begun to noticeably pooch forward, and your thighs and booty looked meatier in your pants as well, though that garment was at least still serviceable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is kind of worrisome, especially since this shirt was perfectly fine last week,\"</i> you thought as you gave your belly a rub. The organ gave a growl, either in appreciation of the touch or disapproval at the lack of food, you weren't really sure which.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, not all hope was lost. You grabbed your sweater out of the closet. You'd been hoping to avoid the heavy garment, as it was the height of summer, but it was the only work-appropriate garment you had that didn't leave an unacceptable amount of your body on display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach let out another growl, clearly feeling neglected as you needlessly obsessed over clothes when you could be eating. You let out a sigh. No matter what, you would need to buy some new work duds this weekend. There was also the matter of your weight gain to consider at the same time, as well. You didn't question that, if you continued as you had been, you'd get bigger and bigger, necessitating either larger clothes or more frequent purchases of them, likely both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you should cut down on the food and exercise more, but you really didn't want to. It was really nice to eat as you want. And honestly, with how much you were saving on food, a new wardrobe wouldn't impact your finances all that much. What to do?</span></div></div>",

Honestly, being a little pudgy didn't bother you in the slightest, and there were so many places and foods you had yet to try. How could you just waste this opportunity? Besides, you only had a year's worth of coupons. How much damage could you do in a year? You could worry about dieting back down afterwards, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it through your work week, though admittedly with some difficulty. Your sweater may have been your saving grace, but it was HOT. Everyday, when you got home from work, you peeled it off, your undershirt soaked with sweat. Slightly wore out, you decide to take a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water's warming up, you strip down. You look at yourself in the mirror, eyeing the patches of fur stuck to your skin with sweat. As you look at your belly, you frown a little. Are your side rolls getting bigger? <i>\"No,\"</i> you think to yourself, <i>\"can't be. No way I gained that much in a week.\"</i> That thought reminded you of the pastries you bought earlier. As you waited for the water, you went to the hallway and grabbed the last two from the bag, scarfing them down before hopping into the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tummy let out a growl, giving its own opinion on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weekend, you bought new work clothes. Since you didn't have any plans to cut back on the chow or start exercising, you figured it was more then likely that you'd gain a few more pounds, and bought your wardrobe appropriately. Your pants required a belt to avoid falling off your body, and your shirts were honestly a bit too baggy, but at least this way you knew you'd get a fair bit of life out of them. And hopefully you wouldn't run out of work clothes and have to wear that awful sweater again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd purchased a hot dog at the food court, and were eating it as you made your way through the parking lot to your car. You felt a slight wobble from your belly, and you again found yourself wondering whether or not you should cut down on the fatty foods a little. Licking the grease off your fingers, you got a little lost in thought while you dug out your keys. What were you thinking about?</span></div></div>",

Your meals had greatly increased, both in size and frequency, since you received that coupon book, forcing your stomach to stretch out. While this had some positive effects, namely not feeling sick after every meal, it did result in you needing a larger quantity of food in order to feel full. The fact that you still went to bed feeling rather stuffed was a testament to your unabashed gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely wait to get home, swinging through the drive-thru of a local burger joint to tide yourself over until your actual meal. Your tail curled with happiness as you scarfed down your burgers and fries on the way back home. A dinner for 4 for only $3? Yes, please! You honestly found yourself wondering if any of these places were making any money from this promotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished the last of your pre-dinner snack as you parked your car. <i>Should I have chinese for dinner, or maybe order pizza?</i> you thought as you grabbed your new work clothes from the back seat, blatantly ignoring that you'd just eaten enough calories to feed a family, and were actually considering eating more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke with a groan on your couch, surrounded by empty fast food containers and empty pop cans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to decide between the two, you simply ordered both Chinese and pizza. Against all odds, both delivery drivers arrived at the same time. Initially assuming there'd been some mistake, both were shocked when you had told them that all this food was indeed meant to come here. Their eyes nearly bugged out of their heads when, after questioning, you told them that no, you weren't expecting company; this was all for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd eagerly dug into the feast before you, happily chewing your way through multiple Styrofoam containers. However, even your eyes could be bigger then your stomach, and eventually you found yourself slowing down. Not to be deterred, you ate until you fell asleep, then resumed eating once you awoke. This process continued many times until, finally, well into the night, you woke up to find the last of the food containers was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What time is it?</i> You looked to your living room clock, seeing it was shortly after midnight. Tenderly, gingerly, you slowly move forward on the couch until at last you feel you can safely get to a standing position. You slowly stagger your way up the stairs to your bedroom and collapse on your bed with an audible \"oomph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez, you were stuffed! Honestly, you were kind of amazed right now. That was an insane quantity of food you'd packed into your body. Your fuzzy belly was rock-hard, and making some rather alarming gurgling noises as it tried to process the ungodly food baby you'd given it. You fell to sleep wondering (somehow) what you should have for breakfast tomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you chose to ignore your mounting pudge and keep eating. The question is, how much did you gain before you had to reexamine your life choices again?</span></div></div>",

I don't even...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts and others just like it were passing through your mind as you looked at your expanded features in your mirror. It really was something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past few months, you'd gotten fatter. A lot fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for some, out growing your clothes every couple of weeks might have been an indication to slow down. You, on the other hand, just opted to keep eating and buy larger clothes on the weekends. When your tush was getting too wide to comfortably fit in your chair at work, you put in an order for a new chair while grabbing another box of donuts from the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven your coworkers, some of whom were far from svelte themselves, seemed taken aback by the rapidity of your weight gain. One, who shall remain nameless, even had the nerve to point out just how fat you'd gotten after he was gone for two weeks vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, through all of this, you never once slowed down your consumption. If anything, you were only eating more. So long as you were stuffing your face with deliciously fattening foods, you were more then able to block out the inevitable after effects. However, one event earlier in the day had made you finally take full stock of your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at work earlier in the day, you'd dropped a box of staples to the floor and bent over to pick them up. As you leaned over, a loud ripping sound echoed through your tiny cubicle. To your horror, you learned it wasn't just one, but two large tears in your clothes, one for both your shirt and your pants. Shocked to stillness, you could only look in stark terror at your exposed flesh as your nearby coworkers snickered at your situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least today had been Friday, but you knew this story would make its way around the office like wild fire. By Monday morning, everyone would know of the land whale in cubicle 17b.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you'd looked at yourself in that moment, you had finally noticed what you'd been working so hard at ignoring. The flesh you saw was soft with fat, and jiggled like jello covered in a too tight wrapping of gray fur. This had driven you to the bathroom once you got home, and at long last, you were taking stock of the damage you'd done to yourself, and it was certainly substantial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour belly had taken a sizeable share of the calories flooding into your system. Thick side rolls wrapped all the way around your back, and your cavernous gut had formed a large, heart shaped belly. It proudly stuck forward, bulged wide, and was beginning to droop down under its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you couldn't see all of it in this mirror, you could see enough of your hips to know they'd also widened considerably, and turning to the side gave you a good view of just how far your flabby butt cheeks were beginning to protrude. Finally paying attention to yourself after all this time, you hadn't failed to notice how much you were starting to waddle as you walked, nor how much jiggle there was with each lightly swaying step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven your arms had started to put on a layer of pudge. Lifting your right arm up, you looked at its increased girth. Reaching over with your left hand, you gave it a shake and watched it wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How? How did I let this happen?</i> That was very much a rhetorical question, as you knew exactly how you'd put yourself into this situation. Good deal or not, you knew you had no excuse for eating as much as you did. Frankly, you'd been making a pig of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you eyed yourself in the mirror, you noticed that, so far at least, you'd managed to avoid gaining any weight in your face. A small blessing perhaps, but for now, you'd take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran your hands over your gray furred tummy, paying especial attention to its softness and how it rippled like water as you played with it. You glanced over at your dusty bathroom scale in the corner. Perhaps you should weigh yourself? Last time you checked, you weighed somewhere around 160 pounds. </span></div></div>",

Nothing too extravagant; the generic drugs, snacks, drinks and other strange oddities they stock. When you get down there, someone new greets you. The store is owned by a nice pair of elderly labs who moved from Eastern Europe in the late 1950\u2019s. Now a young tiger runs the till. He\u2019s in his late teens by the looks of it, the first longer hairs of a beard beginning to come in. He wears a jacket and a nondescript tee, and a pair of clean jeans. He seems a little on the pudgy side, however; maybe around 160 or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there! What can I get\u2019cha for tonight?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need something to help me get to sleep.\u201d You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the over-the-counter meds are over in the aisle next to the snacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, though\u2026\u201d he starts. \u201cIf you\u2019ll eat a good meal and then take these, they\u2019ll knock you out cold.

If you add a chapter and it doesn't follow these, then I may or may not edit it to my heart's content. Also follow Writing.com rules, and don't go and ruin the story for everyone by ending a path prematurely, or forcing someone to follow a single path. Other then that, have fun reading and/or writing, be sure to include lots of weight gain.</td>",
