            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   The noises and screams sound female, females in dire need of help.  However, the situation is none of your business.  So of course you charge right in.  <br>\r\n   The door is shut as you approach.  You hope it is a cheap one, or at least you can replace it with a cheap one.  But either way, you are opening it the proper barbarian way, with your shoulder and at full speed.    <br>\r\n    The door quickly converts to \"used\" condition as you crash into the room and try to figure out what is going on.  With at least a dozen screaming women, who have between them perhaps enough clothing for one of them [but which is way too much in your opinion] make it hard to focus, but the three men with swords and a none too friendly attitude seem worth attention.<br>\r\n     \"WHAT GO ON HERE?  THROG NO LIKE!\"  Pretty much just an act.  Granted you are not smart enough to make much of a wizard, but you are hardly stupid.  Still, when people see the stereotype big stupid barbarian looking angry, they either run or they think some really stupid trick will get rid of you.  Either way, the result is apt to be better for you than for them.  Sometimes it is smart to be stupid.<br>\r\n    The apparent leader of these three manages to do both tactics.  \"Beat it.  This is none of...\"  His voice trails off as he realized just how far he is looking up when he tries to look you in the eye.  \"... I mean we are just here doing some redecorating, and the girls got a little upset at the changes.  Isn't that right?\"  His glare at the ladies is presumably intended to intimidate them into silence.<br>\r\n    You do not bother to see if it works.  \"THAT SILLY\" you bellow and step forward with sword out.  \"YOU LEAVE NOW!\"<br>\r\n   \"Well in that case...\" the leader answers, and the three rogues attack.<br>\r\n    Rather, two of them do.  The one that was trying to sneak up behind you is busy trying to keep his guts from falling out after your sword slash takes care of him.  But two rogues can still give a careless barbarian a really bad day if they flank you.  You have some painful memories of that sort of misadventure.  So you desperately move to keep them from getting that advantage.  <br>\r\n    Seeing the dispatching of their companion, the other two pause long enough to miss the best chance to get you.  But they come on, even as you roar with rage.  Not really too bright of them, but it's not too hard to hurt an angry barbarian, and their swords make some nasty cuts into you.  <br>\r\n    Unfortunately for them, a raging barbarian takes a lot of killing. You are just annoyed by the wounds.  Really really annoyed, but not slowed down as you cut the head off one of them.  The leader is rather shocked to find himself alone, but has the courage, or the stupidity,  to attack you again.  That hurts him a lot more than it hurts you.  Your sword goes all the way thru him.<br>\r\n    As you tug your sword loose, you look for new foes and are disappointed to see none.  You calm down, and once again experience the disadvantage of being a raging barbarian.  Without your anger to strengthen you, you feel weak and helpless.  Those pinprick wounds are suddenly firestorms of pain.  You are barely able to stand and stagger over to a couch and more fall onto it than sit down.    <br>\r\n    For a moment, the women stand in shock.  Then they rush to your side to deal with your wounds.  One seems to be some sort of cleric, and you are soon able to stand.<br>\r\n    As you thank the ladies of the evening, the madam steps forward and tells you.  \"You have saved my life and I pay my debts.  My darlings are all slaves, so you may have your choice as a gift if you promise to treat her well.  Alternately, you may become my business partner.  I warn you that will be dangerous.  I have enemies you will have to deal with.  You should get more that way, but you will earn it.\"<br>\r\n    \"Well, I guess I will ...\"    <br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

They make me a lot of gold as long as they work hard, and unhappy slaves don't work hard or well.  We have got to keep the girls happy, and that means you stay off them unless they want you on.\"<br>\r\n   \"But...\" Not that you are sure that you would want a lass who didn't want you, but...<br>\r\n   \"No!  You are just going to have to say 'Please'.\" She confirms.  \"I doubt they will say no all that often to a stud who has maybe saved their lives, but you are going to have to take their word on the subject.\"<br>\r\n   With a sigh, you switch subjects.  \"OK, now what trouble?<br>\r\n   \"Gilles is the main problem.\" The madam explains.  \"He's a new crime lord in the area, and he is being greedy.  That was his thugs you just killed.\"<br>\r\n   \"He only killed one.  I was able to save the other two.\"  Looking up, you see the cleric-prostitute who healed you is smiling happily, and two of the thugs are getting back to their feet, still badly wounded, but clearly alive despite the massive wounds you gave them.<br>\r\n   \"Peace!\" the madam groans.  \"What are you doing?  They would have raped and killed you.\"<br>\r\n   \"But they would have died, Lady Tabra.\" Peace answers as if that explains why she should save the lives of vicious slime. You wonder if she is simple-minded, but clerics are usually pretty smart...<br>\r\n   Tabra seems to agree with you that there is something weird about Peace's mental processes, but apparently she has had this argument before.  Instead she rolls her eyes to the ceiling and turns to the two thugs.  \"Wigan!  Take your two louts and get out!  You have your answer.\"  <br>\r\n     Wigan seems willing to argue, until you get to your feet and pull out your sword.  Then the two pick up the body of the third and stumble out.  \"This isn't over.\" he warns as he leaves.<br>\r\n    \"All right girls,\" Tabra orders.  \"We have got to clean up this mess.  Let's get to work.\"  It quickly becomes apparent that \"We\" includes you, particularly for the heavy items.  At least the women are quick with compliments about your strength, and how impressed they are with you.  You also get to \"accidentally\" bump into the girls, who make no objections, and some of which bump back.  One does so quite vigorous, and earns a rebuke from Tabra, \"Barbara!  Business before pleasure.  Do the housework now, and save your eagerness for the Johns tonight.\"  Barbara sticks out her tongue at Tabra, but moves away from you, tho not without an enticing wiggle.  [Not that you get much chance to admire it.  Tabra has a couch that needs moving.]<br>\r\n    Finally the place looks like a brothel, and not the scene of a battle.  Tabra announces \"Good.  Now get yourselves cleaned up.  I don't know if we are going to have a great or dead night, but we need to be ready.  So put on your best.\"<br>\r\n    As the girls head upstairs, Tabra turns to you.  Clearly the two of you need to discuss some things.  Who is this Gilles?  And just what is he likely to try?  Just what percentage of the business do you own?  And what are you to do to earn that share?  And...     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> You ask Tabra \"Who this Gilles?\"<br>\r\n   \"He's the current crimelord in this area.\" Tabra answers.  \"A business like this is nearly always paying off somebody, actually several somebodies.  And having this thug come around and demand money if we want to stay in business is par for the course.  But Gilles is being greedy, and won't listen to reason.<br>\r\n    \"I'm not sure of the details.  I just want these people to leave me alone to run my business.  But from what I hear, Gilles convinced some of the more powerful thugs in his gang that merchants like me could be squeezed for a lot more gold.  That's crazy.  I can't pay what he demands and stay in business, and I doubt most of the others can either.  But he managed to convince those other jerks, and so the lout who had been leading them -never thought I'd say I wish he was back- had an accident.  The talk is that there were seven witnesses that say it was an accident, and seven knife holes in his back.  I wasn't alone in ordering seven rounds of drinks for the house in celebration, until I found out about Gilles.<br>\r\n    \"I can't say, but talk is that some of the others don't like Gilles much, and if he can't come thru with the gold he promised, he's going to have his own accident.  Can't be too soon for me.  But right now he is really pushing for that gold, really hard, and he just won't believe I can't pay.  He's talking about how he can get the others to buckle if he breaks me.  I'd laugh at him if I wasn't going to be broke or dead before he finds out how wrong he is.<br>\r\n    \"So you are going to be earning your share of the business.  I don't know what he is going to try, but killing you has got to be high on his to do list.  He can't let you beat up three of his boys and let you walk the streets.  You stay in town and he is coming after you.  <br>\r\n    \"I'll give you a description of Gilles -he's a big fellow, tho hardly in your range- and those of his boys, tho I don't know most of them, at least not well enough that you should let random strangers get behind you.<br>\r\n   \"Gilles is going to do something to this place too.  Just what I can only guess and worry about.  You are going to have to be ready to stop it, whatever it is.  Ainia will help you there.\"<br>\r\n    \"Ainia?\" you ask.<br>\r\n    \"Here.\" you hear behind you.  Turning, you see a tallish severe lass, dressed up like an amazon. [Well, an amazon with maybe about half as much armor as you would expect, but the sword is a decent one at least.]  \"I do a fair amount of the guard duty around here.  We had a man too, but the coward took off when those three showed up.<br>\r\n    \"We can expect the city guard to watch part of the time,\" Tabra continues, \"at least I will be paying them to.  But at least one of you two had better be awake and ready at all times.\"<br>\r\n    \"I can help too.\"  Turning again, your face ends up in a delightful set of breasts, with a redhead smiling down at you at her success in sneaking up behind you and standing on a chair to get the needed height.  \"I'm Evaine.  I'm pretty talented at roguish tricks.\"<br>\r\n    \"If you were really talented, you would not be here.\" Tabra reproves.  <br>\r\n    \"Well, it looked like an easy mark.  And it would have been too if the others had done their part.  But when things went South, I just got stuck holding the bag.\"  Turning to you, Evaine continues, \"Jerks wouldn't pay to break me out of jail, so I ended up being sold here, with the threat of losing a hand if I tried to escape.  It's not so bad really, and I'm not going to let these louts push us around.\"<br>\r\n     \"Well, we have other matters to consider...\" Tabra announces.  </span></div></div>",

You are to make yourself visible, and friendly, while looking dangerous.\"<br>\r\n   \"Sound confusing.\"<br>\r\n   \"Well, it shouldn't be too bad.\" Tabra answers.  \"As big as you are, just holding that big sword should take care of the threat department.  But you have to remember that these are paying customers, and we defer to them as much as possible.  At the same time, some of them will demand more than the girls want to give, and you have to keep the girls safe, preferably without making the John unhappy.<br>\r\n    \"Now you have to watch out for Gilles.  I don't think he is going to try anything tonight, but we can't count on that.  So keep your eyes open and look for ways he might try something.\"<br>\r\n    Tabra likely has more to say, but now the girls start to enter the room.  She pauses to inspect each lass, an inspection that seems distinctly personal to you.  Of course, she does have to make sure the merchandise is in good shape, but even so...  However, you are certainly not going to object since you also get a fine view, and if Tabra's hands seem to caress rather than inspect, you are happy with that.<br>\r\n    However, now a man is approaching the door, and the girls rush to make him welcome.  Looking behind him, you are surprised to realize the day is over and it's dark outside.  It shouldn't be a surprise.  You have been working for some time, and prostitutes are called ladies of the evening for a reason.  Still, you had not noticed the time going by.  [Spending the time surrounded by underclad lovelies likely has something to do with that.]<br>\r\n    The fellow takes his time about making his choice, naturally since he is being mobbed by about a dozen lasses.  But he eventually makes a selection, Barbara, and the two head up the stairs.  He is not up there long, and returns looking happier, and presumably poorer.  But by the time he does, other men are arriving.  <br>\r\n    For such a desirable location, the evening rapidly becomes surprisingly dull.  Of course, now you are a worker instead of a patron.  Later the girls may be fun for you, but right now they have to concentrate on the Johns, not you.  And you have to concentrate on possible problems, which are not happening.  [Well, technically a John does get a little loud, but when you approach and ask what the problem is, he wheels and looks you in the ...chest, and quiets right down.  He still has a complaint, but it is one that Tabra has to deal with.]<br>\r\n    A visit by some members of the city guard at least provides a little variety, but they prove just as routine.  \"We pay off the city guard as well as others.\" Tabra explains.  \"The good news is that they are generally satisfied with sex.  The bad news is that they are lousy tippers.\"<br>\r\n   \"Tip?\"<br>\r\n   \"Of course.\" Tabra answers.  \"A good John adds a bonus for the girl.  And if she really works the Johns for tips, she can buy her freedom in maybe two years.\"<br>\r\n    \"But how slave buy self?  You own.\" you protest.  \"Her gold your gold.\"<br>\r\n    \"Not if I want them to work hard.\" Tabra corrects.  \"If I just don't ask where the gold came from, I get a hard worker, and a lot of gold.  So my girls are mostly saving up to buy their freedom.<br>\r\n     \"And these guardsmen will not pay me or my girls.  But we need to stay on their good side.  And at least they are not too greedy.<br>\r\n      \"Well, it's been a quiet, but reasonable night so far.  Now we can just hope Gilles won't try anything, at least not yet.\"    <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Prostitutes are called ladies of the evening for good reason, but there is a limit on how late they work.  Light provided by fire is expensive, and so nearly everybody wakes at first light, which means not staying up late.  There are some exceptions of course, but business at the brothel trails off well before the witching hour.  The brothel is closed long before the 1st bell of the hour rings, much less the last, only marginally because of fear of that evil hour.  Financially, it is just not worth the small amount of business.<br>\r\n    But while the girls can now go to sleep, some of them alone, you can't.  You are going to have to stand guard duty, at least until Gilles is dealt with.  You would bet that Gilles will not try anything tonight.  It sounds much better to you to scout you out first.  Maybe see if a little bribe will cause you to switch sides or go away.  Sounds much smarter than just his just barging into a situation he doesn't understand.<br>\r\n    Of course, barging in was just what you did, and maybe Gilles does think like you do.  That means you can't take a chance and take a nap.  You have got to be ready just in case he does try something tonight.  <br>\r\n    Locks on all the doors and all windows shut and barred.  Of course, Gilles has to have some talented fellows to get by them, but even talented fellows make noise at times.  It's worth the effort.<br>\r\n    Now a tour of the grounds.  The first of many.  You need to know all the ways attackers might come.  You are also looking at how to eliminate hiding places and approaches.  Again you don't expect to do as well as the foes can, but you can at least make their job harder.<br>\r\n    Will he try to burn the place down?  It seems unlikely.  He won't get any gold from a business that no longer exists.  Still, if he can scare all the other businesses...  But it is not something he is apt to try before he has exhausted all means to get the gold.  Well, you might as well look around while you can.<br>\r\n    Of course, you can look better tomorrow when there is light, but the attackers will have to come in the dark and what you see is what they will see.  Definitely useful information for you to have.<br>\r\n    You are edgy of course.  You aren't too worried about monsters like undead striking in the night, but that does not mean you are not worried.  This is deemed the most dangerous hour for good reason.  Even if the danger is not that high, it is not absent.  So you find yourself looking over your shoulder at times.  <br>\r\n    But the time passes without incident, as normally happens on guard duty. After a couple of hours, you wake Ainia and allow her to be the guard while you sleep.  You of course keep weapons and what armor you can put on quickly right besides your sleeping form.  You remind yourself that the two of you have to shift your hours around in a random manner so any thugs will not be sure who is on guard.<br>\r\n    All too soon, Ainia is waking you again to return to watch.  And you return to boredom.  However, it is not so complete boredom.  Already the city is stirring, even if only barely.  But some unlucky souls are stuck with jobs that must be done before business can really start, which means very early in the dark, and so the streets are no longer entirely empty.  Of course one night soil collector and his cart hardly makes a traffic jam.  Still, you are no longer the only thing awake.<br>\r\n    Eventually, it is time to wake Ainia again, and to make ready for battle at an instant's notice, a battle you don't expect to happen, but still have to be ready for.<br>\r\n    But as you thought, nothing happens expect the normal daily activities and so you can sleep in before starting a day you doubt will be entirely dull.  For one thing you want to \"interview\" the girls.  For another, you expect some action by Gilles today, tho you are unsure just what.</span></div></div>",

A brunette nearby is struggling with a large basket of laundry.  When she puts it down, two tempting hips seem to rise and attract your attention.  Of course a hand of yours quickly finds a great place to rest.<br>\r\n    The lass reacts quickly, and not favorably, until she sees you, and smiles. You think you remember her from yesterday as being very friendly.  What was her name?  B?...something?<br>\r\n    \"Hi\" the girl grins.  She turns her underclad self towards you, \"I didn't get a chance to properly thank you last night, but I do want to do that as soon as I can... do it properly...\" She rubs up against you.  \"Of course, right now I have to deal with this heavy load...\"<br>\r\n    This is an obvious invitation for you to show off your muscles, and you soon have laundry under one arm and girl under the other.  The laundry is soon delivered to the proper room, and the girl to your room.<br>\r\n    The lass slips out from your arm and urges \"you must be tired from all that heavy work.  Why don't you lie down?\"  Her removal of her limited clothing encourages your speedy obedience.  <br>\r\n    The girl climbs atop of you and straddles your body.  As she gently picks at your clothing, she starts talking, \"I'm Barbara in case you missed that. My parents were the poorest of the poor, and they had seven daughters who needed dowries they could not get. So I volunteered to be sold here, and now all my sisters are, or will be, honorably married because of my sacrifice. Which really isn't much of one. I am very good at making men happy, and quite enjoy my work.\" Her snuggling up against you seems to confirm that. <br>\r\n    Your soldier is standing at full attention, and now Barbara lifts herself onto the tip of your staff, and carefully positions herself.  Then she is sliding down your tool, to your considerable enjoyment.  She leans forward, her breasts pushed invitingly in your direction.  It is an invitation you quickly accept, cupping a massive mound with each hand.<br>\r\n    As you caress her beauties, Barbara begins to move her hips, slipping up and down your piece, with both of you feeling the excitement building.  Finally you can stand it no more and explode into her.  She does not stop, but continues her effort to bring joy to both of you.  Her own emotions are running far out of control and she is building up to a tremendous explosion, which ends with her seized by a rush of sensation so intense she collapses onto you, completely burned out. But even as she does, you shoot off again, leaving you feeling in a great mood about this lovely piece sprawled over you.  You do not try to get out from under.<br>\r\n    Instead you lie there until you hear Tabra yelling \"Barbara!  Where are you?  Get out here and do your chores!\"  Barbara wakes with a start and dives for her clothing.  \"Sorry, I must go.\" she apologizes, \"but if you don't feel I have thanked you enough...\"  But another yell from Tabra keeps her from completing the statement and she vanishes out the door at a run.<br>\r\n     You are a little slower in getting up again, but you want to get to work.  If you read the situation right, this thug will try to bribe/scare you today.  So you want to be in a position where he can try that.  Since you are getting a piece of the profits here, not to mention a piece of a dozen girls like Barbara, there is no chance he can offer enough, but the more you learn about your enemy, the better.  So you learn the location of the most likely inn and are soon ready to go.<br>\r\n    Of course, you are in no real rush, so maybe you can check to see if any of the other girls are properly grateful for their rescue... Or maybe... </span></div></div>",

Now a lass who will be there in the morning for as long as you want is quite another thing.  [And best to keep up the dumb act.  If they have to explain to the stupid barbarian, they can't cheat him.]<br>\r\n    \"That's right.  Take whichever one will make you happy, and you will make happy.  You have saved my life, but I may not be able to stay in business.  If so, I will have to sell my girls, and whoever you take, I think you will be better for her than whoever might buy her.  <br>\r\n   \"Like to look them over?  With the mess those...gentlemen... made, we will not be open for business and they will be able to explain the advantages of owning them to you.\"<br>\r\n   \"Sound good.  Start with blond?\"  <br>\r\n   The blond is dress in an amazon outfit, or rather maybe half of one.  She's tallish, if hardly in your league, and slender, tho definitely not skinny.  She carries a real sword rather than some toy.  She had been standing in front of the other girls trying to defend them when you barged in.  [You don't think she really had much chance, but she had been trying.]  As you inspect her, she stands almost at attention, and announces \"I'm Ainia. I was born in Amazon territory and was on the losing side of a battle.  I was eventually sold here.  I serve as bouncer here when I am not serving the johns.\"<br>\r\n   Her serious manner is a contrast to the next lass, who cheerfully jumps into your lap and cuddles up against you. \"I'm  Barbara. My parents were the poorest of the poor, and they had seven daughters who needed dowries they could not get.  So I volunteered to be sold here, and now all my sisters are, or will be, honorably married because of my sacrifice.  Which really isn't much of one.  I am very good at making men happy, and quite enjoy my work.\"  Her snuggling up against you seems to confirm that.  <br>\r\n    The third lass is the cleric who healed you.  She's a dark brunette, but she is wearing a lot of makeup to look light, and her hair is dyed to appear blond. What little she is wearing is pure white.  She bows to you respectfully.  \"I am Peace, a cleric of Sune, which should tell you my work here is not shameful.  If not, I will be happy to tell you the teachings of Sune.  <br>\r\n    \"Despite Sune not approving of slavery, I became one when I loudly and vigorously backed an idea I thought would benefit the church.  I vowed I would do whatever I could to guarantee we did not lose a copper.  Sadly the idea lost a good deal of gold, and I was held to my promise, and eventually ended up here as a slave.  Besides my regular duties, I make sure the girls and the Johns stay healthy.\"<br>\r\n    The other girls advance and introduce themselves, tho they somewhat blur together.  You start considering their merits.  You could use somebody to guard your flank as well as warm your bed.  Ainia would be quite useful.  But so would Peace.  Barbarians like you get hurt a lot, and having Peace to cure you would be very nice too.<br>\r\n    Barbara might not be so useful, but she would definitely make your life worth living, very much so.  Even if you starved to death with her, you would die with a smile on your face.  And each of the other girls have their own virtues.  Which to choose?  <br>\r\n    Well, at least the girls are grateful for their rescue, and happy to let you have a full investigation of the merchandise.</span></div></div>",

You need to go to the Fell Doom Tavern in Greyhawk City and ask for Thumb-on-Scales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Finter. I'm a marsh-jigger, I get shrimp and other things out of the marsh. I told you this yesterday, and the day before.

They remember the feel of the leather, the jingle of the layers of segmenta lorica, the rhythm of the long march that conserves energy while eating up distance. Finter let you off at the shore nearest this shabby road, and you've walked since. Your friends--three of them: some kind of magic user, a barbarian, a little fellow--halfling or gnome, Finter didn't know which--left some coin to pay Finter. He gave it back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't steal,\" he said. \"You came with it, and you leave with it. I only did what was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he waved from his skiff, his lanky body almost gold in the dawn sunshine and any parting words swallowed by the noise of the marsh. And you're on the road to Greyhawk City. The road has grown during the day, gathered gravel and stones, lost some of the weeds that had never been stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's almost dark. You've had nothing to eat today but some shrimp jerky and rice and weeds rolled in a leaf. Ahead of you are some lights: one is a roadside inn; the other is a house, and a rude stable outside it.</span></div></div>",

The door opens--a young woman, who might be pretty, might not; it's hard to tell under the bruises and cuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings,\" she says, in a voice clogged with--what? fear? tears? desperation?

Nothing elf-made. \"You have no money for the inn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would rather not see too many people right now.\" People are confusing: they know who they are, and he does not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, probably thinking he is a fugitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can spare you some water, and a bit of elf-loaf, spiced with merrin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do chores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she says quickly. \"It would be obvious that I didn't.

Wait there until after dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom across the road come the scents of smoke and wood and roasting meat, and the sounds of laughter and song. He does not know the words, but he knows the tune as he huddles unmoving in the shadows of the manger. If he doesn't move, his buckles and scale don't jingle, and he is suddenly cold, grateful for the warmth his padding gives. Night settles its aged bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely hears her padding across the grass, but he stands when she arrives. She thrusts a bit of bread and a wooden bowl of water into his hands. \"You can use the privy at midnight, when all are asleep,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she is gone with a sound like an oaken staff hitting flesh, and she tumbles to the ground.

He pauses at the edge of your table and asks, \"You are aware of the mysterious stranger who shows up to offer you ways to glory and riches?\"<br>\r\n     \"That's just a cliche!\" Perd objects, \"A bad one too.\"<br>\r\n     \"Cliches become so because they are true and common.\", the figure briefly looks at Perd before returning his? gaze? to you.  [The light in here is poor, but really, you ought to be able to see more detail than you are.]  \"...as you would know from your past.  I am such a figure, and I can, with luck, lead you to fame and fortune.\"<br>\r\n     \"You know of my past?\", you ask, more interested in recovering your memories than in the wild ravings of riches.  [Somehow you 'remember' there have been several past cases where the fame was fleeting at most, and the fortune vanished just as fast.]<br>\r\n     \"Sadly, no.\" admits the figure as he sits down, \"I only know what you are, not what you were.\"<br>\r\n     \"And what is that?\" you continue.<br>\r\n     \"You are a toy of Chance in its game with Fate.\" he starts to lecture, \"While the life of most of those present will follow a path set by Fate, you have the power to change that, or not change it.  In a way that even the wise can only begin to understand, you have been freed of whatever doom was upon you, and you are now a wild card, able to change the game, perhaps in great degree.\"<br>\r\n     \"I am just a fighter.\" you protest, \"I may be pretty good, but there are better, and I am nobody special.  How am I supposed to change the world?\"<br>\r\n    \"That, I can only guess at.\" the mysterious one admits, \"When Chance takes a hand, all is uncertain.  Perhaps you will found a great empire.  Perhaps you will merely kill the one who was going to found that empire.  Perhaps your freed actions will merely get you killed, and you will never found that empire.  I just do not know, and there is no way to know, even if we were of the gods.<br>\r\n    \"What I do know,\" he continues, \"...is that a decision or decisions you will be making, perhaps very soon, will have a massive influence, even if nobody, yourself included, deems it of any importance and all forget it ever happened.<br>\r\n    \"And I know that Fortune favors the brave.\" he adds in a more heated voice, \"I can assure you of nothing, but if you follow my guidance and take the bold path, the possibilities are endless.\"<br>\r\n     \"Sounds great!\" Perd enthuses, \"Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n    \"Has this crazy old man been bothering you?\" the barmaid asks as she refills your horn.  Now that you think about it, this is not the first refill either.  Possibly this is why you decide that 'burly' is not the proper description for her.  That figure may have heft to it, but it is still a fine figure, and you have always preferred lasses you didn't have to worry would break in half when you gave them a good squeeze.  [You have?  Is this your memory starting to come back?  Well, it seems right anyway.]<br>\r\n    \"Hmm... So you are saying that if I am bold with this lovely lass here, I may father the next emperor?\" you 'ask' the old? man, \"It seems a most desirable task.\"<br>\r\n    \"You try that, and I'll box your ears!\", the lass retorts.  \"I'm no man's idle plaything to be discarded after a night.\"<br>\r\n   Actually, she probably is, at least for the right price, and as little coin as you have, you know it is enough to pay for several barmaids.  Of course, you will likely have to approach her in the right way.  Slap the gold on the table and she is apt to get all huffy and refuse, or demand double.  But if you say the right words, and merely hint about your excess coin... Well, your bed may be delightfully crowded tonight.<br>\r\n    \"That is not what I mean at all!\", your would-be adviser crossly disputes, \"Granted, it could happen, but the odds are...\"<br>\r\n   But you are no longer listening.  The charms of the lass are much more enticing.  Of course, it is a long trip to Greyhawk and you may need your coin.  So maybe it is foolish to be spending it on the first woman you see.  Still...</span></div></div>",

You learned asceticism, martial arts and the wisdom of the written word. You know vaguest basics about planes of existence. At least you know that certain portals can transport anybody into another world. That and the secret magic of your monastic order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some hate you for your race, or your artful way of evading extra-duties, you are actually a pretty well-trained disciple of the order. Your competences having been tested through the years. Be it field-working, brewing, scripture and copying, religious chant, unarmed combat or crafting and wielding your magical quarterstaff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know every routine sound in the monastery. You recognize most smells and even blindfolded you would find your ways within these walls. Many black eyes and blueish to purple blotches were the price, yet after just eight years of practice you had earned the rank of a disciple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was a day like many others. A clear weather had encouraged work outside the monastery for many monks and nuns. The physical labor was not simply hard and strenuous, actually it was a welcome form of workout for shaping your body into a martial artist ideal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had joined the afternoon exercises, the evening prayer and the occult teachings later. Finally you had entered the tiny room where you laid yourself to rest. But you arose with a disturbance felt and sensed, a violation of the spiritual equilibrium which you knew as normalcy within the monastery walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of bloodshed was in the air, the sounds of skirmishes all around you.

Greyhawk has many, many inns.  You usually hang out in the Thives' Quarter, the lower part of Greyhawk.  <br>\r\n   Greyhawk is divided into three quarters; The Thives' Quarter, Clerksburg, and the High and Garden Quarter.  The High and Garden Quarters is home to the Lord Mayor or Greyhawk, Nerrof.  You know that Nerrof is the leader of a thives' guild.  Actually, everybody in Greyhawk (mostly) knows that Nerrof runs one of the four thiefing guilds in Greyhawk.   There are four thiefing guilds in Greyhawk, but two are more powerful than the other two.   Nerrof does a good job running the city.  20 or so years ago, there was a war between the two most powerful thieving guilds in Greyhawk.  The war was basically a gang war, which destoryed a section of the Thives' Quarter now known as \"The Burn\" <br>\r\n     Gasper is the leader of the other more powerful thieving guild.  He is also known as the Godfather of the Thives' Quarter.  The war was between Nerrof and Gasper.  Gasper lost the war, and argeed to stay out of the High Quarter of Greyhawk, while Nerrof argeed to stay out of the Thives' Quarter.  <br>\r\n       You live in Clerksburg.  Clerksburg is in the middle of Greyhawk, and is home to several schools; The Magic School, the Bard School just to name a few.  You live quite near the Bard school (which makes sense, since you're a bard). <br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

Greyhawke is a sprawling city, ruled by thieves and terrorized by roaming marauders from across the lands; civilian-types make a pittance farming the outskirts, or crafting and selling their wares in city squares peppering each quarter, but much of the profits are claimed by the guilds, leaving the general populace near-squalor.  Greyhawke probably wouldn't have developed into the urban populace of today but for the security offered by its massive outer walls and battlements, as well as a fine naval fleet which patrols and defends the harbor.  Peasants who tire of the greedy looting and pillaging of their hard-earned wares and profits quickly come scampering back under the protective blanket of the Guilds whenever ogres enclaves or goblin hoardes make way from the foothills and sweep a swath of terror across the plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour job at the Black Dragon Inn is to keep the minds of the travelling merchants off their troubles with epic odes of bountiful harvest, to inspire the local troops with songs of bravery and hard-fought battles, and to act as the eyes and ears of the Guilds around folks who do not place trust or faith in the guild ways of rule.  Your calm and pleasant demeanor, soft but well-spoken words, and fanciful instrumentals and singing voice have served you well, and garnered much respect, praise, and a tidy profit from the meager and haggard patrons of the Black Dragon. And your connection to the Guilds helps insure that your cut of profit stays well within reason, compared to Outsiders and local-though-unaffiliated traders and craftsmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a hard life, always being polite and positive, spreading cheer and hope where there is little of either.

Another long day was coming to a close, which meant thay yours is just begining.  You sit in the corner, tuning your small harp, eyeing the flow of patrons as they enter one by one, or in small groups.  They make their way to the tables set within the room, and even take it upon themselves to do a little rearranging of the place to better accomodate their fellow mates, and to settle in for an evening of drinking, entertainment, and eventually (innevittably) a fight or two.  You begin to make your plan, and pick out your choices of tables you will feather your way towards as you pluck and sing.  You begin to think of tales and song that will entertain each group by their appearance.  Of course, there are the dark corners of the room that signal you to just keep your distance of, as those patrons are here for reasons other than to be entertained by song and dance.  You reach down, and give one final check to your daggar clasped to your calf, your only reasurance that by chance you are a target, you may even the score.  Just as you raise your head, your eyes fix on her.  Already, she's taken on an audience as a few patrons have turned their heads to see this beautiful elven woman.  She has taken her place right up at the bar.  She's not dressed as the other wenches of the evening, nor takes on their brash behaviors.  She is lightly sipping from an exotic glass with a stem.  Something she obvioiusly has brought with her, for the only thing one would drink from is his horn, or the Inn's supplied standard stein.  She wears a thin smile as she nods to a table of gawking men behind her.  She does her best to look away, and not to cause any trouble.  She has a very quiet demeanor, yet her beauty draws an abundance of attention in a place like this.  She wears layers of blue and white flowing gowns and a simple silver chain around her neck.  It is all you need to know to redirect your intentions on making your way to her as quickly as possible. <br>\r\nYou strike the first note of the evening and let it resonate, as heads quickly turn in your direction.  With your most shrilfull voice, you sing out above the crowd.  In an almost alarming way, this quiets the room, You have the crowds fullest attention.  You stand and lean in to a nearby table of soldiers; regulars.<br>\r\n  \"... for those who are armed beyond those who dare...\"<br>\r\n You swing to the next table of masonry workers, \"... to those who muscle rock in ways I can't compare... I raise my glass high, high to with all of you whom I share!\"  You snatch up a almost empty, unclaimed mug of brew from yet another table and raise it above my head as you strike a very loud, very high pitched chord on your instrument. As the note finishes you slug down what was left behind in the mug (in your proffession, you take all you can get.) The warm brew flows into your belly, and you now make your way through the crowd, dancing in sync with the melody you play. You give a nod here and there at the patrons, but your aim is to be planted on the stool next to the beautiful damsel at the bar.  Your song continues, as you jimmy lyrics in the way that you do.  They match those around around you, and you are praised with their smiles, laughter, and lifting of mugs.  You have now reached your destination, and turn to face the entire crowd with a wink, your voice goes low, and everyone seems to be in on your unnexpected greeting to this gem.  <br>\r\n\"... and with that my sweet lady, can I buy you a drink?\" your bottom makes perfect contact with the empty stool next to the elven woman, and you lean back and make eye contact with her.  The crowd is silent, and your last note falls as well. There's almost a frozen moment in time before she smiles and says with almost a whisper,\"Yes, you may.\"  <br>\r\nThe room is filled with cheers and applause.  It looks as though you may have yourself a very lucky night after all.</span></div></div>",

I think I don't need to, but just realizing I am not breathing is making my lungs hurt.<br>\r\n    The mage advances to me and removes his spellbook from my grip.  I wonder how he manages to when I am holding it so hard and can't move to let go, a rather odd subject to worry about when my near future may involved rape, torture, and/or death...  Or maybe it is a much better subject to worry about than my future...<br>\r\n    \"Now I have a little business proposition for you.\" the wizard announces [Wasn't he several inches taller a moment ago?],  \"... It's even honest work... by some definitions anyway.  I'll explain it to you in a moment.  Don't say no before I finish the explanation.\"  He seems to think his joke very funny. Not an opinion I share of course, but if laughing at it will get me out of here...  \"Now I need a few things... Don't go away until I come back.\"  OK, maybe there are jokes I can't laugh at even if my life depends on it...<br>\r\n   He leaves for long enough for me to do some serious worrying, worry that contains a bit of hope of course.  His talk suggests I will see the morning light, something I was not sure of a moment ago.  But if I have to do some favor for him?  All sorts of ways that can turn out badly for me.  And he may well be offering to pay me by not killing me.  Not that I am going to turn an offer like that down, but...<br>\r\n    But now he is back, his hands full of a mess of objects which he lays down with a clatter.  \"To start with, I have this little gift for you, which I am sure you will love.  In fact I am sure you won't be parted from it.\"  He somehow is placing a ring on my finger despite my fingers being clenched.  No way to know what that ring does, but I'm betting I can't take it off, and that he can find me any time he wants to, which means that taking whatever suicide job he is about to suggest, and then just running away, is likely suicidal too.<br>\r\n   I watch the window I came in thru close itself and lock.  I can only barely see it, but the door locks itself too.  The mage [who seems about 50 pounds heavier] takes a seat behind a desk [which you don't think was there a moment ago] \"Please make yourself comfortable, my lady.\", pointing to a chair [that definitely was not there a second ago.]<br>\r\n    Suddenly I can move again, and somehow do not fall over, or even have trouble maintaining my balance.  There being no useful alternative, I sit down as suggested.  I find myself looking at the mage [who now has a beard.]  \"So what do you want me to do?\" I ask as I pull at the ring, and confirm it is not easily removed at least.<br>\r\n    \"Directness has its virtues,\" the wizard smiles in a way I can't determine the meaning of, and am not sure I want to, \"...but I prefer to have us learn more about each other first.  After all, we may be working together for a long time... Life long perhaps in your case.\"  If he has many more jokes like this, your life definitely is going to seem long at least.  \"...Or maybe longer...\"  That is not the most encouraging statement I have ever heard.<br>\r\n    \"So would you like to learn more about me?  Or would you prefer to tell me about yourself?\" <br>\r\n    Neither choice sounds appealing, but what else?  Maybe...    </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately as these kind fellows were relaxing in my inn, they ran accross a rowdy bunch of barbarians... barbarians seeking me by name.  I can't tell you why just now, but they have been looking for me for quite some time.  The barbarians burned down my inn, to send a message.  They want something I have, something far more precious than I could ever dream.  Once these gentlemen left the tavern they sought me out themselves, and found Ishbella, your closest friend outside the tavern.  These men told her that these barbarians were looking for me.  But that they wanted to protect people like me from further harm.  They are noble folk from my home region.  As you can see they are all half-elfs themselves.

You are tempted to give him the rough side of your tongue for that, but even if your adventuring experience is not as varied as your husband's, you know everyone will be stuck with some chore, and the cooking is by no means the one you are most eager to avoid.  So...<br>\r\n    \"For some years my husband's inn did not prosper enough for us to be able to hire a cook.  So I have had long years of cooking lots of food.  Given the inn's trade has grown, I'd say I'm more than passable.<br>\r\n    \"As to your next question, yes, we had best eat before we go.  It will save a little trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It also gives you a little time to notify the neighbors you will be gone and they should watch the house [and loot any perishable goods, but since you are not going to be around to use them, they might as well.  It's at least possible the favor will be returned some day.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The meal itself could go better.  The food is fine, but the conversation is a tad nosy.  Brutan asks \"We half-elves are not particular about race, but this is the first case I have heard of that a gnome has married one of us.  How did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That's an interesting tale I may tell you if the journey is long and dull enough.\"  The look you shoot at your husband reminds him he is not to tell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Shivel doesn't seem to notice your unwillingness to answer personal questions by strangers.  \"I would imagine children would be quite a problem.  How would you get around that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well now, perhaps I should ask this wizard we are going to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Now that you think of it, maybe you should.  71 is not even middle aged for a gnome, but you know of gnomes lasses who were mothers at half your age.  That might have been almost cradle snatching, but even so.  If you are going to have kids, it's high time you got to it.  Your whitish hair may be premature, but it's a sign the decision had best not be put off much longer.<br>\r\n    But with a half-elf husband... Well, at least he is not as big as a human, but birthing a gnome babe will be agony enough.  A baby twice as big... that seems sure to kill you.<br>\r\n    The churches might be a better place to ask actually, but they talk about this being a major favor to grant somebody they see maybe once a year, and neither you nor  Kadence have found any particular god appealing enough to center your worship on.  Yes, a wizard handling the problem might be much more convenient...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, we'd best be to it.\"  Gordesh announces.  \"The main road's longer, but safer.  You want to try it?

Because of your nature, you can work your spells even when wearing your supple black leather armor. You carry a shoulder bag which is magical in nature. It allows you to carry almost anything in it, up to a weight of 100 lbs. Anything heavier will cause the bag to rip open, spilling the contents into another dimension. Anything sharp will cause the same effects. You stand 5'5\" tall and weigh only 98 pounds. You wear a long-sleeved blouse to hide the throwing daggers strapped to your wrists. You carry two more in your boots, strapped to your thighs and one down the back of your neck. A regular fighting dagger you carry sheathed on your left hip. Your short sword, crossbow (with the bolts safely in a quiver) armor, two full sets of replacement daggers in sheathes, fifty feet of elven rope with a folding grappling hook, black leather pants and your thieving tools are all in your pouch. You wear a supple black skirt which covers your shapely legs to the knees, hiding the daggers strapped to your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can cast the following spells: <i>Magic Missiles</i> - This spell allows you to shoot up to five \"missiles\" at any target(s) you choose. The missiles never miss as long as you can see your target. They cannot pass through a \"shield\" spell. Usually, it only takes one missile to kill an average person, ie. wash woman, baker, etc. Someone with a higher constitution or partly immune to the effects of magic would take more, ie. a warrior, dwarf, etc.  <i>Shield</i> - This spell will protect you from the Magic Missile spell (one casting) or from up to 3 attacks from normal missiles such as arrows or spears or two attacks from hand held weapons like swords, etc. <i>Jump</i> - This spell allows you to jump up to 10 feet straight up or forward. <i>Spider Climb</i> - This spell allows you to climb any surface unless it is covered with something slippery like oil. It lasts for thirty minutes unless ended sooner. <i>Sleep</i> - This spell will put up to four humans or the equivalent number of animals or demihumans, ie. halflings, gnomes, etc. to sleep for up to four hours. <i>Feather Fall</i> - This spell allows you to fall as gently as a feather. However, a strong wind can blow you about when using this spell. And, last but not least, <i>Continual Light</i> This spell allows you to make any object glow like a torch, casting light up to 30 feet in all directions. A dispel magic will negate the effects of this spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you can pick pockets with the best of them, your favorite way of working is to take a man up to his room and cast one of your sleep spells on him. Once he's asleep, you can simply empty his money pouch. You're also very good at picking locks, climbing walls (free style) and have great dexterity. In combat, you try not to fight head on. You prefer to sneak around behind your foes and stab them from behind. After all, this is the way of the thief!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick this character or...</span></div></div>",

Artemis is the goddess of nature and forests, so you don't live in a city...usually.  You've been to Greyhawk City three times so far.  <br>\r\n   You live in Greenstone Abbey, which is close to the small village of Thurmaster.  Greyhawk City is two weeks away (by river).  Greenstone Abbey has been around for a very long time.  It is called  Greenstone Abbey because the land around the abbey has lots of Emeralds in it, hench the name.  <br>\r\n       You are also the Lord Abbot of Greenstone Abbey.  You own the lands around the abbey.  The nearest city, Spireton, is 80 miles away.   Thurmaster is even furter.   <br>\r\n    Spireton is the name of the village that's recently grown up around Broken Spire Keep.  The village is populated mostly by Halflings and Gnomes.  Broken Spire Keep is a castle that was built around a volcano.  The volcano has been long since dead.   The castle used to have a spire on the very top, but that was broken a long time ago.  The spire (which serves as the wall surrounding Spireton) lays on the east side of the village.  A wall surrounds the village, for Broken Spire Keep is in the middle of a forest called the Thornwood.  The Thornwood is populated by animals, and a few orcs.  There is also a wandering druid that lives within Thornwood.   You've seen the druid once or twice.  She is a highly attractive half-elf woman.  <br>\r\n            Broken Spire Keep has no king or queen.  It is the property of a Paladin named Link Kastal.  The Halflings and Gnomes were attracted to Link and begin to settle around the castle.  Link is one of your friends that you go out adventuring with sometimes.   Spireton has a small inn called The Spire Inn.   A few human familes are coming to Spireton nowadays.<br>\r\n       <br>\r\n    What is your starting point?  </span></div></div>",

His style of magic is well-rounded. He possesses all three types of magical spells in near equal quantities, e.g. offensive, defensive and informational types of magic. He hires himself out to adventurers needing mages for an equal share of any treasure and first choice of any treasure of a magical nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias wears elvin chain mail, finely made, but otherwise normal. He wears neutral colored robes over his mail so as to blend into his surroundings as much as possible. He carries an iron-shod, hard-wood staff capped with a silver spike in addition to six regular throwing daggers and two more made of silver. These are tucked away in various places so as not to be obvious to a casual inspection. He wears a ring of free action on his right hand and a ring of water-breathing on his left. He rides a light-weight, battle trained horse and carries an elvin long bow and score of arrows as part of his saddle gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile as brave as the next man (or elf), he will not take point position or stand rear-guard unless the party he is in has taken several causalities in combat. His standard agreement calls for recovery of his body and resurrection should he be killed. In return, he will contribute, from his share of any treasure, to the cost of resurrection of other party members slain during an adventure. This only applies if the rest of the group decides to have the member brought back from the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias can work with any other type of human or non-human class. He does not have a problem working with thieves as long as they do not attempt to work their trade against or on him. He refuses to work with orcs or half-orcs for any reason.

Such notices usually indicated the party had either moved on or had already left and had not returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned back to the board, a crier entered the square. \"Hear ye! Hear ye! The DuMas party, consisting of seven, seeks the services of another priest, a mage, a rouge, cook and horse handler. Anyone so interested may seek them in <i>The Hunter's Call</i> today or tomorrow after the hour of noon and before the hour of dinner. The party will be leaving on the morning of the third day. Anyone following will be considered thieves and punished accordingly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias grinned to himself. Some caravan masters liked to follow adventuring groups out of towns to have help if bandits tried attacking. Since this put the adventurers in the middle for no gain and usually much loss, the groups were usually very unhappy to have a caravan leaving around the time they were. It seemed the leader of this group had perhaps found a way to deter this practice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he still had some time before noon, he went back to the board to obtain more details of other offers.</span></div></div>",

While he could not recall every detail of everything he had ever read or seen, he could remember most of them. It was one of the things which helped make him a valuable member of any group with which he went out. He moved out toward The Lusty Lady. It was an inn near the south gates of the city. It had seen better days, but still was in decent repair with big rooms for large parties. He entered the darkened area, pausing to let his eyes adjust before moving to the desk. \"Are there any members of the Sen party still around?\" he asked. (He pronounced Sen as Sawn.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, there's the man himself just coming down the stairs.\" The clerk raised both head and voice, calling, \"Hey Sen, there's a man here to see you.\" Pelias had turned to see the man, stocky with dark hair and eyes, wearing a traveling cloak and a short sword change direction to head toward the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Pelias said as he flipped a silver penny to the clerk. \"Saw your notice on the board this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notice?\" Sen asked, looking puzzled. \"I haven't posted any notice in at least three months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the notice was dated almost four months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my group has finished the adventure which that notice addressed. We're planning on taking a month off to recover and recuperate before we go back again. We will be looking for additional men. We lost four men out of twenty taken with five more injured badly. In time, they should all recover. Of the four killed, one was a priest; two were rogues and the last was a swordsman. Three of four mages were among the injured along with two more swordsmen. We arrived back in town last night and the injured are already being treated in the temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be posting another notice before you leave again?\" Pelias asked, thinking fast about what had been said as well as what hadn't. Nothing had been said about the dead being revived, so Pelias had a good idea they were still dead. He still hadn't heard anything mentioned about either the treasure or what it had been which had beat up the group so badly. But, anything which could take out a third of such a powerful group was something which needed respected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the notice will go up in about two weeks.\" He'd noticed the shooting guard around Pelias' left arm and the stiffness under of the mail under the robes Pelias wore. \"A good archer can earn an extra half share of treasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep it in mind,\" Pelias answered. What he really desired right now was to speak to the survivors. He bowed to Sen before leaving.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pelias walked slowly back to the square, thinking about what he'd learned. Nothing had been mentioned about where the injured from the party were being treated. From that, he concluded questioning the survivors would be frowned upon. The more he thought about what he still didn't know, the more his gut was telling him to stay clear of this group. Everything might just point to the members of the Sen party being cautious about loosing a source of income, but this was being cautious to the extreme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived back at the square just after the hour of noon and proceeded to walk to The Hunter's Call. A large table sat off to one side of the entrance with four men seated at it. Each of the men had a goblet sitting before them. There were four chairs sitting, one across from each man, on the opposite side of the table. Three of the chairs were occupied. Pelias walked over to the table and stood by the open chair. The man sitting across from this chair looked up at him. \"Have you come to apply for a position with the DuMas Party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please then, be seated. I am Thomas DuMas. What position do you seek to fill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias sat, then answered, \"By profession, I am a mage. As you can see, I am also a Half-Elf. I can shoot a longbow and have some modest ability with a short sword and dagger. While I make no claims to ability, I also eat what I cook and have not died from it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed, \"Splendid! It is good to meet a mage with a sense of humor. While I can make no promises as to additional shares for your extra skills, it is possible that when the treasure is divided afterward, some additional consideration may come your way. If you are selected and should you agree to join us, know that we pledge to do all in our power to keep you alive should you be injured. Alas, we have not the funds nor do we expect to obtain sufficient treasure from this adventure to pay for resurrection should you fall. If you supply us with the necessary information, a full share of the gains will be delivered to your next-of-kin should this happen. Food and basic supplies will be provided. We require you supply your own mount and weapons. As a mage, your earnings will be one and one-quarter shares. This is expected to cover the extra costs of your spell components. Should you feel this is not sufficient, you may argue your case with us if we agree to hire your services. If there is nothing else, please leave your name and where you are staying so we may contact you should we choose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Pelias and I have taken lodging in this Inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. We will contact you no later than the dinner hour tomorrow should we choose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias stood, gave a half bow and replied, \"Thank you for your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour after dinner, there was a knock at Pelias' door. He opened it to see Thomas DuMas and the three other men from earlier standing there. \"Please enter. I would offer wine, but I fear I do not have enough goblets for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother man spoke, \"Do not worry about that. I am Reynold DuMas, the leader of this group. You have already met Thomas. This is James,\" he said, indicating one man, \"and Pieter. We are brothers. I am the oldest. As such, I am responsible for the group and all which happens within it. Yet, I would be a poor leader if I did not take council of my brothers. While I have no problems working with one such as you, there are others already in the group who will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias said, \"As the leader, that would be your problem to resolve. But, if I may ask, is it my being a mage or being a half-Elf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you say, it is my problem. Thomas is quite taken with you and I must admit, I would like to have your services on this outing, but I must determine if you are neutral to this problem or if you would add to the problem. One of the men is a half-orc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" he said as his eyes hardened. \"Then, I will seek employment elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, my friend. I have been debating firing him since we arrived back at the town. While he is a good fighter, he is quarrelsome and causes much trouble. Two Gnome clerics have also applied and between their abilities and your skills, we should be able to offset any loss of ability firing him would bring about. I had to meet you to judge your reaction for myself. Thomas, it seems your eye is as keen as ever. Should you agree to join our group, I offer you a full one and one-half shares of treasure plus a discount of one-fifth the value of any magical items found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias blinked in surprise. A lot of groups had begun getting any magic items appraised and offering them first to those within the group. To be offered the items at a discount of one-fifth was unheard of! It meant he could buy an item worth 100 gold pieces for only 80 gold. \"That deal is for this adventure only. I cannot promise that we will discover any magical items, but it applies for any and all items that we should happen to find on this trip. What say you?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Early the morning of the second day after being hired into the DuMas party, Pelias stood with his horse saddled and waiting near the front doors of The Hunter's Call. The sun was just breaking the darkness of the night when the DuMas brothers strode from the inn. Their mounts were saddled and as soon as they appeared, the hostler brought them around. The two gnomes appeared, riding small, fast looking ponies. Reynold called, \"Mount up. The others of our party will meet us at the western gate.\" The group mounted and they rode to the gate in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias noted Reynold had his arm bandaged. He knew there had been a fight when the oldest of the brothers had fired the half-orc. James had been wounded when the fighter had taken exception to being fired. James had taken a thrown dagger through the shoulder. Fortunately, or perhaps wisely, the brothers had taken the two clerics with them. Thomas had been wounded in his leg by another dagger. Both had been thrown before Reynold had gotten his sword clear of its scabbard. Reynold had waved off Pieter's aid, fighting by himself. He had taken a slash down his forearm and a stab which would have gutted him had he not been wearing his armor. He finally killed the other by slicing through his leg after an exchange of blows instead of backing off as he would normally have done. The half-orc had made a final, desperate lunge, but, off balance, he had left himself open to a killing thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReynold had tossed a gold to the manager of the inn where the other had stayed. \"Bury him. He fought well. And, if I should find he was not properly buried, I will come looking for you next. Word does have a way of getting around.\" Since Thomas and James both seemed well, he guessed they had benefited from the healing touch of the gnomes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A short while before noon, the sounds of a horse being ridden hard came to the group. The Gnomes disappeared into the wagon with the wounded cleric. Pelias and a fighter went into the trees on the right side of the trail while a mage and a fighter went into the trees on the left. \"Half Elf,\" the fighter called, \"I am called Ronald. If we are attacked, I will try to draw their fire. I trust to the archery of you and yours far more than mine. Good luck and good hunting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am called Pelias. Thank you for your trust. I shall not let you down.\" Both men ducked behind a tree and seconds later, a rider on a foam-flecked horse came over a rise behind the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello you riders. I come bearing news. Is Reynold with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Reynold. What is it you wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reynold, it is I, James the younger. You fought your first battle in the Orc wars with my father, James the Elder. May I approach your party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames? By the Gods boy, you were a mere lad back then. What news of your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lives, but with one leg now, thanks to an Ogre's club. I will tell him you have asked after him. He will be pleased to know you remember him yet. As for the news I bring, I am afraid it is bad news.\" The fighter started to move forward, onto the road, but Pelias waved him back. He remained behind his tree, waiting. \"The man Sen has placed a bounty on the heads of all in your party. One hundred gold for each of your men, five hundred for each of your brothers and one thousand for you. I thought you should know. He claims you and yours killed the wounded he brought back from his last campaign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReynold snarled a curse. \"If nothing else would unite others against us, that claim will! What evil will that bastard not sink to? I thank you for your warning. You had best ride on lest someone see you with us and think you part of my group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shifted on his horse and Pelias fired, his arrow shattering the boy's elbow before he could level his crossbow. The bold struck the ground under Reynold's horse even as he screamed in pain. Bent low over his saddle, he charged out of the camp. Before he reached the rise of the hill, three bolts struck him and he fell heavily to the ground. \"Nooo!\" screamed Reynold, \"You didn't have to shoot him! He was unable to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPieter called, \"We did not kill him, Reynold. Those bolts all came from the hill behind us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be ready, Ronald,\" Pelias called, \"They are coming.\"</span></div></div>",

Pelias called out softly, \"Ronald, aim for their horses!\" Saying that, he fired his first shot at one of two unarmored men who had dismounted halfway down the hill. His target fell back, into his mount, which turned, knocking over the second mage. His spell ruined, Pelias turned his next shot toward a man whirling a hammer over his head. His arrow took him high in the chest, but not until after the hammer had been thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squeal of pain from a horse told Pelias Ronald had made his shot. He looked out from behind the tree to see a fighter down under a horse. Pelias shot at the second mage who was back on his feet, his hands moving in a pattern Pelias recognized. His arrow hit as the other finished his spell. Luckily, he fell back, his aiming sent his fireball high into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it was over, Pelias shot the last man out of his saddle as he tried to flee over the hill. He looked around and saw one of their fighters was down, a crossbow bolt through his chest. Thomas was cursing as one of the clerics worked a healing on his left arm. Ronald stepped out from behind his tree ans said, \"Good advi...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others looked on in shock as one of the wounded fighters rose, dropping his crossbow to draw his sword. \"Come on ye craven cowards, I'll slay all of ye if given the chance! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stepped forward, drawing his sword. Within five minutes, it was over. James stepped back, saying, \"A brave, yet foolish man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias and two others had gathered all the usable weapons, items which might or might not be magical in nature and valuables from the fallen.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pelias agreed to join the party. Being already ready, he went to bed early and was up before sunrise. He was at the door of the biggest temple in the town while dawn was still struggling to break night's hold on the day. A small contribution and he found out that no injured persons had been brought to the temple in the last ten-day. He thanked the priest and moved on. By the noon hour, he had checked all the large temples and over 90% of the rest. He bought some fruit and headed off to check the rest. By mid-afternoon, he had checked every temple and shrine in the town and had not learned of any injured person whatsoever. What ever had happened to the injured from the Sen party, it appeared they had now fallen from the face of the world. He went back to the inn, ate a good meal, packed everything except his outfit for the next day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the morning of the second day after being hired into the DuMas party, Pelias stood with his horse saddled and waiting near the front doors of The Hunter's Call. The sun was just breaking the darkness of the night when the DuMas brothers strode from the inn. Their mounts were saddled and as soon as they appeared, the hostler brought them around. The two gnomes appeared, riding small, fast looking ponies. Reynold called, \"Mount up. The others of our party will meet us at the western gate.\" The group mounted and they rode to the gate in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPelias noted Reynold had his arm bandaged. He knew there had been a fight when the oldest of the brothers had fired the half-orc. James had been wounded when the fighter had taken exception to being fired. James had taken a thrown dagger through the shoulder. Fortunately, or perhaps wisely, the brothers had taken the two clerics with them. Thomas had been wounded in his leg by another dagger. Both had been thrown before Reynold had gotten his sword clear of its scabbard. Reynold had waved off Pieter's aid, fighting by himself. He had taken a slash down his forearm and a stab which would have gutted him had he not been wearing his armor. He finally killed the other by slicing through his leg after an exchange of blows instead of backing off as he would normally have done. The half-orc had made a final, desperate lunge, but, off balance, he had left himself open to a killing thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReynold had tossed a gold to the manager of the inn where the other had stayed. \"Bury him. He fought well. And, if I should find he was not properly buried, I will come looking for you next. Word does have a way of getting around.\" Since Thomas and James both seemed well, he guessed they had benefited from the healing touch of the gnomes. He wasn't sure about the wisdom of going out with a wound when it could have been healed quickly. But, he was not the leader of the group, so he said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were waiting by the gate. Once the party was assembled, they rode out. Thomas took the point position with an unnamed man. James and Pieter took up the rearguard and the others fell into a column as they moved along. Pelias rode up to where Reynold rode and asked, \"Is it now permitted to ask where we are going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the wagon is a cleric who wasn't quite as dead as the Sen party believed when they left him behind.

Yesterday, I searched all the temples looking for one of the <i>survivors</i> to question. Since I found none of them, I had already come to the same conclusions. I am merely saddened by the thought of such greed. Ours is a hard enough life without having to worry about the greed of others in ones own party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as they figure out where we are bound, they will attack us, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly, but I believe they will wait until after we have either killed the dragon or been killed by it. That way, whoever wins will be weakened, perhaps dying. And should we prevail, whatever spells are available to us will also be much more limited. So, we should be safe from their attack until then.\" Pelias didn't mention that he personally thought there was more than one red dragon around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One day, very early in the morning, Ollie set out to catch some fish in the nearby river. He had a spot, near a rocky overhang where the fat lazy fish liked to pool in the morning before the sun heated the water there. When he was in luck, he usually managed to catch three or sometimes four of them. And, sometimes, they managed to take all his bait no matter what tricks he tried. Today, he was in luck, catching four big sunfish almost as soon as he threw his line into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ollie was getting ready to head back home, something broke a branch behind him and he froze, tucking himself into a small crevice at the edge of the overhang. Above him, he heard two voices talking in a guttural tone. He had never heard this language before, but hearing it now sent chills down his spine. He stayed put while the voices continued...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Spoken in Orcish and translated into common here,) \"I'm telling you, I heard something over here. It has to be one of those humans from that village we're gonna attack later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're full of it! I think you're just scared and want to go running back home to your momma and this is your way of doin it... OHhh! The big bad humans are gonna get me, Ohhh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back to our story.) For whatever reason, there was much grunting and shouting from above him and suddenly, a heavy body fell over the edge of the outcropping and into the water, slowly staining it red. Ollie looked at the creature who looked back at him. It gave him a grimace-like smile before its eyes closed forever. From above him, Ollie heard something else being shouted down at the other which he couldn't understand. \"You always were a lousy fighter. You should a been a female!\" Then, there were the sounds of something moving off and after a bit, there was silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie looked at the fish hanging from his line in one hand and the body in the water before him. He sighed and set the fish down. Concentrating, he gathered the mystical energy around him and cast his spell. The body lifted out of the water and floated before him in the air. Ollie grabbed his fish and headed for home, pushing the floating body before him. By the time he was halfway home, he was sweating as if he'd ran fifty miles. This was the hardest thing he'd ever done in his life! By the time he had covered another quarter of the way, he was shaking hard and stumbling over everything in his path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, one of his friends, Otak, the smith, had just stepped out side to see to some work on a plow. He saw Ollie stumble, then stumble again. Whatever he had been pushing before him crashed to the ground and Otak saw him fall on top of it. \"Sven, Thomas\" he called. Sven stepped outside to see what was going on. He was in his final year of apprenticeship to Otak and was almost as heavily muscled as the older man. Thomas was in his first year of apprenticeship and did much of the minor, but extremely important jobs which had made the smithy a solid reputation as a teacher. \"Sven, you come with me. Ollie collapsed in the field. He was coming toward the village, pushing something which I think may have been a body. Thomas, you go and roust the mayor out of his comfortable seat in the Inn. Tell him <i>I</i> said it is necessary. Don't tarry. And, if he tries to ignore you, tell him I have instructed you to to the shire next. And, actually, now that I think on it, do that, whether he the mayor comes or not. Go!\" he commanded. Thomas took off at a run. \"Sven, I doubt we need them, but...\" Otak let his voice trail off and Sven stepped back into the smithy and returned moments later with two maces and two daggers. Each man took one of each weapon and headed out to where the boy had fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtak looked at the body Ollie had brought with him and spat, \"Orc!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSven was scanning the countryside, \"I don't see any of them. That could be good or bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtak grunted a chuckle and picked up Ollie. His breathing was weak and he lolled lifelessly in the big smithy's hands. His clothes were drenched in sweat. Otak had smelled the sour stench of it as he checked out the boy earlier. The four fish he had caught fell to the ground beside him. \"All right lad, let's see what we can see. You were out fishin for breakfast and caught yerself four nice uns. Then, this orc fell into yer path. Yer felt it important enough t' see we knew what yu'd found, sos yer brought it back with yer. Now, yer wouldn't a been a killin yerself iffin yer hadn't been worried bout somtin, and since thin un died by a sword stroke through the gut, I'm being to guessin theres more of them orcs and theys fixin to pay us a visit, mos likely round bout dinner time. How's I doin so far lad?\" he asked the unconscious boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shire, a man of early middle age grunted, \"Well, I ain't been called a lad in many a year now, Otak, but I'd be sayin yer got the right of hit. How be the lad? Will he make it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used himself up tryin to bring us warning. If he a hadn't, we'd a laughed ourselves silly, much to our dismay later. I'd be sayin he deserves a heroes reward fer savin our hides. Course now, the hardest part's the waitin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shire and the smith spread the word around and within a few hours, everyone was heading into the town. Ollie was placed in a room at the Inn where he could rest and the town healer came to see him. After lookin the boy over, he went back to the common room and had a draft of ale. \"The lad will live. As for his magicin abilities, won't know about them until later on. But, its sure to be one a two things what happens to them. Either he's burnt hisself out or he'll be stronger for whut he's done. But, till he tries to do magic, we won't know fer sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty Mary Markwood, the innkeeper's middle aged daughter, was a full year older than Ollie. She'd always sort of liked him, but he was so far below her status, that any thought of marriage was out of the question. She was listening to the town elders talking about the upcoming attack. Her father had put Ollie into a small room, near the back of the Inn and over the kitchen, so getting any rest there was questionable. The only reason he'd done so at all was because the rest of the elders had insisted. She had also overheard the healer's report and shrank back, her fist crammed into her mouth to prevent any outcry on her part. She sneaked back into Ollie's room and bathed his hot head with cool water. \"Ollie?\" she asked in a low voice. \"Ollie, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie moaned and opened his eyes. \"M-Ma-\" he choked out. She poured him a glass of water, holding it when she saw how shaky his hands were. After Ollie had drank the better part of two glasses, he sat up slowly. His head spun, but his voice was steadier this time, \"Mary! Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shushed him by putting her hand over his mouth. \"I overheard father and the others talking in the common room. The shire sent a rider for aid, but no one thinks help will arrive in time. Please, will you stay with me?\" She blushed, making her even prettier in Ollie's eyes. She looked down lest he think her too bold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie reached out and raised her head. \"Don't ever look down around me, Mary. You're one of the few people who have ever thought I would make something of myself. You have nothing to be ashamed of around me, although, \"he went on, musingly, \"if someone caught us in this position...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Mary jumped almost out of her skin. Framed in the doorway, Otak grinned, \"I see yer be doin as a bit of alright, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me past!\" snapped her fathers voice. Otak stepped into the small room, guiding Mary behind him so her father wouldn't see her. As Stephan Markwood strode into the room, several of the elders followed him inside. \"I see you've awakened, no doubt you wish to remain here, stinking up my Inn and living off your new status <i>if</i> this attack happens as predicted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtak hustled the girl out of the room as he said, \"Enon a that, Stephan. We'll be seein soon enon if what we think will happen will be a happenin. Can yer tell us aboot this mornin lad,\" the big man asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was fishin at a spot I found over by the river where the fish like to hole up in the early mornin. I had just caught the last of them four when I heard some voices I'd never heard afore grumbling above me. I hunkered back into a hidin spot an they was a yellin and screamin at each other. Then, the one I was bringing back fell into the river and died. Afore he did, he looked at me an grinned, he did. I waited until I hadn't heard anything fer a while, then I headed back to town as fast as I could. I thought I saw you afore I collapsed, but by then, I wasn't sure a much as to real or not.\"</span></div></div>",

He hadn't thought of that possibility. \"If he is, then he'll be sorry he messed with you two. I'll make sure of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you, Ollie? How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Mary. I feel really good.\" And, to Ollie's amazement, he really did feel good. The drained feeling he had had earlier was gone. True, he felt as if he could eat a whole cow by himself, but otherwise, he felt really, really good. \"Let's go then. Katy, you've been really brave. But we need you to be even braver for a while. You can't scream or cry until we're safe. You understand?\" Katy, her eyes big, nodded. \"Mary, you take her hand. I'll need my hands free in case I have to do more magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach rumbled and Mary said, \"Wait a moment.\" She ran over and pulled three apples from one barrel and two potatoes from another. She also pulled down a strip of jerked meat and handed all but two apples to him. \"You're going to need something to eat if you're going to keep using magic. Otherwise, you'll fall out in a faint and won't be able to protect us. Katy and I will be fine with an apple apiece until after the fight is over.\" Ollie had taken the food from Mary and was almost finished with it by the time she had finished talking. He hadn't realized just how famished he had been. Mary frowned, then went back to the barrels and took out three more potatoes and another apple. She handed them to Ollie and said, \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they reached the top of the stairs, Ollie had finished everything but the jerky. And, it was over half gone! He listened for a moment before opening the door and leading the girls out. The man who had offered him shelter was fighting an orc. The orc had a short sword while the man had a stout cudgel. The orc had his back to Ollie. He motioned for the girls to stay still and he moved quietly behind the orc. When he was just out of range of the sword, he threw a chair at the orcs legs, yelling at the same time. The orc started to turn around at the same moment the chair hit him. He fell heavily and before he could recover, the man had smashed his skull with his club. \"Good job,\" he panted, \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie picked up the sword. He had never used a weapon like this before, but had no intention of leaving it for another orc to find and use. They left the In, darting across the street and into a house there. The door opened just before they reached it so they could get inside without slowing. Ollie looked around to see half of the town's womenfolk, armed with cleavers and staffs, in the room. \"Best be off to help with the clean-up,\" one stern looking woman with steel gray hair said to the man. He bobbed his head and left without a word. Ollie was about to say he should be out fighting, too when he saw his mother, his two younger brothers and all three of his sisters standing near a corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done enough for today,\" his mother said kindly, her pride in her son clear in both voice and eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye!\" muttered several of the other women. Before he could argue, his stomach rumbled again, making several of the women laugh. The woman who had commanded the man to leave said, \"I'll get yer sommat to eat young mage. An ye best be eatin all a it, too.\"</span></div></div>",

(He will do things normally outside of his alignment -in the short term- if they will further an overall good outcome in the long term.) His looks take after his father, leaving him looking like a black draconian or a draconic humanoid. Although sterile, his body is made for sex... and war. can't forget war. He's straight or heterosexual or whatever, and is an inventive sort. from *cough* alchemical potions for sexual productivity to the more common every day use healing potions to prototypeing spell based weapons. (Think magic guns and so on.) he's strong for a mage, (16-18 str) and has a breath weapon (acid) along with a black dragon's digestive system. he's not very good with people, save women that want to get back on their husbands for cheating on them and that sort of thing... you get the picture by now right?</span></div></div>",
