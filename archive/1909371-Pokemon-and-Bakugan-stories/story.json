Namely being the first person she could recall calming her out of her depression. She did a good job hiding it, but the war was eating her up in manys way, all of them coming back down to this: she caused it. It turned out her father was a Gundalian, and that the Emperor had no tolerance of inter-species relationships to begin with, let alone intimate ones with Neithians. However, Dan convinced her otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fabia, You're not what caused this war.\" She remembered Dan reassuring her. \"Yes, you might have something to do with it, but you didn't cause it. This war was built up for years, I'd bet. They just used you as an excuse to slaughter each other. besides, Gundalians are violent by nature.\" She then remembered wrapping her arms around him, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Sheen?\" Fabia was brought out of the sweet past by one of her assistants.... whom she was hugging. \"Is it wrong of me to assume you miss this Dan Kuso?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed you using your newly developed powers on some of male castle residence to have them play the role of this Kuso fellow. I also hear you yell at them for not getting him down right. If I may say, that part is rather humorous.\" Fabia's blush was golden.... figuratively, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... you won;t tell anyone, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" She said, granting a sigh of relief from Fabia. \"That said, I think you should go to this Dan fellow, if he is that important to you.\" She then handed her something that resembles a hand-held game system. \"We'll give you a call should anything go wrong here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... How will I get to Earth?\" Fabia asked, hiding her child-like glees from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to forget our teleport system can send you there, where ever you would desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, let us go there right now!\" She said. She actually had a.... devilish grin. Her 'powers' she got from her Gundalian side kicked in shortly after Dan and company left. And she has been needing to thank Dan for some time now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Fabia, here you are.\" Where did Fabia go to?</span></div></div>",

She found a surprisingly young women with Dan's Hair and Eyes on the other side. \"Um.. is this the house of Dan Kuso?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Dan? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... Fabia.

Well, Dan's not home right now, but you can come in if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Fabia followed her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Miyoko Kuso. I'm Dan's mother.\" She said, having the two sit down on the couch. Fabia.... was thrown for a loop by that last bit. \"She's Dan's mom? She looks more like a sister than a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, his Dad is out for a worldwide business trip, and won't be back for a while.\" Fabia then got some ideas... she wasn't sure how to feel about them. Then again, how bad could it be? \"So, what did you want with Dan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not much\" She said, hoping on top of her. \"I just owe Dan some favors. And I think you could help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Fabia, this isn't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh..\" Fabia said, lightly hold Miyoko's chin in place, granting her a perfect view into each other's eyes. \"Don't resist.\" She then gave a passionate, but short kiss on the lips - all while keeping her eyes open and focused. \"In fact, I bet you'd enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\" She weakly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFabia answered with another kiss. \"Don't talk, honey. Not while we're doing this, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiss. Miyoko felt her will slip away. (Don't talk)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I better you've felt an itch for some love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiss (I itch for love)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can fix that for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiss (Fabia can help)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As can Dan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiss (Dan can help)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Dan. He sure is hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiss (Dan.... No, can't.. think.... About... how hot.....)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, he's a good fuck buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiss (Dan's a fuck buddy)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, why not test that out when he gets back., but until then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFabia then place her arms around Miyoko, and began to passionately kiss.

Fabia then walked up to her. \"Fabia, or whatever your name is, let me go this instant!\" She screamed. Fabia put her lips on Runo's and kissed. As the half neathian-gundalian girl was kissing her, Runo was mesmerized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have never felt like this before ever in my life. She thought. Fabia then broke the kiss. \"Runo, when I kiss you again, you will be under my control along with Miyoko and we will serve Dan.

Fabia left the house and stood out on the sidewalk. \"Now where should I start?\" She asked herself. As the neathian was thinking, she heard a loud slam. Fabia looked in the direction where the sound was coming from and noticed a tan girl wearing a cheerleader outfit slamming down the trunk hatch of her Honda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you piece of junk, just close already!\" The white haired girl snapped. This gave Fabia and idea. <i>Maybe this girl knows Dan.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the white haired girl was going to walk up to the door, she noticed Fabia come up to her. \"Hello, my name is Fabia, I'm new around here. Is there a chance that you know Dan Kuso?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the one with brown hair that wears goggles on his head?\" The tan skinned girl asked. Fabia nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a close friend of his, my name is Julie Makimoto. Nice to meet you.\" The girl now named Julie answered. <i>So she's his close friend, perfect!</i> Fabia thought. \"Since you are his friend, then you can help me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you with what?\" Julie asked. Before she could continue, Fabia slammed her against the wall and connected her lips with hers. Julie could feel her strength drain away as her eyes became droopy. Fabia seprated from her and went up to her ear. \"When I kiss you for the second time, you must tell me all the girls that know Dan so I can bring them over to his house.\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie dumbly nodded and the neathian smirked. She started kissing Julie again, this time more deeper. Her wet tongue twined with the white haired girl's tongue, making each other moan in delight. After the kissing, Fabia stared at her. \"Tell me.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan knows Alice and Mira.\" Julie said. \"Where do they live?\" Fabia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira is currently living with Marucho and Alice is living in Moscow, Russia.\" Julie answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Julie. Now go into Dan's house and sit with Miyoko and Runo on the sofa.\" Fabia ordered. Julie nodded and went to Dan's house. \"Now let's go see Marucho.\" She said, taking out her transporter. Fabia activated it, taking her to Marucho's large house. </span></div></div>",

He then leaned into Alice's face for a closer look. \"Is there something on my face?\" Alice asked in worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you crying or something?\" The brown haired boy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, why are you asking that?\" Alice stammered nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your nose and eyes are red and your face is wet too.\" He told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I was crying because Shun broke up with me.\" Alice hastily spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shun broke up with you?\" Dan asked. Alice nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not a surprise. Shun really doesn't take interest in girls anyway, the only girls he loves are his mom and Skyress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did he date me then?\" The orange haired girl asked. \"I don't know, maybe he was bored and he wanted to kill some time.\" Dan shrugged. Alice sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so down, want to go to the park together and eat ice cream?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really in the mood for ice cream Dan.\" The brown eyed girl said. \"Come on, I really hate to see you so down.\" He told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went to the park and sat down. Dan ordered himself chocolate chip and ordered strawberry for Alice. As soon as they got their cones, they sat down at the nearest bench, and started licking. \"Thanks Dan, I feel a little better now.\" Alice thanked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" He replied. </span></div></div>",

You see, your father wasn't from Neathia, but rather from Gundalia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, that's not possible. He was a Neathian. My mom and sister said so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ever see an image of him, or wonder why you've never met him? It's because he was Gundalian, and I have no tolerence for interracial union, especially when a Gundalian is involved. In fact, child, it was your mere existence that started this war. You are the reason Neathia has suffered so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying!

If you don't believe me, ask your sister. Farewell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarodius teleported away, leaving the brawlers stunned. Could she really be half-Gundalian and the neice of Barodius, the man who declared war on her home? There was only one way to know for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Later on, in the Neathian throne room--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Brawlers,\" Queen Serena said. \"You're lucky Barodius didn't attack you, though I don't understand why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He talked about Fabia's father, said you'd know,\" Shun said, causing Serena's face to downcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave us.\" The guards did as the queen ordered, leaving her alone with the brawlers. Once they were gone, Serena returned her attention to them. \"What did he say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said that Fabia's father was really a Gundalian, his brother,\" Marucho said. \"And that Fabia is a huge part of the reason he declared war on Neathia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serena, he was lying right?\" Fabia asked, a pleading tone in her voice. \"Please tell me he was lying! Tell me it's not true!\" She saw the way her sister looked down. \"No. No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, little sister, but Barodius spoke the truth. Your father is from Gundalia, and Barodius's brother. We're actually half-sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it can't be true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it is. This is your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Serena showed them a holographic photo of Fabia's father, a Gundalian. She also showed them Fabia's DNA with traces of Gundalian in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I'm a Gundalian? No. No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fabia, just calm--,\" Shun tried to say, but Fabia smacked his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lie! Some sick joke! It has to be! It has to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't look like it,\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at your eyes,\" Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFabia looked into the wall, and saw her eyes. Her left eye was her Neathian eye, but the right one was that of a Gundalian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...it's true? I'm Gundalian. I'm the reason Neathia's suffered so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fabia,\" Dan said, moving to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFabia ran out of the throne room in tears, not wanting to accept this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fabia, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan ran after her, Shun just standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you gonna stop him?\" Ren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't matter.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Alright, here we go. So here's the thing here. This has three options for the stories you can do. Each story has it's own unique rules, sometimes, but the general rules apply to all of them.<br>\r\nFirst one: Dan Kuso's Hypno Harem- Dan from Bakugan gets a harem through hypnotic means. <br>\r\nExclusive Rule: Make sure to have creative ideas on how he hypnotizes the girls. Like a musk that overrides their brains. Or a magic tongue twister that has a variety of effects that happen when they mess up. One that'll make Mira lactate without being pregnant, and will make her love being milked. All forms of hypnosis are welcomed here. Go crazy with bimbos if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond one: Bakugan Girls Interactive. Basically like my other interactives, but with the Bakugan girls. No exclusive rule(s).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird one: Pokegirl Interactive. An interactive about the Pokemon girls. <br>\r\nExclusive rules: Max must be limited to at least one or threads, and can not snatch up all the girls. And must not be in the Serena thread at all.<br>\r\nPlease include the female player characters, like Hilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew story: Ash Ketchum's Hypno Harem: same as the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew story: Pokemon/Bakugan Anthro stories: stories that revolve around the Bakugan and Pokemon being anthromorphed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Rules:<br>\r\n1: No scat, vore, gore, yaoi, or unbirth. <br>\r\n2: No weight gain, maybe. Alright, you can if you don't go overboard with it.<br>\r\n3: Expansion is fine.<br>\r\n4: Shrinking and growing is fine.<br>\r\n5: Bimbos are also fine.<br>\r\n6: No rape<br>\r\n7: No death<br>\r\n8: I think that's enough for now.</td>",
