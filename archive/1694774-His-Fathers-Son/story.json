The beating he'd suffered through this afternoon had convinced him of the fact that should he stay at his Uncle Vernon's house he would not survive for long.  His arm felt wrong, his side hurt, and his back hurt from where Vernon had gone after him with the belt.  So it was either now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd made it two blocks from the house when he began to feel weak.  Whatever Uncle Vernon had done to his side, Harry was pretty sure it was going to be the death of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking hard he saw a man on the sidewalk.  In the fading light of day Harry hurried as best he could to make it to this unknown man.  \"Mister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke softly, pain overwhelming him, \"Help me, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in question, turned and looked at the boy who was about to collapse.  Without a word he tbent and picked up the boy in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Harry whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\"  Harry asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebeus Hagrid was a very nervous half giant.  He was currently on a mission of great importance:  He was trying to find Harry Potter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been quite the shock when it was discovered that Albus Dumbledore had misplaced The boy who lived.  And that the people he had chosen to raise and watch over Harry Potter had been arrested for child abuse.  There had been no further trace of Harry Potter.  Once the Drusleys had been jailed Harry had simply disappeared as if carried away on the wind.  That was more than five years ago.  Which had been followed by five years of fruitless searching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beyond important that they find Harry this year.  This year was the year for Harry to start Hogwarts.  The year he would returm to the wizarding world.  The year Albus Dumbledore could no longer conceal the fact that he had lost a national treasure.  Each of those loyal to Dumbledore that could be trusted not to mention his misplacement of Harry had been sent out to track down the last of the possible leads Albus Dumbledore had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe completed the point me spell one more time and looked at the small house amongst the other small houses the his umbrella was pointing towards.  Or rather at the large black car that was pulling up in front of the small house in this American suburb.  If he remembered right those were called Lemosinis.  Or something like that.  It had been a long time since Muggle study's had been a priority of Hagrid's.  Still that's where he was needed.  He angled his flying motorcycle down and prayed that his disillusionment charm held until he was on the ground.  He figured landing behind one of the houses would be best for cover so he came augering in behind 1122.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding he stepped off the bike and dismissed the charm, making himself visible to the eye.  He edged nervously to the side of the building and looked at the long black car that had now stopped in front of 1124.  The back door opened and hagrid held his breath.  The first person out of the car was an exotic looking woman with dark hair wearing a form hugging black body suit with red pipping under an over coat.  Never in all his years had Hagrid seen a woman wearing an outfit quite like that.  It was indecent.  It was exciting.  It was... things he ought not be thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person out of the vehicle was who Hagrid had been hoping for.  It was Harry Potter.  It had to be.  It couldn't be anyone else.  He had James' face and he had Lily's eyes.  But the lad had a stern expression, those green eyes staring straight ahead.  Hagrid quirked an eyebrow at the white suit the boy was wearing.  He wore a white coat, slacks, shirt, tie, vest and shoes; not a single other color in his outfit.  But that was pushed aside by the joy he felt.  He had found Harry Potter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the open he nearly shouted, \"Harry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two just out of the car stopped, the woman shrugged off her overcoat and took a defensive stance in front of Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry Potter!\"  Hagrid joyously cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy in the white suit put a hand on the woman in black's elbow.  The woman relaxed her stance and looked from the approaching Hagrid to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my name, Mister?\"  Harry spoke when Hagrid was within striking distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.\"  Hagrid said unsure what to say to that.  Dumbledore said that Harry might not know he was Harry Potter what with being adoped and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you, Mister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hagrid, Rubeus Hagrid.\"  Hagrid said with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snow, Harry Snow.\"  Harry replied with a curt nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wagner, Jakita Wagner.\"  The woman in black smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet you.\"  Harry hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came ta talk ta you Harry, all th' way from 'Ogwarts.\"  Hagrid nodded impressed with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry frowned, \"I see.  About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bout comin' ta 'Ogwarts, o' course.\"  Hagrid thought that would have been obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry murmurred to himself for a second and then let out a breath, \"Mr. Hagrid, I've business to see to in that house.  Family duty, you see, you can come with if you keep quiet.  After I've concluded my business you and I may talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Hagrid nodded, \"I un'erstand about family duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakita looked from Harry to Hagrid.  When Harry gave an imperceptable nod she turned and walked towards the door, picking up her overcoat on the way. Knocking without waiting for Harry to catch up.  The door opened to reveal a black woman holding an infant daughter on her hip, she looked from Jakita to Harry and with widening eyes up to Hagrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry spoke, \"Mrs. Chase, I'm Harry Snow.  You know Jakita.  Behind me is Rubeus Hagrid.  May we come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Chase nodded her head and lead the odd group into her living room.  Jakita sat on the couch with Mrs. Chase and her daughter, Harry took the opposing chair.  Hagrid fearful of breaking any of the furniture just sat on the floor.  Him being in a muggle home was always a tight fit, standing nine feet tall made it a little hard for him to meet ceiling clearance for most muggle homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you something to drink?\"  Mrs. Chase asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Chase.\"  Harry began, \"Larissa?\"  She nodded her head.   \"I'm going to be blunt.  It's a trait I've gotten from my father.  Your husband is dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarissa Chase bit back a sob at that statement.  Jakita reached over and put a hand atop Larissa's for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot change that for which I am sorry.\"  Harry said softly.  \"My father would be here were it not for recent... health problems he's had.  However I am here in his stead.  As of now you and your daughter, Angela?\"  Larissa nodded.  \"You and Angela are now independantly wealthy.  You will never want for anything ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- i don't need charity.\"  Larissa gasped through held back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not giving charity.\"  Harry replied staring Larissa dead in the eye.  \"I have more money than I can spend in one lifetime, more than I can spend in two.  You husband was my friend, he was my father's friend, he saved my father's life once.  In my eyes that makes this a long over due debt.  If you wish to work I will make sure that you will always have a job at Planetary.  If it turns out all you want to do is raise your daughter  than that's what you'll do.  It's not a question of charity, Mrs. Chase, it's a question of doing what's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your husband died working for my family.  It is poor recompense but from now on you will never want for anything.\"  Harry said stone faced.  \"If you don't want to use the money I can't force you too but the money will always be there for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tears in her eyes Larissa Chase looked at the young boy in the white suit, at his black unruly hair and at his piercing green eyes.  \"Ambrose spoke of you and your father often, Mr. Snow,  He held you and your father in the very highest regard.  It's nice to see that you deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am.\"  Harry nodded his head.  \"Jakita, I'll meet you back at the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakita gave Larissa a pat on the knee and then stood, walked over to Harry and put both hands on his shoulder's as he turned to face Hagrid.  Jakita spoke with a wide smile on her face as she adressed Hagrid. \"Mr. Hagrid, you're going to be going with Harry now.  If you hurt him I will take great pleasure in breaking all of your limbs and them stomping you to death.  Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid had never seen a more scary woman than Jakita Wagner right now.  He nodded his head quickly.  That woman could give Professor McGongal lessons.  He thought Harry talking just now had been impressive but that woman was... something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook Jakita loose and stepping to Hagrid put a hand on the sitting giant's shoulder.  \"Sit tight, Mr. Hagrid, and I'll teleport us to my office for  our talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleport?\"  Hagrid asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
