Then the Floatzel gently picks you up with his giant paw and places you on the table. \"So do you have a name\" the Vaporeon asked. \"M..my name is Donald\" you reply still a little scared. \"Pleased to meet you Donald my name is Shiki.\" said the Vaporion. \"My name is Jet\" said the Floatzel \"and over there is my little brother Storm.\" pointing at the Buizel which was siting on the floor playing with a ball.

Finally it is dark to the point that you can't see so you cling to the Vaporeon as tightly as possible. \"Don't worry Donald we know where we're going\" Shiki reassures you. For a while all you can do is hang on to Shiki and listen to the sound of their foot steps on the cave floor. Then you can see a light in the distance and you are finally to see again. As you come out of the tunnel you see a small beach that is hidden by the massive cliff. \"We made it.\" said Jet as he sat down in the sand. As Shiki sits down you slide down her back and land on the soft sand.  \"This is our secret spot.\" Shiki informers you \"We come hear every night to watch the sunset.\" \"Whys that?\" you ask. \"You'll see\" She told you giving you a small wink. You sit down and look towards the sea waiting for the sunset. As the sun sets you see the water glow with a rainbow of colors. You watch in amazement as the colors dance around the sea surface. after five minutes the colors stop. \"That was another beautiful sunset\" Miku stated \"But ,we should get home before it gets to dark.\" \"Ok\" Shiki said lowering her head so you can get on.

A minute later you see her caring a basket of fruit in her mouth. she placed the basket on the table and using her tail she picks up a large blue fruit and sets it in front you. \"This is an Oran berry\" Miku explains \"Eating this will help you with your injuries.\" \"Thanks\" you reply \"Can I have something to cut this with?\" you ask. \"Hear ya go\" Jet says handing you what looks like a tooth pick. taking the tooth pick you start to cut the fruit and eat.

Day after day they would come to the island and caused chaos and destruction. When all hope was lost, 9 brave hero\u2019s came to fight those monsters. These hero\u2019s where the hero\u2019s of Joy, Sorrow, Rage, Peace, Courage, Wisdom, Willpower, Light, and Darkness*. These Pokemon had power that others can only dream of having. The 9 Hero\u2019s slain the monsters as if they where nothing and returned peace to the land. Even though the monsters kept retuning the 9 Hero\u2019s always destroyed them. Then one day a giant monster came to the island. This monster known as the destroyer was so large that it could destroy the island with one swing of his claw. The 9 Hero\u2019s confronted the monster but, the monster was just to powerful for them to defeat. But just before all hop was lost the Hero\u2019s combined into one and defeated the monster. Even though the monster was no more a peace of the monsters essence still remanded. The 9 Hero\u2019s took the essence to a secret island and with all there power sealed it in a cave with an unbreakable barrier. With the world at peace again the 9 Hero\u2019s left the island never to be heard from again. But before they left the they sent an essence from each one of the 9 Hero\u2019s to another dimension to find a successor. The successors of these hero\u2019s are known as Commit Children and have the amazing powers of the hero\u2019s.

Everyone stayed away from me because everyone believed I was trouble cause that\u2019s what all Sableyes are in there eyes. I was very alone until that day I met her. One day wile walking to class someone said hello to me. I turned around and I saw a young Swoobat. I didn\u2018t know what to do since no one had ever spoken to me before so I was very insecure. However she under stood me and she helped me feel wanted. Even though no one else liked me I didn\u2019t care if Millenia was with me. We have been real close ever since.\u201d  \u201cWell then what happened that made you join Team Ghoul?\u201d You ask. Dimitri sighs heavily as he continues \u201cAbout a month ago me and Millenia where walking together when we saw the leader of Team Ghoul, Gengar tormenting a young Pokemon. Millenia couldn\u2019t stand seeing a little Pokemon being bullied so she went after him. Even though she was at a disadvantage she beat him and he ran off humiliated. Then that night wile she was flying home, Team Ghoul ambushed her they beat her up. She was almost done for but the island police arrived and Team Ghoul fled. They took her to the Pokemon Center to try and help heal her. When I got the news I got over there as fast as I could. When I saw her she had many burses on her body and both her wings where broken. Even though she was in a lot of pain she smiled at me when she saw me. I was told that it would be weeks before she would be able to fly again and after hearing that I was determined to help Millenia feel better. So day after day I visited her and hoping to see the day that she would be able to fly again. But one day I came to visit her and I saw that the Center had been raided by a gang of Pokemons. I feared the worse had happened so I rushed to see if Millenia was alright, however when I got to her room there was no sign of her anywhere. I looked everywhere for her but I could never find her and I expected that Team Ghoul had some thing to do with it. However I couldn\u2019t seem to get any info on them from the outside so I did the only thing I could do to get what I wanted, I joined Team Ghoul.\u201d \u201cSo you joined Team Ghoul so you could find out what happened to your friend.\u201d Jet says with sympathy \u201cDid you find out?\u201d  \u201cSadly no.\u201d Dimitri says sadly \u201cHowever I can\u2019t shake the feeling that she is still alive so I kept looking. However I also remembered Millenia would always want to help others in need so I would always try to help little Pokemon that Team Ghoul harmed.\u201d You could see the sadness in his face. You could see that if he could cry he would but being a Sableye he couldn\u2019t. Jet released his ice grip on Dimitri as he looks at him with sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jet says. \u201cDon\u2019t be you where just looking after your friend.\u201d Dimitri says getting to his feet. \u201cHey why don\u2019t  you join us.\u201d you ask \u201cThat way we could help you find your friend.\u201d Dimitri looks at you and he replies.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Two is that you feel pain in your stomach. And three is that everything is way bigger than it normally should be.

Are you ready to listen? <br>\r\nAll three of you quietly nodded and sat down. <br>\r\n(Mew) Alright. 400 years ago there was a war with an evil race of monsters known as the Night Crawlers. Day after day, they would come to the island and caused chaos and destruction. When all hope was lost, 9 brave heroes came to fight those monsters. These heroes where the heroes of Joy, Sorrow, Rage, Peace, Courage, Wisdom, Willpower, Light, and Darkness. These Pokemon had power that others can only dream of having. The 9 Heroes slain the monsters as if they where nothing and returned peace to the land. Even though the monsters kept retuning the 9 Heroes always destroyed them. Then, one day, a giant monster came to the island. This monster, known as the Destroyer, was so large that it could destroy the island with one swing of his claw. The 9 Heroes confronted the monster but the monster was just to powerful for them to defeat. But just before all hope was lost, the Heroes combined into one and defeated the monster. Even though the monster was no more, a peace of the monsters essence still remanded. The 9 Heroes took the essence to a secret island and, with all there power, sealed it in a cave with an unbreakable barrier. With the world at peace again, the 9 Heroes left the island never to be heard from again. But before they left the they sent an essence from each one of the 9 Heroes to another dimension to find a successor. The successors of these heroes are known as Commit Children and have the amazing powers of the heroes. Because of the time of peace we have had we never needed to call upon them\u2026Until now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     With your headache fading, you take a moment to assess your situation. Looking around, you realize almost immediately that you are in a nest of some sort; sticks and leaves abound. You also immediately see that this nest was laid in a thorn bush. Very painful-looking thorns and branches surround you, almost daring you to try and traverse them. You had lived in a place absolutely riddled with these bushes, though, and had you been your normal size, you probably could've done so with nary a scratch on you. That actually reminded you: you had been shrunk! Comparing the apparent size of this bush with those back at home, you surmised that you were about a foot tall, meaning that everything was almost six times larger. But this didn't make sense; even at 6x size, an ordinary bird wouldn't have been able to make a nest this large.                                                                                                                                           <br>\r\n         What could've created this?.....<br>\r\n         Your thoughts are answered when you hear a loud flapping noise from behind. Whipping around, you are stunned by what you see.<br>\r\n         The bird's skin was steel-gray everywhere except the red feathers on its wings, the piercing yellow eyes, and the navy-blue neck, talons, and tail. The triangular crest on its head and the sharp teeth in its jaw confirmed your analysis: This was a Skarmory.<br>\r\n          A 30-foot-tall Skarmory. Well, this just made your day.<br>\r\n          The steel bird perches on the branches in front of you, the thorns not seeming to hurt it in the slightest. The two of you stare at each other for what feels like an eternity. Your friendliness back at home had granted you the ability to read faces like a pro, so you took this precious moment to judge this avian's feelings.<br>\r\n           Child-like curiosity and wonder, riddled with shyness and timidity, were what you had seen at first. Looking deeper into those golden eyes, you could've sworn you could see some fear as well. Odd... why would this massive steel predator hold any fear at all with someone of your diminutive stature?<br>\r\n             Finally, you decide to be bold and break the silence. \"Umm.... Hello.\"<br>\r\n             The Skarmory had tensed up at your words, but relaxed when it understood your intent. \"H-Hello,\" it responded back. The voice sounded feminine, and a few years younger than you as well. Was it really just a child?<br>\r\n             \"A-Are you hurt at all? I tried to put you down without scratching you,\" she continued with a worried tone.<br>\r\n             So she had rescued you from.... wherever you had landed in this strange world. You were grateful that someone would do such a thing. \"Yes, I am alright,\" you replied. \"How did you find me?\"<br>\r\n              \"I was flying when I noticed a weird-looking portal near one of the hills. Suddenly, a small creature popped out! You were unconscious when I got to you, so I decided to take you back to my nest,\" she explained. Almost immediately afterwards, she gave you that same timid look and added, \"Umm.. W-what are you, exactly?\" <br>\r\n               \"I am something called a human,\" you responded.<br>\r\n               \"Hoo...Hu-man,\"' she repeated. \"I've never seen something like you before. Maybe it's just because I only left my parents' nest a couple weeks ago.\" Suddenly, she looks very sad as she adds, \"Or... maybe I really am as clueless as my brothers told me.\"<br>\r\n                 \"Don't say that,\" you say, standing up and walking towards her. She starts shrinking back as you approach, and it might have been funny were it not for the current situation. \"Obviously, you aren't clueless if you noticed me on that hill and brought me here. Your brothers are clueless for not realizing how kind their sister is, so don't you go thinking that they're right!\" You were almost shouting now, and the Skarmory had pinned herself to the side of the nest, curled up and shaking with fear.<br>\r\n                   Perhaps you had taken that a bit too far; your temper got ahold of you sometimes. Lowering your voice a little and kneeling down, you continue, \"Please, there's no reason to be afraid of me. I don't bite, I promise.\" This was ridiculous. She should be saying that to YOU, not the other way around. You were going to have to really talk with her later to figure out the deal with her self esteem and fear of everything.<br>\r\n                     Slowly, she uncurled herself and looked at you with those yellow eyes, the fear beginning to fade. You took the chance immediately, saying, \"I don't think I've mentioned my name. It's Shane. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n                   \"S-Sarah,\" she replied. Although most of the fear was gone, she still retained that timid and shy persona.<br>\r\n                   \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Sarah,\" I said with a reassuring smile. This was going to be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You say to yourself \"man i wish i could be more like Seth, always talking and not an enemy to be seen. I just wish people would understand why i don't talk to them, but they just won't understand.

A sharp pain shoots across your entire body, proving that you were awake, then you sit up and that's when you notice that a huge cloth had somewhat been wrapped around your body. It was loose enough that you could remove it, but tight enough that it held close to your scars.  You decide to remove it as you think it will only slow you down. That's when you finally realize the biggest issue: everything except you was massive. You stand up and see that you had been laying on a giant bed. You then say to yourself \"hm well these scars were probably from that crash landing, which still makes no sense, just like everything else. A giant bed, giant room, giant everything. Why is this all happening? Anyway all this giant stuff probably means a giant person... but, the person can't be too bad since they tried to cover my injuries. Maybe i should go see if i can find out who it is or maybe even find a way to repay him or her. (chuckle) Yeah right, somebody this huge can't really be repaid unless its a labor and I'd rather not do that. Oh well, if the person does want labor, maybe i should because they did take care of me. Maybe if I do find the person, they can tell me what happened or at least where I am or maybe even why they helped me.\" You think of how to get off the bed without further injuring yourself and realize that the cloth you tossed to the side would make a perfect rope to climb down on, but the next problem is what's going to stop it from falling down with you. You hope for the best as you stick it between the frame and the mattress. You slide down and just before you touch the ground, the cloth slips and falls to the ground. You just shake your head with disbelief, as it may have given out just a few seconds earlier and put you in some serious pain. You then walk off and realize that this place was a cave that had been sculpted into a house-like design and had been furnished pretty well. It had a T.V., kitchen appliances, a comfortable but durable chair, and finally with envious eyes you notice some game systems, and behind those eyes, you had realized that even if the owner and you got along, there was no way you could possibly play it. (Sigh). You decide that the owner must have either put some real work in this place or had somebody do it for them. You finally see your way out and without finding the owner, turn around looking just one more time just to be sure, then turn back around to face the exit.

He obviously knew you were staring at him as he turned away from his refrigerator to look back at you. His face showed a mixture of curiosity, unsureness, and nervousness. He eventually slowly breaks the stare and sits at his table with a glass of milk. You were not sure why, but something about him seemed familiar, yet unknown. You start approaching the table, but one thing about this aggron seems to eat at you. In a voice so quiet he wouldn't hear, you say to yourself \"Is he angry with me? All we've seemed to do so far is have unannounced staring contests. He probably is mad at me, all I've managed to do is get injured and not respond to his greeting. Great first day in a new place and I've already got <br>\r\nsomeone thinking I'm a jerk... Ugh\" You arrive at a foot of the table and wonder how to get to the top without bothering him. Without over-thinking the situation, you wrap yourself around the leg of the table and climb up after a struggle, to which you hear the aggron give a little chuckle, you reach the table top and walk towards his direction. After gathering up your courage, you say \"hello\" to the iron giant that sat in front of you. He nods his head and continues drinking his milk. Unsure of how to continue a conversation and not make it awkward, you say the only thing that you know was safe to say. \"Thank you for taking care of my injuries.\" He puts his glass down for a moment and replies back in that low, quiet voice \"It was no big deal and your welcome.\" In an attempt to keep the conversation going, you say \"I'm sorry about earlier, at the door. It's just your sheer size had me scared and I'm not really too good at talking to other people, no matter what size.\" You look at his face and notice his eyes got real big and he soon followed up by spitting all the milk in his mouth all over you. He says immediately after wards without looking up \"(cough cough) You..., I thought i was the one making the doorway incident seem quiet.\" You start shaking off the milk and that's when he looks at you and says in that same voice \" Whoa, my bad, let me get some paper towel for ya.\" He walks over to the counter and grabs some and gives them to you. You grab them from his hands and start wiping yourself off with them til you were as dry as you were going to get. He looks at you with a sorry expression and you tell him \"Hey, it's alright. Stuff happens. Anyway my name is James.\" You reach your hand out for a handshake, but you soon realize that a handshake wasn't going to happen anytime soon. You hear him chuckle as he notices your blunder and you soon join him in a good laugh. He reaches out with a claw to try and attempt a handshake and replies by saying \" My name is Rai and it's nice to meet ya.\" You ask him \"Is it alright if i ask you a few questions?\" He laughs again and says \"If you're looking to get drenched with milk again, I'm sorry but what i didn't spit on you, i drank.\" You laugh and say \"well then go get another glass, I need another bath.\" Rai laughs and finally says \"yea, go ahead, ask anything just as long as you are not making funny of me.\" You back off and reply \" right now I don't think I'm in any position to be mocking anyone.\" He nods and you ask...   </span></div></div>",

Nobody treated me like someone and all the older pokemon would beat me up just for fun. Everyday I would get beat up, and when I would try to talk to people they would either ignore me because I was 'weak' or talk to me, but talk bad about me behind my back. Only a few were my friends and we all talked, but we all had hard times talking as we had to hide from our bullies. I decided that the only way to quit being a punching bag and stop being ignored by everyone other than my friends was to get strong and show them all who I was. After school I would go home and work on getting stronger. Then a few weeks after my vow, I woke up in a different body. I looked at my reflection in a mirror and saw that I had evolved. I went to school with my head held as high as I could get it, proud of my accomplishment. When i got to school the Rai they picked on was gone and a new Rai had taken his place. My friends had a hard time recognizing me, but once they did they cheered me on and I convinced them to train so we would quit being victims and then be seen by everyone as equals. I earned the bullies respect and I began to talk to everyone else, but just as glory goes, all my glory soon faded away. They began to beat me up again and my social status soon dropped back down. I remember one day they all hit me real hard, harder than they ever had, and I ran home as quick as I could, listening to them talk and jeer at me. It was raining and I tripped a lot, but every time got up and kept going. I had to get away, not just from them, but from everyone who wasn't with me, whether I knew them or not. But one of times I fell and didn't get up. I just laid there and... and...\" He started to stutter and his breathing got irregular. Then you looked at his face and saw a glimmer on it, not of his metal, but of a tear shed. You immediately ran over and get hit by a fallen tear. You shake the hit off and rush up to his face. Worry ran through and you start rubbing a part of his face and embracing the tears that fell on you. You look up at him and say \"come on, don't cry. You don't have to tell me the rest if you don't want to. I can't stand other people hurting, no matter how similar or different we are. I\"ve felt what you were feeling. I know what it's like to be the scapegoat and be outcast by people. I understand, that's why I don't need to know the rest. I've been there before, just not the exact same conditions.\" He picked his head up to look at you and opened his eyes.

He could not tell you were crying until he heard little splashes on the table. You look back up at him and with tears pouring from your eyes say \"I don't care about talking to a wuss, and I'm not talking to one right now. I'm talking to a friend who understands, someone who knows, a comrade who shares the same pains which i have endured. We both have experienced hurt down by others and it eventually overwhelms even the strongest people. Just because we finally lose control does not make us weak, it just makes us stronger the next time and nobody can say anything about us crying because the only witnesses are us,\" and through the tears you show a smile. Rai looks at you with a joy similar to your own and says \"well I'm glad someone knows what it's like.\" Well since you know what it's like, sharing the rest is not so much a bad memory, but rather a burden a friend is here for to offer help and support.\" You nod to him and simultaneously both wipe away the tears in your eyes. (Rai) \" I saw nothing.\" You give him a nod with the same meaning. He then continues the story. (Rai) \"anyway I fell and I just cried and cried, thinking of all the effort I put in for nothing and how I felt betrayed by everyone. Then a few of my friends ran over to check on me. I didn't know what to say, so i remained quiet and in a silent tone thanked them for being there for me. All of us decided to head here to my cave and discuss our situation.  We all decided to form a group and vowed that whoever was the strongest of the group, that person would defend the rest. So after wards, everybody went home and started training. Everyday we trained and in a month almost everybody evolved at least once, except my best friend, yet even if he had evolved, we thought we still weren't strong enough to take all the bullies on. Then a week and a half later my best friend came over to tell me that he had finally evolved. I was envious that he was so powerful, but I had to congratulate him because I know it took a lot of effort and time. Then a rumbling occurred and we both looked to the top of the mountain. A massive rock slide had happened and a boulder twice our size rolled our way. We were too far from any homes to make it to them in time, I couldn't outrun it, and if we let it go, other pokemon could get hurt. My friend used any long-range attack he could, but they either glanced off or hit it harmlessly. He finally gave me a defeated look and said ' we can't stop it, we have to get out of here and hope for the best.' I felt both anger and sorrow and told him back ' I can't let this thing go loose, it could take out our friends and others. I will stop it ', and i remember turning and running straight for it. I can't remember what my friend said because all I heard was my heart pounding and thoughts running through my mind. Then I remember that a white light consumed me and i finally evolved to my final form. Running on two legs was quicker than the old four and i felt so much stronger. I remember running up to the rock and catching it. I used the strongest rock smash I could muster and watched the boulder dissolve into pebbles. I had started breathing heavy and turned around only to see my best friend right behind me. That's when i was sure that i actually had friends and not just fakes. We both went to his place since it was closer. When we got there, I saw an egg and asked him about it. All he told me was that he had a baby brother coming. I told him now he had another ally on our side and he chuckled. Then the next day at school was bad and not like that rainy day, more hatred than betrayal. The bullies started talking trash how no matter what size I was, I was always weak and started hitting me. It didn't too bad, but it was really irritating. Then I looked over and finally lost all control. For what I saw were all my friends, both big and small taking hits from those jerks. I picked up one of my bullies and threw him at another, then gave the leader a nice full force punch square in his wretched face. The rest were easily taken care of with an unstoppable hyper beam. Luckily, all my friends went unscathed and the enemies had been taken care of, but that's when things got worse. Someone had tapped me on the shoulder and I turned around to see my principal glaring at me. I went with him to the office and got a lecture on how bullying is such a bad thing to do. I tried to defend my position and told him to call my friends in, but he said there would be none of that and told me lying is just as bad as bullying the littler guys. He then signed a sheet issuing three days out of school suspension. I stormed out of his office and went straight home. My friends tried to slow me down and talk to me, but I was so enraged that ignoring them was the best option. Three days at home got lonely quick and even though my friends stopped by everyday after school to try and talk to me, I just felt lonely and betrayed by the world again. That's really when I became antisocial. I still talk to my friends a little, not as much as i used to and all those bullies left us all alone after that, but now nobody talks to me out of fear and when they do, I don't know what to say to them. That is the tale of Rai's anti-socialism.\" You looked at him and told him \"well my story is almost exactly identical just without evolution or cool attacks and a few other things.\" (Rai) \"well any other questions for me?\"...</span></div></div>",

Besides, who said you\u2019re coming with me anyway?\u201d <br>\r\nWhen he says this, he shoots you a puzzling glance. You drop back a little and say \u201cwell I just assumed I was going to go with you, but I guess that\u2026 You\u2019re cut off by Rai and he says \u201cwell I was going to bring you regardless. Leaving you alone in an all-huge, pokemon world just seemed dangerous. I just thought I would screw with you a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (phew) Thank goodness, I\u2019d hate to try and overpower.\u201d <br>\r\nHearing this, Rai gives a chuckle.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell I only got a few more questions, so umm\u2026 where am I going to sleep?\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell I\u2019m not really sure.

How about you go and check?\u201d <br>\r\nYou nod and he sets you on the ground, letting you roam towards his room. You ran the whole way and climbed to the top, using various notches as your footholds. You look out across the table and you could guarantee a mini bed would fit up here. But before you climb down, you hear Rai talking to what sounds like a young male pokemon.<br>\r\n(???) \u201cHi Rai. How are you?\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI\u2019m alright. How about you?\u201d<br>\r\nYou climb down and hide along the wall while they are talking.<br>\r\n(???) \u201cI\u2019m great. My brother wants to know if you want to come over for dinner.\u201d <br>\r\nThere is a pause and you peek out around the corner of the wall to see Rai has his head dropped slightly and he appears to be talking to a riolu. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNot tonight. Sorry, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve got a lot on my mind.\u201d <br>\r\nThe riolu then looks sad and says \u201coh, well my brother really wants you over sometime for dinner and you always seem busy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) I really am sorry, but I just seem to have something going all the time.\u201d <br>\r\n(Riolu) \u201cWell maybe next time or maybe next time, we can come eat with you.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) (smiling) \u201cThat sounds like a great idea. See you around\u201d <br>\r\n(Riolu) \u201cBye Rai.\u201d <br>\r\nAnd with that, the riolu was off. Rai walks back to the table and sets his head down, sighing. You jog over to the table and climb up the leg\u2026 again. You go over to Rai and tap on his head. He just looks up at you.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWho was that?\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cThat was Ryu, Aura\u2019s little brother.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAnd\u2026 who is Aura?\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cOh that\u2019s right, I never told you. You remember when I was telling you my story and mentioned my best friend?\u201d <br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell Aura is a lucario and was and still is my best friend.

I feel like such a jerk, but I feel like I would just ruin things or create an awkward silence.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cOh... and I think I have only one more question.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah what is it?\u201d <br>\r\nBefore you can say anything, your stomach growls, causing Rai to crack up. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell assuming that was your question, I\u2019d say now would be the perfect time to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cGreat, so I don\u2019t mean to sound picky, but what\u2019s on the menu?\u201d <br>\r\nRai shoots a grin your direction and heads over to his fridge. He pops it open and grabs a handful of berries as well as a bottle of tea. You look at all he grabbed as he sets everything on the table, and while drooling, run over to the stockpile. Rai pops the bottle open and pours the cap full of tea, puts it in front of you and completes your meal by rolling an oran berry your way. Without much thought you say thanks and dig in. The both of you eat, Rai eating every other berry except yours and chugging the tea. You, however, had finished your cap of tea and was halfway through the berry when you stopped. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYou finished?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYep.\u201d Rai reaches over and eats what\u2019s left of your berry. You look out the cave and notice the moonlight. <br>\r\n(Rai) (standing and stretching) \u201cWell it\u2019s about time to go to sleep wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d<br>\r\n(You) \u201cWell, with school tomorrow I guess so.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) (Giving you a hand to climb on) \u201cWell let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll set your bed up.\u201d <br>\r\nWith that, you climb up and head towards his room. He turns all the lights off along the way and walks into his room. He sets you on the little table, grabs some cloth, and organizes the cloth into a makeshift bed. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell there you go and can I ask you a question?\u201d<br>\r\n(you)  \u201cWell with all the questions I asked, I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d\t <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell I want to call you something, but saying James doesn\u2019t sound cool saying it <br>\r\nover and over again, so I had come up with a nickname and wanted to know if it would be okay if I called you by it.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cAs long as it ain\u2019t late for dinner, I think I\u2019ll be fine with it.\u201d <br>\r\nYou look at Rai laughing and nodding his head.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNo. I was thinking something more like Jay or Jai or something like that.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) Well I like that idea of being called Jai, \u2018Jai and Rai\u2019 or \u2018Rai and Jai\u2019, just if you would every now and then call me James please.\u201d <br>\r\nRai lays in his bed and shuts off the light on the table. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cCan do. Well night Jai.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cNight Rai.\u201d <br>\r\nAnd you fall asleep, thinking of all that\u2019s happened today and how you met someone just like you. In your thoughts, you say to yourself \u201cWow, somebody just like me and we act like we\u2019ve known each other for a while. I hope I didn\u2019t rub off on him in a bad way. I hope all the people at his school are as nice as he is. Maybe we can each help each other be more social. Well tomorrow is another day at a new school with pokemon. Hope for the best, expect the worst. I hope my family isn\u2019t too worried about me or anybody else. I\u2019d hate to start a search party for me, because if I don\u2019t know where I am, they sure won\u2019t find me. Well at least I know Rai will be with me, like an older brother.\u201d In the final moments before you sleep, you whisper to Rai thanks and drift off to sleep. Then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the next morning, but you were still asleep. You had a dream about your family and were on a completely different dream. You were in an area of complete shadow and in the far distance was a white light. Unsure of what it was, you walk towards it. But as you approached it, it too approached you, just at a quicker speed. It wasn\u2019t until it was probably thirty feet away that it made a sound. The sound struck fear in. It wasn\u2019t until it was probably thirty feet away that it made a sound. The sound struck fear in you as you realized what was heading your way; a freight train. Yet, when you knew it was too late and you would have been hit, if you wouldn\u2019t have woken up. You quickly arose in a cold sweat, breathing heavily. You look over at Rai\u2019s bed and notice he isn\u2019t there. \u201cI hope he didn\u2019t leave without me\u201d you say to yourself. Rai then walks in and looks your direction. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cGood morning James. Hey, you okay? You don\u2019t look so good\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cMorning Rai. I\u2019m alright, just had a bad wake up call.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cBad wake up call? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\nYou then explain to Rai your dream, about the eternal darkness and that little light.  <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell I don\u2019t know about the darkness or the light, but I gotta apologize for that sound.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell every morning I go down to the river for my wake up and while I\u2019m down there, I let loose my mighty cry and come back to my cave. That sound you heard was probably me. Sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I broke your usual routine and I that\u2019s not your fault. Anyways I\u2019m up and moving. I don\u2019t mean to be a bother but do you think you could go to the river again, this time with me, please?\u201d <br>\r\nHe walks closer to table and reaches out his hand.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt\u2019s not a bother. I like being by the water, anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) (puzzled) \u201cBut wait, you\u2019re a stee\u2026 never mind.\u201d<br>\r\nYou step up and Rai walks toward the exit, but after he gets out, his pace becomes slower and almost cautious.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Rai?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (whispering)\u201c Well, I don\u2019t think showing you off or letting anyone see is a good idea and I don\u2019t know where anybody is, so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good point. Glad you think of this stuff because I don\u2019t think I would\u201d<br>\r\nYou look at him as he grins and chuckles quietly. He finally stops at the river, kneels and stretches out his hand to let you off, and lays on the ground. You walk up to the river and notice the slow-flowing, crystal clear water and you turn around to face Rai.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cThis is amazing. The river is slow enough I can  get in and not have to worry about being carried away, for the most part at least. Thanks for bringing me\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNo problem, besides I feel like I owe you something for that rude awakening.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell, I should still say thanks and is the only reason you brought me because you woke me up?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (chuckling) \u201cNo, just thought this might make us a little more even.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell I don\u2019t care who\u2019s up or down, at least I know now. Why aren\u2019t you in a rush to get to school, aren\u2019t I slowing you down?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cActually I get up early every morning just in case something happens.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell that\u2019s a great plan. So will you get up even earlier tomorrow morning because of me?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cProbably and quit acting like you\u2019re a problem. You are somebody I can talk to without feeling too\u2026 different. So thanks.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cThanks back since you are taking care of me. Are we even?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cOnly with your consent.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cDeal we\u2019re even.\u201d <br>\r\nBoth of you smile until Rai breaks the silence.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYou hear something?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod and in a flash a large black and blue pokemon runs past at a distance.<br>\r\n(???) \u201cMorning Rai, wish I could talk, but I wanna keep going so I\u2019m early. (turning back) Come on Ryu.\u201d<br>\r\n(Ryu) (getting closer) \u201cComing Aura. Morning Rai\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (sitting up) \u201cMorning you two and see you both at school\u201d<br>\r\n(Ryu and Aura) \u201cSee you later.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd with that, they were gone, leaving Rai with a fearful expression.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Rai?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI\u2019m just hoping Aura didn\u2019t see you.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI don\u2019t mean to go against you, but my clothes blend in with the mountain and I\u2019m not exactly big enough to see at a distance.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI know you don\u2019t mean to be rude and I don\u2019t either, but did you take into account his ability to read auras?\u201d<br>\r\nYou then freeze up and wonder yourself. The two of you do nothing but breathe, until you break the silence.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell I guess we\u2019ll just hope for the best.\u201d <br>\r\nRai nods and you turn around, kneel, and splash the refreshing water on your face. You shake it off and walk up to Rai, who looks lost in thought. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cHey, it\u2019ll be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right, I guess when we get to school I\u2019m just going to have to avoid Aura.<br>\r\nRai shakes his head and you climb up him to his shoulder and pat his head. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cIf we want any chance for me to be safe, we\u2019re just going to have to play it safe and stay positive, otherwise we can\u2019t possibly succeed. Besides, if you want to talk to Aura, I can always hide out at your house until you get back.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cReally? You would stay back and do nothing just so I can talk to a few friends?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI came crashing down, literally, into your life and I\u2019d hate to ruin it.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cThanks. Well I\u2019d like to get to school early, so can we please get going?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) Yeah, of course. You still have authority here, so you make the choices.\u201d<br>\r\nRai stands up, making sure you don\u2019t fall off and begins walking back towards his cave.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cLet\u2019s fix your last statement: We make the choices, because you may notice or know something I don\u2019t and vice versa.\u201d <br>\r\nYou nod, but remain silent as he walks into the cave. Rai sets you on the kitchen table as he walks towards the back of his cave. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cSo I know I\u2019m going to school with you, but where I\u2019m going to hide?\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell I\u2019m not exactly the best hider, but I thought maybe you could hid in my school bag.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAs long as it\u2019s a safe place to hide, I\u2019m not gonna complain.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (walking back with a messenger bag slung on his shoulder) \u201cWell this thing holds all my stuff and it seems pretty spacey. It\u2019s the only bag that works well with me, plus it\u2019s comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI want a bag like that in my size, no lie.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell thanks for the praise, but it ain\u2019t that cool.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201c(raising a hand and pointer finger high in the air) FALSE. Well it\u2019s cool, end of discussion. Shouldn\u2019t we be heading to school?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah, hop in and try to get comfy, (opening the flap) it\u2019ll take a little bit.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cJust one question, do you ride a bus?\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNo, up here on the mountain we walk down because we are fairly close, just a downward hike.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cOkay and thanks for answering all my questions.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Somebody was going to answer them, so why not the guy you\u2019re staying with.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that, you smile at him, he smiles back, and you jump in the bag, moving things to get comfortable.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYou good and ready?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYup.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\nShutting the flap, you jerk back as he seems to be in a light jog (for someone his size anyway). Somewhere on the mountainside, you barely hear Rai whisper something to himself.<br>\r\n(Rai) (whispering and muffled) \u201cHopefully I don\u2019t rub him the wrong way. Also hoping I can keep James safe.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) (shouting so he can hear) \u201cYOU\u2019LL KEEP ME SAFE, I\u2019M SURE. BESIDES YOU\u2019RE DEFINITELY NOT IRRITATING AT ALL. I WAS MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOU BEING TIRED OF ME.\u201d<br>\r\nYou feel Rai stop completely and open his bag.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYou heard that!?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cBarely. And honestly, I\u2019m not tired of you at all. Why would I be, the only thing that might\u2019ve gotten to me was my wake up call, but that was just an awesome alarm clock.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI\u2019m not tired of you at all either but I can\u2019t be sure about the other way around. Everybody at school seems to get tired of me real quick.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI know what that\u2019s like, remember? We may look different but we act similar.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry, forget we are almost identical. Thanks for the reminder. Are you sure you\u2019ll be alright?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ll be fine and you\u2019ll do a great job. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore he closes the bag to get moving again, you see him smile and quietly say thanks. You smile back and watch as closes his bag. He takes off again, this time with a little more speed probably because you were being a friend, and you relax, hoping he was being honest about you not being a problem, but then knowing he was, otherwise you would be somewhere else right now. Then\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You notice there aren\u2019t any kids there yet, except for Rai, you, and presumably Ryu and Aura. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell I come early enough so nobody is here and I can get to my locker without having a small army in my way.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you there. So what do you do until class starts?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell I would usually go hang with Aura, but with you here, I\u2019ll go get my books and sit beneath a tree.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cOh\u2026 sorry for ruining your plans.\u201d<br>\r\nRai thinks about what you said, then realizes the error in what he said.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. What I meant is I sometimes go hang with Aura, but more often sit under a tree and today will be another day under the tree, just with you here.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cOkay. You had me feeling bad\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\nRai arrives at his locker, opens it, and opens the flap to the bag, letting the hallway lights shine in and letting you see out. Rai then pulls out a few pencils, an eraser, a pen and a few books. With great caution, he sets all the supplies in the bag without setting them on top of you. He looks at his locker to make sure he has everything, then shuts his locker. He looks down in the bag and shifts the books so he can see you.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAre you okay in there? I can always come back and get my books later if you aren\u2019t comfortable\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t trouble yourself too much over my well being. Besides these books make a little more cover so nobody can see me and your eraser is comfortable to lay on.\u201d<br>\r\nYou then lay back on it and look up at Rai. You notice he\u2019s chuckling and shaking his head. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWhatever you say boss. Just don\u2019t get mad if I knock you off because I need that eraser for class.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI doubt I will. You are the one who needs it and I am not in any position of power anyway. So if you need it, take it. Just one request.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah, what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cIf you can, please try not to throw me around or at least no too much. I don\u2019t know how long I can last being thrown around.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI\u2019ll try my best to keep you from flying around.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cThanks Rai.\u201d <br>\r\nYou smile up at him and he returns the smile.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, James. Well I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m going to go sit beneath a tree.\u201d <br>\r\nYou chuckle and nod. He then shuts the flap and appears to be heading outside. You get comfortable and listen to Rai say good morning to a few pokemon, always saying mister or misses before he said a name. You guessed they were teachers and listen to the variety in the voices. A little later, you hear a door open and eventually feel Rai stop and sit. You crawl through the gap in the bag and climb atop Rai, silently and carefully. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cI can see why you like sitting beneath trees. So calm and quiet. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAhhhh!\u201d (breathing heavy for a little bit then returning to normal.) I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but wasn\u2019t the agreement for you to come to school with me, but you stay in the bag for safety reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cSorry, you\u2019re right. I just wanted to get out and see what the world looked like in a more urban setting.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt\u2019s alright, just make sure you hurry your looking around up. All the kids come around this time and if they see you, you might as well as stay out of the bag and socialize.\u201d <br>\r\nYou lock up when he says socialize. You high tail it back to the bag and jump back in. You hear Rai laughing at your performance. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cYou know if our positions were switched, you would do the same thing.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI know that as well as you do, but they\u2019re not and I found it comical how quick you went back in the bag. (slight pause) Well it\u2019s a good thing you did when you did, because here\u2019s the bus now. If you wanna take a peek at the kids, go ahead. Just make sure you\u2019re in enough so they don\u2019t see you.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYes sir.\u201d<br>\r\nYou watch the vast variety of pokemon pour out of the bus and notice a few wave or say hi to Rai. Rai responds back with a grin and a hello.  You then notice a floatzel jump off the bus with a buizel, vaporeon, and milotic following it. You hear Rai call out to the floatzel, but either the floatzel didn\u2019t hear him or it ignored Rai. The vaporeon responds back to Rai. <br>\r\n(???) \u201cMorning Rai.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cMorning Shiki.\u201d<br>\r\nYou still are peeking out and notice the last off the kids walk into school. You wait until they are guaranteed not to see you and you walk out and get Rai\u2019s attention. He finally notices you and puts you his shoulder so you are hidden, just in case. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cWho was that floatzel and everybody else following him?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cThat was Jet, the buizel was his little brother Storm, the milotic was Miku, and as you already heard, the vaporeon was Shiki. They all stay in one house.\u201d<br>\r\n You nod and Rai stands up to stretch.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell time to go back in.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWhy? It\u2019s so nice out and I can be out of the bag here.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI know you like to be out of the bag and I can see why, but I gotta go back in the school.\u201d<br>\r\nHe reaches a hand up for you to climb on, and although you didn\u2019t want to, you climbed on so you could go back to the bag. Rai levels his hand with the gap and you slide down the side and land safely on the bottom.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell I hate to keep bothering you and being a pain in your side, but why do we have to back in the school?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell you\u2019re still not a bother, you\u2019re just new to this place and you\u2019re curious. I\u2019d be the same way if our roles were switched. Well, anyway, the reason we have to go back in is because\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201c\u2026The bells are about to ring for class to start.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cThat sounds like a good enough reason to go in.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI was hoping you would agree.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cCould you please answer just one more question before we go in?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cOf course. What is it?\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cAre you sure I\u2019m not as bother to you? I mean all I\u2019ve done is eat your food, make you my caretaker, and interfere with your plans.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI promise you are not an issue or hassle or any kind of problem. If you were, I would\u2019ve left you somewhere to fend for yourself. Besides, you\u2019re a friend like Aura. Aura has my back and although you two are different, you seem like you act the same. So thanks for being a friend and quit worrying about irritating me. I\u2019m fine as long as you are.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (brief pause) \u201cRai, thanks for everything.\u201d<br>\r\nRai opens the flap and reaches in for you. He holds you at eye level and grins. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Just promise you aren\u2019t going to be a jerk or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYes sir. I promise I won\u2019t be jerk as long as Rai isn\u2019t a jerk.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWe have a deal.\u201d<br>\r\nHe sets you back down in the bag carefully. Closing the flap, Rai walks towards the door and opens it. You feel the bag get hit a few times and you teeter for a little while each time, then regain your balance. You climb to the top of the bag and once again, scout out all the pokemon in the school. You stare in awe at all the pokemon, until your eye catches a lucario and floatzel talking by a locker. You feel Rai slow down a little bit, then get back to speed. You assume he too saw Aura and Jet talking. You keep your eye on the pair and see a shocked face appear on the floatzel, but you then lost them in the crowd. You notice Rai walk through a doorway and take a seat towards the back of the classroom. He sets the bag down flat on the desk and opens it, but leaves it open facing the front of the class. After adjusting to the shift, you move to a position where you can see out of the bag, but still remain in shadow so no one can see you. You look out for a teacher, but notice nobody except you and Rai are the only ones in the classroom. Rai spins the bag around and you fall over. He looks in the bag and you glare at him while laying on your side.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAre you alright? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (standing up) \u201cI\u2019m fine and it\u2019s alright. Just please try to be more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYes sir.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYou\u2019ve got more authority so you are the sir here and can I ask some more questions?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSure, fire away\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cThere is still about 5 minutes left, and nobody except for a few come in until about 2 minutes are left.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAlright, number 2. So why didn\u2019t you stop and talk to Jet and Aura? I felt you slow down, but then you just kept on moving.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell I was going to stop and ask Jet why he didn\u2019t reply but I didn\u2019t because he was talking and if Aura would\u2019ve sensed you, we would have had a major problem. Besides Aura and Jet are in this class, so although we aren\u2019t safe yet, we are a little bit better off and I can always ask Jet in here what happened.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to ask a few more questions, but I\u2019ve bothered you enough and I need to go back into hiding. See ya later.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNo you haven\u2019t. Though going back to hide is probably a good idea. See you after class.\u201d <br>\r\nRai closed the bag, carefully turned it so it could stand and you wouldn\u2019t fall, and set it back on the floor. You adjust again and sit down for a second and wait until you hear footsteps come walking through the door. As they walked by Rai\u2019s bag, your small size made their footsteps seem like miniature tremors. You tried to stay in one place, but with each step of theirs, you would occasionally lose your balance and take a few steps of your own. <br>\r\n(you) (thinking to yourself) \u201cGreat. Can barely stay in one place and these seem like the lighter pokemon. I would hate to see someone Rai\u2019s size walk by. Probably can\u2019t even get halfway up the bag before I fall back down, so no more scouting for now. Hmm\u2026 what to do during class. None of my usual luxuries, so I\u2019m going to have to improvise. Maybe Rai has something I can mess with during class. Gotta make sure I don\u2019t mess his stuff up too bad. I\u2019d hate to see him mad because I couldn\u2019t keep myself entertained without ruining his stuff.\u201d<br>\r\nYou wander through the bag and realize that not much light can get in. Trying your best to see with what light you had, you look at all his books and other things in his bag. You see a book that had a ringed binding, but couldn\u2019t tell what it said on it. There were a few folders and you remembered Rai had the notebook on the desk. You were on the side of the bag when you noticed another bag. You walk up to it and recognize what kind of bag it was: a brown paper bag. You then knew it held Rai\u2019s lunch and left it at that. Snooping through his lunch was both pointless and rude. Walking on someone\u2019s food didn\u2019t help it taste any better and you really weren\u2019t hungry. Although you didn\u2019t have breakfast, you usually didn\u2019t have breakfast and that wasn\u2019t an issue. You walk to the opposite end of the bag and notice a pencil and some paper. You check the paper to be sure it is unused and rip off a piece proportional to paper your size. Against your better judgment, you break the tip off the pencil and move to one corner. With part-pencil and some shred of paper, you start to draw and sketch things around you. You modeled the looks of being in the bag and attempted at drawing some pokemon. You drew all over the paper until no more room remained. Then you looked at all the drawings. You drew some cubes and other geometric figures and looked on them with pride as they seemed flawless, even though you know they weren\u2019t. But you then looked at your pokemon drawings and didn\u2019t feel as confident about them. On each, you seemed to notice one little flaw or two and that ruined your view of how good they looked. One spot was too big or small, or another spot seemed too long or short. Without an eraser, they could never be perfect. Regardless, you decided that they were good despite the flaws. Then exhaustion kicked in and you attempted at denying it. Eventually giving up, you set the paper shred and pencil tip off to the side and try to get comfy. <br>\r\n(you) (thinking to yourself) \u201cWell, everything is alright so far. Rai is an awesome guardian. Glad he was there to get me and not somebody cruel. I wonder if he really is alright with me being here. I\u2019d be surprised if he really is, since not many people will talk to me for very long. (sigh) I hope my family isn\u2019t worried about me or any of my friends. What am I saying, my friends probably won\u2019t even notice me being gone. They hardly ever noticed me before, almost like I was a ghost or something. I just wish I could be accepted and not be such an outcast. (chuckling) I\u2019m such a hypocrite, telling Rai to stay positive and here I am thinking negatively. We can\u2019t work well with each other unless we both follow through. Guess I need to try harder. Maybe Rai and I can both improve our social skills and not seem stuck up to everybody else. Grrr, there I go again with the negativity. I need my friends here; maybe they could help the both of us.\u201d (yawn)<br>\r\nYou started to feel more and more tired with each thought and you were about to fall asleep, when a bell rang. You decided that must be the bell for class to start. A few seconds later, just before you fell asleep, you hear one voice from the front of the class.<br>\r\n(teacher) \u201cGood morning class.\u201d<br>\r\n(entire class) \u201cGood morning Miss Blaze\u201d <br>\r\nYou chuckle as Rai\u2019s voice is the quietest and can barely be heard above everybody else\u2019s. You fall asleep and wake up\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He notices you walking over and puts down what he was reaching for. <br>\r\n(Rai) (whispering the whole time) \u201cNice to see you awake.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t have much to do and didn\u2019t want to destroy anything. Besides sleeping feels so nice.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell, at least someone enjoys my classes. Could you please duck down so I can get my books without smacking you and you still stay hidden?\u201d<br>\r\n(You) (taking a knee and dropping your head) \u201cYes sir.\u201d<br>\r\nRai reached in for the ringed book and you still can\u2019t see what\u2019s on it, this time because the top is face up. But while he is pulling out the book, a tip-less pencil rolls out and nearly trips you. Rai notices it, picks it up and examines it.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cUh-oh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWhat happened with this? I thought you said you didn\u2019t destroy anything.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (scratching the back of your head) \u201cUm\u2026 well\u2026 you see what had happened was I didn\u2019t immediately fall asleep and I decided that since there was unused paper and something I could write with, that maybe I could pass the time by drawing. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look up at Rai and notice a quiet laugh.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell, for one I found a use for broken pencil tips and two, it\u2019s comical how you couldn\u2019t wait for this class.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018wait for this class\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell you see, the class we are in now IS drawing class.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (falling over) \u201cWhat?! Oh come on, the one class I want to participate in and I can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (silently laughing) \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s how it goes. It\u2019s almost time for you to hide and me to set the bag down. But before you go back in, I just wanted to say a few things.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cAlright, so what are they?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell for both not being social, we sure talk to each other a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cMeh. For some reason, antisocial people tend to talk a lot with other antisocial people.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) (Grabbing the rest of his stuff) \u201cSorry for not getting you breakfast. I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Also should I let you sleep next time?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cIt\u2019s alright about breakfast. I usually don\u2019t eat anyway and unless it\u2019s necessary to wake me up, could you please let me sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, alright.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cThanks Rai. See you later\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAnytime James. See you after class.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWait, one more thing. Why don\u2019t you call me Jai?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201c I don\u2019t know. Just more natural to say James, I guess. Why, do you want to be called Jai?\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cNo, I just was curious. I really don\u2019t care.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAlright, after class sometime. See you then.\u201d<br>\r\nRai closed the bag and carefully set it down. Just in time too, because as soon as it was on the ground, some kids walked in to take their seats. A few more minutes passed and the rest of the class and the teacher had walked in. The bell rang and you took a peek at the teacher. It was a smeargle who stood in front of a large easel.<br>\r\n(Smeargle) \u201cGood morning class.\u201d<br>\r\n(entire class) \u201cGood morning Miss Sketch.\u201d<br>\r\nYou chuckle at Sketch being her last name and she was the drawing teacher. Regardless, you wanted to see the drawings and climbed to the top of the bag and sat on a book. <br>\r\n(Miss Sketch) \u201cOkay class today, we will continue on our drawings of Latios and Latias.\u201d<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped as you really wanted to draw them or at least learn a good technique of how to draw the pair. You tried to watch her lines as she drew them, but you were too far away and too small to see around Miss Sketch. All you could do was listen, but her saying \u201cnow continue this line to here\u201d or \u201cmake sure this section is proportional to this section\u201d really made staying awake pointless. Giving up on the lesson, you climbed down and found a comfortable place to sleep. You then woke up\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eventually you gave in and sat up. Looking around you saw daylight and a massive hand. You go up and walked over to the hand and shook it\u2026 or at least tried. You look up at Rai and he looks back down at you. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI know it\u2019s nice to catch a few z\u2019s, but it\u2019s time for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cSorry, but its way too hard to get up when you\u2019re happily asleep.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) (chuckling) \u201cI\u2019m with you there. Here\u2019s your lunch.\u201d<br>\r\nRai was handing you a berry, but he held it outside the bag. You look at the berry then up at his face, puzzled. He obviously understood what your concern was.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt\u2019s alright, you can come out. I\u2019m out in the middle of nowhere and nobody can see you from here.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want to be noticed or be trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will be alright.

He handed you your berry and you began wolfing it down. You noticed his lunch was a sandwich and juice. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cSo since we\u2019re safe to talk here, what did Jet say about this morning?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt was weird because neither Jet, nor Aura was in class and they\u2019re never absent.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cHuh, guess there is a first for everything.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI guess so. How was drawing from in the bag?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cIt was terrible. I\u2019ve been wanting to learn how to draw Latios and Latias for a while, but I could never see what she meant by \u2018drawing this line\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cThat sucks, here, tell me what you think of mine.\u201d<br>\r\nHe pulls his sketchpad out and opens to the page with drawings of the duo. You look at his book and envy his drawings. Then from a far table away, a few girls start laughing your direction. You crouch a little further so they can\u2019t see you guaranteed, but all Rai did was give a quiet, angry growl. You crouch even further down and put your hands over your head, unsure what Rai was going to do. He held his head down, folded up his sketchpad, and put it away. Fearful of what he may do, you do the only thing you can: praise Rai.<br>\r\n(you) (stuttering and fearfully) \u201cI e-envy t-t-those pictures. I w-wish I could d-d-draw   th-that we-well.\u201d<br>\r\nRai quieted his growl a little, but it was still there and enraged.<br>\r\n(Rai) (solid, quiet, and hateful) \u201cIn the bag.\u201d<br>\r\nWithout a second to breathe or think, you run all the way to the bag and jump inside. You crawl your way to the back and cower. Afraid of what might happen you organize Rai\u2019s things to make a barrier, though you knew it would be absolutely useless in any case. Cradling yourself, you eventually lay down and try to sleep. You hear a bell ring and feel Rai shut the bag and without a care, stand up and start walking. You were tossed around and felt a little pain after getting hit with the pencil. Unfortunately, you could only endure it because saying the wrong thing could be critical error. You were paralyzed with fear and had a headache, but managed to fall asleep. You...</span></div></div>",

You talked for a while until a different voice cut in. You were uncertain of what the person said, but Rai clearly heard as he seemed suddenly enraged with eyes glowing a bloody red. You tried getting his attention by talking to him, but your voice fell on deaf ears. Then the unexpected happened, Rai threw a punch to your chest. You embraced the hit and staggered backwards. You looked at your chest, noticing an imprint from Rai\u2019s fist, then you looked at Rai. Something seemed different about Rai then. It wasn\u2019t his anger, it wasn\u2019t his stance, but it was his height. You look at him and think he is continuously growing, but when an unknown shadowy figure floats by, you then realized that Rai wasn\u2019t growing, but you were shrinking. You stopped shrinking when you were about your normal height compared to Rai.  Still feeling intense pain from the previous hit, you drop to a knee and try to recover. Unsure of what came over Rai, you stand up and try talking to him. Again, your voice went unnoticed and see Rai cock his arm back, preparing to throw another punch. You roll out of the way and decided talking was useless. Rai just kept throwing punches, alternating arms. Finally, you trip and fall flat on your face. You look up at Rai as he throws what you expected to be his final punch. You instinctively drop your head and cover it. Then the punch arrived, hitting you, and recoiled back. You feel pain all over your body, and with your remaining strength, picked your head up, only in time to see Rai throw another punch. It again hits and again it hurts, but you start ignoring the punches and start worrying about the situation.<br>\r\n(you) (thinking to yourself) \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? That\u2019s the third hit and I\u2019m still alive! Why? And how am I not flat yet? It doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re crushing me but rather\u2026 bending me. But that\u2019s not possible, I break, not bend! (looking at your lower half and torso) AHHHH! I\u2019M BENDING! His punches hurt like crazy, but they aren\u2019t killing me.\u201d <br>\r\nRai throws one last punch and walks away, still red-eyed and angry. You try to stand up and notice your entire frame is bent. Then, as if on queue, you seem to return to your normal form, leaving only pain to reside in your body. But in the distance, a giant beam is heading your direction.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cGreat recover from one problem and another rushes to take its place. First the punches, now Hyper beam. I\u2019m really hoping this is only a dream and but what if that dying in a dream thing is true? I never proved it when I fell from the sky because that was real. At least I know when I wake up from a nap, I\u2019m not going to end up in another realm anymore.\u201d<br>\r\nFinally with Rai giving a battle cry, the beam reached you. You woke up in a cold sweat, breathing heavily. You look around and notice the bag is laying flat and open on a table. You cautiously walk out and look around to see Rai\u2019s cave. Looking towards the mouth of the cave, you see Rai walking out. He turned to his left and you saw an enraged face. Fearful of both your nightmare and Rai, you run to the edge of the table and slide down a leg. You sprint to Rai\u2019s room and seek refuge under the table by his bed. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cI hope I don\u2019t make Rai any angrier, but right now it\u2019s just too scary to be near him. I wonder if he\u2026<br>\r\nYou are cut off by what feels like earthquakes. The entire cave is shaking and you see little pebbles fall from the ceiling. You freeze and hear what sounds like Rai grunting in a somewhat rhythmic style. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can say anything, because it will just be us here, so nobody else can say anything.\u201d <br>\r\nYou quietly laughed to yourself as that wasn\u2019t completely true. But you didn\u2019t care what Rai said, if it was about you or somebody else.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell I guess what\u2019s getting to me is everybody talking trash about me behind my back. That and I feel like I\u2019m letting someone down.\u201d <br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cWho is this \u2018somebody\u2019?\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI\u2019d rather not say.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll respect that. So what about everybody seems to be getting to you now? I mean you know that they talk trash about you all the time, but what seems to be striking that chord now of all times?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell I think this \u2018person\u2019 will think I\u2019m pathetic and want nothing to do with me.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cMhm. I see what you\u2019re saying.\u201d<br>\r\nYour fear slowly turned to anger because Rai\u2019s acting like you\u2019re any different than he is. You only remember the conversation you had about your similarities. To make sure he knew you still existed, you picked up a loose pebble and walked to the doorway. Hiding along the side so Aura would not see you and with all your might, you threw the rock as high and far as you could, then quietly walked back to the table and took cover under it. You were safely under when the pebble hit the ground.<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cHuh? Must\u2019ve fallen from the ceiling.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cWell, I guess the only way to help would be to actually talk to the person and be sure.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah I guess. Thanks Aura. I\u2019ll see you later\u201d <br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cWhoa, who said I\u2019m going anywhere? As I recall, you told Ryu that next time, we could maybe eat with you and you don\u2019t look too busy, so how about it?\u201d<br>\r\nYou started laughing, trying not to let Aura hear you, but it was hard as you knew that Rai didn\u2019t really have a choice.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell, I guess you\u2019re right with me not being busy, so I guess so.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cIt\u2019s alright, we aren\u2019t going to talk trash about you to your face or behind your back. I\u2019m going to go get my brother, so I\u2019ll be a while. Try not to destroy the mountain while I\u2019m gone.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSince you asked so nicely, I guess I won\u2019t. See you in a bit.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that, Aura nodded and took off, leaving Rai at the table alone. He stood up and went over to the bag and began searching through it. As he did that you walked to doorway and just stood there, tapping your foot. He didn\u2019t seem to notice and you decided a whistle should get his attention. You whistle as loud as you can and watch as he slowly turns your way. He looked a bit ashamed and you run his way. You scurry up a chair and look up at him.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAnd you think you\u2019re pathetic? I\u2019m shorter than your pencils and about the same weight as your eraser. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re either pathetic or a failure. I\u2019m still alive and well so you aren\u2019t letting me down, and I\u2019m still here talking to you, because you aren\u2019t pathetic. The only person here that should be worried about being pathetic or a letdown is me.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAnd neither are you, so what made you think that way?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just not used to having others say good things and mean them.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cRegardless, we both need to seriously start thinking more on the brighter side. Agreed?\u201d (stretching out your hand)<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAgreed\u201d (completing the handshake with a claw)<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell you got guests that will be arriving soon and I\u2019m not invited, so could you please get me some dinner and I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell maybe I\u2019ll amend that dinner invitation to include you.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cPlease don\u2019t. I know you\u2019re not exactly social either, but I\u2019m at the disadvantage, socially, ability wise and size wise.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI won\u2019t. We both agreed on you staying hidden for as long as you can. One question though, where were you when you threw that pebble?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (chuckling) I was hiding behind the doorway. I was sure Aura was going to turn around and see me.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI did too. Sorry about earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cNot trying to be rude, but I think its best to talk about it when Aura and Ryu aren\u2019t coming here. Right now I need to go back to hiding and get some food for the hideout if you would please get me some.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cOf course I will.\u201d<br>\r\nHe turned around and went to his refrigerator. He pulled out a bottle of water and a berry.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI know I might be there a while, but I don\u2019t need a whole bottle of water.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (chuckling) \u201cJust be patient.\u201d<br>\r\nHe then opened it and drank a little over half of the water. Then he screwed the cap back on and picked you up, carrying the berry and bottle in one hand, and you in the other.<br>\r\nCrouching, he then puts the supplies under the table and you right next to them. He unscrews the bottle and sets the cap under the lip of the bottle.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cHere\u2019s the idea behind this; if you need water, push down on the top and water should come out in the cap and you sip out of the cap.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cAwesome. So when you\u2019re done chilling with Ryu and Aura, can I discuss the day with you?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSounds like a great plan. I probably should get out there; they will be here anytime soon, so I will see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI wish you the best of luck.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWait, before they get here, hold on.\u201d<br>\r\nRai runs back for his bag and sets it down by the table in his bedroom.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIn case you get bored. Just don\u2019t destroy anything.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAye aye.\u201d<br>\r\nRai walked out just as Aura and Ryu walked in.<br>\r\n(Ryu) \u201cHi Rai.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cHowdy Ryu.\u201d<br>\r\nRyu and Aura get settled down at the table and Rai gets food out and ready. He sets  the food down on the table, then heads back to the refrigerator for a few bottles of tea and sets those down on the table as well. With everything out and ready, Rai takes his seat next to Aura and across from Ryu. Both Ryu and Aura start talking to Rai, but Rai seems to only say a few things.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSorry, I guess I don\u2019t know how to keep a conversation going.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Nobody\u2019s perfect and you\u2019re no exception. We just need to eat dinner with you more often, right Ryu?\u201d<br>\r\n(Ryu) \u201cThat\u2019s right. How about again tomorrow night?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cI\u2019ll answer for him: no. He needs us around every once in awhile, not every night.\u201d<br>\r\n(Ryu) \u201cOkay. Just thought I\u2019d try.\u201d<br>\r\nThe meal went on with Rai saying a few things every once in awhile and Aura or Ryu replying. Rai seemed a little more joyful than earlier, and everything went along smoothly. You walked out towards the door with your half-eaten berry in hand. You look out at the trio, from behind the doorway, eating together and loneliness hits you. Enviously watching three friends sit and chat, no matter how social or antisocial the individuals are. You wanted to rush out there and join them, but you knew it would not be the same with you there. Sighing, you walk back to table and sit underneath it.<br>\r\n(you) (thinking to yourself) \u201cWish my friends were here. We would end up looking something like that. In a new world without many people you know sure does get lonely quick. At least I got Rai here with me. We may have just met, but he seems like a friend I knew from ages ago. I guess even though I don\u2019t have my friends here, I will always have Rai to hang out with. (chuckling) There, the first step to thinking positively.\u201d<br>\r\nYou look out at them again and they have gotten up from the table. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAnybody want to play?\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d<br>\r\nRai turns the television and the game system on. Aura picks up another controller and sits on the couch along with Rai, leaving Ryu on one of the recliners. You finish eating your berry and pour a capful of water. You sip the water and look around for something to do other than be jealous. You notice Rai\u2019s sketchpad and decide to look at those Latios and Latias drawings. You try pulling and pushing from any angle, but it was just too massive. You give up and walk out of the bag, hoping for a new activity to arise. Nothing else seemed accomplishable, so you walked towards the door, just in time to see Aura and Ryu leaving.<br>\r\n(Ryu) \u201cBye Rai.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cLater Ryu.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cAre you all right now?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cThanks to you, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cGood, see you tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSee you tomorrow and thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cAnytime Rai.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rai walked around, shutting off all the lights and walked back into his room.  He looks down at you and drops a hand to pick you up. You step up and he walks over to the table, sets you down on the surface, and reaches under the table to grab the water bottle. He caps it and sets it on the table with you. Rai then walks over to his bed and sits on it, staring at you.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell that was fun\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cIt sure looked that way\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell, I guess I owe you two apologies; one for school today and one for just now.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI accept the one for school, but you don\u2019t need to apologize for just now. The deal was I stay hidden, and sometimes that means I\u2019m gonna miss out. So what happened at school? I mean I heard why you got mad, but you seemed unbelievably irritated.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell those girls always laugh at me and today I guess with you there, I had to show I had power over someone, even if they didn\u2019t see it.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cTold you I was pathetic.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cOh come on I didn\u2019t mean it like that. I was angry and wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cI accept, I just was proving the point.\u201d<br>\r\nRai just shakes his head and shuts the light off. He lays down and while he is awake, you ask a question that had been eating you since you got home.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cHey Rai?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWould you ever intentionally hurt me?\u201d<br>\r\nYou hear him rapidly sit up and turn on the light.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWould you ever intentionally hurt me?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNo. What made you ask that? I\u2019ve not hurt you yet, have I?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell today a pencil hit me, but that was during your rage\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cOh, sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cIt\u2019s alright, but the reason I ask was because I had a nightmare that involved the both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (curiously) \u201cCould you tell me about it?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t make fun of me or make a fist.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (puzzled) \u201cI promise.\u201d<br>\r\nYou took a few breaths and prepared yourself to relive the nightmare. You then started at the beginning and went on to tell about him beating the life out of you. Throughout the story, you would occasionally look up see Rai with a shocked, yet curious face. You end on the note of the hyper beam and he seems unsatisfied.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSo what happened after that?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201c I woke up and ran to your room, just before you started beating on your walls.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAnd that just made it worse, right?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cOh boy. I\u2019m just surprised that after all that you\u2019re still talking to me.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cIt was pretty scary, but I thought about the old you and hoped you wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI promise I won\u2019t. We should be getting to sleep. Sleep well and if you have any nightmares, don\u2019t be afraid to wake me up and discuss them.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cNo offense, but I\u2019m not afraid of what you will do if I woke you up. It\u2019s the trying to wake you up part that scares me.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cOh\u2026 that is a good point. Here, (opens the bottle and pours it in the cap) splash me with this and that oughta do the trick.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cOkay, if you say so. Thanks and see you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAnytime and remember, early wake up tomorrow. See you then.\u201d<br>\r\nHe reaches over and shuts the light off. You lay awake for a little while and, with a grin, drift off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up the next morning to an entire hand rolling you a bit. You get up and see Rai staring down at you. You felt a little groggy, but you always felt a little groggy, but that never seemed to stop you before. He smiles down at you and you stand up and stretch.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cMorning James.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cGood morning Rai.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYou didn\u2019t splash me last night, so I assume you were alright.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYeah, nothing wrong. How about you?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI slept great. Well I woke you up a little earlier so we could get to the river before Aura sees us and we could get some breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cThat sounds great. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNo problem. Well let\u2019s get going.\u201d<br>\r\nHe reaches out his hand and you step on, but drop to a knee because you weren\u2019t feeling too stable. Rai slowly walks down to the river and sets you down by it. You and Rai were in perfect sync as you both crouch down and splash water on your faces and shook it off. Rai\u2019s eyes snapped open. He stood up and gave his cry, booming all over the mountain. You liked everything about it except for how loud it was, and decided to try and counter it with a shout of your own. He stops and looks down at you, puzzled.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell since I\u2019m awake this time,  I thought I would try and beat you with a good morning cry of my own. What\u2019d you think?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be a dream crusher, but you lost without a doubt.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (snapping) \u201cDarn, and I thought I had you beat by a mile.\u201d<br>\r\nRai just chuckled and reached a hand out. You climbed up and he walked back to his cave, then to the table. He set you down, then walked over to the fridge and grabbed breakfast. Breakfast consisted of what looked to be a rawst berry and milk. He poured some milk in a lid and set the berry in front of you. You look at his little pile of berries and hearty glass of milk. You start eating a little before he does and soon had finished everything. He finished a little before you, but you were full and he probably wasn\u2019t even close. You watch as he goes to his room, then returns with his bag. He looks around through his bag, but seems unsatisfied at finding nothing.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYou didn\u2019t draw last night. Then how did you keep yourself entertained?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell I wanted to look at your Latios and Latias drawings since I didn\u2019t get to see them at lunch, but I couldn\u2019t move the sketchpad nor open it.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI\u2019ll show you them after school today, deal?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cDeal.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) Well let\u2019s be off to school then.\u201d<br>\r\nHe threw the bag over his shoulder and set you inside. He shut the flap and was off to school. A little while later, you arrive at school and pretty much repeat yesterday morning: Rai goes to his locker and gets his stuff, teachers and students saying hi, and you tottering around the bag as students walked by. This time was different though, during the first class, both Aura and Jet were there, and Jet had a bandana on. You slept through every morning class, except art, which you once again failed to learn any new drawing techniques. At lunch, Rai woke you up and you climb up to his shoulder to eat your lunch. The two of you both enjoy your lunch, until those girls from yesterday start laughing at Rai again.<br>\r\n(you) (nervous) \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just stay calm.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (drops his head, then whispers) \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019m fine. After you explained that nightmare and told me how afraid you were, I realize that nobody gains anything by me getting angry, so relax.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (sighing in relief) \u201cGood, had me a little nervous there. Do you think you could get me a little tea, please?\u201d<br>\r\nRai picks the bottle up and drinks a little, but then \u201caccidentally\u201d slips it from his mouth and pours just a little your way. Most of it landed in your mouth, but the rest splashed your face.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not trying to prove you have power over me again?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNo. The reason I did it like that was because any other way would have looked suspicious.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAh, touch\u00e9.\u201d<br>\r\nRai finished his lunch and so did you. You look around for anyone, then run down Rai to get to the bag. He just shakes his head and chuckles. He stands up, shuts the bag, and walks to class since the bell just rang. You sleep through all of the classes again and you wake up shortly after the final bell has rung. You move to the top of the bag and look out as the entire hallway is empty, except for the two of you and an ariados. You figured he was just another student, but as he got close to Rai, you noticed Rai seemed to get a little tense. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWhat do you want Jared?\u201d<br>\r\n(Jared) \u201cYou know what I want.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNo, I really don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n(Jared) \u201cI know you have a commit child, so hand him over!\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI really don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n(Jared) \u201cSo you wanna play dumb, huh? Fine. Then after I destroy you, he will be mine!\u201d<br>\r\nJared charges at Rai and Rai throws his bag aside and the two fight each other. You were thrown around, but luckily landed safely after the bag hit the floor. You could look out of the bag and watch the two fight, Rai scoring a hit, then Jared landing one, but you didn\u2019t want to see Rai take too many hits, so you step back from the opening and sit down and think.<br>\r\n(you) (thinking) \u201cHow did he know I was here? And why did he call me a commit child?<br>\r\nBetter yet, what is a commit child? I wonder if Rai knows. (sighing) I hope he wins. I don\u2019t think all would be well if Jared wins. I just wish there was something I could do. Rai\u2019s fighting for me out there and all I\u2019m doing is sitting here watching him like it\u2019s all just a movie.\u201d<br>\r\nYou crawl back towards the opening, frustrated, and all you see is Rai moving slowly and taking multiple hits. He eventually backed out of sight and a large thud could be heard and felt. <br>\r\n(Jared) (tired) \u201cNow hand him over!\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) (near fainting) \u201cN-n-never. I\u2019ll never l-let you t-take him.\u201d<br>\r\n(Jared) \u201cVery well then, weakling.\u201d<br>\r\nJared looked like he was about to prepare another attack, one to finish Rai off. You were afraid to lose Rai, because in your eyes, he was just a huge, steel brother. Without second thoughts or regrets, you ran out of the bag towards the ariados. The ariados stopped whatever attack it had prepared and now focused on you. <br>\r\n(Rai) (weakly saying) \u201cNooo!\u201d<br>\r\n(Jared) (exhausted) \u201cThat\u2019s right, come to me!\u201d <br>\r\n(you) (filled with hatred) \u201cOh I\u2019ll come to you alright. Just with a little surprise!\u201d<br>\r\nYou ran full force towards him, never looking back at your fallen comrade Rai. You just ran with both fists clenched tight. You were near him and you closed your eyes. You felt him use String Shot, but it didn\u2019t affect you at all. You heard him gasp, but somehow it didn\u2019t affect you at all. You heard him gasp, but all you felt was a thirst for vengeance and a strange, growing sense of solidity. You jump and with all your might, throw an uppercut. You jumped in air and after what felt like minutes, you felt your fist connect with the underside of his head. You expected to not do much damage, but after you landed, you opened your eyes to see Jared a few inches back from where he was, upside down. You walk over to him and noticed he\u2019s fainted. You walk back towards Rai and notice he\u2019s got a used potion in his hands. He puts it back in his bag and notices you walking towards him. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cHow did you do that?!\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (breathing heavily) \u201cI really don\u2019t kno\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nAll of sudden you felt completely exhausted and collapsed.

Sitting up and looking around, you notice Rai is nowhere in sight and you start to wonder where he could be. Unsure of what happened, you stand up and see that you were laying on cloths on the kitchen table. You stood there motionless and silent until you heard someone mumbling. It came from Rai\u2019s room and you climb down the table. Walking as stealthily as possible, you make your way to Rai\u2019s room and peer around the doorway. Rai was mumbling as he sat on the edge of his. He had his head down and didn\u2019t move an inch. You walk over to him and look up at his face. He looks unhappy, but doesn\u2019t notice you at all. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cHey Rai.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (trance-like state) \u201cJames is hurt because of me. I should have protected him at all costs.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cHey, I\u2019m fine. See?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cHe trusted me to protect him, but I failed.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cRai, I\u2019m perfectly fine. You haven\u2019t failed yet.\u201d<br>\r\nRai just sat there, motionless, and started to cry with a mixture of sadness and anger. You just watched and stepped back a bit. You looked at yourself, then pinched yourself in order to be sure you weren\u2019t dead or something. You felt the pinch and just looked up at Rai. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cRai it\u2019s alright. Rai. Rai. RAI!!!!\u201d<br>\r\nHe remained motionless. Unsure of what else to do, you felt you had no choice other than try and shake him for attention. You walk over to his leg and shake it, first soft, then progressively rougher. You step and think of something when you trip over a pebble. You pick it up and throw it as hard as you can at Rai\u2019s face. It hits his lower jaw, but doesn\u2019t seem to have done anything. You all of a sudden feel weak, not physically, but more because anything you tried failed. With all but one idea gone, you decide to put it effect no matter how useless: hit Rai until he noticed you. With all the anger coursing through you, you cocked your arm back, shouted to Rai one last time, and threw your punch. But before your fist connected with Rai\u2019s foot, you felt a strange sensation. It felt familiar: it was the same sensation you had before you hit Jared back at school. You felt solid and undefeatable. Your fist finally hit and the pain you had expected to follow never came. Rather, your fist stayed locked at Rai\u2019s foot and even made the foot move a few inches.  You fell to a knee and started to breathe heavily due to the power you put in the punch. Rai almost instantaneously snapped back to life and looked around. He notices you on the ground near his foot and gasps. You look up to meet his surprised expression.<br>\r\n(you) (still breathing heavily) \u201cIt\u2019s.. nice to see.. you awake and well. And.. just so you know.. I\u2019m perfectly fine.. because of you.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cBut you passed out in the school because I let Jared take me down. And you got hurt because of that.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cMaybe, but without you there, I never could have fought him off alone. Plus, you took me back here to your home to recover. So all is well and good.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIf you say you\u2019re fine then I guess your fine. Ok, so I got a few questions, but one at a time. One how did you wake me up? When I\u2019m in a trance stage like that, it\u2019s almost impossible to wake me up.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYeah I noticed how hard it is. I tried a bunch of different things, but I finally punched your foot and you woke up.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (puzzled) \u201cHuh, that\u2019s strange, no offense, but you don\u2019t seem strong enough to wake me up with a punch.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I know what you\u2019re saying and I agree, but I did it to Jared and now to you.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSpeaking of Jared, I noticed something strange about you when you hit him. While you were running over to him, you looked like you were made of metal. How did you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWhat? But I can\u2019t change to being made of metal. Are you sure you\u2019re alright?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI used potions before we left to come back here and I know that\u2019s what I saw.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell I can\u2019t answer your question because I honestly don\u2019t have a clue as to what you are talking about. The only thing I know that happened was I closed my eyes, I felt different, then hit Jared.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI believe you, even though it\u2019s hard to believe. Final questions: what did Jared mean when he said you were a commit child?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cOh boy, well I hate to sound stupid, but I don\u2019t have an answer for that question. I was going to ask you about the commit child thing.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cDang, no answers for the questions I\u2019d like answered.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cSorry\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) It\u2019s alright, I was just hoping you knew. I wish somebody could tell me about the commit child thing without bringing harm to either of us.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n(???) \u201cI can tell you and I\u2019m not going to hurt either of you.\u201d<br>\r\nBoth you and Rai turn to look at the doorway to his room and saw\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She floated closer to you, but you backed off a little. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cH-hello miss Mew.\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cHi. Just call me Mew. What\u2019s your name?\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI\u2019m Rai and this (pointing at you) is James.\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cHi James.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cH-h-h-hi\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Meowth got your tongue?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt\u2019s just that neither of us really talk much to others. You\u2019re the first person he\u2019s met other than me.\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cAww. It\u2019s okay, I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\nShe comes real close to you and, in response; you cower a bit and close your eyes. You open your eyes once you feel your head being gently petted. <br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cSee that\u2019s not so bad, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI guess not. Thank you.\u201d <br>\r\nSee just smiles and floats back, looping every once and awhile.<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but you said you could answer my question.\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cYou asked about the commit children. Lucky you, I have the answer.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAwesome, but you said commit children, so there\u2019s more than one?\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cYes. If you\u2019ll listen to my story, I can explain.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI\u2019ll listen, how about you James?\u201d<br>\r\nYou just nod and climb up Rai to sit on his shoulder so Mew was really only talking in one direction rather than two. <br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cWell, to make sense, I have to tell you the history behind the commit children. Around 400 years ago, a race known as the night crawlers waged war against the island. Day and night, they would come to the island, destroying everything in sight and leaving everyone amongst ruins and chaos. Just when we neared complete destruction and all hope seemed lost, 9 heroes emerged to fight the monsters. These heroes were the Heroes of Joy, Sorrow, Rage, Peace, Courage, Wisdom, Willpower, Light, and Darkness. All pokemon who saw them fight were envious, envious of their strengths and abilities, ones nobody except the heroes possessed. Eventually all the monsters were slain, for a time, and peace returned to Emerald Island. Yet, the monsters would show up now and then, and the heroes were there to defeat them. Then one day a monster, larger than any night crawler, came to the island. The monster became known as the destroyer, due to the fact that the island would cease to exist with one swing of its claw. The 9 heroes confronted the monster in battle, but it was too strong for them to defeat. Finally, with hope dwindling, the heroes combined themselves into one and defeated the monster. Though the monster was not physically there, an essence of the monster remained. The heroes took the essence to a secret island and sealed it away behind an indestructible barrier. With the world at peace once again, the heroes left, never to return. But before they left, they sent an essence of themselves to another dimension to seek out a successor. The successors of these heroes are known as Commit Children and have the hero\u2019s amazing powers. The heroes also had a color that identified which commit child inherited which hero\u2019s powers. Red: the Hero of Rage. Blue: the Hero of Sorrow. Green: the Hero of Peace. Yellow: the Hero of Joy. Black: the Hero of Darkness. White: the Hero of Light. Grey: the Hero of Willpower. Purple: the Hero of Wisdom. And Orange: the Hero of Courage. We have never needed to call upon them because of the peace\u2026 until now.\u201d<br>\r\nMew finished and just floated in one place before you opened your mouth.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cSo I am a commit child?\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t think I have what it takes.\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cOf course you have what it takes. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI guess, if you say so.\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, trust me. Any more questions?\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah. How does James use these powers?\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cI wish I could answer that, but I\u2019m not really sure. I guess he is going to either need help from the Hero of Willpower or figure it out on his own. Sorry I couldn\u2019t answer that.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Thanks Mew.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYes. Thanks a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n(Mew) \u201cAnytime. See you guys later.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that Mew was vanished and you and Rai sat there, thinking about your situation. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSo that\u2019s what a commit child is. Great, you\u2019re so important and I have to try and protect you. I\u2019m gonna screw it up.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cNo you won\u2019t. You\u2019ve done great so far.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAnd what about at school? You passed out because I couldn\u2019t beat Jared.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cThe only reason I passed out is because I ran out of the bag and I punched Jared. You didn\u2019t mess anything up. So what, he got you once. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I wouldn\u2019t have beaten him without your help weakening him.\u201d<br>\r\nRai just sat there and thought about the whole commit child thing, then a thought crossed his mind. <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cMew said there were 9 heroes, right? That means there are 8 others, excluding you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou gave him a look that showed you understood what he meant and the two of you talked about it, until your stomach growled.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI\u2019m kind of hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSo am I. Let\u2019s go get some food.\u201d<br>\r\nHe walks in to the kitchen, with you on his shoulder, and puts you down on the table, and makes his way to the refrigerator. He grabs the usual and spreads out both his meal and yours. Before long, you both finished and made your way back to the bedroom. He sets you down on the table ad he lays down in his bed. With an exchange of goodnights, you both fall asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stood in your dream with everybody before you woke up. You looked out the doorway, expecting to see sunlight. All you saw was moonlight and you laid back down. Sleep didn\u2019t come as easily this time. You eventually looked over at a sleeping Rai, then climbed down the table. You walk out of the cave without a care in the world and stop when you got to the river. You sat down by the waters edge and just sat down, looking at the beautiful reflection of the moon on the crystal clear water. <br>\r\n(you) (thinking to yourself) \u201cBeautiful night tonight. Let\u2019s hope no one else is awake to come out and admire it. Of course if they do, I can always use these powers for my defense. These powers\u2026 why do I have them? This \u201cHero of Willpower\u201d must have made a mistake and picked me instead. Yea because I can\u2019t be the true successor, I\u2019m not strong enough, nor good enough to wield them. Maybe tomorrow I\u2019ll wake up to find out I\u2019ve just been dreaming. Just one crazy, long\u2026realistic dream. Who am I kidding, everything here is real. This world, Rai, these powers, everything. I just hope I can fill the hero\u2019s shoes and accomplish what I need to. I wonder if all the other commit children are like me. Hope I don\u2019t let them down either, whoever they are. Great. between them and Rai, I\u2019ve got so much to live up to. Knowing my luck, they\u2019ll think I\u2019m a stuck up jerk if we ever meet each other. So much stuff in so little time. Well tomorrow is a new day, maybe it\u2019ll be a good day. Tomorrow, I work on mastering these powers and helping Rai rather than slowing him down. Probably should be getting to bed.\u201d<br>\r\nYou sat outside a little longer, occasionally reaching in for a little drink. Finally, you got up and went back to the cave. You walked in to Rai\u2019s room and climbed back on the table. You laid in bed, but sat back up when Rai said something. You looked over at him, but all he did was mumble as he tossed and turned. You breathe out a deep breath and lay back down. <br>\r\n(you) (somewhat quietly) \u201cRai, I will help as much as I can and try not to let you down. I promise I will do my best and together, we will both be somebodies. Thank you Rai, you\u2019re an awesome friend, even though you\u2019re more like a brother to me. Good night and again, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou fell back to sleep and slept well until\u2026</span></div></div>",

You thought about your powers and decided to see if you still had them. Not wanting to damage anything, you make a fist and focus on it becoming solid. That sensation flowed through you again and soon your hand looked metallic. You broke your concentration and the feeling as well as the metallic look went away, leaving your hand normal. You stood there, unsure of why you hadn\u2019t passed out yet. You decided it was because of how little you did it. You heard something stirring and looked over to see Rai getting up.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cMorning Rai.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWhoa you\u2019re up already.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cI just got up.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAh, I see.

Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cRight back at ya.\u201d<br>\r\nRai got out of bed and opened a hand for you to climb on. You reluctantly step up and the two of you head to the river. Both of you splash water on your faces and open your eyes. You waited for Rai to shout, but it never came. He reached out a hand and you step on. You wanted to ask Rai what\u2019s the matter, but didn\u2019t for no particular reason. He got breakfast ready and set it down on the table. You were about to bite into your berry when you stopped and looked at him.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cHey Rai.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI hope you don\u2019t me asking, but what\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cHm?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell every morning since I\u2019ve been here, you go to the river, shout, then come back. But this morning you didn\u2019t and that kinda makes me concerned.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cWell last night I had a dream that with your new powers, you didn\u2019t need me and you left. I woke up and looked over at your bed and you were gone, so I thought you had left. Then when you were here this morning, I wasn\u2019t and I\u2019m still not sure what to think.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cOh, I see. Just so you know, I don\u2019t plan on leaving unless there\u2019s a good enough reason. I left last night to go and think about all that\u2019s happened so far. I was just standing down by the river, thinking about my world, and this world. Besides I think we\u2019re almost brothers, so I couldn\u2019t leave.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cCool. Well thanks.\u201d<br>\r\nBoth of you finish your breakfast, but each a little more cheerful than before. Soon, Rai has his bag over his shoulder and you slide in. He makes his way to school and the morning repeats itself again. Later in the classroom you wait for the kids to start piling in and shaking you around. Then it hit you, they can\u2019t shake you if you\u2019re made of metal. You wait for the last moment and let that solid feeling come over. The kids walk by, but you didn\u2019t move at all. You let go after they had all passed and soon you return to normal. But not long afterwards, you pass out again. Time passes by and you wake up, still in the same class. Shaking it off, you stand up and think of what else you can work on. Then for, some odd reason you feel tired and since you already did a bit of training, you give in and fall asleep. You start dreaming about\u2026</span></div></div>",

Unsure of what happened to the rest of Emerald Island, you look towards the mountain\u2019s peak. Then you hear a \u201chello\u201d come from behind and you turn around.

All the rocks hit the partially destroyed beams and break apart, and the bars are left bent or in pieces.<br>\r\n(essence) \u201cThe reason I chose you is because of your willpower. The beams up there represent peoples\u2019 wills. The two flat pieces represent their determination to help others with their goals and the center part represents the determination for their own goals. The rocks represent obstacles. As you can see, every beam had a part disintegrate, representing them either losing sight of their goals or losing caring for others\u2019 goals. With the loss of one part, all the other goals suffered because they lost sight of a single goal, either their own or somebody else\u2019s. But you, (one beam pops out alone and a rock rolls towards it) you remain solid and keep everyone\u2019s goals in your mind, even your own. (the rock hits the beam and the beam doesn\u2019t move) Even though you have obstacles, some more challenging than others, you stay strong and remain determined to accomplish both yours and others\u2019 goals. (lone steel beam bends in crazy or impossible ways)  Sometimes you also bend to others needs, even if it put your goals at stake. You still keep them all in your mind and never lose sight of them. (both rocks and other beams come flying towards the single beam and a cloud of dust forms) And even though once and while these obstacles bring you down, whether other people or more natural problems, (the cloud clears and the beam is bent all the way down, then slowly returns perfectly upright) you always come back, determined to finish the task at hand, no matter how much you\u2019re brought down. You never lose sight of the goals and never give in until they\u2019re done. That is why I chose you.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI understand, but I still don\u2019t think I\u2019m the one you need. There must be others who are better than me\u201d<br>\r\n(essence) \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe and I don\u2019t question your doubt, but you are my successor. I\u2019ve made no mistake in choosing you. You must believe me. Believe in yourself more. You are more than capable of wielding my powers and bearing my burden.\u201d <br>\r\nThe flame starts to brighten, then slowly dulls.<br>\r\n(essence) \u201cJust believe in yourself. I know you will be great.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI believe you and thank you.\u201d<br>\r\nThe flame almost had a smile before it completely faded out, leaving you on the mountain alone. You expected this be the part where you wake up, but you were still there. You went up to the lone beam still standing and touched it. It seemed solid, yet almost seemed to move when you touched it. You imagined it bending all the way down and then, as if on queue, it did. A little puzzled, you imagined it standing straight up and it did. You kept thinking of it moving in various ways, and whatever you thought, it did. You decided that when you woke up, you had to try this out. You walk back down to \u201cRai\u2019s\u201d cave and looked around at it. It was pretty nice when you were the size it was meant for. You try everything in Rai\u2019s cave, from his bed to the water, then you saw his TV and game system. \u201cYes\u201d you said to yourself and turned on both the system and the TV. But then you woke up in\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up and looked around, seeing only the open end of the bag and a berry. You slowly walk towards the berry, and look out of the bag, but don\u2019t see Rai anywhere. You peek around the side of the bag and see Rai talking to some other pokemon. You weren\u2019t sure what they were talking about, but by the look on Rai\u2019s face, it wasn\u2019t good. Then out of nowhere, berries are getting launched towards Rai by those same pokemon that were talking to him. They splash all over him and some of the juice gets in his eyes. You watch as he struggles to wipe it out, but can\u2019t as the other berries stop him from doing so. Anger swells within and swiftly courses through your veins. Then memories of these kinds of things happening to you re-emerge and fueled your rage. Eventually deciding this was complete and utter madness, you looked for a way to help him without being seen. You noticed everyone throwing something was sitting on metal chairs. Feeling the need for payback and some more practice with your powers, you step out of the bag, staying close to it so you remain hidden, and close your eyes. You focus on the chairs melting beneath them, pooling together, and forming a creature. You made the monster similar to a werewolf, as tall as Rai, made entirely of metal, and with spikes extruding from its back. You open your eyes for a second to see this creation form, then close your eyes to take control of it. Then, rather than just see the creature, you feel like you are the creature. Your sight becomes what it would see, you feel what it would feel, and for however long you could last, this monster and you were one. A few screams and gasps are heard, but you stay focused on the task at hand. You glare down at Rai\u2019s aggressors. Looks of fear cross their faces, but they otherwise remain motionless. <br>\r\n(Purugly) \u201cW-w-who are you and wh-where did you come from?\u201d<br>\r\n(you/creature) \u201cI have no name. I was forged from the pain and anguish of those you\u2019ve harmed. Now their marks have left me a form which cannot be destroyed, like the scars you\u2019ve inflicted on their mental minds or their bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n(Houndoom) \u201cIndestrucible? Yeah right.\u201d <br>\r\nHoundooom readies a fireball and fires it at you. It hits your abdominal region. Surprisingly, you don\u2019t feel any pain, but you notice it melted part of your creation. Soon, the metal melts back and fixes your hole like there was never one there. Everybody gasps again and stands there, paralyzed with fear. You just grin, but it was soon replaced by a stern face. <br>\r\n(you/creature) \u201cAs you can see, I am unharmed. Now I offer you a warning: do not harm this Aggron or anyone else anymore, lest you wish to be harmed yourselves.\u201d <br>\r\n(Houndoom) \u201cTalk is cheap!\u201d<br>\r\nHe readies another fireball and lets it go. This time it hits your face. Your face amazingly didn\u2019t melt, but your blood was brought to an even higher boil. Rather than just say something and have them not listen, you remembered that actions speak louder than words. You ready a fist and throw it at the Houndoom\u2019s chest. He gets sent flying back and lands on the ground, unconscious. Everybody in the lunch area turned to see him lying there. You look out amongst all the pokemon, secretly surprised to see so many different kinds, even though they weren\u2019t truly seeing you. They quickly went back to eating lunch and tried hard not to look. You turned your eyes back to your intended audience.<br>\r\n(you/creature) \u201cI said it once and made an example. Now I will repeat myself: Do not harm anybody anymore or you will end up like him. Farewell. (Turn around to Rai) Do not allow them to harm you anymore. Let them fear you, not the other way around.\u201d <br>\r\nThey all nod and try to say goodbye, but are still too afraid to utter a sound. Even Rai was afraid, even though you were about equal in strength as he was. Thinking you are about to pass out from exhaustion, you melt the creature back into the chairs they originally were, walk back in the bag, and pick up the berry. You had just taken a bite out of it when things started to go black. You drop the berry and fall on your side. The last thing you remember thinking was that your mission had been accomplished and you did have the ability to warp other metals. You passed out and later woke up\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slowly woke up and looked around. You noticed your unfinished lunch was on top of you and Rai was back in class. You picked the berry up and slowly ate it. You couldn\u2019t tell what they were talking about in class, but you really didn\u2019t care. After finishing the berry, you start thinking about how to train next and a thought crossed your mind: If you could become made of metal and could manipulate metal, could you manipulate your body to change shape? You start to turn your hand to steel, then imagine it being a hammer. It slowly gains the head and claw. You change it into a mace and then a sword. Finally, you change your hand back to normal and relax. Sitting there, you start to wonder about all the other commit children. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cI wonder who all the other commit children are. I hope they\u2019re people I know or at least people I can get along with. All of us humans, in a world bigger than any of us, supposed to stop some evil force. Impossible. Mew said all nine of us have a power only for us and that they were inherited from the 9 Heroes. They were normal sized pokemon, not micro humans.\u201d <br>\r\nYou thought you heard the Hero of Willpower say something and you feel the chills. You decided it was time to keep working on mastering your powers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went smoothly and soon, school was out. Rai was at his locker and you were peeking out of the bag. Nobody was there except you, Rai, and\u2026 Aura! You duck back in and think of what you can do to stay secret. You couldn\u2019t outrun him and nowhere was safe to hide. You began to panic when you started to feel strange, yet familiar. You remember you can change your shape. You turn to complete metal and think of a form you can take on that arouses the least suspicions. The only one that came to mind was your creation from lunch and soon, the monster is once again a part of you and you a part of him. You stand in a position that resembled an action figure. You stay perfectly still as Aura and Rai begin to talk. <br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cHey Rai.\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cHi Aura.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAlright. How about you?\u201d <br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cGreat. Can I ask you two questions?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cFire away.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cWell I wanted to know if you wanted to come over for dinner. I\u2019m having dinner with some other friends and thought maybe you\u2019d like to join.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (depressed) \u201cNot tonight, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cYeah it\u2019s alright. Anytime you want to come over or talk, just come see me.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAlright, thanks. Didn\u2019t you say you had two questions?\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cYes. I hope you don\u2019t mind me asking, but what\u2019s hiding in your bag?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cW-what are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cRai, I\u2019ve been seeing an aura other than yours all day and it\u2019s been coming from your bag. You can show me Rai, I won\u2019t hurt it.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (defeated) \u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\nRai opens the bag and starts searching through it. He keeps looking until he sees you, but looks surprised when he notices your form. Nonetheless, he picks you up and hands you over to Aura. Aura looks surprised as he examines you. You remain frozen and without a single emotion, as this would change your aura. <br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cRai, this is what you\u2019ve had in your bag all day? It looks just like that thing from lunch. Did you make both of them?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI didn\u2019t make either of them. I don\u2019t know how this got in my bag.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cRai\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cAura, I swear I didn\u2019t. You\u2019ve got to believe me. I had juice in my eyes during lunch and when I could see again, the monster had already taken out Marcus [the Houndoom]. I don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s is supposed to be.\u201d<br>\r\nAura just looked at him, unconvinced, and, with you still in paw, raised his other paw and closed his eyes. He sat there for a few seconds, then opened his eyes and lowered his paw. <br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cForgive me for not believing you. It just seemed too coincidental.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cIt\u2019s okay. This statue and that monster do look alike, and I\u2019ve got the statue in my bag.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear somebody or something took vengeance for you. So you\u2019re okay, right?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine and I guess it\u2019s great for that lunch incident. But what I don\u2019t understand is why it showed up now or why it said something about being formed from pain and anguish.\u201d<br>\r\n(Aura) \u201cThat does seem intriguing. Well see you tomorrow Rai and here\u2019s your thing back. Again I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201c I forgive you Aura. Thank you and farewell for now.\u201d<br>\r\nAura left, leaving Rai looking at you, unsure of what you were or where \u2018you\u2019 were at. He sets you back down in the bag and sets off for home. When he gets home, he empties the bag on the table you hit the table somewhat hard. He sifted through everything all while calling your name. Eventually you move around and stand up, leaving him staring at you. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cJ-James?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (returning back to normal) \u201cIt is indeed James.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cBut how?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell I decided to do some experimenting with my powers and found I can change my metal self as well as other metal objects.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cCool, but then that means you were responsible for the monster.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYes I did make the monster. I\u2019m sorry for the trouble between you and Aura. I just didn\u2019t want to be seen.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cI forgive you for me and Aura, but why did you make that monster? It could\u2019ve put you in more danger.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI know, but I couldn\u2019t stand by, watching you being berry-bombed and laughed at. So to keep you from getting in trouble, I took the risk and made the monster to protect you.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (stunned) \u2026\u2026Thank you. But I\u2019ve got to ask two questions: One, why were asleep this morning, and two, how are you still awake?\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell I felt really tired this morning and I\u2019ve been training, so I guess I\u2019m a little more durable.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSo you can use the advanced technique too.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAdvanced\u2026 Technique?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah, advanced technique. Pokemon are taught how to use it, from taming fire to bending water and so on. I know how to use it, but like most pokemon, I just use them for speical tournaments.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cSo\u2026 you can bend metal too?\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cYeah. Here I\u2019ll show you and we can work on it a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\nRai went over to his cabinet and pulled out two forks. He sets one down in front of you and the other he sets in front of himself. He twists the fork in one way and you copy him. Whatever he did, you imitated. Eventually he makes a human-like form that resembles you. To have a little fun of your own you turn into metal and shift your shape. In a few seconds, the sensation you always get from turning to metal fades and you leave yourself looking like Rai. He just stares, surprised at how much you look like him.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cSorry, I can deal with two Rai\u2019s but not two James\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cThat is unbelievable! You look just like me.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cThanks. I practiced making forms at lunch today.\u201d<br>\r\nRai just laughs and heads over to the fridge for dinner. You return to normal and return the forks to their regular shape. He sets out a berry and some tea for you and sets his food down. You both eat in silence and when you\u2019re done, Rai heads over to his game system and TV and turns them both on. He grabs a controller and sits on the couch. You climb down from the table and walk over to the couch and climb on the arm. You sit there awhile and he sits there playing. He looks over at you lot, but says nothing.<br>\r\n(you)  \u201cWe\u2019re both still antisocial.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (chuckling) \u201cYep. You wanna play?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cPlay, no. Try, yes.\u201d<br>\r\nHe sets the controller down in front of you and you wait to begin your attempt. You run back and forth, hitting all the buttons you could, but it was just too hard and you lost. <br>\r\n(you) Oh. So much for that.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cGood effort, even at the size disadvantage. (looking out of the cave) Well I think it\u2019s time to call it a day. Wouldn\u2019t you agree, Mr. Monster?\u201d<br>\r\nYou laugh and begin to turn metal. You change to look like your monster and speak.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cYes I would Master Rai.\u201d<br>\r\nHe just laughs, shaking his head, and opens his hand for you to climb on. You step on and he gets ready for bed. He sets you on table and you return to normal while he lies down. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cNight Rai.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cNight James and thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (yawning) \u201cAnything for a friend, Rai.\u201d<br>\r\nYou both fall asleep, but about half an hour later, you wake up because\u2026</span></div></div>",

You let him sleep, but you yourself were determined to find who it is and if necessary, get them out of here, no matter what size they are. You slip down the table and shuffle over to the doorway. You peek around the corner and can barely make out a figure in the moonlight. It appeared to be a Ditto and it was searching for something\u2026 or someone. It mumbled to itself, but by the way it was searching through everything, it was looking for you. You wanted to fight it off, but at your size, you wouldn\u2019t win and would probably get captured. He starts opening all the kitchen drawers and you notice it\u2019s about to go for the silverware drawer. You see an opportunity to attack and wait for him to open the drawer. You merge all the forks together and drop this metal mass on top of the Ditto. It didn\u2019t react quickly enough and was crushed beneath the mass. It slimed its way out and searched for its attacker. You stay behind the doorway, out of sight, and make the mass turn into a Ditto-like shape. The real Ditto turns back around and jumps back a little. It moves and you move the mass in the same ways, like a mirror. It stands still for a second and you attack again. This time you make your Ditto throw a punch and it hits the other Ditto in the face. It recoils and starts rubbing its face. You make your Ditto melt into a puddle and circle around this other Ditto. It looks fearfully at the puddle and that\u2019s when your werewolf monster forms from the puddle. It\u2019s smaller than the table, but bigger than the Ditto. It takes the form of your monster and tries to attack. You quickly turn around and the Ditto hits the spikes on your monster\u2019s back. Ditto returns to its regular form and just looks at your monster, tired from fighting. It takes one last look at the monster and runs away as fast as it can. You let it escape and watch it run out of the cave. On the way out, though, it mentions something like \u201cThe boss ain\u2019t going to be happy about this!\u201d You assume he had some boss that sent him to find you, probably just like Jared. Unconcerned at the moment, you melt your monster back into forks and sets them back in the drawer. You climb up the counter and barely manage to shut the drawer.

You sat there on the counter, looking out of the cave at the beautiful moonlight. You climb off the counter and stand at the mouth of the cave. All of a sudden, you hear a whoosh of air that, seconds later, blows you back in the cave. You roll and land face up. Something lands on your face, but you move it and take a look around to see what just air tackled you. You see nothing, but hear a girl\u2019s playful giggle.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cMust be hearing things. And what is this thing?\u201d<br>\r\nYou stand up, dusting yourself off, and look at what had landed on your face. You hold it out in front of you and see that it is a grey cloak. It had no hood, but it could cover your body completely or halfway. You nod in approval and try it on. It fits perfectly, but as soon as you get it on, a symbol of some sort glows on your back, then fades away. You couldn\u2019t tell what it was, but it didn\u2019t hurt a bit. You move it so it is halfway, but it vanished when you did. You wonder where it went and reach where it should be. It somehow shows up in your grip and you pull it back over your body. It completely shows up again. Curious, you play with pulling it back and forth. It disappears and reappears until you stop. Unsure of what it is or why you have it, you walk down to the river with it draping over you. You hear that laugh again and turn around, once again seeing nothing. Shaking your head, you sit down and try to find your sanity. You watch the river flow and decide to practice a little on your advanced techniques. You notice a metal lump not too far away and get it closer to you. You make throwing knives out of it and toss one in the water. It seems to get absorbed by the water rather than make a splash. Unhappy, you pull your cloak over your head and notice you can see right through it, almost as if it isn\u2019t there. A little startled, you pop your head back out and look at it from the outside. You can\u2019t see through it from the outside, but you can see through it from the inside. You pull it back over your head, make another throwing knife, and throw it at the water. When it hits the water, the water splashes this time. You throw another knife without the cloak over your head, then another with the cloak. The results are different, but show are exactly the same from the first time. Intrigued, you do the same thing with the air, without the cloak, the knife just flies through the air, but when the cloak was over your head, you could see all the air currents and watch the knife move through those air currents. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cSo\u2026 this cloak helps me see and target things I normally can\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n(girl) (giggles) \u201cYay!\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201c Ah. Wait, who are you and why are you following me?<br>\r\nBefore she can answer another gush of wind comes and tumbles you.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cNot again.\u201d<br>\r\n(guy\u2019s voice) \u201cC\u2019mon sis, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n(girl\u2019s voice) \u201cOkay. See you later, little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cSis? Little guy!? What?!\u201d<br>\r\nSoon the two seemed to leave, but you couldn\u2019t be sure because you couldn\u2019t see anyone.<br>\r\nBut then you had the idea of trying out the cloak to see if you could see whoever this duo was. You pull your cloak over you and look around. You didn\u2019t see anyone and you turn to look behind you. That\u2019s when you saw two large eyes not even five feet away looking at you. You recognize the faces but have a hard time admitting they\u2019re there or that the one just scared you half to death. For who stood or rather floated in front of you were Latios and Latias.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cAHH!\u201d (fall backwards and start breathing heavy)<br>\r\n(Latios) \u201cSis, I think you overdid it. You okay?\u201d<br>\r\n(Latias) \u201cSorry.\u201d (offering you help up) <br>\r\n(you) \u201cI think so. (getting up) Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\nYou stood there, stunned that these two legends were right in front of you. You wanted to say something, but between your shock, fear, and antisocialism, no words came out of your mouth.<br>\r\n(Latias) \u201cHey, are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n(Latios) \u201cI think he\u2019s more scared than hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (almost whispering) \u201cI\u2019m a little bit of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n(Latias) \u201cLittle bit of everything? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cWell I don\u2019t talk much and I\u2019m surprised to see you two, but you did scare me pretty badly.\u201d<br>\r\n(Latios) \u201cSo you\u2019re quiet. That\u2019s alright, nobody\u2019s perfect. I can understand being surprised. It\u2019s not everyday you see legendary pokemon. And it\u2019s not everyday a legend scares you.\u201d<br>\r\n(Latias) \u201cI said I was sorry. We don\u2019t see humans everyday.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) (looking at them both curiously ) \u201cI would guess not and it\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n(Latios) \u201cI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess you have a question: What are we doing here? Am I right?\u201d<br>\r\nYou just nod, not really up to talking.<br>\r\n(Latias) \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. Like we said, nobody\u2019s perfect. Well we\u2019re here because Mew sent us to deliver that cloak to you because we\u2019re both quick and possibly invisible\u201d<br>\r\nLatios just stares at Latias, giving her a dirty look for interrupting him. She just smiles and shrugs. You can\u2019t help but smile and chuckle at this little. They both grin, knowing you\u2019re a little calmer. <br>\r\n(Latios) \u201cWell we need to get back to Mew. Farewell, Commit Child James and good luck.\u201d<br>\r\n(Latias) \u201cYeah see you later and good luck. (whispering to you) Sorry for earlier.\u201d (nuzzling you softly)<br>\r\n(you) (embarrassed) \u201cI-it\u2019s okay. Thank you both and farewell for now.\u201d<br>\r\nThey both flew away with smiles on their faces, leaving you by the river alone. You touched your face where she rubbed against you, shocked that you actually got to meet Latios and Latias. You pull your cloak to one side and it disappears. You then march back to Rai\u2019s cave and go to his room. You see he is awake and looking around for you. <br>\r\n(you) \u201cSorry about that Rai. I heard somebody out there and tried to wake you up, but you were deep asleep.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (groggy) \u201cWho was here and what did they want?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cIt was a Ditto and he was looking for me.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) (suddenly awake) \u201cWhat?! And you fought him off?\u201d<br>\r\n(you)  \u201cYep, but only thanks to him being such a snoop and you having so many forks.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cJames\u2026 if you\u2019re going out for a little while, please leave a note or something. You make me think you\u2019re tired of me and want to leave.\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cRai\u2026 I told you I wouldn\u2019t leave unless there is a good reason. Besides, I like hanging out with you. The question is; do you like being near me?\u201d<br>\r\n (Rai) \u201cWell, yeah, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n(you) \u201cExactly.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cSorry.\u201d <br>\r\n(you) \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Good night.\u201d<br>\r\n(Rai) \u201cGood night.\u201d<br>\r\nYou soon both fell asleep for the night. You woke up the next morning\u2026</span></div></div>",

It had some writing on the other side. You throw it off and start to look around. You are in Rai\u2019s cave, but Rai wasn\u2019t there. You feel a little scared and alone at the same time. Eventually you look over to the paper which has landed on the bed. You run over and jump, landing safely on the bed. You start reading at the top of the page, and word by word, work your way down.<br>\r\nPaper:  Dear James, <br>\r\nI decided to go to school alone today. It\u2019s not because of you, yet it is. It\u2019s not that you did anything wrong, I just wanted to ask around about the Commit Children and thought maybe it would be safer if you weren\u2019t here. After Jared and that Ditto last night, more Pokemon seem to want to get their hands on you. If you aren\u2019t with me, maybe we both can be a little safer. I also wanted to talk to Aura and you said if I ever wanted to, you would be okay with that. I hope you\u2019re not mad because I left you at home. Take care and try not to destroy anything or anyone. Thanks for sticking with me and I\u2019ll see you after school.<br>\r\n -Rai<br>\r\nWhile you were reading the first part, both guilt and abandonment swept over, but as you read on, things made more sense and you felt better. You looked back over at the table and saw a berry waiting to be eaten. You run back over and, jump then barely climb up to the tabletop. You walk over to the berry and eat it up. You then walk over to the edge and look down. You were about to climb down when you remembered your cloak. You reach where it would be and it appears. You pull it around you and look down again. For some odd reason, you felt the urge to jump off and use the cloak to glide. You always wanted to fly, but jumping and hoping a cloak could save you seemed foolish. You paced back and forth, unsure of what to do. Your mind churned like a stormy ocean. Finally, you figure if your cloak didn\u2019t let you glide, you could turn to steel and drop down. You still were a little nervous about jumping. Finally you gather up the courage and step a few steps away from the edge. You close your eyes, run towards the edge and at the last second, jump off and grab the sides of your cloak. You open your eyes and saw the cloak was letting you glide across the room. It felt exhilarating knowing you could fly without wings. You float until you were a little ways from the ground. Unfortunately you had no clue how to land and put your legs first. You\u2019re sent tumbling and eventually run out of momentum. You stand up and shake off the bad landing. Then you move the cloak over to one side and it fades away. You walk a little ways and start thinking about what to do today. You look at the rest of the cave and the exit, then\u2026</span></div></div>",

You wanted to stay and practice your techniques, but you also wanted to unite with the other Commit Children. You all had to meet sometime, so why not try and speed it up. Besides, if one of them was in trouble or alone, you could always help them out. You stood at the mouth of the cave and looked at all the places on the island. Walking would take too long, but it seemed like the only way. You sat there and thought about what to do. Then you remembered your ability to change shape. You decided you would fly around. Unfortunately, metal doesn\u2019t fly and most planes would probably look suspicious to the island. You looked up at the sky and recalled one metal Pokemon that could fly: Skarmory. You feel the metal sensation all over and think of how a Skarmory would look. Soon your arms become wings and the rest of the change occurs. Although you could now comb the island a little easier, you were a lot smaller than a normal Skarmory. Hopefully too many people wouldn\u2019t notice and you could fly with ease. You prepped your wings and soon took off. However, you quickly crashed as you had no experience with wings or flying. You sat there practicing for awhile until you finally learned how to use your wings. Takeoff swiftly followed and you were soon soaring through the skies. You would occasionally land to search a new area, then after finding no one, took back to the skies. You look at the skies around you and saw a few more legendaries flying around. Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres were flying around, staying close to the mountain, but keeping a decent distance away from you. They\u2026</span></div></div>",

Between Moltres\u2019s Flamethrower, Articuno\u2019s Ice Beam, and Zapdos\u2019s Thunder, you barely missed all of them. Eventually, Moltres hit your left wing, Articuno hit your right wing, and Zapdos straight on hit you. Unable to withstand the barrage of attacks, you lost consciousness and plummeted into the forest below. You watched them float in air, then return to circling the mountain just before things went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou later wake up to pains shooting across your body. You look at yourself to find you are back to human. Your left arm was a little burnt, your right arm was almost frozen, and your chest was numb. You stayed awake, then moved over to lean against a tree. You stayed there until you could feel your chest again and your right arm seemed warm enough. After making a brief recovery, you stand up and look at the surrounding forest. Then a sharp pain hits your burnt arm and you quickly grasp it. Looking around the forest floor, you see a fallen leaf and go over to it. You turn your arm into a sword and slice the leaf into long strips. You wrap the strips around your burn and use some leaf fibers to tie it up. It didn\u2019t dull the pain, but it made a decent oversized bandage. You sit back down and remain motionless. <br>\r\n(you) (talking to yourself) \u201cHow am I supposed to find the other Commit Children? One person trying to find eight others. I can\u2019t fly because I\u2019ll get shot down. I can\u2019t walk because I\u2019ll be out here all night. I guess I could try to tunnel, but I don\u2019t know this island at all. I can\u2019t give up but what other choice do I have. I don\u2019t even know if they have guardians or where they even could be.\u201d <br>\r\nYou sat there, feeling like hope was lost. So many places to look, and no clue where to start. You decide that even though you were taken down once, that the second time might be better. You once again change to Skarmory and fly up. You try staying lower to avoid being seen, but they still take notice. All three legends ready an attack, but rather than dodge, you fly straight towards them. Taken by surprise, they rapidly attack. You keep a steady path, flying directly for them. All their attacks seem to be a bit off, but you pay no attention. Finally you were close enough to them and you quickly drop. They gasp and float steadily. You stay on a downward dive, aiming towards Rai\u2019s cave. You pull up just in time to enter his cave.  You glide to the table, shift to human form and hide behind a leg. You hear Articuno fly by the entrance, then fly back up. You heard the three birds talking, but couldn\u2019t hear exactly what they were saying. You wait a bit longer, then peek around the leg. Nobody was there and you decided to get some lunch. You needed to get the refrigerator open, but had some size issues. You turn your arm into metal and change it into a crowbar. You barely pry the door open and climb up to where the berries were. You grab one and climb down. You set the berry on the ground and put your full effort into shutting the door. It shuts and you begin to eat. When you had finished, you went to Rai\u2019s room and went under his bed. <br>\r\n(you) (speaking to yourself) \u201cGreat, couldn\u2019t even find one person. What a failure I must be! (You turn your fist to metal and begin punching a rock bigger than you.) I\u2019ll bet they found each other no problem. Bet nobody wants to hurt them. But everybody here wants to hurt me. Pick on me till I get back. Then it\u2019s me picking on them, not self-defense. Just like at my school.\u201d <br>\r\nYou kept punching the rock until it shattered, hatred flowing through your veins. You turn your hand back to normal and shortly afterwards, pass out. </span></div></div>",

You walked back to the entrance of the cave and looked out, then up towards the sky. Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres were still circling the mountain. You were determined to look for the Commit Children at least once more, but getting shot down wasn\u2019t part of the plan. A breeze blew by and you felt your cape move. You pull it over and just stand there. You shift to Skarmory once more and prepped for takeoff. The only thoughts in your head were why you kept passing out after using your powers even though you never felt tired before you passed out and if you would fly in safety. You take off and notice they haven\u2019t seen you. You soared all over, from Coral bay to the school to anywhere you hadn\u2019t looked the first time. You still found nobody and flew home. They still didn\u2019t see you and you landed on the kitchen table, shift back to normal, cloak still over your torso. You pull it over and it fades away. You had looked everywhere and found nobody.

They were melted after you visualized them melting. You started making various shapes and figures from the pool of liquid metal. From pokemon to weapons to geometric figures, you had an arsenal of ideas to experiment with. You made shurikens that were sent flying into the walls. A practice dummy was made and you worked on your fighting skills. Although it was useless, you made metal knuckles and punched with them. Finally, you had to urge to play some music. You made your instruments all metal since you had no choice and soon, a guitar and an ocarina were created. The guitar didn\u2019t play the best without the wooden body and you melted it back into a pile. The ocarina, however, sounded as nice as a porcelain ocarina, but was a bit heavy. Regardless, you played a few songs you could remember. You were about to play the song of the Great Guardian, but went against that idea as it may be a major mistake. The ocarina too was melted back and you reformed all the metal into a statue of a good friend of yours from the human world. You walked up to it, sighed, and thought.<br>\r\n(you) \u201cI wonder how it is back home. I really wish you were here. Maybe you could help me with these powers or keep me company. It\u2019s nice having Rai, but his size is intimidating and I\u2019d like to see another human so I don\u2019t feel so awkward being here.\u201d The puddle melted as you lost focus and collapsed onto your knees. It overwhelmed you knowing that you had no other humans to be near and Rai was probably sick of watching over you. All the negative emotions, feelings, and memories washed over you: Sorrow, betrayal, abandonment, loneliness, failure and others. You walked into Rai\u2019s room and climbed up to the table by the bed. You laid down on the cloths as a single tear rolled down your face.<br>\r\n(you) (thinking) \u201cI\u2019m sorry Rai. All I\u2019ve been is a thorn in your side. I\u2019m sorry everyone I\u2019ve hurt or let down. I just hope you all can forgive me. I guess I\u2019m like steel itself: I try to hold strong, but I break or give way in certain areas, failing at what you needed me to do.\u201d <br>\r\nYou drifted off to sleep, leaving all your pains somewhere in your mind.

Short, dark brown hair and wearing a grey t-shirt under a black overcoat with dark blue jeans. Has a thin build, but is still taller than most humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: friendly and quiet with new people, though when you're on his bad side, you should stay clear of his view. He's really unfogiving. Be on his good side on the other hand and he's willing to help you out in any stituation as long as you ask him directly. IF he gets in a fight and he sometime's gets into kind of a bloodlust and can seriously injure others, if no one holds him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikes: People he trusts, music (He plays guitar very well), people learning from their mistakes (himself included)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDislikes: groups of people (6 people other than him are ok, but with more around he feels uneasy), someone looking down on him, getting involved in fights he has nothing to do with<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: He remebers little to nothing about his family and doesn't care to about them, since the accident in which he lost his leftt eye. The accident happend shortly after he turned 4. It were the usual fights in the family, which normaly ended with the ones arguing, beating each other up and then going to bed. That time around it got out of hand and some glass bottle were shattered and the shards were send flying, one landing in Ashor's eye. After the medical treatment it was clear, that there was no way for it to heal properly and the old wound would start bleeding again every so often (about 3-5 days until it bleed out again). Cause of that he got his nickname \"Bloodeye\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>... It's been a long time since I've thought about my past human life, and to be honest, there's not a whole lot to remember. I wish I could remember more, but time won't wait for you to reach out towards your past. The farther time goes, the more out of reach they become, and now the only characteristic I remember about myself are my eyes: hazel green. When I first came here, or at least what I can remember, is I was just a Zorua. There was a Charmeleon there, too, talking to me about something. It was something like a proposition, and I can remember that part crystal clear... <i>\"If you do what I tell you, then your secret is secured, got that?\"</i> I could only agree at that point, since my body was banged up pretty bad for some reason. I wish I could know what exactly happened, but nowadays if I try and think about that, I start slowing down on the job. Charmeleon has since then evolved into a Charizard, and I myself am a Zoroark. My job is to collect money from Pokemon who owe Charizard. I don't ask why, I just follow through with the task. I asked about it once... Lets just say I'll never do something that stupid again....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy target today: a Lucario. Him and his family owe Charizard a fair amount of money, and I'm the lap dog picking up the money for him. <i>\"If you don't do what I say, I'll tell everyone who you really are, AND I'll return to scorching villages.\"</i> His threat is what I hold dear in my memory. If I fail to measure up, then thousands may become injured. Or worse... Enough with these horrible thoughts, and back to business. I approach the Lucario residence, and bang on the door while shouting \"Lucario, open up! Charizard tells me you owe big time!\" Mentioning Charizard's name around here can cause an entire village to hole up, but most residents are submissive to the payments that they are forced to pay. Lucario opens his door and silently hands me a bag of coins. Judging by it's weight, it's not nearly enough to please Charizard. \"Where's the rest of it, Lucario?\" Lucario growls at the inevitable and comes back with a more acceptable amount. \"That's all we have, Zoroark. Now leave us be...\" I take the rest of the cash and say quietly \"Well, if you know what's best for both of us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the structure, I see several Riolu hiding behind their mother. Seeing them like that was painful enough, so I look away and start walking. \"I won't ever understand you, Zoroark. Deep down, I know you're as bad as Charizard.\" I wasn't in the mood to argue anymore. \"Then I must be the softest side of him.\" Lucario was angry, but he couldn't do anything about it. He may have read my aura as well, seeing regret and sadness. \"I... don't understand why you put up with him. Just quit, and leave everyone alone!\" I turn around and look at him with no change in emotion. \"I wish I could, Lucario. If I do, I can only guarantee things will get much, much worse. Good night.\" I took off in the dark night, getting back to Charizard as fast as I could. I lingered long enough. Charizard has set himself up at some ruins beyond Lava Springs, where he stockpiles his collection of coins for unspoken reasons. I hand him today's collecting silently. \"Good, good work Zoroark. Who knows, maybe you should be my Hitman later? Heheh!\" \"Yeah, don't count on that. I'm getting more tired of this every day, and you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I DO know, Zoroark. Too bad you and your secret is the only thing keeping you from freedom. However, that's not important right now. You'll actually be given a break from gathering debts. Two weeks at most is your break...\" This was shocking news to me. I have never known any period of respite, and here he goes throwing it right into my face. \"What!? Are you serious?\" Charizard nods, and explains further in detail. \"Rumors are going around, and that...</span></div></div>",

I mean, it's only fitting, right?\" Perhaps I was a little too excited, but maybe Charizard partially understands why I would ask that. \"That is why I didn't ask you to look for him. You're hard to read sometimes, and I have no idea what may be going through your head at times. How am I supposed to know that you will only ask him a bunch of questions about being human? What if you relate to him? I just can't allow that. Deal with it. I'll tell you one more time: you're on break for two weeks. Got it? Get it? Good. Now get outta my face, before I get too annoyed.\" Now I'm free for two weeks; I depart immediately, for my sake. I don't want to see him get angry again... But still, what am I going to do for the next two weeks? Sure, I have several interests, but I haven't visited my place in a long time since Charizard would keep me busy almost 24/7. The most convenient path to take is through Fist Falls, which I had already made a previous rendezvous with Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, he's the only one who I could ever call a friend. However, Lucario would never even consider being my friend since I usually stop by only to collect coins. Meeting him this early morning was mere coincidence. Lucario was collecting some berries, and now walks to his house with his basket half-way full. He stops and sees me walking down the road that cuts through the village, and he eyes me with hostility. \"Why are you back here, Zoroark!? Come for more of our coins or something!? Forget it!\" I look at him with exhaustion and say \"No, I just happen to be passing by...\" I don't think Lucario will let me pass even if I'm here for nothing. \"Well, forget coming outta here clean! Get ready for a brawl you'll never forget!\" Lucario assumes a fighting stance, and I remain as I was earlier: tired and uninterested. \"Lucario, you're the last person on the planet I would want to fight. I don't even want to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now you're backing off?\"<br>\r\n\"That's been the plan.\"<br>\r\n\"Give me a ton of reasons I shouldn't have to fight you, and I may let you through.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright. To begin, you're a Fighting type. I already stand at a disadvantage against you.\"<br>\r\n\"You got that right! You'll need a lot more excuses than that!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I would think in all honesty that you wouldn't want any trouble either in my shoes.\"<br>\r\n\"Go on...\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have to take any more money for the next two weeks. I've been given a very, very generous respite from a job I hate with a burning passion.\"<br>\r\n\"Hah! Why would YOU hate your job? You take coins to share with Charizard!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm given nothing. I do my job to keep his threats from becoming reality. I don't buy food, I usually get it myself in the river, unlike you having the luxury of buying it already cooked.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't even buy anything with no money! How do I know if you're just making all of this up?\"<br>\r\n\"Do you really want me to say why?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'll let you leave if you tell me.\"<br>\r\n\"Because if I were to consider anyone as my friend, I'd want you as a friend.\"<br>\r\n\"... Come again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario was taken aback by my answer. He may have thought of me as a complete monster before, but to hear that from someone like myself... \"... How do I know you're not lying to me...?\" I assume I have made a very weak bond with him, one hinting at friendship or maybe even friendly enemies. \"I can't tell you that you should believe me, because I actually believe that you may believe me.\" \"Uh...</span></div></div>",

I must say, that sack is really piquing my interest.\" Ryo sets his children down and lets them all have the basket of berries, saying \"Yes, it really piqued MY interest as well. Might as well say it was almost noteworthy, too.\" \"How so?\" His wife's aura was emitting a wave and color that meant wonder, or curiosity, depending on the situation. \"Well...

I had made it myself when I had a lot of more free time on my hands, several years ago when I only recently assumed a new identity of a Zoroark. It took quite a long time to finish, because I wanted to take time making it. It's very well refined, with the dimensions neat and aligned with each other, resulting in a house that doesn't creak at every step you take. I notice almost no difference in shape, but it currently is covered with vines and other plants.

I open some nearby curtains to reveal a window, made from highly compressed and heated sand that only residents from Lava Springs could make. We do have technology around here, but I'm not a big fan of it all. There's just something about old customs that can only bring a smile to my face, I don't really know why... \"Oh, wow...

I muster up some energy and assume the form of a Vaporeon. I use the most powerful Hydro Pump I can make with the little energy I have; since I am no water type, it's difficult to use special kinds of abilities, like being able to shoot water from ones mouth.

Travis lays unconscious in front of it all, with signs of some effort of putting out the fires, only to fall short greatly. Ryo shouts out to the water types \"Come on! We need to isolate this inferno, and put it all out!\" Like firemen, the streams of water douse the fires eagerly trying to spread through the forest. Ryo's team of villagers are successfully isolating it all; Ryo grabs Travis and tells his unconscious partial friend \"Don't worry, I'll get you outta here...\" Ryo lifts Travis up off the ground and carries him on his back, making his way slowly but surely back to the village where Travis will be properly healed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">...

I guess I have quite the fee on my head. \"He's broke, actually... He gave the last of it to me. I'm more than willing to pay for it...\" I look over at Ryo, and tell him \"Lucario, if you pay for it, I'll have to return the favor, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I knew by your aura that you would say something like that...\" Then, I remembered...

Fresh air is freely flowing in, so less panicking is sure to happen. <i>Okay, okay, stay calm man... Oh man! Loud voices...! This... is... really... exciting! Who are they?

Where am I?\" you say out loud. As you try to get up your body flares with pain. \"Ow!\" you say meekly as you move back down. The pain doesn't stop for a while and you're left there to lay in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you get the energy to look around you see that your not be the water any more, but what appears to be a comfortable, if somewhat empty, room. You are taken aback by this at first, but you soon settle down. You look out the window in the room and see the ocean outside. That's when you realize something. The room was huge! You couldn't believe your eyes as you looked out across the plain of a bed you were laying on! Everything was ginormous, and made you feel like an insignificant bug. \"That's what I am here,\" you think \"a bug.\" \"Who's room is this? And more importantly, why is everything so big, and why am I in here, and what does this person want with me?!\" you mumble to yourself in a panicked manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might want to hurt me! I've got to get out of here!!\" you frantically think. As you try to sit up and pull the sheets up, the worst and biggest wave of pain washes over you and you fall back down screaming in pain in your mouth. \"It's hopeless.\" you admit to yourself. \"I just hope that who ever they are won't hurt me.\" you silently whimper. That's when you notice something else, your body was completely bandaged! Basically every part of you body had rags tired over them  and were fit tightly just like a bandage, you feel your head to find another cloth wrapped around it. These facts calm your fears a little. \"If someone went to this much trouble for me, I doubt that they would want to hurt me.\" you think. You decide to do something you think is crazy, you begin to call out for anyone that could hear you. \"HELLO? IS ANYBODY IN HERE? HELLO?\" you shout probably too loudly. But that didn't matter because at almost the exact same moment the large door of the bedroom opened to reveal a large figure in the doorway.\"Oh good, you're finally awake, I was getting worried.\" a...</span></div></div>",

You hear a small giggle escape from the figure at the door. \"Well don't be to embarassed. That is pretty big for a pond, and it's not like your that big or anyting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't elp but to take some offence at her comment. \"Well excuse me for not being big enough to just wade through it!\" you exclaim quite irretably. \"Alright calm down,\" says the figure cautiously, \"I didn't mean any offence. And try not to get too angry or irritated, you'll only hurt yourself.\" she says in a concerned tone. \"Okay.\" you give in. \"I'm sorry for getting angry so quickly, I shouldn't be so rude to a lady especially one that saved my life.\" Yet another figure escapes from the large figure. \"No worries. I'm just glad to see that your feeling better, and I wouldn't say that you owe me your life or anything. But it is always nice to have a sweet gentlemen around to give his heroen complements.\" She says in a flirty tone. You can't help but laugh at this and neither could she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, who are you?\" you ask when you both stop laughing. \"I should at least thank you properly and I can't do that without knowing your name.\" \"Oh, of course I haven't introduced myself yet. How rude of me!\" she comments. \"My name's Dewa (Do-a).\" \"Dewa? What kind of name is that?\" you think to yourself. \"Does my name confuse you? I'm not sure but I think it does judging by your face.\" says the figure. \"Well I admit it kinda does.\" you admit sheepishly. \"But that's probably because I can't even see you.\" \"You can't? Then I'll move somewhere where you can see me.\" She says. The figure finally steps out of the shadows and, again, you couldn't believe your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before you at the edge of the gigantic be was an even more gigantic Dewott! If you hadn't gotten to know her a little before she showed herself you probably would have yelled in surprise, but you couldn't help to still jump in surprise. \"Surprised?\" Dewa askes. \"That can't begin to describe how I'm feeling!\" you say. \"Don't worry,\" Dewa says with an amazingly heartwarming and friendly smile, \"I'm not gonna hurt ya. Well, on purpose you're just so cute I could cuddle you for hours! But we have more important things to deal with.\" Dewa then approaches you on the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask quiet timidly. She gives another sweet smile in an effort to comfort you. \"Just relax, I'm just checking to see how your injuries are doing.\" As she gently undoes the rag on your head you can't help but slink back in anervous manner. And who could blame you, it's not every day that a giant Pokemon is carefully removiing rags from your miniscule body. Once she had undone all of the rags and thouroughly checked your injuries, she gave a relieved sigh and addressed you, \"It looks like you've made a full recovey! But I still think you should rest for a while longer so you can gain your strength back.\" Dewa then stares at you with a loving look in her eyes. \"Do you wan't anything before you rest?\" She asks.</span></div></div>",

But I'm glad that it is.\" you think. \"Dewa seems like a really nice girl/Pokemon and she seems to like having me around.

Do you mind?\" she asks. \"Not at all,\" you reply, \"and thanks again.\" when she gives you the cap you quickly begin to drink the water. But you drink to fast and the water ends up spilling all over you! Dewa giggles as you sputter on the water and at the humiliated expression on your face. \"I think that's enough.\" she says while giggling, \"Now get some rest, I'll wake you when it's time for dinner. Yell for me if you need anything.\" She then takes the cap away from you, and fixes your pillow and bed sheets so they were more comfortable. She kisses you once on the head and whispers, \"Sweet dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she closes the door behind her, you quickly drift off into a deep sleep.

Suddenly, you feel an ice cold hand clamp onto your shoulder. You turn around in panic, only to nearly faint as you look straight at a ghostly figure of an older version of you reaching towards your face. \"Do not be afraid.\" it says, \"I am the embodiment of your inner power and courage. I have come here to tell you that you are in this world to help save it.\" \"What?\" you question, not understanding what's going on. \"It will all become clear in due time.\" says the spirit, \"but for now, I shall let you know that you are exactly where you are supposed to be.

Like always when you get up, you just stare blankly in the direction you\u2019re facing for a few seconds, which happens to be right at Dewa. She had that same amazing smile from before spread across her face. \"Come on.\" she says \"It's time to wake up you little cutie you!\" You moan in tiredness and turn over facing away from Dewa. \"Five more minutes.\" you mumble. Dewa giggles at your little remark. \"Come on you! You've slept for four hours already it's already dark!\" You sleepily look out the window to see the moon high in the sky. \"Good. Now you can go to bed too and will both be rested for tomorrow.\" Dewa laughs at you; you must really not want to get up! \"What about dinner?\" she asks. You groan again, \"We can have a big breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewa finally had enough of playing around with you. She undid the covers, and gently picked you up. \"Fine! I'll get up.\" you mumble as you sit up. \"Good!\" she says, \"Because dinner's ready.\" As she walks out of the bedroom she addresses you again, \"I wasn't sure what you would want to eat, so I just got you what I'm having.\" You yawn, \"I'm sure it'll be fine. Thanks by the way.\" \"Your welcome!\" she responds with a smile, and you smile back. When you reach the kitchen, you notice it's about the same as any normal kitchen in a wood cabin. There's a stove, a fridge, a couple of cabinets, and a small table to eat on. \"Nice place you got here.\" you mumble, but Dewa wasn't listening because at the moment she was bringing over dinner. She sets down a large basket full of berries down on the table in front of you, and gives you another bottle cap of water. \"Try not to spill on yourself this time!\" she says in a mock tone. As she picks out certain berries ad sets them in front of her, you take small sips of your water and examine each of the individual berries. \"They look delicious!\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewa notices the hungry look on your face and smiles. \"I can tell you like the looks of theses berries,\" she says, \"but you should let me choose for you, a lot of them would be way too strong for your taste buds right now.\" She begins to look through her basket for a certain berry she thinks that you could handle. \"Aha! Here it is.\" she says as she pulls out a round, blue colored berry and sets it in front of you. The berry was quite large; it was about the same height as you. You could probably hide behind it in order to avoid being seen by anything. \"Awww.\" Dewa cues, \"I never noticed you were the same size as a berry, how cute!\" You blush at the fact that she thinks your cute, it felt weird; it felt like you were being treated kind of like a pet. \"That's an oran berry.\" she tells you, \"It's a very common berry, but everyone loves it because it has such a natural and well balanced taste. I think you'll love just as much as everyone else does!\" she ends with a smile. \"The berry does look good.\" you think, \"Oh what the heck!\" You quickly take a bite out of the huge berry and your mouth is flooded with the most amazing sensation of flavor you have ever experienced! You begin viciously attacking the berry with your mouth eating as much as you can. \"Slow down little guy!\" Dewa says, \"I don't want you getting a stomachache!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then remember your manners and quickly stop. \"Sorry.\" you say pretty embarrassed. \"No worries!\" Dewa replies as she begins to eat as well. Your meal goes on silent for a few minutes when Dewa suddenly speaks. \"Oh my gosh! I can't believe I've been so rude!\" She says out loud. \"How?\" you ask with a slight chuckle. \"I haven't even asked you your name yet! And you were such a gentlemen earlier asking me for my name. But I guess late is better than never.\" she says, bringing her attention to you. \"So tell me about yourself.\" she says. You quickly swallow your mouth full of food and get a quick drink before speaking. \"Well,\" you start, \"there isn't much to tell. My name is Andrew, I'm about fourteen years old, I'll be fifteen on November 14, I come from a family of seven,\" you pause for a quick breath, \"I'm the youngest of five children, I have three older sisters and one older brother, I don't have a job yet, and I'm a freshmen at high school.\" The entire time you continue to talk Dewa listens to you with her full attention, occasionally taking a bite of food or drinking some water. \"And that's about it.\" you conclude. \"Well!\" Dewa says, \"Andrew I never would have guessed you had such a busy life. But it's nice to finally fully meet you.\" she says with a smile. \"The pleasure's all mine.\" you say, \"Okay now it's your turn.\u201dAlright,\" she says, \"where should I start?\" For the next few minutes or so, she tells you about her life, family, and friends. It turns out that she' in high school to, and you were kind of shocked to learn that they had school here, wherever this place is. You both finish your meals soon after she finishes telling you about herself, and she puts the basket away in a cabinet. \"By the way,\" you speak up, \"I forgot to ask. Where are we?\" Dew smiles at you again which warms you to the core. \"Where in Coral Bay on Emerald Island. This island is divided into multiple individual towns, each home to many different types of Pokemon. In Coral Bay, there is generally water type Pokemon. The school I told you about earlier is for every type of Pokemon. So it's not like water types have their own school or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you process the information. \"This sounds like a pretty cool place.\" you think. \"Well I think it's time for bed.\" Dewa says. She holds her hand out for you and you quickly jump on it. It felt so warm on her hand like paw and you almost fall asleep right there. But you are soon taken outside, and are brought to a large body of water. \"Well,\" Dewa says looking at you, \"this is the pond where I found you!\" Your are utterly shocked. \"Wait!\" you say, \"This is the pond where you found me!? It is a lot bigger than other ponds. You were right.\" She giggles at your shocked face. \"I come hear to brush my teeth, and that's how I found you this morning.\" she tells you. She gently places you on the ground and tells you to wait for her. She then quickly goes to too a large bush and grabs two leaves. \"Here you go.\" she says as she hands you a small leaf. \"This is a mint leaf, you can use it to brush your teeth.\" she tells you. She spends the next few minutes with you, telling you how to use the special leaf to brush your teeth and watch you finish brushing after you learn. Once you're both done, she gently picks you up without warning, but you didn't mind, and took you back to her bedroom where you first woke up hours ago. When you get back to her room, she addresses you, \"Ohhhh. I forgot to make you a bed.\" she grumbles. She stares down at you in her hand with a nervous smile. \"you don't mind sleeping in my bed do you?\" she asks awkwardly. You blush at the idea, but you manage to respond \"Sure I don't mind.\" She gives another awkward smile and only says, \"Great.\" She grasps you in one hand as she gets into her bed. She gently sets you down on her pillow and pulls her soft bed sheets over you. \"Good night Andrew.\" Dewa whispers, \"And remember, if you need anything just ask me.\" she says. She gives another kiss on the head before she goes to sleep. You smile to yourself and think, \"This is great!\" As sleep begins to take over your mind again, you whisper one more thing to Dewa before you fall asleep, \"Sweet Dreams Dewa.\" After saying that, you fall asleep with a happy smile on your face. </span></div></div>",

The first class had was History about the island or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next class was even less interesting, apparently Dewa was interested in Art. The entire class, all you hear is scribbling and the occasional question or comment from a student or teacher. You tried to fall asleep during the class, but whenever you were about to drift into the land of dreams, something woke you up. Dewa didn't check on you must and you never really got to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last it was lunch time, and you were hoping you could finally get out of the bag. But unfortunately, Dewa had to meet with some teacher about some project or assignment she missed. When you heard you were skipping lunch, you just flopped onto the ground and started to groan. Thankfully, you finally managed to fall asleep while she was talking with her teacher and miss the rest of the day. You even slept through the bus ride home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home and unpacked her things, she decided to wake you up. With you still in her now empty book bag, she flips it over, and you tumble out of it headfirst onto the table. \"What the heck?\" you mumble as you recover from the fall and your sleep. You never really liked saying stuff like \"What the hell?\" and other crap like that. You look around while rubbing your head, trying to figure out where you are. \"Just so you know,\" Dewa says behind you, \"you're at my house again.\" You're then presented with a bottle cap of water and another Oran berry. \"So how did you like your first day at my school?\" she asks biting into a berry. \"Honestly, it sucked!\" you reply. \"I thought you'd say that!\" she responds laughing. \"At least you didn't have to sit through those classes.\" she complains. \"You have a point there.\" you reply with a chuckle. Suddenly, the two of you are interrupted when... </span></div></div>",

The voice was so beautifully used and heard that it made you swoon. In this feminine voice was not only music, but love and understanding. Who ever she was, you would not have hesitated to meet her in any way. Anyone with such a lovely voice couldn't be evil to you. Dewa on the other hand had the opposite idea. After all, you can never be too careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick as a flash, Dewa scoops you up and drops you into a nearby glass of water. That wasn't exactly the best spot to hide in. As you recover from the sudden surprise and try to keep above the surface of the water, you try to listen in on Dewa's conversation. \"Glacia!\" Dewa says, trying to sound happy. \"Um, what are you doing here?\" \"I came to visit you silly!\" You hear Dewa let out an awkward laugh. \"Well you could've visited me at school instead then.\" She replies. \"Well then it wouldn't be surprising!\" counters Glacia. \"Alright look.\" says Dewa, losing all of the fake enthusiasm in her voice. \"You never visit me here unless you have a favor to ask of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you win, I admit it.\" Glacia concedes. \"Ha!\" yells Dewa, \"I knew it! Now what do you want?\" Glacia cleared her throat before speaking. \"Well, my parents are going away on their anniversary for a while, so I need a place to stay. And-\" \"No way.\" Dewa interrupts. \"You can't stay here. Why don't you try your cousin's Shiki's place?\" \"I can't.\" replies Glacia, \"She won't have enough room. She's already staying with Miku, Jet, and Storm. Come on please!\" she begs. At first Dewa manages to keep saying no, but after constant begging from Glacia, she finally gives in. \"Oh fine! You can stay.\" she says irritably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" cheers Glacia, \"Thanks so much.\" \"Whatever.\" Dewa replies. The situation with Glacia and the annoyance of Glacia's begging had gotten into Dewa's head and made her forget about you! She reached down to take a drink of water from the glass that you were in! As she brought the glass closer to her mouth, you try to get her attention by shouting her name, but to no avail. Soon, you were sent careening into her mouth and at the mercy of her natural instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour puny presence went unnoticed in Dewa's mouth, and you were carelessly shoved into Dewa's throat. The strong muscles try to force you down her throat, and into your doom, but you manage to hold on. Unfortunately, this caused Dewa to start choking and naturally she starts swallowing harder. You desperately try to keep your grip and you would've lost it if Glacia hadn't performed the Heimlich Maneuver Dewa, causing you to fly out of her mouth and onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock from the situation you just underwent was so serious, that you weren't able to recover for quite some time. In fact, you didn't even notice that Glacia noticed you lying on the table. What kind of Pokemon is Glacia? </span></div></div>",

You noticed her gazing at you and you tense up, not sure what to do. Other than Dewa, this was the first gigantic pokemon you've seen and you were scared. Her face was emotionless as her large teal eyes scanned your body. You had know idea what to do; so you just stand there trembling and look into those beautiful, but intimidating eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dewa had finally regained her composure, she realized that Glacia had seen you and was inspecting you. Dewa was afraid this would happen. She could tell that when you heard Glacia's voice you really wanted to meet her. But she knew you would be scared of her. She was over five times your size, probably even more than that. If she was you, she would be afraid of Glacia too. \"Glacia I can explain.\" She began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Glacia asks, turning her attention to Dewa. \"How do you explain that you have a human, a rare mythological creature? How do you explain that you were hiding a human from me? How do you explain why you <i>wanted</i> to hide him from me? How do you explain why you almost <i>swallowed</i> him? And how do you explain...\" She pauses getting right in front of Dewa's face. \"How do you explain... how ADORABLE he is!?\" she squeals. She basically runs back to the table, brings you towards her face, and nearly cuddles you to death. The entire time, she's cooing and mumbling about how cute you are. Whatever fear you had of her had completely disappeared and it was replaced with laughter. Her cuddling was an amazing experience! It was like having the world's biggest and softest pillow being rubbed against you but only a million times better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewa stared at you and Glacia in shock. Just a few seconds ago, you were trembling just at the sight of her. But now you were laughing and enjoying yourself as Glacia eagerly snuggled against you. Despite the weirdness of the situation, Dewa sighed a breath of relief. \"At least Andrew won't be afraid of her while she stays here. I just hope they don't do that all the time.\" She thinks as she sits back down and drinks her water again.</span></div></div>",

You were still in a trance from your earlier experience and stood there completely oblivious to the world around you. \"Um, Earth to Andrew.\" Dewa said. \"It's time to get back to reality.\" You shake yourself out of your trance and begin to blush in embarrassment. \"Sorry about that.\" You chuckle nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So his name is Andrew?\" Glacia mused. \"It definitely suits him. I can't believe I'm talking to an actual human! This is so exciting!\" She squealed. \"What do you mean by that?\" You ask. \"What's so weird about seeing a human? Dewa didn't seem shocked at all when we first met.\" Glacia smiled gently before speaking, \"Well Andrew, let me explain. You see, once very long ago our certain amount of great ancestors discovered this island and made it their home. For a long time, we made homes and developed societies without interference of any kind. But, we eventually got to the center of the island and that's when we discovered something incredible. We discovered a race of tiny creatures that we equal to our level of intelligence. For a long time our ancestors thought that we were the only species capable of talking and thinking logically. Image our ancestor's surprise when they discovered you humans.\" Glacia says enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our ancestors tried to become friends with the little humans, but to no avail. The humans were terrified of our ancestors because of their size. They thought they were monsters and wanted to destroy them. Apparently, the humans were never supposed to have existed on this island. Some kind of strange magical force had brought a group of humans to the island because they were supposed to fulfill a great destiny. But that generation wasn't the right group and therefore suffered greatly while they were here. Slowly, as our ancestors inhabited the island around them, they began to die because they lacked the resources to survive. Our ancestors tried desperately to help them, but the humans were too scared of them and always drove them away. Eventually, all of the humans left the area our ancestors found them and they were assumed to be dead. Eventually, most of us forgot about you humans and you became only a myth. The fact that you're here is truly a miracle.\" Glacia finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite knowledgeable young Glacia.\" A mysterious but feminine voice said, seemingly from nowhere.

You're not sure if it's because of fear or wonder, but you feel the urge to bow down in front of her and you do. There is a moment of silence but it is eventually interrupted by... giggling? Looking up, you notice that neither Glacia nor Dewa were bowing in front of Mew and that all three of them were laughing at you. \"Wh-what's so funny?\" You stammer in embarrassment. \"You are!\" Dewa says laughing. \"Why are you bowing?\" Glacia says amused. \"I-I thought it was expected with Mew. I thought she was important!\" You say incredibly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew doesn't request we bow to her.\" Dewa said, her laughter dying down. \"Most of the other legendaries don't either.\" You cheeks literally become red with embarrassment and you chuckle awkwardly and nervously. \"There's no need to be embarrassed.\" Mew said comfortingly. \"You would never have known that; so don't be embarrassed.\" This makes you feel a little better and your blushing reduces to a much less drastic shade. \"Forgive me if I'm being to frank Mew.\" Dewa began. \"But why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here to tell you a little story about your human friend. It's very important.\" Mew said. \"Will it tell me why I'm here?\" You ask timidly. Mew smiled gently, \"It will explain many things, and answer many of your questions. Are you all ready to hear it?\" The three of you nod and Mew begins to tell her story. \"It all happened long ago. A couple years after the humans on the island were presumed dead. Your ancestors had all settled down on the island and lived in relative peace. They enjoyed simple and happy lives for quite a long time. The only thing that ever bothered them was the fact that the humans had died and that your ancestors were unable to anything to help them. That's when everything changed. Your ancestors were attacked by an evil race known as \"The Night Crawlers\". Your ancestors were hopelessly outmatched until 'they' appeared. A group of nine heroic Pokemon resisted the Night Crawlers. The Nine easily beat back the vicious creatures and basically defeated them. But, they had not yet faced their greatest challenge. A gigantic Night Crawler known as \"The Destroyer\" attacked the heroes, seeking vengeance for its fallen brothers and sisters. The creature was too strong for the nine heroes and they would've been defeated if they had not combined their powers and destroyed it. All though The Destroyers physical form was destroyed, a spiritual essence remained of the creature. The nine heroes took that essence to another island and sealed it away behind an indestructible barrier in the back of the island's largest cave. With the world at peace again the 9 Hero\u2019s left the island never to be heard from again. But before they left they sent an essence from each one of the 9 Hero\u2019s to another dimension to find a successor. The successors of these hero\u2019s are known as Commit Children and have the amazing powers of the heroes. The peace the heroes brought to this world has lasted for a long time, but now it is beginning to fade.\" Mew finally finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" You say. \"What does this have to do with me? I mean I can't POSSIBLY be one of the Commit Children, right?\" You ask somewhat scared. \"Yes you are a Commit Child! And you will not be afraid of being one, because you can do it.\" Mew says sternly starring at you. You, Glacia, and Dewa were all incredibly shocked and couldn't believe it. \"You can't be serious Mew.\" Glacia and Dewa say in union. \"Oh, but I'm completely serious.\" Mew says. \"Andrew is a Commit Child and you two must protect him until he masters his powers and finds the other eight Commit Children.\" Mew commands. \"Could you at least tell me where the other Commit Children are? You must have talked to at least some of them already?\" You ask desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew giggles at you, \"I can't do that. That would make your job to simple; I can't do your job for you! It's your destiny, so you must find them yourself.\" You all finally accept your responsibilities and Mew is about to leave. But before she left she had a request for you. \"Could I give you a quick cuddle?\" She asks shyly. \"O-Of course.\" You say awkwardly. Mew floats over to you, gently levitates you into her hands, and cuddles you against her cheek \"You're the only one who's let me do that.\" You hear Mew in your mind. \"So far you're my favorite.\" Mew then sets you down and disappears in a puff of pink smoke. The three of you stand there in silence for quite some time. \"This just got a lot more interesting.\" You think.</span></div></div>",

But you caught her Glacia, but what was I thinking? I mean Andrew could never be so important.\" She said, indirectly being cruel. \"Excuse me!\" You say, irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I u-um didn't mean it like that.\" Dewa began nervously. \"It's just that your so small and-and young I assumed-\" \"You assumed I couldn't do anything important and that I'm a loser!\" You accuse. \"No, that's not what she-\" Glacia tried to say. \"Shut up Glacia! This is between me and Dewa, so stay out of this!\" You yell, actually making both of them flinch. \"I've tried to endure your guy's demeaning comments, but I can't stand it anymore! I'm not some cute little pet or thing you can control or talk about so freely. I am a human and your equal and I demand you treat me as such!\" You finish, literally screaming at the top of your lungs. After looking at the shocked look on Dewa's face and the teariness  in Glacia's eyes, you start thinking that maybe you overreacted and acted stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry guys! I didn't mean to-\" You begin desperately. \"Just save it!\" Dewa snapped at you calmly. But by the look of her face, she looked like she wanted to tear you apart. \"I don't want to hear it, any of it. You don't like us talking about you like that? Then leave! Because it will happen again at some point, and then you'll just get angry again. If you come back here <b>ever</b> again, you'll be dessert for my next meal! Get out of here!\" She says as she grabs you and tosses you out of her home. The giant door slams violently behind you, and you finally realize how badly you've messed up. \"Good job idiot! You couldn't control your temper and now you have nowhere to stay!\" You think angrily about yourself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNot wanting to be miserable all night, you head towards the pond where you and Dewa met. It wasn't the best place to stay, physically or mentally, but it was the only other place you could think of. When you get there, you splash some water on your face and try to think about what you should do. You were so hungry, but you didn't think you could find anything to eat so you just take a couple of big drinks of water. \"Now I just have to find a place to sleep.\" You thought, noticing the sky was becoming dark. You end up jumping onto a nearby lilly pad and just lay on that. You slowly brush the surface of the water with your hand as you drift along with your new, soggy bed. The cold night air chills your body to the bone as you lie there, no warmth at all. Your thoughts stray to your first night here. You were wrapped up comfortabely under Dewa's sheets while she laid next to you. You could feel the love and warmth radiating from her and you were happy. But now you were cold alone and miserable. All because you acted so stupidly. After hours of saddening thoughts, you finally manage to cry yourself to sleep.</span></div></div>",

I don't want Dewa to see you and I together, she'd probably get mad.\" Glacia sighed. \"You really should just come back to the house with me. You were right. You're not just a little pet that I can demean and take care of. You're an independent human being that can take care of himself. You just need help right now, so let me help you.\" Andrew did not respond. \"I know Dewa threatened you, but she didn't really mean it. It was just a spur of the moment kind of thing.

I don't want to go back!\" He shouted. Glacia shushed him. \"I'm not. I was just taking you onto the dry land because I'm sick of getting my paws wet in this pond. What were you thinking sleeping in there? You could have drowned or gotten stranded or lost.\" She stopped briefly, \"Sorry. I know that this is the kind of stuff you were talking about. Would you please say something? I need you to give me some kind of way to have you forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew got to his feet and looked up at Glacia. \"The thing is, you shouldn't have to apologize. I was being stupid and over reacted and shouldn't have yelled. I yelled at you and made you cry for goodness sake! You should be just as mad at me as Dewa. I convinced myself that there was no way either of you were going to forgive and that I would have to find a way to survive. But then you come tonight, probably just an hour or so after I did this awful thing to you and you forgive me. It makes me feel petty and stupid.\" Drew finally stopped his rant and took a deep breath. Glacia looked down at the little human who had just poured his heart out to her. She was touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all kinds of ridiculous. I don't have any problems with you coming back in the house. IF Dewa is still mad, then I'll keep you safe but you don't have to be afraid. Are you coming?\" She asked, somewhat embarrassed. Drew chuckled nervously. \"Well if you promise to keep me safe, I guess it beats sleeping outside.\" Glacia smiled, \"Great!\" She gently lifted Andrew with her mouth and quietly brought him to her room, trying her best not to wake Dewa. She set him down gently at the head of her bed. \"Tomorrow morning I'm going to have you and Dewa talk alright? You two need to make up. Now sleep tight, you'll be fine tonight.\" Andrew fell asleep quickly, exhausted by his odd day. Glacia placed her paw on top of him, \"Sleep tight Drew.

You tried not to worry, but you were pretty paranoid after the events of yesterday and soon start calling out for her. \"Hush Drew. There's no reason to yell this early in the morning. I was just talking with Dewa.\" Glacia said as she entered the room. You scramble to the foot of the bed. \"Did you tell her about me!? You weren't supposed to tell her!\" You ask accusingly and afraid. \"I wasn't going to, but she said she'd gone out to the pond this morning to talk to you, but you weren't there. Then she started freaking out and talked about searching for you and she got all dramatic about how you could be dead because of her. So I asked, 'Weren't you the one that chased him away?' That was a mistake because then she got mad and yelled at me, but then she got sad again and apologized. Then she started acting scared again, so I told her what happened last night to help her stop worrying.\" Glacia said going on and on. \"Glacia! How could!?\" You say frantically. \"Calm down! You should be happy! She was so concerned over your safety that I'm sure you two will make up in no time!\" Glacia said optimistically. \"If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I have to get ready for school so I'm going to take you to Dewa so you two can make up. Good luck.\" Without warning, Glacia carefully bit the collar of your shirt, brought you to the door, opened it, and set you outside before closing it. Before you could attempt to get back inside, you were ensnared by a world of black and lifted up. In a few moments you were set down on the table and saw Dewa staring at you with her head on her table. \"H-hello Dewa.\" You say nervously. \"Hey Drew.\" She replied. Following the awkward greeting was an awkward silence that lasted longer than it should have. \"S-so? How've you been?\" You ask trying not to be unnerved by her constant staring. \"Uh, about the same. It's only been one night and we basically slept away from each other.\" She replied. \"Oh good.\" You say with a nervous chuckle. \"This is ridiculous! Just apologize to her and be friends again!\" You thought to yourself. \"All right here it goes. Deep breath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Dewa says suddenly as you inhale. Her sudden outburst shocked you and you ended up choking on air. Dewa quietly got you a cap of water which you drank from after the initial fit passed. \"Are you alright?\" She asked patting your head gently. \"Yes I'm fine. There's no need to pat my head.\" You reply dryly. \"Oh good. Sorry about that, I know this is why you got mad in the first place. Let's just put this all behind us. I really hate drama and discussing yesterday would just be too dramatic for me. So, I apologize for threatening to eat you yesterday.\" Dewa said calmly. \"Apology accepted. Of course I'm not completely guilt free, I overreacted as well so I apologize as well.\" You reply. \"Okay that settles that. We should get going, the bus will come soon and I don't want to miss it-\" Dewa stops suddenly because without warning you had hugged her. \"I missed you Dewa.\" You whisper. \"Oh come on. It wasn't even half of a day! We were going to avoid all of the drama and now you do this! ...I missed you too.\" She said returning the hug the best she could. \"Ah! You two made up! That makes me so happy!\" Glacia cooed appearing form her room. \"B-be quiet Glacia!\" Dewa stuttered defensively. \"We have to get to school. Sorry Drew but you'll have to spend all day in my bag again.\" Glacia huffed. \"I could keep him with me you know! I'm taking the mythology class so we could learn why he's here or what Mew was talking about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does have a point you know Drew.\" Dewa said. \"I'll let you choose who you go with. Do you want to go with Glacia or me to school?\"</span></div></div>",

There had just been a lot of unnecessary drama and he wanted to make sure that his choice wouldn't cause anymore. \"Ugh, you're taking too long for something so simple.\" Dewa sighed suddenly. Not waiting for a response, Dewa grabbed her stuff and started heading to the door. \"You take him Glacia, I have to meet the others for practice after school anyways. I don't think he's ready for them yet.\" Without another word, Dewa walked out the door and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I choose Glacia?\" Drew said, trying to sound like he made the decision. Glacia simply giggled happily in response. \"That's more like the Dewa I know! I guess she was trying to be... motherly when she first met you.\" Glacia said aloud as she grabbed her stuff. Drew gently lowered himself off the table and into Glacia's bag when she motioned for him to. \"What do you mea?  You mean Dewa was acting differently before?\" He asked. Glacia hummed to herself a bit and shut the house's door before heading towards the bus stop. \"Yes, a lot different from my perspective. Usually she's blunt and aggressive and sassy and kind of rude But when she was around you, she acted more like me.\" There was silence for a moment as Drew tried to understand what Glacia meant. \"Like you? So sweet, loving, friendly, and gentle?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bag Drew was in began to shake violently and he was tossed about a bit. Glacia's smiling face peered into the bag and her shining eyes locked into Drew. \"Aw! You really think I'm all of that? You're so sweet!\" She said happily. As quickly as her head had gone into the bag, it dissapeared from Drew's sight. \"Anyways, yeah. Dewa was acting differently. But don't worry! Her normal self is just as lovable.\" Drew didn't entirely understand what Glacia meant but he had enough information to stay content. But something else was still bothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glacia! What was the practice Dewa was talking about?\" He asked. \"Hm? Dewa's practice? Well it's for-\" Glacia's explanation was cut short by a loud rumbling noise and a hiss of steam. \"Oh! That's the bus. I'll tell you about practice at lunch. Stay safe.\" Glacia said as she stepped onto the bus. \"Wait! Can't  we talk while you're on the bus?\" Drew asked, desperate to escape boredom and loneliness. He got no response, Glacia was already having a conversation with someone else. \"Huh might as well take a nap.\" Drew said sadly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The start of Drew's day with Glacia was the same as his day with Dewa. Unable to entertain himself, Drew slept through Glacia's first class in her bag. Glacia, paranoid about Drew's safety, kept looking into her bag to make sure he was safe. She was only able to stop checking on him when her classmate noted her strange behavior. \"Uh sorry I'm nervous because I have a... presentation and I keep thinking I forgot my notes.\" She lied, trying to sound genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next class, Drew was woken up by some kind of strange noise. The noise repeated for awhile and then stopped. Before Drew could return to his slumber, the noise started again. This happened several times before Drew's curiosity got the better of him. \"What could that noise possibly be?\" He thought. Glacia's stuff was conveniently stacked to make Drew a path to the opening in Glacia's bag. Drew began his descent, guessing in his mind what the noise could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the open if the bag and stuck his head out, he saw the last thing he thought he'd see. Glacia was operating a sewing machine, seemingly very skillfully. \"What? ...How is she doing that? She's a quadruped Pok\u00e9mon right? How is she even reaching the table?\" Drew thought as he shifted his attention to Glacia's rear paws. Her paws were balancing on a small stool helping to increase her height. \"I guess that explains how she's reaching the machine.\" Drew said aloud, giving up in figuring out how she was operating the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Glacia smiled to herself softly as she worked. She had originally been doing the extra sewing to stay ahead in her class but the moment since she learned about Drew's existence, she had decided to change her work to suit him. \"I hope I guessed his size right. It would have been easier to ask for his measurements, but I want this to be a surprise.\" She thought. Her ears twitched slightly in response to a tiny noise and she reflexively looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she noticed Drew poking outside of her bag, she checked her surroundings to make sure no one was looking and lowered her head to Drew, startling him in the process. \"What are you doing Drew?\" She started concerned. \"You need to stay hidden.\" Drew patted Glacia's nose dismissively. \"I heard a weird noise and had to check it out. I didn't know you could sew!\" He said somewhat excitedly. \"What are you making?\" Glacia paused for a moment before responding, \"That doesn't matter. You need to stay hidden.\" She said pulling away from him. She gently pushed Drew back into her bag with a forepaw before resuming her work. Drew, now content with the knowledge of what the mysterious noise was, eventually managed to settle back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the second class, Glacia wandered the crowded halls daydreaming. \"Hmm. What class were we discussing mythology in again? I only brought that up to get Dewa to let Drew stay with me, but I should probably actually take this seriously. It's not really even fun having Drew with me. I guess it's nice knowing a cute little buddy is in my bag, but that's also a stressful thought.\" Glacia thought to herself. As she continued to daydream, she suddenly collided with another Pok\u00e9mon in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment of the collision, Glacia's bag got thrown from her grasp and its contents flew everywhere, including Drew. He happened to be awake when he was thrown out of the bag and it was quite the terrifying experience. He wasn't exactly a fan of heights,and flying through the air at high speed completely unprotected in a world of giant Pok\u00e9mon wasn't anymore agreeable with him. Fortunately, he was able to survive the fall safety under some of the lockers, he only lost his consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlacia groaned softly as she recovered from the collision. \"Ugh. I'm sorry. That was my fault. I was day dreaming pretty hard.\" Glacia said. Once the pain subsided a bit, Glacia looked at who she collided with. She was surprised to see that it was a young Espurr, likely from the younger grades in the school. The Espurr picked itself off the ground and dusted itself off. \"No need to apologize.\" It said in a cute, young and female voice. \"We were both obviously not paying attention, I'm sorry too.\" Glacia giggled happily in response. \"Aw, you're one of those cute younger kids from the lower classes! Why are you all the way over here?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was assigned to one of the older students to observe the classes and how they work.\" The Espurr explained. \"My name is Espa by the way.\" Glacia slipped her bag back onto herself and began to gather her things. \"Espa is a cute name. I'm Glacia.\" She responded. \"I can't believe I never thought of signing up for that program! I love kids like Espa, that'd be the best!\" Glacia thought to herself. \"Glacia is a nice name too! I'll help you pick up your things.\" Espa smiled. She used her psychic powers to gather up Glacia's things and quietly slipped them into Glacia's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah wow. I wish I had strong psychic powers like yours! It would make stuff easier.\" Glacia sighed. Espa nodded lightly. \"Yeah, it can be really helpful. I should get going now, thanks for not getting angry.\" Espa said moving past Glacia. \"Bye bye! I hope you have fun observing classes!\" Glacia called back. \"That settles that! I'm signing up for that program next chance I get.\" Glacia resumed her trek down the hall, feeling like she forgot something. Does she realize that Drew wasn't in her bag anymore?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span></span>Glacia was too occupied with her new idea to let her sense of forgetting something to distract her. She was positively giddy with excitement just thinking about her new idea. <span class=\"clteal\">\"Oh, I definitely I need to sign up for that program! I would <i>love</i> to chaperone some of the younger kids around school. I wonder where I would sign up for that... maybe the student council? I love kids so much that I might make this a regular thing!\"</span> With those thoughts holding her full attention, Glacia began to subconsciously skip down the hall. Her skipping caused a lot of problem for the other Pok\u00e9mon in the hall and moved her further and further away from Andrew. She wouldn't realize her mistake until much later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Andrew was completely out cold underneath the lockers. Thankfully his flight didn't seem to injure him too badly but it certainly didn't leave him with the ability to remain conscious. The physical impact was so sever that it sent him spiraling into the world of his psyche. The transition to his psyche was incredibly bizarre for him. One moment he was trying to keep his balance in Glaica's bag, then he flew out of the bag with no explanation, and then he was in some empty white void. He looked all around him in total confusion. \"Where in the world did I end up?\" Drew gasped. He jumped in surprise as his words echoed repeatedly all around him and then settled into silence. \"Glacia?\" He whispered to himself, hoping in vain that she'd suddenly appear and comfort him. The only response he got was more echoes of his voice. Andrew groaned, very frustrated with his current situation. \"Oh, this is great! I ended up in another weird place I know nothing about and this is by far the worst one yet. Why is the Pok\u00e9mon world so strange!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a new voice echoed around him from nowhere. <span class=\"cpink\">\"That's a pretty funny thing for you to say considering that this is you <i>human</i> psyche. Hate to break it to you, but there's nothing Pok\u00e9mon about this place... well accept for me.\"</span> The voice sounded oddly familiar to Andrew, but he couldn't really figure out who it was because of the echo. Suddenly he felt the uncomfortably familiar sensation of being taken into the grasp of a gigantic creature. Naturally, fear coursed through Andrew's body and he began to struggle against the grip of his captor. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Hey! Hey! Relax, it's just me!\"</span> The voice said for what was probably an attempt to get Andrew to calm down. Obviously, it didn't work and Andrew continued to struggle against the grip that was holding him. After being forcibly dragged through the air, his vision was suddenly filled with Mew's face, a playful smirk upon her lips. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Man, it's a good thing I'm a gentle Pok\u00e9mon. You'd never survive an encounter with some big mean one.\" </span> Mew giggled. Andrew meanwhile was stunned at the sight of the legendary Pok\u00e9mon but instantly felt more comfortable than before. He allowed his body to relax in Mew's grip and in response Mew opened up her fist and let him rest on her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew, what's going on!?\" Andrew asked after he had relaxed enough. \"Why am I in my uh... psyche, or whatever it is, and why are you here?\" The look on Mew's face after he asked that question did not make Andrew happy.<span class=\"cpink\"> \"Well... uh might as well start with the bad news.\"</span> Mew laughed awkwardly. <span class=\"cpink\">\"From what I can tell, you're currently completely unconscious. It seems like you've been that way for nearly the entire day because it's night time in the physical world. And you're not with Glacia or Dewa at the moment... in fact you're with two completely different Pok\u00e9mon. Oh, but the one I can sense holding you right now doesn't seem bad!\"</span> If Andrew wasn't already unconscious, he probably would've fainted. \"Wh-what do you mean I'm with two strange Pok\u00e9mon!? What happened to Glacia!?\" Mew quietly patted Andrew on the face, trying to calm him down.<span class=\"cpink\"> \"Don't worry, these new two are really nice! ...Probably. I mean they haven't killed you yet or even thought about it so that's good.\"</span> \"That doesn't matter! They can still decide to do it later or make me their slave! If you can see them why don't you rescue me from them!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew sighed, she shouldn't have even bothered trying to comfort him, of course he'd be scared.<span class=\"cpink\"> \"I can't rescue you because I can't see them. I can only sense their auras as an extension of your own. Besides, I can't solve your problems for you, how're you going to get used to this world if you can't solve your own problems?\"</span> Andrew, sensing that he wouldn't be able to get Mew's help quietly sulked to himself. \"Is this because I'm one of those comet people or whatever they were called?\" At the mention of that title, Mew's eyes lit up and she smiled.<span class=\"cpink\"> \"Oh, That reminds me about the good news I had for you! It turns out that I got the timelines wrong when I spoke to you. I won't go into the details since it's already super confusing for me, but the point is, you aren't some super important savior of the world. In fact, there's nothing even remotely evil or dangerous about anything in this world! ...Well except for the fact that you're adorably tiny but hey, that's only worked to your advantage so far!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew remained silent for a few moments before speaking. \"So... I'm not some super important savior? And that weird vision I had when I first got to this world with that creepy ghost thing was pointless?\" Mew nodded excitedly. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Yep! I was the one that made you have that vision because at the time I thought you were one of the commit children. Those people never even existed in this timeline, so you're all clear.\"</span> Andrew could feel his jaw drop and his head began to hurt. \"Well, why did I even end up here then!? If I don't have any mission here why I am I even here!? Just to be some kind of pet for giant Pok\u00e9mon?\" He grumbled completely confused. Mew's face quickly twisted into a sad smile and patted Andrew on the head. <span class=\"cpink\">\"No no, that's not it at all! I looked into what your life was like as a human, don't ask how I did it, and figured out why you're here. You were pretty lonely back in your world. You lived alone for some reason and were anti-social and didn't interact with others very much. This was the universe's way of making your life better by giving you some friends!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew laughed awkwardly in response. \"I guess it kind of worked... Dewa and Glacia are nice. And so are you, Mew.\" He added hastily. \"But couldn't the universe have used a less extreme method!? I mean why didn't it just give me a human friend or like a pet? Did it really have to send me to a world where I'm so small and fragile? If I couldn't interact with humans or something weird like that, couldn't it have just brought one of you guys to my world? I mean, this is a pretty extreme solution for anti-social behavior!\" Mew shook her head. <span class=\"cpink\">\"I think sending a Pok\u00e9mon over to your world would've been really bad. I mean you didn't change height when you came to our world. We Pok\u00e9mon are just gigantic. Dewa or Glacia could probably destroy your old home with a stomp or two.\"</span> \"Wow, that's honestly terrifying to imagine.\" Andrew responded, trying to laugh. \"But I guess my situation isn't too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, Andrew suddenly began to seemingly fade away from existence. \"W-wait! What's going on Mew!?\" He moaned. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Oh, seems like you're waking up! Don't worry, I'm sure the two new Pok\u00e9mon you meet will be lovely, good luck!\"</span> Mew gave Andrew a quick wave goodbye before disappearing in a ball of light. \"Oh yeah, I forgot about that part of my situation.\" Andrew gulped. Pretty soon, Andrew had completely faded out of his psyche and was returning to the physical world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Andrew began to wake up in the physical world he felt an odd mixture of feelings and emotions. He felt warm, but also cold and safe, but also not safe. It didn't really make any sense to him. Slowly, he tried to stretch his body, but he was meant with a surprising amount of resistance. He realized that he was in the disturbingly familiar sensation of being grasped by something. No wonder he was having all of those conflicting emotions! He was surprisingly comfortable with whatever was holding him, but his survival instincts were resisting the comfort because he had no idea who was holding him. Any feeling of comfort was instantly replaced with cold fear when he heard some voices uncomfortably close to him. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh! It looks like the little creature is awake now!\"</span> Said one voice. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"I can tell, it felt like the thing was trying to escape.\"</span> Unable to do anything else, Andrew tried to pierce through the darkness and see what Pok\u00e9mon he had been collected by while he was unconscious. Once his eyes finally adjusted to the lighting, he discovered that the two Pok\u00e9mon were...</div></div>",

He doesn't remember his real name, because all his parents would ever call him was twerp. He was abandoned age 5, and was forced to watch over, and protect himself. It's been 7 years since he last saw his parents. He doesn't even remember them at all. He was never very social since the day he was left alone. So he normally tries to stay hidden in the shadows. He isn't emo, but his clothes, and hair blend in well with the shadows. Not to mention they make him feel comforted for some reason. He has an amazing singing voice, and the only thing he had when his parents left him was a guitar witch he always played. Though the only song he knows how to play is Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, by Green Day. The one thing he hates though is seeing people in pain, or upset. He feels sympathy for those being hurt both physically, and emotionally. If he sees someone being physically hurt, he'll jump in, and start kicking the attacker's ass. If he sees someone crying he tries to comfort them. He currently lives in a dark cave in the woods.</span></div></div>",

I walk up a sloped road next to a soccer field. I yawn, drowsy from early wake up. I stop and close my eyes. I tell myself \"its for a few seconds.\" When I opened my lead-heavy eyes, The fog became more dense. My sight was obscured, losing sight my surrounding. <br>\r\nI began to feel slight tremors. Then a deep voice \"COME ON... YENA, RIKO, LUNA, WERE GOING BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.\" I turn to the sound of shouting. The fog dissipates and I find myself on a trail with ginormous towering trees, I stand paralyzed with shock. \"I don't remember walking on this path to the bus stop.\" I mutter to myself. <br>\r\nThe tremors became powerful, I stumble toward the roots of a nearby tree. The tremors stop as the last one knocks me on the ground. I look upward at the cause. A massive Mightyena the size of a three-story building appeared. I made use of my small size and hid low against one of the roots. A Houndour walked next to it. It was slightly smaller than the Mightyena, but equally massive and terrifying to me. I held back my breathe a little and hoped they would walk off. The Mightyena spoke, \"I'm sorry for my siblings, they can be sluggish in the morning. You can go on without me Ruby.\" Then Ruby the Houndour replied, \"It's okay Ren, I can wait.\" Then three Poochyena walked over. \"Sorry big brother, we're tired.\" One of them spoke. Then the three yawned in unison. <br>\r\nI closed my eyes, It felt like I was dreaming, and maybe I was. the poochyena were the size of a large truck. \"What's This Thing?\" The voice I opened my eyes to ended up being one the poochyena, two meters from my position, with crimson eyes locked on to mine. I stood up and tried to slowly back away. I back up against the tree forgot about. I'm trapped between a tree and five humongous canine Pokemon. <br>\r\nThe Poochyena tried to take a step forward, but the Mightyena spoke, \"Riko step back from it.\" Riko stopped and looked up to Ren. \"But big brother.\" Ren answered with an intimidating glare, and Riko submissively stepped away. Then one named Ren got close and tried to lower himself to my level. \"I'm sorry, forgive my little brother Riko. My name is Ren.\" Ren said with a gentle demeanor. I nervously spoke, \"I'm Wyatt.\" I was sure to be careful around Ren, he put his younger brother in his place with just a glare. \"So you can speak. Well Wyatt, can you tell me more about yourself?\" Ren asked. I was at a loss for words. I collected myself and explained my situation. I thought if I just complied with whatever he asked, it would be less trouble. \"So you're a human, and you were going to school, but you somehow found yourself here. Strange, I've heard of humans, but I thought you guys were a myth. I'll help you get back to your home the best I can, and I'll keep you safe too.\" Ren replied. I felt less anxious around Ren, he seemed more genuine and mature, and he made my situation seem less stressful, maybe I can trust him </span></div></div>",

Ruby had a small smile, but she kept to herself. \"You said you all were going to your school. is that right Ren?\" I asked. \"Yeah.\" Ren replied. \"Are you all students, and what's it like there?\" Ren spoke, \"Yes, all of us are, the young ones here are in a beginners course. Ruby and I are in a more advanced course, we all learn basic math, reading and writing, some extracurriculars, and a battle strategies class. Once we're in the advance course, we choose to advance in dungeon exploration or gym battles. The classes are okay and the other students there can be tolerable, but I'll have to ask you to stay hidden for your safety.\" \"Okay Ren, I will stay out of sight.\" I replied. we get to the end of the trail and the Pokemon school comes into view. Along with several other students. I ask, \"Um, is there a good place for me to hide Ren?\" \"Just hide in the fur on my back for now.\" I slide down the back of Ren's head, into the black fur on his back. It was thick enough to conceal me. <br>\r\nThey continued on as if I didn't exist. Ruby left for her homeroom. Ren dropped off Riko, Yena, and Luna at their homerooms. Then headed to his homeroom, on his way, he got a hello from a group Pokemon, I had to guess were his friends. he is the first and only Pokemon who enters his homeroom and sits at his desk near the back. \"Wyatt, are you doing okay?\"  I pop my head out and reply with \"Yes.\" \"Luckily, we'll be in the library for my first period, I'll find what information I can, Also I'll find good spots throughout the day for you to pop your head out for quick breathers, okay.\" I nodded in confirmation and dove back in his fur. <br>\r\nThe classroom was filled in seconds, and the first bell rang. Ren sat quietly as the other students conversed with each other. The same group of Pokemon that greeted him, tried to pull him into one of their conversations, he gave some small talk, but went quiet again. Then a Zoroark entered the room and walked to the desk up front. She began the roll call, at some point she calls on Ren, \"Here!\" he answers. Then we wait for the next bell. Ren's fur gives a nice, warm feeling and his rhythmic breathing forces my eyes shut. \"For a few seconds.\" I whisper to myself as take a \"quick\" nap.   </span></div></div>",

It felt unfair to take a nap in the fur of my new friend, but I close my eyes once more. \"Wyatt, I'm in a good spot in the library, you can take a breather.\" I pop out to Ren's voice, with eyes still shut. I pry my eyes open, \"Sorry, I'm not a morning person, And your fur feels great to be honest. I'll try my best stay awake.\" Ren replies, \"I understand, it can be a torture to stay awake. You can rest in my fur for awhile. I'll find what I can and tell you as soon as you wake up.\" I didn't think he'd be this understanding. \"Thank you, but why are you helping me?\" I ask. \"It seemed right, and I think it's better for me to help you before someone unfavorable gets ahold of you.\" Before I can respond another Pokemon called out to Ren. I duck back into Ren's fur quickly. I peer out a little, and it was another Mightyena, but it was slightly bigger than Ren. <br>\r\n\"Good morning Riku, how is your morning?\" Ren said giving his attention to the books on the shelf in front of him. \"Its been okay. Are you staying after school? The battle club wants know if you're coming today?\" Ren moves away slightly.\"I can't Riku, I have important stuff to do today.\" Riku Replies, \"Are you sure, you've missed three weeks. if it's about your brother and sisters...\" Ren cuts him off, \"No, I'm just not interested in battling, and I already told you I have stuff to do.\" Riku tries to add a \"but\", but Ren gives a menacing glare.\"I thought I said no!\" Ren is slightly smaller, and he can terrifyingly put others in their place with only a glare. I definitely know not to mess with Ren. He's been nice enough, but it's terrifying to question him, which I'm glad I didn't. Riku walks off. I pop back out and look up to Ren. <br>\r\n\"Wyatt... Do I terrify you?\" Ren asked in a low voice. \"You can be... but you've been kind to me... And we've just met.\" I replied. We both remained silent for a few minutes. \"I know I can trust you though.\" I blurted out. Ren looked surprised at what I said. \"You trust me?\" \"Yes, because you're proving it by helping me.\" I replied. \"If you trust me enough, then I promise to never let anyone harm you.\" He said as he stared at me with gentle, but determined eyes. I gave him a nod and ducked once more into his fur. Ren went back to searching for answers. <br>\r\nBefore the period ended, Ren found material that referenced humans. He told me he would go over it during lunchtime. I rest through a couple of periods until we are...</span></div></div>",

I notice he's walking outside. \" Yeah, I just woke up.\" I replied as I yawned. \"Sorry, but it will be better if you're awake. We're in my dungeon exploration class, and the possibility of a battle will happen.\" Ren said. \"I understand, and don't worry I feel more awake now that I got some rest. I'll keep my grip tight during the fight.\" I replied. He nods as he continues on.<br>\r\n\"Is this class held outside?\" I ask \"Sometimes, there are training grounds around the school, we're heading to the Forest Dungeon.\" Ren answered. I was gonna ask another question, but I hid back in Ren's fur as two Pokemon greeted him. One was a Grovyle, the other was a Braviary. They both were more massive than Ren. Ren greeted them back, \"Hello, Skylar... Sakura. Do any of you know who we're up against for today's course.\" The Braviary, Skylar answered, \"We'll be up against Arcanine's team.\" Then Sakura added,\" It'll be a challenge since it's them.\" Then I heard Ren asked, \"Sakura, Skylar, I can't tell you why, and it might be a lot to ask, but can you keep my back protected?\" They  both nodded in agreement without question. Ren and the other Pokemon arrive at their destination. <br>\r\nThe same Zoroark from homeroom was there waiting for all her students to arrive. She begins a brief lecture and states objective of today's assignment. \"For today, two teams will be racing for a flag In this forest, both teams must find and battle for the flag. The team that finds the flag must bring it back here to win the match. Team Ren and Team Arcanine are today's matchup.\" I tried to get a glimpse of the opposing team, Ren was going against. It was Arcanine as the Leader, then Weavile, and Dewott. Arcanine walks up to Ren, \"Let's make this a great match, good luck.\"  Ren looks up to him unfazed by the fact that his opponent is many times larger than he is. \"Sure, whatever.\" Ren replies walking away. It felt nerve-racking, my grip tightened as Ren walked toward his teams entrance. Ren whispered as he felt my tug \"It will be a rough ride Wyatt, but I'll keep you safe.\"  </span></div></div>",

He dashes through the root covered terrain effortlessly. His two teammates, Sakura and Skylar were following behind him. Ren looks back to Skylar giving him a silent command. Skylar soaring through the air, ascends above the trees out of sight. After two minutes while running, Skylar returns and gives his aerial assessment. \"I've spotted the flag, continue running forward. There will be clearing up ahead.\" Ren replies, \"That's too easy... What about the other team, did you see anyone from that group?\" \"No, I haven't seen any of them.\" Skylar answered. Ren gives a warning. \"Skylar... Sakura... Stay alert, They might be plotting an ambush.\" \"Right\" Skylar and Sakura spoke simultaneously. <br>\r\nThey stop at the edge before the forest clearing. The flag could be seen under a tree in the middle of the clearing. The tree was five meters away from a stream of water. Ren gives Sakura one of his silent commands. She uses double team and rushes toward the flag, Then a fire based attack was launched at her. She dodges, and Ren sends another silent signal. Skylar ascends to provide air support. Ren jumps out in the clearing to support Sakura. As he did, Arcanine charges toward Sakura. I tightened my grip on Ren as he leapt in front of Sakura. He then moved low and quick within Arcanine's range. Arcanine's momentum shifted as he hesitated, and Ren used his bite attack, latching on to Arcanine's neck, lifting the large hound Pokemon off the ground, over him and slams him to the ground with a monumental \"Boom.\" I recollect myself from Ren's monumental feat and notice a Pokemon's shadow. Midair, Weavile was launching his attack on Ren's backside. I noticed Ren was distracted, so I tugged on his fur to alert him. Ren notices and splashes a sand attack at Weavile with his left back paw. Blinding his attacker, Weavile drops to the ground. <br>\r\nRen releases Arcanine and shouts \"Sakura the water!\" seconds before Dewott jumps out, attacking with razor shell. Sakura reacts and counters with leaf blade, leaving both to a stalemate. Arcanine tries to recover with a fire attack, but got shutdown by Skylar swooping down and pinning him to the ground. I was astonished by Ren's battling. He countered two attacks without a scratch and noticed an attack before it was launched. He was well coordinated with his teammates, they moved flawlessly, even without him barking a command. Ren turns to Weavile.  He recovers from Ren's sand attack. Ren charges at Weavile, connecting a headbutt. Weavile gets pushed back, but endures the attack. He begins to taunt Ren to attack. I tug on Ren's fur to caution him, I'm no battle expert, but I could tell that Weavile has something shady planned. Ren takes my tug to heart and keeps his cool. Until Weavile baited him again \"What's wrong Ren, afraid to attack with that tiny human on your back.\" Everyone, even I was surprised with the words that came out of his mouth. \"I saw you in the library this morning. I know about that insignificant creature hiding in your fur.\" I could feel vibrations running off Ren's body, his fur stood up, growling was produced. Ren got in a protective stance. I tugged once more at Ren's fur, but it did little effect to calm him down. It was clear, Ren was about ripe out a throat, and Weavile was baiting him, pushing the buttons no one  expected him to push. \"Come on Ren, little Wyatt might get hurt! Why do you think I tried to attack from behind.\" Ren rushed furiously toward him. Weavile sneaks an ice beam attack, freezing one of Ren's back paws to the ground, causing Ren to lurch forward and plummet to the ground. I lose my grip and fly out of Ren's fur.\"Oh No... Ren!\" I shout as I plummet to the ground two inches in front of Ren's face. The landing knocks the air out of me. <br>\r\n\"No! Wyatt... Please be okay.\" Ren cried out. \"Yeah Wyatt, please be okay!\" Weavile mocking Ren. I tried to pull in whatever air I could get. Ren glared furiously at Weavile for his mockery. I uttered until I got my voice back, \"Ren stop...\" I slowly sit up. Ren stares down at me. \"Ren, you need to calm down. He's baiting you... playing you... he wants you to make your mistakes. I know you're better than that.\" \"But you got hurt...\" Ren whimpered. \"It was only a little fall. I'll be okay.\" I said as I stood up, giving Ren a thumbs-up. \"Wow Ren, I didn't think you'd be this pathetic around an insignificant creature like that human. If I had your reputation and skill, it would be a completely different story. I'm going to take the human, but don't worry, I won't go overboard and kill him. It's time I end this.\" Weavile spoke while charging his ice beam. Ren took his right paw, and pulled me into his chest. He held himself over me to shield me from the attack. Then Skylar and Sakura jumped in front of Ren to guard the two of us. \"What the..!\" Weavile yelled as a loud \"Thud\" was heard. A familiar voice called out, \"Sorry kids, but I'm calling this match.\" Ren loosened his grip. I peer out to the voices origin. \"Mrs. Kino...\" Ren uttered. It was the Zoroark, holding down Weavile. \"Class is dismissed, and I want everyone here in my office now! Including you human!\" She commanded.<br>\r\nRen pulls himself free from the ice. \"So you're the reason Ren asked us to defend him.\" Sakura said as her and Skylar strolled up to us.\"Yeah, I'm sorry for causing trouble.\" I replied. \"Don't apologize, we wished Ren would confide in us more. I'm Skylar, it's a pleasure to meet you.\" \"Yeah, and I'm Sakura.\" I introduce myself, \"I'm Wyatt Jackson. just call me Wyatt.\" Once I said my name, the Zoroark gave a look I couldn't explain. Ren nudged my back with his crimson nose. I turn to him. His ears drooped and he looked toward the ground. \"I'm sorry... Wyatt... I got reckless and it got you hurt.\" I began to stroke his muzzle and looked up to his eyes. \"Ren, I told you I'm okay, and I'm not upset at you. I'm happy that it didn't turn out too badly, and come on... You were awesome!\" Ren's face started to lighten up and I heard tail wagging. \"I was?!\" What I said cheered him up. Ren lowers himself and motions for me to climb on him. I sat on top of his head and stroked his fur. \"You promised to protect me, so I'll promise to stay by your side, okay.\" Ren happily barked, \"Okay!\" We all left the forest and followed Mrs. Kino to her office. It looked like she dismissed the entire class before she stopped the battle. I wonder what she'll say when we get to her office.</span></div></div>",

Ren and I were outside her office as she gave Weavile a lecture along with a detention. Then one by one she pulled others from the incident in her office. Quietly having her one on one discussions. Minutes went by, until Sakura exits. \"You may enter Ren! Thank you Sakura, and can you close the door behind Ren.\" Ren enters the office and the door behind him was shut. \"Wyatt, you can come out. Ren help him on to my desk\" Kino commands. I climb out of Ren's fur back to the top of his head. Ren walk to the desk and lets me off. Kino begins, \"How long has it been since you've arrived, and how long have you've both known each other? Tell me everything.\" Ren was about to speak, \"No Ren, I want to hear this from Wyatt.\" Kino interrupted. I told her everything I knew that happened. She took a few minutes to process what I said. \"I know why you're here Wyatt, but before I tell you both...\" Kino walks over to Ren. She grabs and violently shakes him yelling, \"REN, YOU IDIOT! I thought I taught you better than to act recklessly! Not only that, you brought Wyatt into a dangerous mock battle too, you're lucky I intervened when I did!\" she stops and releases him. \"It would've been a horrific end if I didn't... Not for you, but for Wyatt. Don't do anything stupid like that again! Do you understand!\" Ren wore the look of disappointment, and replies, \"Yes Ma'am.\"  <br>\r\nKino's gaze turned to me. \"Now Wyatt, tell me... How's Izzy been doing.\" I stared at Kino with shock as she wore a grin. \"How do you know my nana's name?\" I asked.  She replies. \"Well... She's a nana now. I can't imagine her at an old age. She was my partner, and like you she found herself here too. I'm shocked she never mentioned me to you.\" It was too much to process, I wondered what more she had to say. \"She used to visit sometimes. Too bad she lost her abilities... Wyatt you're one of the next set of children here to help us.\" I looked to Ren, he sat attentively. I turned back to Kino. \"There's a darkness sealed away under the island, and you're here because of it. Your nana and I, along with many others battled that darkness many years ago. You're a Shadow Child, one of the children. What you did was pass safely over between our worlds. Only you are born with this ability to do so, like Izzy and your Mother.\" I shout with shock, \"Wait... My Mom was here too!?\" \"Yes, like you they found themselves here. They came here for their first time without knowing how or why. Izzy was a young girl when she came here. I was a Zorua when we met.\" Kino paused and looked as if she were reminiscing her time with her human friend. \"Sorry to interrupt, but you said Nana lost her abilities, what happened?\" A frown appeared on Kino's face, \"Your Mother came to this world, but in the wrong place and at a terrible time. It was a while since Izzy visited, but she came to me at night, she was worried for her daughter, and knew her daughter would appear here someday. I helped Izzy track down your Mom. We found her next to the seal. We named you a Shadow Child, because of your ability to draw power and manipulate your own shadows. One of the creatures we sealed... it took both their shadows from them. The loss weakened them both. I got them both away from the seal. Helped them get back to your world, but I never saw them again. What happened to them afterward remained a mystery to me. It's why I asked about Izzy.\"<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Kino, you said Wyatt was one of the children. Who are the others, and how do you know we need Wyatt's help?\" Ren asks. Kino replies, \"I don't know who the others are, but I've spotted from dusk to night to dawn 8 of the children falling from the sky. It's a sign that the seal is breaking, and I believe someone foolish is trying to release that darkness. Ren do you recall the Legend of the Nine Heroes?\" Ren nodded at the question. \"Yeah, the heroes of Joy, Sorrow, Rage, Peace, Courage, Wisdom, Willpower, Light, and Darkness. Why are you asking?\" Kino answers, \"Wyatt... Ren... you both are going to have to fight tough opponents. From fellow Pokemon, dark creatures, and some of the other children. Remember you both have to work together along with the other 8 children. I'm limited with what I can do, and I have to monitor everything that's going on in this place, so I can't help you 100% of the way. I want you both to be careful, find and meetup with the other children.\" I turn back to Ren and we nod to each other. \"Before I dismiss you both, I have something for you Wyatt.\" Kino pulls out something wrapped in cloth between her two claws. She hands me the parcel. I unwrap the cloth to find a stack of notebooks. \"Before Izzy left for good, she left me notes to give you. It's on everything you want to know. There's info on how to use your shadow, the Night Creatures, what little she know on the other children and more.\" I climb back on Ren's head, and thank Mrs. Kino, \"Thank you! And Mrs. Kino... Izzy's doing fine, I can see where my nana gets her spunk from.\" Kino smiled and dismissed us. I stash the books in my bag, and hid back in Ren's fur. The school bell rings, Ren chimes \"It's lunch time!\"  </span></div></div>",

I didn't see you grab anything on the way out.\" I replied. \"Don't worry, It's already there.\" Ren answered. I turn and lie on my back. I watch the white cloud filled sky as Ren walked. I close my eyes and listen to the surrounding sounds. Ren's paws lightly hitting the ground, his rhythmic breathing, the wind blowing, the birds chirps and flying. \"Do you go to this mystery spot with food already there, often?\" I ask. \"Since I was a Poochyena, the cafeteria can get obnoxiously loud.\" Ren answers. \"I get it. I hate when it gets loud, and talking over it can be a...\" \"Pain.\" Ren finishes. \"Yeah...\" I reply. \"It's a great to be outside today, the clouds are nice.\" I said. \"Yeah.\" Ren replies. \"<br>\r\n\"Now that we know what's going on. What should we do now?\" I ask. I wait for Ren's answer, \"...I don't know, why are you asking me?\" \"Well, I want you to have a say in what we do, and I feel like you always know what to do.\" I answer. Ren stops walking. \"I don't know where to start...\" I open my eyes and sit up. \"Ren, It's okay... To be honest, I have no idea what I should do. I've been useless, and you're doing all the work. I can't do this by myself, but I can't let you do it by yourself either. You're my friend Ren.\" Ren starts walking again, but he doesn't respond. After five minutes, Ren stops, \"We're here, Wyatt.\" Ren spoke.  \"Are you upset with me?\" I ask. I feel Ren lower himself down to the ground gently. \"Wyatt, come on down.\" I froze. \"Wyatt, please come on down.\" I was frightened, thinking that I messed up. I stand up and climb down his left side. He stands up and faces me. I'm staring at the ground. \"Wyatt, I'm not upset. Why do you think I'm upset at you.\" I shrug. \"Wyatt, I'm surprised you would call me your friend, I enjoy being with you, and you aren't useless!\" Ren replied. I looked up to him, and he continued, \"You helped me in battle by only tugging on my fur, you calmed me down when I got reckless, and you've stayed positive throughout your time with me. We have more information, and I want you to have a say too. I'll do what you need me to do. Don't be afraid ask me for guidance. I'll always be here to help.\" Ren walks over to a nearby tree and uses a headbutt on it. A few large apples fell from the tree. Ren picks one up and brings it over. He placing it before me. \"Before we decide on what to do. We should eat!\" Ren said lying down, wagging his black, furry tail. <br>\r\nRen takes a claw and shaves a large piece of the apple off for me. I take the piece and sit right next to his left paw. We silently eat our apple. Ren was right, his secret spot was peaceful. We sat under a tree, facing a pond of water in front of us. I listen to the sounds of water, as it entered and exited its' reservoir. I finish my apple and pull out the notebooks from my bag. There were Ten color-coded notebooks, one for me, one on the creatures, and one on each child. Ren finishes his apple and looks over. I turn to him. \"Which one should I pick up first?\" I ask Ren. \"We could do your's first.\" Ren answers. \"Before I pick up my book. Mrs. Kino told us to find the other children, Right?\" I ask. \"Yeah, what do you want to do?\" Ren asked. \"I think finding them all will be a pain, so before we meetup with any of them we should let them gather on their own. If they're like me, they might be partnered with a Pokemon already.\" Ren nods, \"When we get back, we'll covertly scout for any potential partnerships. When we find one of the children, we'll wait for the rest to gather and then join. While they're gather, we can use the time to gain more information and we'll train too.\" I finish. \"Yeah, the window of time we'll have before we join them is enough to give us a chance to prepare. Mrs. Kino never said when we should join them, so let's use the time we have.\" Ren agreed. I turn back to the notebooks and pick up mine. I flip the black cover over to view page one.<br>\r\nI flip through the thin, black book to see how much info there was, It was filled. I flip back to page one and begun reading out loud. \"Log 1. Isabel. Once again I've lost. I've taken on everyone of the other kids. They're already mastering their abilities. I can only manage paralysis with my shadow, and force my target to mimic my movements. Kino has been supportive with my training, but I'm frightened, I don't want to hurt anyone. Kino told me I should let her focus on the fighting, but I don't want to leave it all to her. I want to get stronger to support her!\" After the first couple of sentences, I realized it. \"This is a diary!\" I said, Under the paragraph were sketches of a shadow technique, and under that were requirements for the technique. I get up for an attempt, but before I start, I hear a bell. \"Lunch is over.\" Ren spoke. I close the book and put the notes in my bag. \"I guess we're pushing pause on my book.\" Ren lowers himself, and I climb on. I ask Ren, \"Do you remember what to do when we get back.\" Then Ren answers, \"Yeah, I'll keep a look out during my last remaining periods.\" We nod to each other. I hide back in Ren's fur. </span></div></div>",

Its sheer size had you terrified, and in a desperate attempt to scare it away, you immediately screamed out at the top of your lungs. The instant that the scream left your lungs, the massive figure seemingly jumped backward in fear before turning around and curling up into a ball. You then heard several sniffles and realized that your plan had worked a little too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the massive creature was, you had just scared it to tears. You couldn't believe it, but the enormous being whose mighty stature completely dwarfed your own was even more terrified than you were. You could tell that it was trembling, and you saw several large teardrops falling. Seeing how scared this thing was of you, you felt absolutely terrible about what you did. Reaching out, you proceed to stroke the large creature's back to try and calm it down. Unfortunately, in its nervous state, this had the opposite effect. The instant that your hand touched its back, the creature jumped and backed away from you nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please don't hurt me!\" it cried out in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that its voice was like that of a very young girl; and given the feminine voice, you made out that the creature was in fact female. Wanting to calm her down after your little stunt made her so terrified, you speak up in a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you. I'm sorry for yelling at you, so please don't be afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? Y-you promise that you're not going to hurt me?\" she said, trying to wipe the tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I couldn't even hurt you if I wanted to. To be honest, I only screamed because I was afraid of you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were afraid of me? Why?\" she asks, beginning to finally calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just turn around and see for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the young female creature slowly turned around and looked down at you. Seeing you there, her eyes lit up as she scooped you off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, you're so cute and tiny! Now I get it... You were scared 'cause I'm so big compared to you, weren't you?\" She asks, rubbing you into her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Now could you please put me down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sure. Sorry about that, little guy. I just couldn't resist.\" She says with a cheerful smile taking over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, don't worry about it. I'm just glad to know that <i>you</i> aren't going to hurt <i>me</i>.\" You say with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look up at the creature, and getting your first good view of her appearance, you instantly recognize her as being a Pokemon!

When all hope was lost, 9 brave hero\u2019s came to fight those monsters. These hero\u2019s where the hero\u2019s of Joy, Sorrow, Rage, Peace, Courage, Wisdom, Willpower, Light, and Darkness*. These Pokemon had power that others can only dream of having. The 9 Hero\u2019s slain the monsters as if they where nothing and returned peace to the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the monsters kept retuning the 9 Hero\u2019s always destroyed them. Then one day a giant monster came to the island. This monster known as the destroyer was so large that it could destroy the island with one swing of his claw. The 9 Hero\u2019s confronted the monster but, the monster was just to powerful for them to defeat. But just before all hop was lost the Hero\u2019s combined into one and defeated the monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the monster was no more a peace of the monsters essence still remanded. The 9 Hero\u2019s took the essence to a secret island and with all there power sealed it in a cave with an unbreakable barrier. With the world at peace again the 9 Hero\u2019s left the island never to be heard from again. But before they left the they sent an essence from each one of the 9 Hero\u2019s to another dimension to find a successor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe successors of these hero\u2019s are known as Commit Children and have the amazing powers of the hero\u2019s. Because of the time of peace we have had we never needed to call upon them\u2026Until now.\u201d<br>\r\n*The colors of each Hero to commit(Yellow, Blue, Red, Green ,Orange, Purple, Grey, White, and Black)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He runs up to you and put his paw on you and uses a burst of energy to knock you down but you manage to get back up. \"Shadow clone jutsu.\" you shouted. You made 2 clones and they went forward to attack Aura. As Aura was focused fighting your clones you use your sharingan to read his moves and determine his energy level and devised a plan that might work. Both of your clones we're destroyed. \"Time to get serious.\" you said. You use your clone jutsu again but this time it was 4 clones. You and your clones hid and you use a little more energy for one last clone and it ran out in your place. then make a hand sign and run out. Aura destroyed all your clones and attacked you.

And her finger slipped onto the A button. She felt a small electric shock spark her hand as she did so. \"OUCH!\" She said... She then began feeling slightly woozie, and a little nauseous... Likely from her hunger pains... She soon found herself fainting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up who knows how long later... And she was entirely shocked by what she saw when she did so... She was tiny, and in a valley of grassy hills with a few GIANT trees here, and there. But what she really focused on... Was a GIANT Oran Berry sat in the grass right in front of her! her stomach growling, she swiftly dived at the berry, real or not, and starting to sink her teeth into it viciously from hunger. The last thing she could remember was waking up that morning to incredible stomach pains... She was about to go looking through trashcans again... but then everything went black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall tremors were felt in the ground, and soon a giggle was heard from behind. Cookie had a feeling she was being watched... But she was so hungry! She just kept devouring the berry as much as she could!

Jess gives one more nervous whimper before responding as best she could. \"P-Please d-don't h-hurt me...\" Jess said in a quiet and shaky voice... 'Why is this happening to me?! All I wanted to do was buy a book, and now I might die!' Jess thought to herself... \"Don't hurt you? I'm tempted to cut you in half... But I'm a reasonable woman... So I guess we could work something out... If there wasn't something I wanted from you, I would've left you to die out there.\" The voice said followed by a chuckle... Jess slowly turns herself around to face her captor... And safe to say, she was pretty surprised by what she saw... Sitting there, on the sofa, was a giantess Weavile... \"W-What do you want f-from me?\" Jess asked in a small scared voice...  Weavile replies \"Oh, it's simple really...

The dizziness was gone now, but she still had a bit of a headache... But she quickly jolted awake as she saw her new surroundings... \"W...What the...\" She said, looking around from where she sat up... She was on what seemed to be a... A giant beach? She could feel a nice warm sun above her, nice warm sand below her, and hear the soothing sounds of the ocean... \"Did I just die and go to heaven?\" Jess asked, sounding more scared than anything at the thought she might've died in the book store... She quickly pinched herself to see if this was a dream... And then gave herself a gentle slap... Nope, this was all real... She then checked for a pulse... Yep, she was still alive... \"W-Where am I?\" She asked, standing up fully as she looked around... Of in the distance, she could see a sort of village, or town. All the buildings were made from wood and palm leaves... And there was a wooden sign by the entrance to the town that read 'Welcome To Coral Bay!' in big bubble letters... It was then she noticed the palm trees around, and the seashells on the ground... And looking at their sizes, she went pale as a ghost with fear... Either everything was really big, or she was really tiny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could then begin to hear a faint sound... The sound of feet shuffling through the sand... And chances were, whoever it was was far larger than she was!</span></div></div>",

If anything, Jess' surprise made it less likely for her to run and hide... Vaporeon didn't seem like she was at the beach for any major reason, just seeming to be on a nice walk... She was wearing a wristband made from pretty pink seashells (Or Would It Be An Anklet In This Case?), and was wearing a pair of Black Glasses to block out the sun... \"Ah~ Nothing better than a nice walk on the beach after a nice meal~ The sand feels so nice between my toes~\" The Vaporeon said with a smile, her voice making her sound to be in her mid-teens.

The Pokemon's ears twitch a small bit, and she was clearly looking around a bit... \"Hmm? Did somebody say something?\" Vaporeon asked. \"Down here!\" Jess called up again...

If she'd stayed out there, she would've seen exactly what was approaching her... It was a giantess female Buizel. This Buizel was wearing a necklace made from pretty pink seashells, and had a hand-made basket in her hand that she was using to gather seashells in... She was humming to herself happily as she was going about, collecting whatever shells she could find on the beach... And of course, she eventually found the conch that Jess was hiding in. \"Oooh~ This is a pretty one! I bet I could charge a good amount for it!\" The Buizel said cheerfully as she lifted up the shell, causing Jess to yelp a little... The Buizel's voice made her sound like her age was around her early teens... 13 or 14 most likely... Jess could see that Buizel was lowering the shell into her basket...

As Buizel arrived, she began walking through the sandy streets of the little town, humming happily to herself as she did so. She was likely on her way somewhere...

At her size compared to everything else, this drop was MASSIVE! And she was plummeting right to the sandy ground below. But it would seem Buizel had noticed her falling from the shell, and took action quickly. She dropped her basket, and the conch, trying to catch Jess as she was falling to the ground...
