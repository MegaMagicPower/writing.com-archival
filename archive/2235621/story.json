Jameson had once been the proud proprietor of Jameson Liquor Store. Now the idiotic old bastard was nothing more was a Gory bag of Human Mulch. Wrapped in a shredded and blood-soaked T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop off by the Liquor Store on your way home from work. Steve's Wife Gracie had texted. It had been around Closing time. When Steve received the text. Otherwise, he might be home right now with his feet up. Wondering aloud to His Wife. The Universal question that plagues every household worldwide. What's for supper? Instead, Steve was crouched down behind a Liquor store shelf. Praying the person at the front of the store wouldn't decide to stretch their legs and saunter over to the back of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPick us up a couple of bottles of Enlightenment and I'll buy us some Steaks from that place you like. The text from his wife had actually read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's mouth had practically been salivating the entirety of the drive home. Shillings was his favorite place to eat in the whole world. Had been ever sense he was a kid. Steve could still remember when Old Kurt himself had been running the joint. Standing behind that old giant wooden counter. chewing on one of those big cigars. Now Kurt's Sons were in Charge of Shillings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, Steve thought. What I wouldn\u2019t give to be home right now, sitting on the couch next to Gracie. Speaking of Gracie. His wife was probably, already back to the house by now. Wearing those monogram silken Red Pajamas. That Steve had gotten her for Christmas. Two years ago. Steve could just envision, Gracie, eating all the fries out of his takeout container in revenge for Steve taking his sweet ass time getting home. Wondering what the hell was taking that long-winded, windbag of a husband of hers so damn long. She was probably placing bets with the Arctic their three-year-old overactive Syberian Husky. On who Steve had run into at the Liquor Store and how long he would be talking to them. Ding-ding The bell above the Liquor Store door sounded indicating someone was entering or leaving the Store. Oh God Steve thought. Panic gripping him. If someone's coming in here that means. They don't know. They have no idea. Maybe I can warn them somehow. Give them a chance at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHello, a Woman's voice spoke. Is anyone here? Before Steve could so much as move. The woman had her reply.<br>\r\nKaBoom. Came the rocketing sound of a discharging Pump Action Twelve Guage Shotgun. The bottle on the shelves reverberated in a shimmering chorus. As the sound filled the air itself.<br>\r\nI'd say there's someone here. A soft-spoken voice mockingly stated from somewhere around the front of the store. Rather unfortunate for you wouldn't you say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an insanely long pause of silence. Before the voice continued. Oh, that's right. You're dead! You can't say anything. To anyone, ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve could hear the distinctive chick-chicking. Sound of a Shotgun feeding a live shell into the firing chamber. Damn Steve thought how many shells does that thing hold. Steve knew most version of pump actions could hold between six to eight shells. However, some people bought upgrades and refitted their firearms. Especially for hunting in Bear Country. And this was Grizzly territory. So this person's Shotgun could easily contain sixteen or more active shells. There was no reason to assume anything with this maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can count! The soft-spoken Voice said menacingly from the front of the store. So why don't you save me the trouble and come on out from behind there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steve breath caught in his throat. Was the voice talking about him? You see there are seven cars in the parking lot. One of them is mine and there's only five bodies on the floor. So either you come out from back around there or I take this little P.Shooter Jameson kept behind the counter and start lacing bullets through the shelves until I hit something vital. Steve was frozen in place unsure of what to do next. When the door to the broom closet suddenly opened from behind that door came a young man wearing a red vest. Like the one Jameson normally wore. The young man wasted no time stepping forward. Behind the young man and still inside the confined space of the broom closet was an attractive blonde woman. The youth shut the door. Behind him. Before looking directly at Steve. Stay down. The young man seemed to mouth. Then putting his hands high above his head. He shouted. The car is mine. I work here now, just started today actually and I'm unarmed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood. The voice said. About time Jameson hired someone with some sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it I can do for you? The young man asked the soft-spoken Voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo it for me? I get it. Like this is some sort of negotiation. I like that. I like you kid. Sure you can do something for me.. The cash register. Open it! And no grief either. Like I got from Jameson back there. Understand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few seconds before the sound of an opening cash register could be heard. Followed by the sound of a paper sack. Being expertly flipped open on the first try. The young man's voice came next. Here you go Sir that everything we have in the register. I swear. There was a long pause before the Soft spoken voice spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got to learn to negotiate better Kid. Came the reply. You see Negotiations are like playing Simon Says. Now Simon said. Open the register. Which you did fantastically. Point for you. You should feel proud of yourself. Simon at no point however said. Give Simon a bag full of the register's money. Point against you. Which in any other game on Earth. That would be alright. The points would cancel each other out and you'd still be golden. Except here's the problem. Your not playing any other game on Earth you're playing Simon Say's. It's a rigged game to be sure. No matter how many points one accumulates while playing. The only point that matters. Is the negative one. Subtracted from your score for disobeying Simon. And at No point did Simon say give Simon the money. Understand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I do. Came the young man's reply. I can put the money back if it pleases Simon. The Shotgun roared stressing Simons displeasure. And eliminating another contestant from the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, you don't get it. The soft-spoken voice uttered. You see if you got it you'd understand. That the games is not about pleasing Simon. It's about obeying Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if simons were to tell these bottles of liquor to fall to the floor and shatter. Then he'd have to do something like this and tip them over. Because they're an adamant object<br>\r\nand they need help to obey. One by one Steve heard the sounds of several bottles falling to the tile floor and busting.<br>\r\nThen the soft-spoken Voice said. Something that sent Steve's heart to racing. And if Simon told this lighter to light on the first try so Simon could drop it into the spilled Liquor settings this place ablaze. Then that's what that light would have to do. Fith. The sound of a lighter being struck was instantly the loudest sound Steve had ever heard in his entire life. Followed by the sound of VOOM. As the fire spewed in all directions. Ding-ding. The bell above the door rang out the only indicating sound that the Mad man had left Smoke had already begun to fill the room. Steve turned and bolted for the broom closet door. Nearly ripping the door off its hinges as he got to it. The suprised Blonde shrieked in terror as the door flew open. Wasting no time to explain and knowing he had none Steve struck her hard across the face silencing the panicking Woman with one blow. Out. Steve roared. The woman just stood there blankly staring at him. Steve didn't have time for stupid. He grabbed her wrist and turned to flee. Then he found himself staring at the thing she had been staring at. Jameson Elm was clambering unsteady to his feet a lifeless and cold look stretch across his face his intestines spilling out from the hole in his stomach. Steve didn't have time for this. They had to get out now. Steve went to the left trying to go around the shelf only to find it blocked by another patron who had been gunned down. Somehow the bastard. Was standing up. Half their body on fire. Steve turned to go the other way. Looking towards Mr. Jameson who moaned and then lunged for them. Steve shoved the blonde woman towards the wall as Mr. Jameson fell between them. Knowing there was no time left Steve vaulted over Mr. Jameson. Grabbing the blonde woman once more.<br>\r\nWe have to go! Steve screamed. Now!<br>\r\nThe shelf Steve had used for cover toppled towards him crushing Jameson Elm beneath it. Two humanoid figures crawled over the top of the metal shelf. Towards them. The blonde woman must have come to her senses for She shot past Steve like a track star. Disappearing into the wall of smoke. Steve followed suit taking a running leap off the corner of the metal shelf. He lashed out with his right foot knocking the over a metal revolving basket of booze found his footing and raced towards the exit. The woman was standing stock still at the counter presumably staring at the body of the young man. Who had been in the closet with her? Steve was a big boy. He had played football in Highschool. Worked four years in his uncle's grade after that taking engine blocks out of old stock cars. So to him, it was nothing to wrap one arm around her waste her waist while on the run and never once brake stride. Steve's Grandfather had been a firefighter and would have been able to explain the reason that Steve and the woman needed to go through that door together. He would have been able to breakdown whatever chemical reaction would occur when all that heat mixes with all that fresh cool air. Steve on the other hand was not his grandfather he wasn't going to be able to find the words to explain what was about to happen or how to avoid it he just knew it was going to hurt. Steve's shoulders barreled into the door flinging it open the Bell had time to ding once and the next thing Steve knew they were airborne.<br>\r\nThe two landed fifteen feet away in the parking lot. Steve crawled over to the blonde woman. Gravel digging into his arms. Are you ok he asked? Realizing he couldn't hear his own voice. Using the bumper of a car Steve helped himself to his feet. Stay here Steve said I'm going to get my cellphone and call for help. Steve walked to his car a Tan and Green Nineteen Sixty-nine Marco Wrath Savoy. Fumbled for his keys. Then realized the door was unlocked the whole time. Sliding behind the wheel of the car Steve reached into the passenger seat and grabbed his cellphone. He pushed in the numbers 911 hit the speaker button turning up the volume to full blast, Steve then held the phone Close to his ear and waited. The phone rang once, rang twice, and then a mechanical voice said. The nine one one emergency call center. Would like to inform you they cannot take your call at the moment. Seeing as we are over flooded with a high volume of in traffic calls. We hope you'll stay on the line and one of our dispatchers should be with you shortly. Your call is number one hundred and thirteen. And it is important to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve started to climb out of the car just as something swooped out of the sky and flew off with the woman.<br>\r\nWhat the Hell is going on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steve had been given Fair Warning. He just hadn't realized. What Fair Warning entailed. In this case. The Fair Warning that Steve had received. Came in the form of a slow moving shadow. A shadow that Steve hadn't initially registered. As not even being worthy of a blimp on his radar. Now sitting opened mouthed inside his car. With the doors firmly locked. Steve was replaying the scene in his head. Reliving the Horror that one missed Shadow could cause. Steve had witnessed what had befell the Blonde Woman. And now he was alone, numb,  and scared to death. Steve was asking himself could it have been prevented. Could I  have prevented it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether Steve could have prevented it or not was irrelevant. To prevent it Steve would of have had to catch a Warning sign. And Steve had missed the Warning sign. <br>\r\nTHE WARNING SING:<br>\r\nAs an injured Steve had slumped inside his automobile. Fumbling with his cellular phone. Attempting to dial the numbers nine, one, one. The shadow has silently passed over his car. Steve didn't know the Shadow was menacing of course. How could he. His brain had registered it as no more threatening than any cloud passing between the sun and himself. Steve hadn't even looked up from the phone. He had been to floored by The Nine, One, One automated operator confirming to him that help was not coming. Steve still uncertain of how he was going to break the news to the Blonde Woman. Had just begun to opened the door to his car When he saw the Blonde Woman's arms fling up. In a defensive posture. Steve's frist though was oh Lord. The poor girls having a seizure. The Blonde Woman shrieked shrilly as her legs began pushing frantically attempting to push her body  underneath a car. Steve imagined he shouted what's wrong. As he cleared his car. In truth he couldn't remember. What he did. The thing he remember clearly however was that the creature had descended from the Sky directly into his field of vision. In one fluid motion the creatures lower body whipped foward. Both muscular legs extending  outwards twoards the woman. The creatures Webbed feet splayed wide. Bringing to  bear razor sharp Talons as long as Steak Knives. Seamlessly the Talons wrapped around The Blonde Woman's Arm. Her body jolted off the ground. As the creature's momentum carried it past her. Her shirkes of terror. Turned into a cry of pain. As a shower of blood sprayed in all directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelp! She cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was pulled higher into the air. Steve had been unable to help. Infact he had been unable to move. Steve was transfixed. Staring helpless at the  creature. All Steve could do was to count.  Loudly he said. One, Two,  Three. Three flaps of the creatures massive wings is all it had taken before Steve could see her no longer.  Woman and Creature dissappear behind the pillar of rising smoke Created by the fire in the Liquor store. <br>\r\nWhat the hell is going on Steve though to himself? What am I doing. I need to move. That Creature could come back. If it does what am I going to be able to do about it? I'm not armed and I sure as Hell won't be able to fight it off. I'll be just like her. What was her name? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve realized he hadn't even known her name. Steve's hand moved toward the key setting in the ignition. He tried to turn it. Yet his body refused. His thoughts still flooded him. Could I have prevented it. Could I have saved her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Steve saw them. A sight so out of place.  That Steve was immediately snapped from his eternal shameful loop. Standing just on the other side of the road,  beneath a row of Live Oak Trees.  Were serval people dressed in Clown outfits. Each individual Clown stood just to the left of a tall oak tree. Each Clown brandished a farming implement. As one the group of Clowns began walking toward the parking lot. Toward Steve. Steve didn't wait to ask what was going on. He had seen enough in movies and on the news to know when something this out of place happens. The smartest thing to do was to unass the lo-cal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve had once heard someone say. Fear is a hell of a motivator. And with everything that had just happened those Clowns were fear. For all at once. The strength seemed to leap back into Steve. This time Steve had no problems twisting the key in the ignition. Steve's Tan and Green Automobile fired up. Steve stomped down on the gas reving the engine. The clowns seemed to zero in on him. With the engine still reved Steve flung the gear shift into drive. The car lurched foward from its space.  And with it The Clowns broke from their walking pace into a run. As one. The Clowns headed straight twoards Steve's now fleeing automobile. Steve heart fluttered in his chest as his car sped towards the parking lot exit. In his perriferial vision Steve could just make out the nearest Clown. A male possibly in his twenty\u2019s, Steve estimated his height to be around six feet tall. Black triangles silhouette his bright yellow eyes. The rest of his face had been entirely painted White. Except for his lips which were bright red. In his right hand The Clown carried a hatchet. His left clutched a reddish Dogs collar. As Steves Car rounded the last of the now owner less parked cars. The crazed youth flung the hatchet at Steve car. The drivers side passengers window shattered. The hatchet had just missed Steve's head by a foot. Steve took the corner out of the parking lot a little to sharply. The back passenger side tire ran over the curb as the car rounded out of the lot. The Clowns ran behind the car until they realized it was hopeless. Then they began to walk. Steve turned off old mill road. And raced down Broken  Bear Avenue. He had to get home. He had to get to Grace. It would be dark soon and they needed to get out of here. While it was still light enough to see. This town wasn't safe for them anymore. A glint of Steel gleamed ahead Steve slammed his foot down hard on the brakes. The car layed down dual straps of rubber eighteen feet in length or longer. The vehicle lurched to a stop about six feet shy of the metal Steve had saw glinting.  On both sides of the roads were massive hardwood trees. Tied around both trees and stretched across the road were several heavy links of chain. The engine idle as Steve surveyed his surroundings. Carefully Steve threw the car into reverse. He began slowly backing up.  Once he was thirty feet back. Steve saw them. About twenty feet off 5he ground and tied by ropes to the telephone poles were people. All except one was covered by a sheet. The one that wasn't had been left completely necked. Steve backed his car to the point the road turned into ditch and swung the vehicle around. The path was blocked two pickup trucks sat a few hundred feet down the road. Clogging up both lanes.<br>\r\nSo that's how it is Steve said out loud. A white hot anger rising up inside him. Box the poor bastards in. Give them no where to go and see who's chicken shit. Steve manuvered his car to the center of the road. Both trucks hit there spotlights. Steve liked his lips. Remember being a child. He had been sitting in his granmothers living room watching a movie with his older cousin. The movie was rated R. And Steve was much to young to see it. Yet his cousin said just don't tell anyone and we'll be ok. Steve had sat and watched asking questions when he didn't understand something. His cousin would pause the movie and explain. There had been a point his Cousin paused the movie without Steve asking a question. Genuine displeasure shown on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuz had looked over to Steve and asked. Where did the stupid bitch mess up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve had said. When she went into that room she left herself no way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll give you partial credit for that one. Stevie boy. Cuz said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly partial. Steve said a little hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartial Cuz. Insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Steve asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause. You only got half the answer right. She's trapped in the room sure. Yet there's another way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere? Steve asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the wall Cuz had said. If she'd find something heavy she might could smash through it and get out. Also those fuck'ers like their nice expensive property. And She's still got the matches the Stoner gave her. You see she's fallen into the classic trap. If she really wanted them to open that door. She could set the whole place ablaze and force the bastard to either lose everthing or open that door and deal with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen why dosent She? <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBecause she's chicken shit and afraid to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve turned on his brights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you one of those people who are afraid to try Stevie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! Came Steve's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve smashed the gas petal. To the floor. Time to try.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jameson Elm was clambering unsteady to his feet a lifeless and cold look stretch across his face his intestines spilling out from the whole in his stomach. Steve didn't have time for this. They had to get out now. Steve went to the left trying to go around the shelf only to find it blocked by another patron who had been gunned down. Somehow the bastard. Was standing up. Half their body on fire. Steve turned to go the other way. Looking towards Mr. Jameson who moaned and then lunged for them. Steve shoved the blonde woman towards the wall as Mr. Jameson fell between them. Knowing there was no time left Steve vaulted over Mr. Jameson. Grabbing the blonde woman once more. <br>\r\nWe have to go! Steve screamed. Now!<br>\r\nThe shelf Steve had used for cover toppled towards him crushing Jameson Elm beneath it. Two humanoid figures crawled over the top of the metal shelf. Towards them. The blonde woman must have come to her senses for She shot past Steve like a track star. Dissapering into the wall of smoke. Steve followed suit taking a running leap off the corner of the metal shelf. He lashed out with his right foot knocking the over a metal revolving basket of booze found his footing and raced towards the exit. The woman was standing stock still at the counter presumably staring at the body of the young man. Who had been in the closet with her. Steve was a big boy. He had played football in Highschool. Worked four years in his uncles grade after that taking engine blocks out of old stock cars. So to him it was nothing to wrap one arm around her waste her waist while on the run and never once brake stride. Steve's Grandfather had been a firefighter and would have been able to explain the reason the reason that Steve and the woman needed to go through that door together. He would have been able to brakedown whatever chemical reaction would occur when all that heat mixes with all that fresh cool air. Steve on the other hand was not his grandfather he wasn't going to be able to find the words to explain what was about to happen or how to avoid it he just knew it was going to hurt. Steve's shoulders barreled into the door flinging it open the Bell had time to ding once and the next thing Steve knew they were airborne. <br>\r\nThe two landed fifteen feet away in the parking lot. Steve crawled over to the blonde woman.  Gravel digging into his arms. Are you ok he asked. Realizing he couldn't hear his own voice. Using the bumper of a car Steve helped himself to his feet. Stay here Steve said I'm going to get my cellphone and call for help. Steve walked to his car a Tan and Green Nineteen Sixty-nine Marco Wrath Savoy. Fumbled  for his keys. Then realized the door was unlocked the whole time. Sliding behind the wheel of the car Steve reached into the passenger seat and grabbed his cellphone. He pushed in the numbers 911 hit the speaker button turning up the volume to full blast, Steve then held the phone Close to his ear and waited. The phone rang once, rang twice, and then a mechanical voice said. The nine one one emergency call center. Would like to inform you they cannot take your call at the moment. Seeing as we are over flooded with a high volume of in traffic calls. We hope you'll stay on the line and one of our dispatcher should be with you shortly. Your call is number one hundred and thirteen. And it is important to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve started to climb out of the car just as something swooped out of the sky and flew off with the woman. <br>\r\nWhat the Hell is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
