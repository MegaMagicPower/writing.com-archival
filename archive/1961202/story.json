He joined partially out of pride for his country, and partially out of it simply being the best option available to him. He couldn\u2019t get into college, and he couldn\u2019t get any sort of decent job out there in this economy, so the military just sorta made the most sense. He found being in the military tough, very tough, but he could handle it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter a few weeks of being sent to base camp he was told he would be told he would be given an experimental drug to buff him up. He was told it would be likely he would even get significantly taller, though the details ended there.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe would be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t nervous as he was lead into a sterile looking room wearing only a patient gown. Inside the room were several doctors, a bunch of fancy looking machines, a hospital bed, and a large mirror on the wall, which Ben guessed was a one way window. \u201cPlease remove your gown.\u201d One of the doctors instructed as he placed little monitoring devices over his body.<br>\r\n\u201cAh, what? Is, is that really necessary\u201d Ben nervously asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d The doctor replied back, a bit annoyed sounding more than anything.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then\u2026\u201d Ben proceeded to remove his hospital gown. He lay down on the bed and the doctors hooked him up to the machine. He closed his eyes took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. Suddenly he was alarmed to find his arms were strapped to the bed.<br>\r\n\u201cW-what!\u201d Ben exclaimed. His immediate instinct told him to try to get out. He pulled at the arm straps as he quickly found his legs strapped down as well.<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down! This is for your own safety!\u201d the doctor barked at him.<br>\r\nBen stopped moving. He tried desperately to calm himself, he couldn\u2019t stop think of what sort of horrible drug it was they were going to inject into his blood. \u201cWh- what is it you\u2019re going to do to me!\u201d His question went unanswered as he saw them inject him with god knows what.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once he learned this was one of the projects, he immediately took an interest in it, and gave it priority over other things being researched there. It was only a month ago when he heard it was ready to be tested on a human, and he insisted it be tested on himself. The scientist and those under him strongly recommended it first be tested on someone else, someone more less valuable than one such as himself, but Alec would not be swayed on the matter. He had simply been dreaming of being big for too long, and this would be his chance.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nInitially they wanted to only test him with a small dose, but Alec strongly insisted on being given a big dose straight off the bat to make him as huge as possible. The scientist reluctantly agreed, but on the condition that they wait until they can get together some equipment to take his vitals and record data that would continue to function through the growth. He agreed, and in the meantime, would order the construction of clothes for him when he achieved his dream.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFinally the time had come for the growth to happen. Alec was lead to a field and stripped down. He was laid on the grass and had a number of important looking machines hooked up to him.

Initially there were concerns and debates about whether we should utilize this technology. Once grown, there was no way to get ungrown, as of yet anyway. The military higher ups were in favor of it, being as huge an asset it was. Though many in the general public were strongly against it, for the idea that one person should be given that much power, plus unknown long term side effects to those it was given to. But the Politicians gave the military free reign to use it on however many enlisted men they choose, and that number, as it turned out, was a lot.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several weeks into the program the soldiers were good, held in check by their discipline. However as months passed the soldiers began to look down on their tiny commanders. And this was not helped by the growing discontent among them. As part of partaking in the growth no soldier was allowed to actually retire. After the public saw just how big they got and how many men were grown there were concerns about just how exactly they were supposed to ever integrate back into regular society. Where they would live, what would they do for a job, along with concerns about how easily they might cause damage if in any sort of populated area. So in response the politicians passed a law that basically stated no grown person could retire or ever live among the general populace.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAdded to this grievance was other problems, clothing for them would be very expensive, and so many had to go barefoot and largely naked for weeks. Eventually they did each receive boots, socks, a shirt, underwear, and a pair of pants. However each soldier also only received one pair of everything, forcing each to wear the, oft, rank sweat covered items for weeks between cleanings.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd the cost applied not only to cloths but food as well. Feeding this new huge army meant only feeding them the cheapest, most nasty clumps of \u2018edible\u2019 items for each meal. And even with the cost saving measures, the general public was very annoyed with the new, still very costly, government expenditure.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd on top of this the soldiers were never allowed to get off base time, due to the nightmare of trying to make sure roads were sturdy enough, then said roads would have to be closed wherever a giant had to use one. Plus the possibility of one of them unintentionally causing damage to private property.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis led the soldiers to be grossly dissatisfied with their new living conditions. They tried petitioning their commanders, or even speaking out, but there was no realistic hope of change for them. So eventually they decided they had had enough. So they organized and prepared a march on the capitol. On the appointed day, the young giant soldiers would get up and march on Washington to bring their case straight to the politicians who had cheated them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey marched out of the base where most of them where stationed and marched toward the capitol. In reaction the military sent in all nearby forces to bring them under control. The military\u2019s attempt was in vain however. The giant soldiers easily overpowered their forces. The only effect the attempt to stop them had was to enrage the giants more so. When the soldiers reached Washington they found the president and the congressmen had all fled well in advance. In response the soldiers decided to take their anger out on the city, pillaging most of it to the ground. The next morning one of the de facto leaders of the band of giants announced to the world how it would be. They would no longer be soldiers, they would be free men, and each would do whatever they so desired. And hence forth, no more giants would be made by any nation, nor would any country attempt to develop any sort of weapon that might be used to fight them, else the giants would unite in unleashing harsh punishment against them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd so this is how the world is now. Giant men roam around the world, some are walking natural disasters, pillaging whatever town or city they see on the horizon, though others have settled down and go about their daily lives, some just happy being live and let live, while others have even established their own little countries. It is a brave new world, were size is all that matters.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was 26 with good experience and was chosen to be one of the giants.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was only yesterday the revolt happened. He didn\u2019t mean for it to get so out of hand, he didn\u2019t think any of them did. But they simply couldn\u2019t stand those conditions they were forced to live under, and certainly not for their whole lives. Then once they actually reached the city they met more reinforcements sent stop them. The thought of being forced down by men you he would have thought of as brothers just few months ago was, maddening. After the small forces were taken care of he just ran straight to the capitol building, they all did. Civilians and the world under them were disregarded in their rush, they knew it was unlikely they\u2019d be fast enough to actually catch anyone of importance there to give their case, but after all they\u2019d been through the thought was pushed far into the back of his mind.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe was one of the first men to reach it. After getting there he joined the couple other giant soldiers that beat him to it in tearing through the building, he assumed they already checked the main chambers because he was ripping through hallways and offices trying to find someone. The whole building was ripped apart down to the basement be they time they\u2019d finished, and they didn\u2019t find a single person inside. After that there was this sort of mob mentality against those that tried to make them lives horrible, who refused to listen, and who tried to gun them down. But there was no one to take it, no one who deserved it anyway. They were mad at their government, and so that is what they attacked. It started with just the government buildings and monuments, but with the mob mentality in full force they all seemed to forgot who it was they were angry at and just saw the vulnerable city around them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat was yesterday. Today, he woke up. Today there was no mob mentality left in him. Today he was faced with what he and his fellow soldiers had done to what they had sworn to protect. And today he would awake to the city in ruins. He saw not a building within about 10 blocks still standing, and of those still up, were only partially intact. He saw a lot of bodies, through the wreckage of the city, but none that he dared examine any more than giving a quick glance.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMost of the other soldiers were still asleep. There were a few in groups, talking about what they were to do now. None of them really knew. Most didn\u2019t seem to be in a chatty mood. Some were wandering through the barren streets. Dakota himself didn\u2019t feel like talking, and he really didn\u2019t feel like sticking around in this desolate place. Within several minutes of having woken up, Dakota just left. He began walking west. He really didn\u2019t know where to go or what to do, but he lived out west before growing so that seemed as good a place to start heading as any.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It\u2019s been a couple of weeks since Nick and the rest of the giants trashed DC. Since then he\u2019s travelled in a sort of pack with a few other giant soldiers. Nick didn\u2019t have any particular place he wanted to head off to most of the guys he was with didn\u2019t either, but Scott, one of the other giants, did. He wanted to get back home. He seemed to be under the impression that he could just try to mix back into regular society.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nScott still regarded the, now relatively small people around him to still be people. He didn\u2019t think he, or any of them really, should be above the law. Excluding last night\u2026 he had a strong moral compass for himself, and if possible, he would try not to hurt anyone. Though he must admit accidents will happen given his now tremendous proportion, and there are limits to how far out of his way for others he can reasonably go.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNick scoffed at the idea of trying to reintegrate back into society. The way he saw it, even if they could, they were a hundred times bigger than those bugs they now stomped under boot, and he saw no reason not to take advantage of it to do whatever they pleased. He himself practically stopped viewing anyone he could crush so easily under his boot as human. If Scott wanted to go home and try to go back to being some hick farmer in the middle of nowhere, well, more fun trashing the runt\u2019s society for Nick then.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNick himself loved the thought of rampaging through cities. And more recently he started thinking about \u2018claiming\u2019 his own city. He dreamed of dominating it. Of forcing its citizens to worship him. Of statues of himself placed throughout it. Maybe he could even start his own country and claim some of the cities near it. This would be his knew goal, he decided, to ditch these losers and find some place to dominate.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe 3rd member off their group was Daniel. Daniel was one of the more focused of the bunch. He was older, relative to the other giants anyway, and was one of the heist ranking among those grown. He was aware that the littles had created them, and he was well aware that, with time, they could create more. He believed the giants should try to organize. It was quite obvious some of the giants among them would give the tiny folk more than enough reason to do whatever they could be rid of them. He thought that getting them united was the only way they could try to enforce the threat of bringing destruction to any other country that might try to create any more giant soldiers, or otherwise put an end to them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUnfortunately he was one of the last to wake up this morning. Only ahead of these other 3. He didn\u2019t really know any of them but they decided to go it together or at least for a while. The first step in his plane would be to find some way to communicate with each other. All the giants were dispersing, and he knew most of them would probably end up isolated from everyone else, and be completely useless if any of the world\u2019s governments manage to come up with some way to stop them. Perhaps he could try to act on behalf of his giant brethren to make some kinda deal with some of the world\u2019s governments to give them something like IPhone usable at their size, or maybe even just some giant walky talkies, or, something to make communication, and from there organized effort, possible.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe would try to convince the others to join him. However he doubted any of them would. Scott seemed determined to stick his head in the dirt in scenic nowhere. Nick would be more of a liability than anything. And Jake, Daniel really didn\u2019t have a clue about him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLastly among them, was Jake. He was one of the youngest of soldiers to be grown. After he graduated high school he found all his friends ended up traveling for college. He himself didn\u2019t have the grades for college. Jake\u2019s parents had kicked him out right after he turned 18. He couldn\u2019t find a job or had anywhere to go. It wasn\u2019t long until he finally decided that joining the military was the only option he had, even though he hated the thought of it. But he toughed it out, and even did well enough to get into the giants program.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd now here he is, with about as much direction as when he joined. With regards to the little folk, sure he didn\u2019t mind crushing a few of them for a bit of fun, but at the same time he doesn\u2019t really feel the desire to really go out of his way fuck with them. Jake doesn\u2019t really care where he ends up, but after the last couple of weeks, he decidedly would prefer it be with Nick or Scott. He\u2019s finds himself attracted to both of them, though he has no idea if either of them would be up for it, or are even attracted to guys at all in the first place.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo we have a few characters available, who will the story focus on?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The soldiers were practically impervious to any sort of weaponry, guns, rockets, tanks; it seemed nothing in the world\u2019s arsenal could defeat them. With this new weapon the government and the people were suddenly far more open with invading other countries. Thus they did invade other countries, wherever an oppressive autocracy was being risen up against, we stepped in to assist and to make the world a \u2018freer\u2019 place.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t long that there were no countries that needed our \u2018assistance\u2019. In response, we made them. And this is how we came to purposefully destabilize countries to give our troops a place to \u2018liberate\u2019 as a boon to the swelling national pride and the growing contentedness of the people. This became routine and after several years we decided that, as the rest of the world had become so hopelessly destabilized we should come to rule these places ourselves to bring peace.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis was a success, starting in the Middle East, and slowly creeping out from there, we came to dominate most of the world. By the time the few developed stabilized countries finally accepted that we would not be satisfied with the 3rd world, it was too late for any of them to put up any effective defense, and most choose to simply give in, and hope we would be benevolent rulers.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThese new lands of ours were largely allowed to keep their own affairs running with significant autonomy. Though the military did have \u2018duty to see these lands prosper and remain loyal\u2019 meaning they held ultimate authority to do as they pleased to keep the populace in check, through whatever means the local administrator thought best. However. There were administrators whose job was, on occasion, to do the exact opposite. National pride needed to stay high, so on occasion there needed to be an uprising or some form of enemy to attack and show our superiority to, and prove still needed our assistance.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd how big these giant soldiers?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We, as of yet, still do not know why these giants have appeared. Wait, this just in.

He was literal ripping it apart, piece by piece. After mostly reducing it to ruble he stomped down on anything still standing above the rest. As this happened you heard the broadcaster listing other major city\u2019s being attacked by the suddenly very violent giants.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe giant then started destroying things seemingly indiscriminately yet methodically.

Then he ripped the roof of it off, tossing it absentmindedly down the street behind him. He used his free hand to rifle through the passengers; he seemed very interested in them for some reason.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter a minute of this he pulled out one of the male passengers, looked to be young, 20s or late teens, you couldn\u2019t really tell from down in your car.

It didn\u2019t sound like he was in a hurry, but from the sound of it he was walking directly to the large hotel you had taken refuge in. You were half way to the exit at the end of the long hallway when you felt the ground shake and heard the sound of what you guessed was the giant ripping through another building. The quake was strong; enough to trip you, if only for a moment before you could push yourself up and continue running. From the sound of it, you think he tore down the building next to the hotel, or at least part of it. Then the quake repeated itself, this time coming from the other side of the hotel.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou had nearly made it to the exit when you heard what sounded like heavy equipment, a sort of much lighter version of the giant ripping through buildings. Then the light coming through the window next to the door you were running towards was quickly shut out. When you got to the door you saw what looked like debris covering the whole window. You tried to open the door. It wouldn\u2019t budge; you guessed he purposely seal you inside to find you. All around the hotel there was a similar kind of commotion of the giant sealing up any exits.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis caused whatever guests staying at the hotel to come out of their hiding places in their rooms to find a way out, now that it was clear they seemed to be being targeted by the giant soldier. As one family left their room you went to check to see if maybe there was some space to squeeze out of their room\u2019s windows, Past the glass there was only darkness. You heard the giant\u2019s booming footsteps encircle the hotel. You weren\u2019t sure if he was giving you time to freak out and lose it or if he was just planning to catch you when you found a way out, if you found a way out. Regardless of what his intentions were, you knew you had to get out for your best chance of survival.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou went to check another room, it was blocked off like the last one. You check another, and another is blocked off as well. Before checking another room you look to see you were next to a stairwell. You think about going up to the 2nd floor when the walls start shaking. This time the sounds of destruction was from directly above you, you think the fucker was ripping the roof off!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pause for a moment, contemplating the ridiculously stupid thing you\u2019re about to do. You take a deep breath and start up the stairs. The stairs at the moment were currently filled with people actually, all of them heading in the opposite direction from you. It\u2019s difficult and slow going, but soon you\u2019ve made it to the top of the stairs and fought your way out of the stairwell. You find yourself seemingly the only person on this floor, with the last of those staying on this floor having pretty much all filtered out at this point. You rush to the nearest room, only to find the door locked. The room doors locked automatically and were slanted to close shut, so there were few rooms for you to possibly even get too.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou jogged down the hallway, searching for some room that by sheer luck might have remained open. Then the walls and the floor shake followed by the, now much louder sound, of the giant removing another floor of the building. As you search for an open room you try to remember how many floors this damn place had\u2026 10\u2026 You think\u2026 or at least 8. Soon you reach a door that was jammed on its own latch. You rush inside the hotel room to find its windows are as blocked off as the ones on the 1st floor. You curse as you rush up to the window, outside it you can only make out the faintest bit of sunlight filtering through from above. There\u2019s no way you could hope to dig yourself out, not before he\u2019d be sure to find you anyway.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn frustration you punch the window and sit on the bed, exhausted. You lay back, and can\u2019t for the life of you bring yourself to your feet. You\u2019ve been sprinting full speed for over 2 or 3 blocks now. You think that perhaps you should have paced yourself. But thinking such things will get you nowhere. From above you can hear the familiar sound of another floor being ripped away from the hotel. You force yourself back to your feet, you must keep moving.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou jog back to the nearest stairwell. By now everyone running down it has made it down to the 1st floor. You start up to the 3rd floor\u2026 you know this is stupid and will probably get you killed, but you must keep going.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou run around looking for an open hotel room. You manage to find one relatively quickly, kept open with a coat lying on the floor holding the door back. You rush inside. Once inside, relief wells up inside you as you see the windows are clear of any rubble. You rush over to them, and soon any joy or relief melts away as you see the giant sitting right outside.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTo either side of your window you see the giant\u2019s camo clad knees. He seemed to be hunched down to search through each floor of the hotel, looking for you. Despite his closeness you do, at least, feel secure he won\u2019t see you here, as his upper body is currently above you, shifting through the upper floors. You can\u2019t help be glance down to his crotch. You couldn\u2019t make out any details, unfortunately, his pants weren\u2019t by any means well fitting, and especially so with how he was hunched down.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen you see his weight seem to shift significantly. He\u2019s leaning forward. Then as he starts to shift back you hear the ripping away of another floor. You fall back onto the nearby bed as a few bits of the ceiling crack off and the walls develop large cracks in a few spots. You think he\u2019s now reached the 5th floor. Above you, you hear what sounds like someone moving furniture. You guess that\u2019s him searching around.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou leave the room to find one that doesn\u2019t open out right to him; at least you knew you should be able to get out on this floor. You jog down the hallway to rooms that open out to a different side of the building. It takes a bit longer to find a door ajar, but after a bit of searching you find one. You go over to the window. Outside it you see the pile of rubble that was one of the buildings he tore down. The area is strewn with debris and very wide open; it looked like it would 1 or 2 hundred feet to the next building, with wide openness all in between you and it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou look for where to open the window about you don\u2019t find any handle. With a frustrating realization you discover the fucking windows do not actually open. If you\u2019re getting out of here this way, you\u2019re gonna have to smash open the thing. You pause to think if he could hear such a thing, or about the likeliness of him glancing over and spotting you as you run through the field of rubble. You begin to think that this may have been a terrible idea. Then you hear the, oh so familiar sound of another floor being ripped away above you. Now he was shifting through the floor just above you, if you\u2019re going through with this it\u2019s now or never.</span></div></div>",

Even if you <i>could</i> manage to make it down to the first floor, it would only be a matter of time before the giant made his way down to that level.  By then, it would be too late.  No, you have to try and escape while there was still a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to cast about the hotel room in search of something, anything, that could break open the window.  Your mind roils with confusion and fear.  Who is this gigantic soldier, anyway?  Where did he come from?  And why is he so hell-bent on hunting you down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the closet, you find a fire extinguisher.  Hefting it, you hurry back towards the window.  The extinguisher is heavy in your grip--surely it must be enough to smash the glass open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the fire extinguisher underneath the window, you sneak one more glance out the window at the Godzilla-sized soldier just outside.  You breathe a sigh of relief.  He still appears to be completely wrapped up in dismantling the floor overhead, lifting up pieces of furniture and leveling entire rooms in his search for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent that he's distracted, you lift up the fire extinguisher once more.  Covering the end with one of the room's bath towels, you heft the extinguisher before smashing it through the window's  glass.  The glass shatters, sprinkling the ground below with shards of various sizes.  You set the fire extinguisher back down, clearing the glass from the windowsill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning out the window, you triple-check the giant's status.  He's still distracted; it's now or never.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no fire escape outside the window, but you do spy a drainpipe stretching down the building within arm's reach.  It's only barely attached to the wall, thanks to the giant's systematic dismantling of the building, but it's definitely better than nothing.  Swinging your legs through the window, you reach out and grab the drainpipe.  It's a short slide down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping away from the hotel, you glance around, re-establishing your bearings.  The giant is stooping right over you.  Any way you go, you're going to have to make it under him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth, you start off at a rapid clip.  The ground is uneven and finding your footing is difficult.  You swear aloud as you stumble and fall, knocking right into the sole of the giant's boot.  Scrambling to your feet, you look up to see...</span></div></div>",

Soon he'd be peeling off the roof and finding you, stupidly beating at a window with whatever random instrument you might manage to lift and hurl into it. There's no hope here, you need to go back down. You jog back to the stairs and start your sad descent down them, right back where you came from. Right as your about to exit the stairwell, you hear the familiar rumbling of the giant ripping away another floor above you. Now he's on the 3rd floor, only 2 more till he gets to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first floor was absolutely jam packed with terrified people. Some were running around looking for a way out, others were just on the ground, praying. You elect to be one of those furiously searching around. You honestly don't know what your looking for, anything that might get you out of here you suppose. At the main entrance to the hotel in the lobby their are a multitude of people trying to clear out the rubble in an attempt to dig out. Maybe you should help. They actually looked to be making a surprising amount of progress considering how much they have to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first you decide to search around a bit more. The rooms, the bathrooms, the pool, the kitchen, everywhere everyone seemed to be trying to do the same thing of searching for a way out, but everywhere everyone was at about the same level of failing to progress. The only place where people were acting noticeably different was the bar. The people there seemed content with their fate. Well, perhaps content isn't the right word for them, but at least they seemed to have accepted their destitute situation via the bottom of a bottle. You think about joining them. The giant mostly seemed to be after you anyway, a sort of cat and mouse game for him, so maybe you should just try a new tactic and 'play dead' just don't move and don't play the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand maybe that idea was just ridiculously stupid, but still, maybe it would at least stop him from doing any more damage, plus you get to maybe get black out drunk by the time he does find you. But then on the other hand maybe he just wanted to crush you and you'd doom everyone in the bar even more than you've already doomed everyone in the hotel. Though there is still that potential way out in the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think over your options you here a loud rumbling from above, he's made it to the second floor. Whatever your going to do, you'd best be quick about it. So then, whats it gonna be?</span></div></div>",

Those digging a way out have got themselves pretty well organized. They've established a chain of handing ruble back and are making significant progress. You join the chain, doing your best to assist the frantic escape effort. After several minutes you can start to see light at the end of the tunnel, after a couple more the exit is open and the first escapees make it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately people drop whatever piece of scrap or rubble they were holding onto and start rushing to the light. Unfortunately, as people stopped clearing rubble as soon as they themselves could fit through the way out was actually fairly small, only 3 or 4 people get jam themselves through at once making things slow going for you and all the other people in the panicked mass forcing themselves through to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside you can hear loud stomps, the soldier saw what they were up to. The dim light a the end of the tunnel is shut off for a moment with one of the loud quaking stomps outside, then its clear again, then just dimmed a bit with the next stomp, then cleared right back up, he's stomping those making it through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you wanted to try to turn back, and get out of this meat grinder. But no. You'd made so much progress, and really you couldn't run away if you tried with all the people behind you forcing you forward. The light gets larger and brighter, your almost outside. Soon your climbing through the last bits of rumble. As soon as you clear the exit you break out into a mad dash forward. Using every bit left of your meager depleted strength you run onward. After about 10ft or 15ft you make out your intended destination, a small coffee shop across the street.</span></div></div>",

You might as well get wasted while you wait. Things in the bar are surprisingly orderly. Well, not quite orderly, but there were a few former patrons behind the bar tossing out bottles like it was Christmas in between taking their own swigs of drink, which kept things flowing well at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the loud sounds of movement from the giant searching around the 2nd floor, you reach out and soon enough manage to get thrown a couple bottles of whiskey. Not your favorite drink, but it'll do. You grab a seat at a crowded table of other drunkards and start on your drinks. After making significant progress on your first bottle there's a commotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the entrance to the bar there's someone shouting something, something about a way out. All at once many start rushing toward the rumored newly created escape route, though a significant number actually decided to stay put. You push yourself to your feet, dropping the partially emptied whiskey bottle to shatter on the ground. You rush out of the bar and through the hallway in the middle of a massive crowd doing just the same as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make it to the lobby you see that they actually managed to dig through the debris, looks like you made the wrong choice. The crowd was now thick, and progress toward the exit slowed to a crawl. As you passed the front desk you can see security footage from outside. Somehow it seemed one of the hotel's security cameras not only survived but managed to continue broadcasting to the little security TV. You can see the parking lot where the giant's massive boots can be seen stomping down on those trying to escape. It looks like he got most of anyone who trickled through, what must have been a pretty tight doorway, actually even after nearly a minute of watching, you don't think you've seen a single person make it past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon there is a loud crash and ahead of you people are flung back. Into the lobby The exit everyone was once rushing to now had a greatly damaged bus rammed through it. Soon after the bus was joined by a truck, then a cab, then a few other vehicles jammed through behind them, effectively closing off the only way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, you can only make out what looks like a bloody mess, maybe you did make the right choice back there. You turn around and start wading through the crowd back to the bar, hopefully in time to enjoy some of the 2nd whiskey bottle you left behind. You make it only about 12ft when you hear a familiar sound, louder than ever before. Tiles fell from the roof and bits chipped off the walls all around you as the ceiling was slowly lifted away. On instinct you dive underneath a random table with about a dozen other people trying to crowd under the same one. Fuck. Now what?</span></div></div>",
