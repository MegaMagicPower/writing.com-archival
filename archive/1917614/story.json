He spit it out quickly and worked his way to his hands and knees, which was a feat all on it's own. The sand even burned to touch. \"Gotta...find...water..\" Jacob said in a raspy voice. He noticed a small rocky formation where there was a small over hanging rock with shade underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow motivated, Jacob crawled across the hot Mojave sand and collapsed on his back under the rock. Jacob reached into his knapsack and pulled out a Rad-Away. He set the pouch next to him as he took the needle in his hand. He was moving over his left arm to inject it into his vein, but his hand was shaking so much.

You turned your attention to Alice Page, she was the medic and your age. She was reading a magazine shaking like a leaf, she was petite in stature only standing at a less than imposing 5,2 her hair brown tied back in a bun, it is normally quite long, her large brown eyes quivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jackson the designated marksman stared off into space rotating the cross on his dog tags, he had his hunting rifle with scope on the bunk with him. The last was the giant of a man John..... you're not sure what his last name is. He stands 6,5 and has seemingly every explosive ever made on him, He didn't say much. And finally the black sheep of the group, he was brilliant in science, but avoided eye contact and people in general. He was just awkward. Before you could really asses the group any more Ranger Carth flung the door open and barked orders at the group of four to get outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"This is the brass ring men, we lost contact with a town a few mile down the road, we would have sent a platoon out to investigate, but the truth is we're in a tough spot. If it really is the legon, we can't spare any more reinforcement, although I got permission to take direct control of this. First order get to the town alive.\" You reached the town by sundown, the ghost town was even more foreboding when its shrouded in moonlight. \"Spread out and search for survivors, or whatever caused it.\"<br>\r\nAlice followed you towards a house \"..... I guess i'll take point, get my back and stay focused.\" She didn't respond she just stared frightenedly at you. (Speech) \"Hey its going to be ok. We need to focus someone could be in serious need of help, and you're their best bet.\" She focused back on you and nodded, You swap your rifle for your shotgun and slowly turn the knob, the door creaked open slowly. Inside the house looked like hell. A trail of blood going into both rooms. You check left then right, all clear. You walk into the childs bedroom to find a pool of blood, no body. The parents room had one body, Alice began examining the corpse, after analyzing it she told you the cause of death was                   </span></div></div>",

The Ranger approaches you taking off his hat to scratch his head in stress. He began to speak only to be interrupted by a round    striking him in the heart, you couldn't do anything he was gone you grabbed his tags and took cover behind a house Sgt. More ordered to fall back to the large building behind the town. He flung the door open, John tied a bouquet to the door knob, as well as placing a mine on the staircase. You picked the lock to the top floor, then relocked it, you all sit in the dark waiting , you peer out the window to see the men were Fiends. You all took positions and layed down a field of fire bringing down a considerable portion of the ranks. This didn't matter as more came in to fill in their ranks. Laying down suppressive fire on you as well, this continued for seemingly ever until you ran out of rifle ammo, leaving you with a shotgun.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            More asks John for a grenade, he then obliges him and hands him the grenade. \"I'm going to give you all time, figures something out... good luck.\" he walks downstairs and fires on the group with a handgun until that ran dry as well. He grabbed the frag and attempted to throw it when it blew up in his hand, severing is arm. The men simply stepped over the slowly dying man. You waited for one after another the men to walk up the stairs to begin laying into them with your shotgun as the others continued to do what they could about the group. The men eventually stopped charging as you ran out of ammo, the head of this raiding party walked calmly in with an entourage of guards. You could surrender and save the lives of your comrades, or fight your way out. Or you could betray your comrades and offer to join the fiends.     </span></div></div>",

You feel Alices tool pry the wound open, your glad you prepared for this, she pulled the bits of bullet out and then poured purified water over the wound, the icey substance numbing the pain further before she wrapped it in a thick piece of cloth.You looked around and took in the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       You stood up to greet your new cell mates, \" So you're the newest additions to our club.

She radiated self entitlement, she was about 5,7 with her blonde hair tied in a ponytail, you noticed the tags on her neck.. she is part of the Brotherhood of Steel. John was in the cell as well as two other wastelander, one with a large beard who had been captured a long time ago, and the other a Ghoul named Harland.\" I was held up in the Repconn site in a standoff with super mutants, I eventually had to go hunting when these bastards caught ambushed me.\" THe guard entered the room and banged a sawed off shotgun on the bars.

You both had leather belts to take the guards by surprise, John had a broken chair leg, frankly you felt bad for whoever got hit by him. Harlow had a glass bottle broken into two making two corresponding knife like weapons, one for himself and Alice. The high and mighty knight in the corner ignored you like always, probably underestimating your chances. Alice called the guards for help, \" Come quick! something terrible has happened.\" The head guard walked in with four others \"someone better be dead or dying in here I shit you not!\" the lead guard said in an aggravated tone. He unlocked the door and three guards went in tow stood guard outside, within grabbing distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jacob and yourself leaped at the guards. You used the belt as a garrote and began strangling the guard. The two guards slammed into the cell as you both broke their necks in almost rehearsed sync. The guards at this point aimed their rifles at the two of you, Harlow drove the guard stabbing him in the chest multiple times, the guard dropped to the floor, with blood flowing out of his multiple wounds and his mouth, his shocked expression still on his face. Alice dove at the female guard stabbing her in between the shoulder blade, the woman dropped her weapon as Alice provided a quick kill shot as her assailant fell. The last man was focused on John only armed with a kitchen knife tried to slash at him only to have his hand be caught then elbow broken brutally by the table leg. Before he could even scream the metal leg struck him on the temple ending his fight. You all scavenged for weapons before you turned your attention to the blonde woman in the corner. \" Do you want to come with us?\" You ask her,\" she scoffed as if she found the idea of you helping her was comedic. (Speech) \"Listen I get it your prideful, but not invincible. This may be your only way out.\" She gave you a puzzled look \" Really why do you want to help me. I may be in a opposing faction.\" She asked as though you were trying to trick her. \" As of right now, we're all prisoners in a life and death situation.. Petty things like that will only get us killed.\" She nodded and took the weapon you offered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You walked up to the armory door and began to slowly and methodically pick the lock, as to not draw more attention. Inside Jacob grabbed his Katana and placed the Bozar on his back. Janet the Steel woman grabbed a laser rifle and waited. Alice put on her original gear as did John.Harlow took his rifle and eyed a flamethrower, Jacob eyed him in surprise at his choice \"What? When our covers blown a little fire will stall these bastards.\" You yourself took a hatchet, Service rifle, and a 9mm submachine gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Your group began silently neutralizing many of the sleeping pillagers You methodically made your way through until an alarm began sounding. Guards began rushing your group only to be effectively cut down one after another until you reached the next group of prisoners. Many NCR soldiers. You flung the door open they were more than happy to oblige by killing any of the men they could find, providing a distraction while your group worked their way towards the clan leaders chamber. You see the man standing with a large chainsaw revving up. He attempted to charge you only to be torn apart by well placed shots from your allies. Harlow effectively set the body guards ablaze, they fell to the ground until the sprinkler system kicked on. \" Grab all the water you can carry, take only safe food.\" Your group did this and met the new survivors at the entrance. Jacob took the lead \" Everyone were moving, whatever happens out there stay together and keep moving.\" The Deathclaw stood no chance as well placed shot after well place shot brought the beast to its knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Your group moved on until they all reached an abandoned prospector cave. You head in with the group and sit down, but should you stay with the group or move on alone.                  </span></div></div>",

He ordered the execution of the men and as he approached woman standing in front of her young daughter, I snapped and fired a round at him. I spent the next few days avoiding their assassins, hell I still am.\" You all sat in silence until you decided to start<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I joined the NCR to protect from that, only now I realize, sometimes my enemy is still human. In my infantry training, i'm not sure if everyones is like this, they trained us to kill made it seem trivial. All that training, all those nights of me lying in bed telling myself I couldn't wait to get out there and fight, nothing really prepares you for all the blood and all the screaming. I guess thats how it is for all of us.\" The silence returns again this time broken by Alice, \"You guys have family?\" You felt relived in the change of pace,\" Yah a sister, names Casey about sixteen now, for years she was all that mattered to me, my Dad left at a young age and mom worked all the time, I'd rather not say what she did to get money. I learned how to fight, pick locks, and talk just to keep Casey safe. I remember one time I was twelve and she asked me if I would always be there, here I am abandoning her just like my father.\" Well what about you Harlow? How did you grow up.\" Harlow sighed \"If you want to hear an inspirational story about how I overcame my affliction and was strong because of it, you're wrong. I was the only ghoul in the family, my mother was addicted to jet, she used it so much that I became irradiated. I ran away as soon as I knew how to shoot a gun.Thats all I have to say about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You quickly began getting tired and unfolded a sleeping bag.

The day had passed like a cool summer day, the group all decided to spend the night at Goodsprings. Todd walked into the saloon, shaking off the cold of night. He sat down at the bar. Trudy the owner turned to take his order \" What can I get.... Todd?!\" She said in excitement, Trudy and himself spent the next couple of minutes catching up. \"Wheres Casey and my mother at?\" She gave him a look with a hint of sadness in her eyes.\" Your Mother stopped working, Casey had to start working at the General Store, if fact she might be there right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Todd left the saloon seething with rage.

She just stood their for a moment  in silence giving todd a moment to get a good look at her appearance. She wore a green shirt with a blue jacket  over the shirt, she wore blue jeans that seemed as if they never had ever had dirt on them, her brown eyes staring up at him, and lastly her brown hair in a ponytail. Casey suddenly ran to him standing on her toes to hug him. She was still speechless \" I got you some things for your birthday, sorry I missed it.\" They both sat down at a small table he reached into his survival pack retrieving a Bottle of Nuka-Cola Victory as well as seven small boxes of Gumdrops and Bubblegum. These may seem like cheap last minute gifts but they actually are quite difficult to find or buy for that matter. Casey's eyes showed the appreciation he had hoped for as she took the bottle containing the crimson substance.            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Todd waited a moment then decided to just jump right in. \"So.. your working now?\" She looked back up at him in surprise \"I.. just until Mom gets back on her feet.. oh crap that reminds me.\" She hurries over to the dropped box lifting the lid to reveal a now broken toaster. \"Damn it I just keep screwing up\" She was on the verge of tears \" How much was it?\" Todd asked as he approached his upset sibling. \" Five caps, or NCR dollars.\" He took out ten caps and ten NCR dollars \"heres another gift. Five caps and NCR credits, and another five of each for you.\" Todd said as he placed the money in her hand. \" So why are you here so late?\" She asked after finding her voice \"I could ask the same of you.\" \"Hey don't treat me like a kid, I can take care of myself. Done ever since you left.\" Todd scratched his head swallowing hiding the pain. \" I'm Serious what if someone came in here. Robbing you would be the least of your worries. What would you do.\" She suddenly became defensive pulling out a small switchblade \"with this\" Todd almost laughed at the sight of her holding the knife, she couldn't be any taller than five three. This made her even angrier, \"Then Ill use this.\" She went to the counter grabbing a silenced .22 pistol, not much of an improvement as shooting anything larger than a gecko would only make it pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Before you could talk any more your mother walks in. \" Casey, what did I tell you about wasting food!

How could you do this to your own daughter?\" She retaliated by cursing at him for a few seconds until he walked out. As Todd reached the other side of the street Casey ran after him quickly impeding his progress \"Look just stay she doesn't mean it when she says that.\" \"No Casey that is no way to talk to a sixteen year old.\" She interrupted you with anger in her eyes \"Sixteen... You're unbelievable you leave for a year and already forget my age! I just turned Fifteen, Moms right you did change.\" She stormed off leaving Todd standing in front of the Caravaners... Not a word was spoken as you all continue on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Todd reached Camp McCarren still shaken a bit from your altercation. Todd enter the main terminal, you sit down in the waiting area. Soon he called you in and and told you to sit down. He outstretched his arm to offer Todd a cigarette, Todd declined \" I wish I had that resolve, damn things will kill me yet. So you're this Todd Wainio I've been hearing so much about recently. I tell ya I wish we had more honest, dedicated soldiers for the public to identify with. Listen I have the authority to recommend you for higher training, or let you out altogether. Either way you need to make your choice soon so I can start the paperwork.\" Todd sat for a few moments thinking about everything and decided.   <br>\r\nSpecial?                 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two days later: The training Todd Wainio would be going through was known as ARC, Advanced Recon Commando. He along with the other candidates waited at a landing pad on a section of the airstrip. The Vertibird arrived at around 0700 hours, the armor was an Olive drab green. The   hydraulic lift opened with a metallic clang as it scrapes the landing pad. Outsteps a man in wearing a personalized stealth armor sporting a dark blue color instead of black, the mask only was in the same tone had one distinct eye the other no defined eyepiece. He removed his mask revealing his greying hair, eye patch covering his right eye, and three three one on where his eye would be and one where his jugular vein would be. His weapons were two corresponding 10mm submachine guns, a customized anti-material rifle, and a long weapon resembling a Machete Gladius only it was longer and more narrow. The man stood inspection the men as he looked less than pleased. \"So you're the soldiers that stand out in the NCR? No wonder they hired me. You all may refer to me as Slade, for the next three months you all will be in your own personal Hell.\" He then ordered Wainio and his comrades onto the the aircraft as it lifted of the ground and made its way to Lake Mead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              ( Fast Forward to three weeks later.) Wainio and his companions stood on the stone dock standing at attention in front of Slade currently wearing his mask again. \"Today is Combat training...\" Before he could even continue he noticed one soldier, Freeman whispering. \" Today is combat training, Freeman get the Hell up here!\" He did reluctantly \"Listen I'm not going to fight a blind man.\" They heard Slade laughing at the comment \"Then you won't have any trouble\" He tossed him a considerably large blade and readied it, Freeman swung and missed. He then charged at Slade, this repeated until Slade struck his arm with the  blunt side of the blade slicing the tendong, the arm fell limply to his side as he collapsed in blinding pain. \"Can you stand, or fight?\" Slade asked rhetorically... no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               (Two months later, final training) One by one the men dropped out as the training became more and more brutal. Wainio stood alone now sore, battered, and bruised but these injuries were fadein. These were only from the last section in interrogation, he had to withstand and then get a piece of information from an initiate. \"Wainio you'r all that stands now, only one final test. Survival stay there night on the east island, pass this and receive your armor.\" Todd remembered very little as he blocked out most of the night up until this point. He had been hunting a Mirelurk and was now being hunted. A pack of them scanned the treeline as he crouched behind a collapsed tree as he heard the sounds of the nocturnal predators growing near. He gripped the combat knight as he flanked the clumsey beast and stabbed the blade in between its breastplate. It let out a haunting cry as its heart slowed to a stop. He turned to see the two moving in, one lunged at him pinning him to the ground. Its gnashing teeth attempting to bite, his knife wielding arm her grabbed a considerably sized stone and slammed it into the beasts head. The last predator fled in fear of seeing its kin die with such ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     Todd returned the next day victorious and for the first time he had known him, Slade looked hopeful. He bulled out a briefcase holding a suit. \"Here put this on.' the armor refit itself to his body.Its white plates reacting to the light. \" Hello. Its nice to meet you. Who may I hide you from today?\" a female voice asked him \"Synchronizing with cardiovascular system.\" He suddenly felt a sharp pain on his spine, then calmness to replace the feeling. HIs pipboy updated to show heart rate, temperature, mood, it also allowed for active camouflage, trauma plates  and blood pressure. \"In the event of severe trauma. I will attempt to keep you alive and send out short wave radio signals.\" Todd may not realize it, but he no longer only stood for being a soldier, but may stand as a beacon hope to the more than just the NCR. He must now decide on what to do.                </span></div></div>",

He found a group of four standing in front of a cell mocking the inhabitant. He took carefully placed shots dropping three, the Lefty pointed a revolver at his assailant only to be shoot in return. The shots taken were nothing short of incredible, he took two precise shots one round hitting his Pulmonary Artery mortally wounding him. Wainio walked over to the cell to find a young girl laying on the bed facing the wall while using her hands to cover her ears. He slowly picked the lock before he slowly placed a hand on her shoulder \"NO... please.\" She said before turning to see who it was. She broke into tears as she jumped to her feet hugging him.

Todd grabbed the mans hand holding the gun as it went off simultaneously. Todd felt a round hit his stomach as he collapsed. The man was immediately on top of him trying to strangle him.

He slowly rose and made his way down the valley to the body on the ground. Casey still in shock of killing a person just starred at her feet.
