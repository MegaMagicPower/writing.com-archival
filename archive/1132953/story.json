            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>sashay<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy default she stands a mere 5'5 and weighs 106lb, her build is rather light and limber albiet with muscular chest and hips,long spine, moderately long tail, stubby head with small ears pressed to the side of her head when at rest. Her color scheme sets her apart from most meerkats though, a light shiney fuschia purple base with a even lighter underbelly. Her back marks are classic tapering brown. The slender 5 foot tail has a dark black tip, a slight bulge a slight bulge about six inches down from that. The tail is fully prehensile and quite strong, she often hangs from it for a proper ambush. Her femine endowments are good but not overbearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory: Sashay was born in Kenya as a freak of her kind, she started small with a strange gummy texture, but grey larger and larger, gaing a more firm rubbery texture on her body. She has never had any fur in her life, but is only mildly curious about it. She started as a non anthro meerkat her first live meal was a dingo puppy, she soon developed a taste for meat and expanded her diet quickly, achiving the devouring of sentients on a unlucky teenager who wandered into the desert one fine day. The woman never returned and eating him gave Sashay the intelligence and the \"Structure\" to stand on four two legs endlessly,rather than just when standing lookout. Since that day she has never been home. She knows her home \"troup\" by scent and they are the only ones she doesn't see on her menu. Everyone else, other meerkats certianly included, are just waiting to be sashaying into her belly. Since leaving \"home\" she wanders, enjoying both civilized lands and the natural beauty of her home<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills and Powers: She is certainly not your everyday meerkat, in addition to the basics of every (rubber) I've designed, nearly impossible to hurt without being digested, insanly stretchy in the stomach area while just very stretchy in other places, simplified internal organs that are mainly for effect rather than use Her stomach turns anything inside it into meerkat plastic to be divided around her body as need and help nourish the living shiny coat. The stretchy stomach is opaque to start, semi transpartent at one human sized meal, and roughly the tint of a lightly shaded window when stuffed with two or more times her normal body weight. The one innabilty of the latex like digestive track is the inability to digest either horns or teeth. These are burped up later or passed through the other end clean.. and often help make her own jewelry or artifacts to sell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eats alot, her metabolism is as high as anyones, giving her both power and hunger, this being said she must eat her own body weight every day to maintain her bulk, eating more will slowly grow her body while eating less will starve her down to her default. Its rather obvious which way she choses. She can devour and absorb her prey in a multitude of ways, when desperate even casual contact can be used.(Ie hodling someone in a Hug and letting her body flow over there own. When desperate she will do anything and everything to eat, betraying friends to live is just something she'll have to deal with. This is why she is thankful to also be able to \"sluice\" off excess size into a gemstone for latter useage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex and things like it: She loves pleasure, as most do, and her body is designed to be supple, lavacious, sexy, and quite able to take in a male., though most often they aren't let go and used for her own body. Way back when it took a male to be absorbed into her snatch to give her the hir form. This took ALOT of energy from her body too.. and was unstable. Now, even though looking quite normal in hir form, even passing for a man at some times, she must be alert to getting to into her new erogenous zones. After using the naughty bits 21 times they will be totally used up and no longer hir, of course the way she regenerates it is by holding another rubbery meerkat to her groin and letting it be absorbed, making a massive phallus. Females only give her 14 shots and a smaller member, but do then\"Job\" just as well, as things go on and power is used up hir endowment shrinks, though only she knows how many lodes she has left. This sex curiosity blends in well with one of her favorite hobbies, implanting her essential rubbery meerkat seed into the stomach of preds then letting them live.. sorta.. once the poor victim has been implanted they will slowly be turned into and absorbed by the injection eventually turning into a meerkat, a very tasty meerkat to EVERYTHING, the amount of the original creatures mind that remains varies of course. This is a fate worse than death for most apex predators. Whenever a victim is transformed like this she can track them uneringly, and often does.. a second meeting always ends in there demise, be it belly or more constructive purposes of the her/hir needs. Finally when devouring a meerkat through anal vore, in addition to being exceptionally arousing) the subject gives her a second endowment hidden inside her tail, and like the first it needs to be recharged every so often. She has a trick or two left she'll show those who get to close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Hungry, ambitious. She loves the idea of taking people inside her, the four basic sorts are all done, though oral probably still gets the biggest chunk of her gustatory time. She is able to stuff herself to immense size(3 human sized meals in her stomach at default size)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'll eat almost anything, but her favroite foods are Lions and Hyenas.. the look of shock on there faces are priceless as eh gobbles them down, soon after those two are ungulates oddly enough(she was trampled when young), Still in her very tasty category fit the rest of the big cats, the jackles and wild dogs, and the rare nile alligator. Eventually she'd like to eat a Elephant at her default size, no where near this milestone yet. Humans are of course tasty, and humanoids of her favroite foods just knocks the flavor up one more notch \"GULP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enjoys deception and seduction almost as much as the hunt and pounce meal, not being cursed with skin that needs to breath a leap in a vat of latex paint'll give her a new look in minutes, a bit of touch up and you'll never know who she is.. till she eats you, the latex based paint is absorbed back into her body with no ill effects a few days later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJOB: Her employment has varied through her life, being somewhat hyper at times steady work is nearly impossible to keep. She often resorts to living off the land, being a simple creature(at least in the maintinance sense) she does this very well, water, nutrients, and everything else coming from her catch. However she does have a love of the pleasures of human civilzation, making money through selling affrican artificats(Selling tooth necklaces, various other trophies,and even some historical relics there owners aren't going to be needing \"burp\" And stashing away the proceds for a rainy day, or for specail treats for herself. Her main Hobby is athletics, Running especially (A classic prey and Meerkat hobby) and Acrobatics (Likewise usefilly) and maintaining a checklist of how best to devour each species, subspecies, and even \"Family\" of meal she takes... not very normal for a prey species indeed)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarb. Casually and racing She wears track shorts(White normally), a bra(again white) and her race number (17)</span></div></div>",

A natural tendency deep inside burned brighter that day. Since then she has been subduing, devouring and savoring everything she can put into her mouth, stuffing momentoes and belongings into her pouch as she wanders, seeing the sites and enjoying every moment on earth. The sights she has seen are all the more impressive because of her tendency to only use her own body to move, no machines.  Now she wanders the dusty paths of Australia(And even more recently the American west) moving by foot with a stamina that outdoes most pieces of machinery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhyscially she averages 23 feet tall and a weight best described as \u201cEnormous\u201d, though as most roos she scales down and up as needed. Built like a tank she tends to charge in and use her bulk to its greatest advantage, trying to resist and NOT get gulped and shoved into her jaws is nearly imposible, humans are real bite sized snacks for her at her default size Snatching them with both paws and shoving them in like candy can depopulate towns quite quickly. Sometimes people fight back but her hide is pretty thick. Once tanks come out she motors off of course, managing to get up to speeds of almost 50 mph, tending to taking down shabby buildings as she goes. Once into the wilds to digest her gorge few people find her. Her color scheme is grey and black with a few tattoo\u2019s over her body. The creator of these is in some doubt, but who knows\u2026. Looking into her deep green/orange eyes can be a wonderful experience, but be careful or you\u2019ll get lost, and if you stay still to long the big hungry lady will put you someplace for her own pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality wise her hunger is unmatched, Stuffing her face full of humans and dragons mostly but few things escape her grip, growing her girth to an obsecene level. Somehow she still moves fairly well though traditional hopping is out of the question. Boistourous and full of life, if satisfied in belly she is quite a caring person and shows no malice to anyone she devours,  its just her natural tendencies she can\u2019t resist.. Oh yes, she does have quite a crude and juvinile sense of humor. ,,, but some think that\u2019s \u201ccharming\u201d. Supremely comfortable and confident with herself she knows what she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t have a steady job, she gets her own food and her fur really protects her from the elements, what else does a person need. For fun she does frequent a wrestling club, always cleaning out a few of the less skilled combantants and taking them away with her forever. Between her thighs or inside her copious gut it all ends up as more roo to love for others. Sweet sexy roo smell pours off her more and more as she gets into rhythm or works out,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing 9'4 and weighing in at 1211lb of pachederm power she has a tendency to make an impression where she goes. Heavy head, and well chested she moves well for her bulk but the bulk is there, including the extra thick hide in places that functions as a natural armor. The beasts muscles are quite visible through her thick hide, athletic and almost crafted like a hindu goddess complete with a sizeable pot belly she has been unable to work off in the wilds, she enjoys eating to much. Her strong abs endless struggle isn't doing well in compacting it back into her torso proper. The thick arms and legs are almost a foot in circumfrence. All in all a Slightly stout build. Her hide is a dark blue shade. Unusual for most female elephants she sports tusks, horizontal and curved up from her face they provide an excellent auxiliary weapontry. Her own trunk provides a third hand,being prehensile and quite usefuly flexible. Nearly 6 feet long it really can reach every place thats important. Finally her mamories, though large are well set and secured against her body, providing a fairly streamlined pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombat: Not the fastest creature but her reflexes are quite good, sweeping trunk attacks, back kick, shoulder blocks, and countless other quick and dirty attacks tend to put her on top of her foe. Should she be feeling... \"Entertaining\" These quick moves often move to more brutal ones such as slams and pile driver, all quite capable of putting people down for the count. Tending toward humilation and brutality she gets off slowly making thing worse and worse. Should a foe exclaim \"It can't get any worse.. it will\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory(needs work)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lives by the rule of the jungle and drapes it over her wherever she goes. The strong survive, the weak digest, the weak should be THANKFULL to be humiliated and tormented because they aren't being eaten yet. People who don't realize the supremacy of the strong deserve no mercy. She certainly doesn't see it as evil or wrong to play with that lucky food. They should enjoy every moment of life. So far she's been hanging out in Morroco and savoring the tastes, though she is likely to be moving to more civilized areas soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA personal love of devouring lions, all types and all kinds, they are her favorite food, closely followed by other felines. \"I got pride in me\" Is a common phrase ,she really should ad a \"A\" between got and pride. Following soon after are humans,(Hunters and poachers obviously) Effectively the more threatening someone is to an elephant naturally the more tasty it is... of course elephants are quite scrumptious too following this logic. She will spice up and prepare humans in more \"normal\" ways if she has the time too, not adverse to cooking up dinner in a stewpot ofther than her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality? She is savage, her blood races with hungers, knowing that the awakening inside her is burning for experinaces. Wiilling to do anything and anything for self gratification she is always on the hunt. Not always evil but she finds it hard to focus on gentler things when aroused. Morally anyone whos smaller than her is often seen as a \"toy\" and treated with as much remorse when eaten and devoured. Belching up a few momentoes that don't go through her body. Once your dead you have no need for such things, and they do make such wonderful mometoes and materials for her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarb: on her tusks she wears a mixture of the grisly and the fancy. Tusk rings are common enough but often she also has the skulls of the male victims she has recently eaten(tusk through jaw area and puncturing through the top of the skull. These dried skulls tent to splinter and as such aren't really considered long term trophies.. On her turnk though she just keeps it painted with interesting designs(rings would limit her abilites and uses of the trunk Other facial adornments include earings(easily poped off to avoid damage of her own ears of course) The Elephants bust shows the same sort of gold nibble rings on each breast. She keeps her front pretty much naked except for bracers around her wrists and ankles. This is counterbalanced by having her \"freinds\" Paint designs on her belly and arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should she start.. what place is worthy for her appearnce</span></div></div>",

He hips are at least a foot thick, her ass is so massive it looks as if there were melons under her skin, her breasts hang down to her belly button, or they would if her belly didn't stick out 7 feet. Rolls of fat cover the sides of her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: When her hunters bring back captured humans or furs, she decides what to do with them. If they are humans, she eats or unbirths them no matter what. If they are female furs, if she doesnt eat them or unbirth them, she keeps them as her personal hand maidens. If they are male furs, multiple factors determine her decision: if they are fat, she'll eat/unbirth them; if they are slim, she'll either eat/unbirth them or keep them as her sex slaves depending on their looks; if they are muscular, she'll make them hunters; if they are good looking enough, she'll keep them as her sex slaves.

A Liger by breed and a herm by gender she (shi prefers to be referd to as such) has had a lot to deal with. Life as it was wasn't so back, a pit animal,trained to fight on four legs for the joys of the masses, never knowing her mother and father, never really thinking above animal thoughts. She can't remember from before she prize fought, mostly with other animals, a freak of nature billed as, she won some, she lost some, she was scared by many. It was one evenging, when her cruel master was drunk to high heavens at the bar that she made her escape to the Wild. She had the same tribal memeories of every animal, something about where they belong. The fact that she was actually in Chicago took her by the most massive surprise even if she didn't know what a city was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pretty much ran through the streets of the city, attracting cops and unwelcomed attention from everywhere, a manhunt as it were was soon after her. After 12 hours of being on the run she literally tumbled into a small shop in the red light district and came upon the body of a young witch who apparently perhised from some ritual or other(that or being caught in a robbery, Bamboo couldn't decide at the time. She stumbled into the various items for sale and accidently fell through the trap door(wood not being meant for someone over a quarter ton. Here she landed in the witches real stash. And found out that most had stuck to her. A platinum necklass with  sapphires, Emeralds set into it in many pladces and a giant blood red ruby hanging down from the middle. The mystic talismans seemed stuck on her, secreting strange emenations while she tried to recuperate in apparently safety. When she woke up she found sentience had come upon her, and strange urges began to flow through her body, thus the change had happened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the change the first thing she did was go back and eat her owner, alive and whole, kicking, somehow this came naturally to the newly enlarged hybrid. The struggling lump in her belly gave her a new life, feeling it nourish the newly enchanced body, and then she stood on two legs and roared in victory, she was now able to stand. Standing on two legs had a lot of charms, it also made her feel a bit bad for what she did, she make a big belch but he was gone\u2026 and had a rather greasy after taste. This second change to being an anthro was the last one for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down her biggest wish now is to have cubs, a lot of cubs. Her choice in partners is rather picky because she dosen't really want to get brought into a relationship.. so she eats most of them after\u2026a black widow perhaps, but she can at least justify THOSE urges to eat, after all, the male is helping her cub grow big and strong. Just momma licking her fingers as dady struggles in the gut. So far this method hasn't exactly gotten her knocked up, but it has knocked up her dress size. For the male part of the equation she understands where the problem is, sex makes her so hungry she eats the laides too.. .such is her life..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality wise she is complex run by hormones,  the urge to control those hormones and the hungers she tends to beat herself up on eating innocent people. She as such tends to eat those who REALLY manage to tick her off, at first she just did it to normal people who angered her(cops giving her littering tickets) but then got to the realization that this wasn't much more satisfying for the soul than eating someone off the street.. of course all these attempts at morality falter when  she is truly ravenous.. just she'll drink and mope about afterword when she's been bad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob\u2014Prize fighter, she goes undercover in seedy rings to box, bare knuckeled and dressed in heavy sweatypants(makes her sweat a storm but she remains nearly totally hidden from view \"the masked monster\" is the name she goes by, and its all a very normal way to make money, she never lets people know here secrets  Through boxing she has learned to control her needs and practice zen(not perfect by anymeans yet), it has also given her agility, toughness and a punch that can knock out any bull. She shambles in the oversized garb, but is doing her best not to be found out. However, little does she know it but all the paraphernalia that got grafted to her body has given her natural witch powers\u2026 soon she will discover these too.</span></div></div>",

Sky blue with orange tiger stripes she is a impressive visage that has never depended on blending in. The queen of her territory, it\u2019s the others that must hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Structure and Capabilites:  A almost mustlid level metabolism gives Malice tremendous natural gifts , when not gorged. She is lean, muscular, Lightening quick reflexed, fast and very durable.  (a industrial pile driver has come down on her shoulders and did not scum to the broken bones).  Anyway you look at it she seems the consummate predator. Leap 23 feet high,  73 feet long. Full run 54 mph. Sprint 89 mph. Wicked forclaws, classic disemboweling leg talon, both slice through hardened steal like butter, (thought they are not meant for digging)\u201d she has been known to slip through passages three feet high when in pursuit of prey.(much th the meals chagrin). Gifted with marvelous recuperatitive powers that are stimulated with thrashing meat inside her belly, any cost for food. (it is also why shy has no scars, by all logic her slender snout should be carved up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality:  Malice shares some personality traits with Gallows, but some would say she is less refined and nuanced.  A strict believer in the strong survive she feels no emotions to those who don\u2019t serve a purpose. No positive or negative, you are what she eats. Devouring all she comes on that will not suit her own view of a pack(Which is admittedly rather eccentric). Inside that reptilian skull is the mind of a tactician though, effective at hunting down her prey with ruthless hunger and seemingly unending determination, some might consider this single minded pursuit of a quarry a weakness. Escape from her is temporary, either soon to be rectified or a trap being lead for another score. While she understands civilization she deplores its use, weakening the gene pool<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Prey :Anything. Humans are common of course, but she frequently has been known to chug down massive meals that are incapacitated by either her or her pack. The act of ingesting a big meal is a sign of true dominance. Her aggression lets her end up eating people who are far bigger but with less drive<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Garb: Minimal\u201d She wears a spiked collar, a spiked bracelet and anklet(left forclaw, right leg).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sky that hung overhead the dense and lively jungle landscape was painted with gleaming white strokes across a sapphire canvas. The sun shone it's light from mountain to mountain, with not even the winding branches of foliage in the canopies able to obstruct its the path. The air, unspoiled and pristine, gave the denizens of the jungle vitality and vigor for the day, given freely by the centuries-old trees and other plants that made up their home. Everything was green and lush and beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the serenity of the scene, Tethys didn't feel particularly bothered by disrupting it. The hadrosaur, standing erect at a whopping twenty-eight feet and weighing at a staggering thirty tones, was more or less used to the destruction that regularly occurs around her. It was assuredly not her fault that she was like this, and if anything it was the rest of the world that should apologize to her for being so small. The massive lizard moves one thick leg in front of the other, the green trees crunching and parting as her blubbery hips shoved them aside. There was barely any effort into her rampage. This was just a casual jaunt to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trunks snapped as if they were pencil-thin sticks, the birds that inhabited the trees they were connected flying away frantically to avoid Tethys. The hadrosaur plucked a few dozen from the air and popped them into her mouth, gulping them down in a manner of seconds. They could hardly even be qualified as a snack, but a figure like her needs maintenance, and unfortunately those birds were probably only slightly smaller than the animals inhabiting the forest she was trembling. She didn't feel enthusiastic about hunting for such small-prey, so she settled for lazily gulping down avians. She stretched her arms out wide and sighed, breathing in the fresh air, leaving behind a trail of toppled trees and giant footprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were drenched in sweat as you ran away from the colossus that was coming your way, you felt as if you were going to pass out. 'Why did they have to send me?!' you shouted in your head but not out loud, not daring to risk your presence to the monster behind you. You had the luxury of being unspotted, but the beast was coming up on you fast. You lived in a small, but relatively prosperous human village only a couple miles away on the edge of the vast jungle. Saying that you were unprepared for it was an understatement, but the leaders laughed your concerns off. The game was docile and fruit easy to find, the only real danger is the low risk of running into a dinosaur or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have given anything in the world for you to have run into 'or something', but instead the powers that be decided that today would be the unluckiest day of your whole life, and gave you a hadrosaur for an adventurous chase. The dinosaurs have roamed this world far longer than your ancestors have, incredibly dangerous and voracious, with the only comfort being they're numbers were low around your village. Several generations of people have lived and died in the village, with only the tale of the dinosaurs passed down to make sure they never expanded their borders. You had begun to think they were all made up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, is that a...no, it couldn't be!\" You stopped your mad sprint as a massive, fat paw crashed only a couple feet away behind you, tumbling to the ground as the shockwave reverberated through your bones. You landed on your front, and immediately twisted on your back to get up, but after that, you couldn't move. You looked up, up, up into the sky as the hadrosaur looked down back at you in amazement and curiosity. You were stricken from fear, your limbs wouldn't obey your brain. She was a female, you deduced. It was a  rather obvious fact considering where all her heft mostly centered around. She had a massive, heaving bosom that giggled and quivered like a lake in the middle of the storm, with two big pink nubs attached to their fronts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her bosom was the most predominant, other parts of the dinosaur's body deserve attention too. She was fat all around, from her toes to her face, every bit of her rotund and soft and plump. She had a stomach that looked to be as big as your home, ominously gurgling and churning in hunger. She had hips that would make your mother blush, protruding so far the trees around her warped to their will. From your perspective you could see her behind, while obstructed by her legs, were the 'skinniest' part about her, though they were still incredibly big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so caught up in drinking in her admittedly beautiful form that you didn't notice until too late she was reaching down to pick you up. You yelped as you fell into her chubby paw, and felt the world around you rise as it did to her face. This was it. You were dino food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh my goodness, I was right! I caught a real live human!\" Tethys squealed in happiness as she eyed her latest prize. Humans were such a rare treat in the world, and they made the perfect...well, everything! She only got to see a human once, when she was little and her parents brought back one as a prize from their hunting trip together. This one is even cuter than she remembered! \"Hehe, hello there, lil' guy!\" She batted her eyes at the little thing, before tucking it into the valley of her boobs for safekeeping. </span></div></div>",
