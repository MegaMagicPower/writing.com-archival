It took some effort, as it felt that someone had used something rather thick to seal them shut, and left the remainder of the sealant in his mouth. As Cyrus tried to sit up, he found a weight on his chest. Two weights, to be exact. One blonde, one brunette. He remembered them as the two very young, very eager serving wenches who took him up on his offer of a guaranteed night of unrivaled pleasure. From the dim memories he was able to bring up through the remnants of an alcoholic haze, as well as the contented smiles upon the girls' sleeping faces, Cyrus deduced he had been able to keep his promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently slipping from beneath the sleeping forms of both young women, Cyrus made his way to a stand with a pitcher of water and a porcelain bowl, with a piece of reflective glass above it. As he watched his face, Cyrus studied the face looking back at him from the mirror. Five years past his thirtieth birthday, Cyrus was still considered a master of the long blade, a swordsman who had very few equals. But the weeks of campaigning for some fat lord or another, of searching in desolate places for legendary treasures, and yes, the carousings that followed a successful campaign or adventure, were beginning to take their toll. Cyrus knew his limitations. He was an unrivaled swordsman, and knew how to handle himself in a number of situations, and could even lead a small group of men into (and more importantly, out of) perilous situations. He had earned, found and spent several small fortunes since the age of fourteen. All notable accomplishments, particularly for the third son of a man whose job it was to tend to the swans, peacocks and other exotic birds owned by a wealthy nobleman's wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cyrus was getting to the age where men like him were captains of companies and military advisers to nobleman. And beyond directing his own sword, and the swords that fought next to him, Cyrus knew he had no talent for such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more campaign, Cyrus thought to himself, as he began dressing. Enough money to buy an inn on a not-too-traveled road, where I can regale my guests about days gone past while I sit by a warm fire with a good meal in my stomach and a cup of wine in my hand. Or maybe I should find some fat nobleman who has martial dreams and serve as an instructor of blade to his sons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cyrus mused these possibilities, his eyes spotted a large envelope that had been slipped under his door sometime the night before. Picking it up, Cyrus noted that the seal on the envelope had no discernible symbol.  Shrugging, Cyrus broke the seal and pulled out the parchment inside the envelope, to discover that it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The letter had invited him to visit the manor house of Lord William of Duskbloom Marsh on the far edge of the region. Apparently, there was some dire business the man needed help with and only the bravest souls and fiercest warriors would have a hope of accomplishing this task... though he conveniently forgot to mention what exactly it was... only that there would be \"piles of gold and silver\" as a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyrus sighed as he sat down at his wooden table and unfolded the note again to read it over again. While he was confident in his abilities and the money promised he wasn't too sure if he felt up to dealing with such a bothersome task. Not only was the manor home a good three or four days away by horse it sat right near the center of a swampy marsh filled with unpleasantness, to say nothing of Lord William's... \"eccentric\" reputation. Even for a whole house made of gold was it really work the trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyrus checked the address given and ripped it off the rest of the parchment, making sure to catch William's signature on the torn piece. \"Enough to retire and then some, but nasty bugs and swamp critters are just the beginning of this little errand.\" Cyrus mumbled to himself as he he thought over what he might face if he showed up. \"Knowing William he could very well be planning a full on civil war with those swamp inhabitants of his or maybe he just needs someone to kidnap a princess or two for him. Whatever the job... it probably won't be clean.

Thinking quickly he deposited the the torn bit of the letter into his boot and chucked the rolled up remainder into the nearby hearth while they were distracted with a man emptying his coin purse on the nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of gold for someone dressed so modestly.\" one of the guardsman said as he picked up a handful of gold and silver coins. \"It looks like there's enough here to buy a new horse and still have enough to gamble away on cards and dice.

Her face did possess the long and narrow shape often associated with the description \"horse-faced\", but the features of her face possessed none of the symmetry that a good horse trader would look for before making his purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding eighteen hands high and weighing a little more than thirteen stones, the fact that Kairin was a woman was an almost forgotten afterthought in her appearance. Kairin kept her hair short, and the dark reddish strands always had the appearance of having gone weeks without being washed (which they often did). Her customary apparel of a leather jerkin over which she would adorn a coat of mail for melee covered her already muted womanly \"charms.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is true that occasionally Kairin might be roughly approached by one of her male colleagues, motivated by curiosity or the lack of female \"companionship\" after weeks on a campaign, but Kairin easily (and usually violently) rebuffed such advances without a second thought. Kairin had put away all thoughts of intimacy, physical or emotional, since her childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Kairin had been born more seemly, or perhaps if she had been born somewhere other than in a herder's hut on the edge of the kingdom she lived in, her fate would have been different, and she might not be known as one of the best (if not THE best) long sword wielders in the known world. But fate had sculpted her appearance and chose her birthright, and thus Kairin had grown into the woman that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt present, Kairin was sitting at a table along the wall of a nameless tavern in a nameless town. To the east were the Abun mountains, home of the tribes of wild men and other rough beings who would occasionally come down from their mountains to see if the flatlands would provide easy pickings. So there were military garrisons along the mountains where rough men had pledged to persuade the mountain creatures that there were no easy pickings here, and the towns such as the one Kairin was in sprung up, in part to provide for the needs of these rough men, martial and otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the table sat Ricven, the closest thing that Kairin had to a friend. Ricven was a decent enough swordsman, though he did not possess  Kairin's skill. But the talent that Ricven used to make his way through the world was not his skill with a sword and shield, but the deftness with which he used his fingers and tongue. Standing six inches shorter than Kairin, Ricven could have used his lean good looks and his talent at song, whether sung or strummed, to make a decent living traveling from inn to inn (though his musical skills were lost on the tone deaf Kairin). But Ricven had an uncanny skill at negotiating the best price, whether it was for a contract for the services of himself and his companions, or for retrieving the most profit for whatever treasure he had helped recover. No lock was safe if Ricven wanted it opened, no passage or trap went undiscovered in his presence. And, as many a maiden had discovered, sometimes no virtue was left uncompromised (this was another skill which Ricven had wisely chosen never to try on his companion Kairin). Occasionally Ricven's skills would land him into trouble, but here he discovered that no father, brother or fianc\u00e9e was ever outraged enough to try their skills against Kairin, his more than occasional protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt present, the two were waiting at their table to meet with a potential employer. Ricven drained his cup and was about to order more wine when a smile crossed his face. \"I believe that is our potential employer coming toward us now.\" Kairin turned around to see two rather large men escorting...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Four hours until the sun set and then...who knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should not be doing this Haziyah!\" Haziyah broke herself from her reverie to look down from her perch at one of the older men in the throng making its way into the cave. \"We should stay. Our warriors will return.\"  Haziyah simply raised an eyebrow at the old man, who turned a blustery red at the obvious dismissal of his prediction. \"Some will return,\" he continued to insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of their warriors had returned, Haziyah reflected. Wounded, dying. And in his final breath, he had told Haziyah of the betrayal. Of the gambit that had failed all, even the betrayer. Haziyah knew that the women, the children and the infirm had nothing to fear at present, at least not from tribes that her oasis had been feuding with for time immemorial. But those weren't the enemies she was worried about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaziyah wished she had more knowledge of what exactly had happened, but one thing was clear: the warriors of her tribe, the warriors of all the tribes, were dead or scattered across the sands, which meant that, as far as Haziyah and her people were concerned, they were dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scattered warriors of other tribes were not what her people feared. There were other things, things that lived in the cold nights and the screaming sand storms. Things that would soon learn of the fate of the protectors of the various tribes. What other tribes would do, Haziyah did not know, nor did she truthfully care. The fate of her people was in her hands now, and the only shelter she could lead them to was the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet and move along, old man. We do not have time for your feeble words,\" she told the protester dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" the old man said. The crowd around him stopped. \"That...girl!\" the old man said, gesturing at Haziyah, \"She is leading us to our doom. You all know the tales of the cave. It is better to stay up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man was right, Haziyah reflected, at least about the tales. There were a number of stories about where the cave led, or what laid inside it. What might or might not be on the other side of the portcullis that had always been closed in the memory of her people. But Haziyah and the other young women who had been trained in the Art of the Carved Blade, to defend their people when the men were gone, knew what was in the night. There were always things that waited just outside the light of a lamp or torch. And those were the weak and the few. When knowledge of the death of the warriors spread through out the night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaziyah leaped down from her perch, and walked to the old man. Even in his younger days, when he stood straight and tall, Haziyah would have looked him in the eye. The old man faltered back a step or two in Haziyah's presence before he finally managed to stand his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear me, my people,\" Haziyah said, lifting her hands above her head. Haziyah was a striking figure even without the scimitar at her belt. She was tall as any man, broad in the shoulder, her long, dark hair bound in a single braid behind her and the white tunic and pants, depicting her status as both maiden and defender, contrasting sharply with her smooth, dark skin. Her near black eyes looked without flinching at the gathered crowd around her, and every eye she met looked down rather than meet her steely gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all know the children's stories about what lies in the cave. But we also know what lies in the night, and this is all too real. And with our warriors gone, the defenders of our people will be hard pressed to keep them back. For now, we must seek shelter in the cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" The old man raised his hands above his head. \"The cave is our doom. Some of our warriors live. We must remain outside until they return.\" This again caused a stir among the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaziyah lifted her hands for silence. \"The people must each choose for themselves where they wish to go. Those who wish to go into the cave will be allowed to go. Those who wish to stay above in the night, may do so. However,\" Haziyah added, again silencing the crowd, \"the Defenders will all be going into the cave.\" Haziyah and the other woman who were trained in the Art of the Curved Blade had discussed this the night before, and were one in their decision. Whatever lied in the cave, it was still unknown. What was in the night was real, and it would relentlessly press its advantage, with the Warriors of the people gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you cannot do this!\" the old man protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the leader of the Defenders,\" Haziyah said, her eyes focused solely on the old man. \"Do you challenge my authority?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man blanched. Even in the prime of his youth, he would not have challenged Haziyah. Her father often jokingly lamented the fact that she was born a woman, as her skills with the curved blade were unmatched by any of the men in the tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the old man tried to press his argument. \"If the people decide...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The defense of the people is my decision, old man. If you wish to challenge me, find a blade and do so. Otherwise, the time for talking is over. Stay above ground or go into the cave, but be quiet, whichever you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaziyah turned her back dismissively on the old man. It was the last insult he could bear. With a cry of pure rage, the old man pulled a dagger from his robes and rushed what he thought was the unprotected back of Haziyah. At what seemed the last second, Haziyah spun around and knocked the knife out of the old man's hand with one blow, and with edge of her hand, struck him on his throat, killing him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaziyah stood staring silently at the old man's body for a few seconds, then looked up at the stunned crowd. \"Each of you must decide for yourselves, whether you wish to go into the cave, or stay above, and await the night.\" Without a glance back, Haziyah entered the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy nightfall, all of the people and there stored supplies were in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opening of the portcullis was a simple thing. The \"lock\" had a strange rod placed inside it. The end of the rod inserted into the \"lock\" was shaped like a star, and the other end of the rod was shaped in the form of a thin ellipse. Haziyah wore a pendant around her neck that was also shaped like a star, a symbol of her status as the leader of the Defenders, which apparently would only allow her to remove the rod from the lock. One the rod was removed, the portcullis lifted up quite easily, as if it had not been in disuse for decades, if not centuries. Once the people and their supplies were on the other side of the portcullis, Haziyah placed the rod in the \"lock\" on the interior side of the gate, and once again the portcullis was immovable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the people got settled in, a little exploration showed that the tunnel led to another portcullis, with the same type of key. Again, it was demonstrated that the pendant around Haziyah's neck would allow only her to open and shut the portcullis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" One of the other Defenders asked Haziyah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll sit up watches at both gates, though we should be safe for now, at least as long as our supplies last.\" Haziyah answered. \"And then tomorrow...\"</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure what brings them here, whether I'm the only one they've ever met from my world, or the fact that I must be the only black man in this world, at least from what I can see, or maybe I've gotten some fame for my prowess in the arena. At least, it looks like the crowds are getting bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrence put his pen down and rubbed his temples. Why his captors gave him a journal in which to write his thoughts, Terrence didn't know. But he was glad they did. As Terrence looked around his spartan quarters, there was still a part of him that wanted to believe that all this was some kind of scam, a large scale hoax, maybe even some psychological study he had unknowingly volunteered for. But he had been here for a year now, wherever here was, and here was a very real place indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a year ago, Terrence had been on a full scholarship at his state's major Tech school. Of course, the college scouts were all over him, as he had been an All American defensive player in both his junior and senior year. But Tech was not only close to home, it had one of the nation's top programs in structural engineering. Terrence knew he was good at football, and he might even have a shot at the pros, but that was a might. His mother wanted him close to home, and she wanted him to take advantage of the opportunity of a top rated education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on one fateful night, Terrence had put away his Calculus II book and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, he had woken up in a room that looked like something out of the Gladiator movie with Russell Crowe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrence had not adjusted well. But his captors must have had experience with people from other worlds. And slowly they broke him to their purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster than he thought possible, Terrence began training for what obviously was his new career: gladiator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was fitted with odd looking leather armor, and began training with a sword. It looked like a Japanese sword, a katana, though Terrence had never seen one in person, just in the movies. A slight man, almost two-thirds of Terrence's own height, came in twice a day to train Terrence. To Terrence, it seemed the only thing the little man taught him were different ways to be knocked down and bruised with the wooden katanas the two practiced with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, Terrence was put in a practice arena with a full grown man who was also wielding a wooden katana. And Terrence demolished him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of it was the fact that wherever here was, Terrence felt lighter. Terrence didn't know if this meant that here had less gravity than back where his reality was, or if there was something in the air, or what, but Terrence felt somehow more energized then he did before he came here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrence found himself pitted against new opponents with his practice katana every other day. Sometimes, his opponents would have other weapons, like wooden swords that looked like something from King Arthur or Lord of the Rings, or blunted tridents, or other practice weapons. It didn't matter. Terrence always won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept against his instructor. His instructor, though, was kind enough to always make sure the beatings Terrence received at his hands were new and creative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people who ran this world looked as if they were Middle Eastern, though there eyes tended to run from crystal blue to bright green, and their hair was either burnished red or a bluish black. The men were all slim and, except for his instructor, were all about a foot shorter than Terrence's six foot three inches, give or take a couple of inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the women of this world looked like, Terrence hadn't a clue, since he hadn't seen a woman since he had gotten here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of his opponents were men from this world, though a few like Terrence were not. Or at least Terrence thought they must be from a world different from his own or that of the world where he currently was. Maybe they were people from different regions of this world. His opponents would range from a pale white to a dark olive in their complexion, but none as dark as Terrence. And they looked as human as he did, though there was also something off that said they weren't, such as pitch black eyes, or an extra finger on each hand, or just something minor but offsetting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrence wished he knew more about what was going around him, but he was limited by a number of factors. No one had actually sat down and tried to teach him the language of this world. He had managed to learn a good deal on his own, but all of his knowledge had to do with fighting and food and sleeping. Nobody was interested in helping Terrence learn about the world outside the arena. All he needed to know (as far as his captors were concerned) was how to survive in the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, Terrence was giving a real katana, and put in a real arena, and matched against an opponent with a real blade as well. And both men were made to understand that only one could leave the arena alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKilling his opponent had come easier to Terrence then he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce every week or so, Terrence was matched against another opponent. Sometimes they were men of this world. Sometimes they were not. Sometimes they were armed with katanas. Sometimes other weapons. Sometimes Terrence was thrown in the arena to fight a beast that looked a little like a tiger or a bear, but was just different enough for Terrence to remember he wasn't on his own world anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter. Terrence always won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a year, Terrence found himself a blooded veteran of the arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrence put down his journal as his usual escort walked him to his transport. It was a closed box on wheels, without horses, but with no visible engine or other means of causing the transport to move. Stepping inside, the door closed, and the transport lurched forward, then gave no other sign of being in motion. After an indeterminate amount of time, there was another lurch and the doors were opened, and Terrence found himself in a strange new arena, where he was led to a holding cell, and then left alone. Terrence didn't have long to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrumpets (or instruments very close to trumpets) sounded in the distance, and a new set of escorts appeared at the door of Terrence's holding cell. Terrence was led down a corridor into an open arena.  One bigger than he had ever seen. And as he looked across the arena, he saw a huge cage being rolled out. The covering on the cage was removed, and Terrence felt his heart flutter. Inside the cage was a <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And it had a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrence's conscious mind might have been frozen by seeing the dragon. After all, he knew he was on an alien world, but he did not think it was an alien world with dragons. Or at least one dragon. But his subconscious mind, the part of his mind that had helped him survive, was already cataloguing the dragon's size (fifteen foot from snout to tip of tail) and other traits, such as there were odd little black pellets on the dragon's wings.

Don't tell me, from that classic cartoon channel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just shrugged and grinned as he looked over at his best friend, Sara. \"It <b>is</b> a classic! From 1948!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize that your grandfather might...MIGHT...have been old enough to see it on television when it first came out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, he would have seen it at the movies. You see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare me, John,\" Sarah sighed as she brushed an errant red lock out of her face. \"Anyway, why are you carrying around that bow?\" The two of them had gone to a yard sale earlier that morning, and John had spent two dollars on a hard plastic bow with a set of cheap arrows held together by scotch tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought while we were out here I'd practice with them.\" 'Out here' was the meadow and the forest behind John's grandfather's house. John's grandfather lived on the edge of town and had a few hundred acres behind his house. It was a perfect place for a pair of friends to wander about, particularly if those friends didn't quite fit in with the mainstream at their small town high school, and especially if the two friends didn't quite know how they felt about each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was a gifted young writer who often found himself living not quite wholly in the world his body was confined to, which sometimes made him the target of ridicule when he was \"spaced out.\" Sarah was a young woman gifted in mathematics but not so much in the social graces. Though neither overweight nor homely, she did carry a few more pounds than what her peers thought was acceptable, and her skin was not without a few blemishes. Add that to her intellect, and Sarah was often made to feel as if she was on the outside looking in. Somehow, she and John had gravitated toward each other, and Sarah, in her most honest moments, wished she and John might have gravitated even closer together. John, though, seemed oblivious to the possibility of anything more than friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was glad John had decided to take his archery experiment out into the woods, though she was sure that this latest adventure of his would make its way back to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd like to explore the cave a little bit more,\" Sarah said. John just grunted noncommittally but followed Sarah as she led the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small cave on John's grandfather's property. It was nothing grand, and the cave did not go very far back. At least not the part that was accessible. The only reason that flashlights were even necessary was so that Sarah and John could peer down the small holes along the back. They had never found anything interesting in all the holes, but they would look in them for a few minutes before sitting down and chatting, or working on their own projects while enjoying a companionable silence. By unspoken mutual agreement, the cave was their secret, shared with no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the cave, and Sarah immediately pulled out her flashlight. John turned his attention to the cheap bow in his hand, plucking at the thick piece of twine that serve as the bowstring. Sarah was about to say something, but instead kept quiet, as she began the ritual of going into the cave and shining the flashlight down the various holes. As usual, she found nothing. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, there's something down this hole. John, are you listening to me?\" Sarah turned back to say something caustic to get John's attention, when a bright light flashed from the hole, casting the cave and the two young adults in a blinding white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded, John and Sarah were facing each other. Except the other had changed. Significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not that their looks had changed. It was as if someone had taken their bodies as templates, and brought out all the potential each one had. John had always been a tall, gangly kid, but now he was tall and leanly muscled. His sparse facial hair, only needing to be shaved every three or four days, was now a tightly trimmed mustache and goatee, and his unkempt hair was braided to the middle of his back. The cheap bow and arrows were now a tall bow made of yew, as tall as John himself, and there was a quarrel of poplar arrows on his back. John found himself clad in some type of leather armor, with a rather large dagger (or short sword?) at his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sarah had gone through the same transformation. Her hair was long now, rich and thick in texture, a slightly darker red. Her skin was fair and perfect, her green eyes sharp and piercing, and she had a body that was fit and feminine. And she wore the garb of<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now back to your targets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some grumblings, and not a few baleful glances at the archer who had made the shot, but the boys dutifully retrieved their bows and began practicing at targets set considerably closer to them. The archer in question either did not notice the glances, or chose not to notice them. Instead, her gaze was solely focused on the middle-aged man, who walked over to her and clapped a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good shot, but I would expect nothing less of you, daughter,\" the man said, causing the girl to blush and duck her head. \"And I noticed you paused to consider the breeze fluttering the target.

How I wish you could come with us, tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why can't I come with you, father?\" Rosalind said. There was a glint of determination in her steel gray eyes, a glint that her father admired, but was compelled to temper from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been over this time and time, daughter. Anyway, there will be naught to do tomorrow. We're there just to show we can be there for Lord Cefn. A few drums will be beaten, a few lords will posture, and then the peace will be made, the cups will be drained, and the men of the village will return by the end of the week, so that we can be back before the harvest begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoslind dutifully nodded, but her father still could see the glint of steel in her eye. Not for the first time did he wish her mother was still alive. She was the youngest child and only daughter of the shire's fletcher and chief bowman, and perhaps he had forgotten at times that she wasn't one of his sons. Not that she wasn't as fair as any maid in the shire, with her slender curves, fair skin and soft red hair. But that hair was bound in a single braid, and she stood as tall and straight as any man who pulled a bow in the shire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt sixteen, she had more than a few prospects in the village, but Rosalind was having none of the them. And her father was not one to marry his daughter off against her will, even if it was within his paternal rights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPromising himself once again that he would seek to address the situation when he returned, Rosalind's father instructed her to watch the lads he was training, and especially the cooper's youngest son, who was having problems with his draw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the next day the men of Saethwr Shire, the finest archers in the land, marched off to answer their liege lord's calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet week went by before one of the young boys of the shire came running up to Rosalind as she oversaw the practice of the young boys in her father's tutelage.

But then, if it were easy, there would be no reason for soldiers to show up for the war (and plenty of reasons not to). Wizards and their ilk could show up on the battleground, exchange their spells and be done with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut magic on a battlefield is never easy. First, there is the fact that spells are difficult things to craft and cast. And the conditions on a battlefield are chaotic. Add to this the fact that there are counterspells being cast, as well as a few rude fellows waving swords about who are trying to kill you, and casting a significant spell on the battlefield is nigh impossible, even for the most accomplished mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo most spellcasters who enter the fray of battle do so with a few prepared spells, such as enchanting armour or perhaps bringing in a rainstorm to muddy the field if they are being besieged. In the actual battle, most mages content themselves casting counterspells to ensure their counterparts have it that much more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, magic does have its uses in battle. Particularly on the edge of battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are men like Guglielmo Colposicuro, for example. Though weapons like crossbows are easier to master than a longbow, they still require skill and training. Guglielmo Colposicuro not only possessed those skills, but also has  a few related spells and charms as well. As you can imagine, this made him a formidable foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sometimes the battles such warriors as Guglielmo Colposicuro fight are far removed from the battlefield. Sometimes a battle or war can be won if a certain individual meets with an untimely demise before a battle or war is even contemplated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuglielmo was about to fight such a \"pre-battle\" today, as he made his way down a narrow, cobblestone lane in a small town on the edge of the Orno Mountains.

Oh, there were things to see. In the distance, she could just make out a small herd of sheep. Their guardian was no doubt somewhere nearby, taking a nap. This close to the Castle Gilbert, Tara doubted there was even a feral dog that might fleetingly think of disturbing the peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, she could just make out a few smoke puffs making their way lazily upward. That would be one of the steamships, making its way down the Illivan river, no doubt carrying passengers and freight to the seaport city of Avonarc. Or it might even be towing coal barges to one the growing factory towns that dotted the banks of the Illivan..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the advent and spread of steam magic throughout the Grand Duchy of Gilbert, peace and prosperity had spread throughout the realm. No doubt Gilbert's neighbors would soon follow suit, but for now, Gilbert held the upper hand ,in the arcane arts, in trade, and in the works of its craftsmen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara hefted the crossbow in her hand as she added the arts of war to that mental list. Attached to the underside of the crossbow was a large, brass cylinder that made even a novice with the weapon a deadly opponent. And Tara was anything by a novice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, the Grand Duchy of Gilbert had an advantage over its neighbors. No doubt in time the kingdoms and empires bordering Gilbert would secure similar weapons of their own, but Gilbert controlled the largest deposits of coal on the continent, and without coal, steam magic could not be performed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, all was well with the Grandy Duchy of Gilbert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich did not set well with Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she begrudged the people of Gilbert the good times they were enjoying. But for the youngest of the seven children of the Grand Duke of Gilbert, that prosperity came at a price. As she approached her sixteenth birthday, Tara knew that she would soon be married off for the purpose of securing diplomatic relations with one of Gilbert's neighbors. There was even the chance that she could be wedded to a master of one the duchy's more prosperous guilds. And as a young woman who was beautifully blossoming, Tara knew that he potential suitors held more than a casual interest in her burgeoning beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfair, Tara screamed silently in her head as she stormed off the ramparts and into an adjoining tower. In more turbulent times, the ramparts and towers would have been manned, but the Grand Duchy of Gilbert had pushed its borders further out and along the walls of the summer palace, Tara only had to worry about encountering the occasional ceremonial guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rushed down the stairs of the tower she had entered, Tara paused for a moment to study her image in a polished shield hanging on the wall. A muddled reflection looked back, but even muddled, the reflection showed a beautiful young woman, fair skinned, crystal blue eyes, raven black hair and, even in the leathers the reflection wore for crossbow practice, the shape of a comely young woman could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of disgust crossed Tara's face at her own reflection as she continued storming down the stairs of the tower. As her father's youngest, she had been indulged on many an  occasion, including letting her learn the martial arts when most noble young women were learning how to play an instrument, weave a tapestry or learn how to write poetry in the popular forms of the day. But those days were soon to be gone, as she was to be married off to a man not of her choosing. As if she would choose any man!

Inside, though, he was seething for action. It had been five years since his father had tricked, bribed and intimidated the horsemen of the great steppes into uniting under his leadership. The walled cities of the Spice Road had fallen under his attacks, and the Seven Kingdoms of the Eastern Sea paid him tribute and acknowledged him as their master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so his father turned his eyes west, to the fabled Kingdoms of the west, with their strange cultures and exotic treasures. And once his father subdued but a single mountain kingdom, the West would be as a low hanging fruit, ripe for the picking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that single mountain kingdom was determined to bar his father's way to the West. And the men of that kingdom, with their allies the mountain dwarves, had held their mountain pass since before the histories known to any man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Apyep's father was not without his resources. He had at his command the largest army ever seen. And it was an army that he did not need to keep at the mountain kingdom's door. He sent his various allies and subordinates back to their tribes while he kept a force ready to easily repel any force foolish enough to issue forth from behind the fortifications of the mountain kingdom. And even as he waited, his father sent for siege engineers from his now subject kingdoms on the Eastern Sea. In addition, his father had made allies of sorts among the tribes of mountain goblins, all of whom nursed their own grudges against the dwarven kind. Apyep detested the site of the goblins, as well as the stench of rotting meat that always seemed to emanate from them, but they served his father's purposes, at least for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of time, Apyep's father assured his youngest son, before the walls of the mountain kingdom began to crumble, and the gathered forces of the horsemen of the Steppe could be brought to bear. But for now, Apyep had to wait. And wait. And wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApyep asked his father if he could take himself and his troop of mounted archers back to the southeast, to hunt bandits, to make raids on the Bandit Kingdoms of the far Southeast, to do SOMETHING, rather than just wait for days, weeks, months...however long it took to begin to make a crack in the walls of the mountain kingdom. When Apyep was needed, he would return along with the other horsemen waiting for the word from their overlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his father said, no, Apyep must wait. Something would happen soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApyep was thinking of petition his father again to release him and his men when there was a stirring from the edge of his camp. One of his sentries escorted in a mountain goblin, a cheiftan among his kind, if Apyep understood the necklaces the creature wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblin chieftan advised Apyep he had found a hitherto undiscovered cave that led far back into the mountains. Where the tunnel led, the goblin didn't know, but perhaps if Apyep and his men joined the goblin chieftan's own tribe, there might be something useful in the tunnel, or something valuable.

There were no sign of the dark invaders, the Chernakozy, and they were not a subtle people. Nor a particularly clean race, Agrafi thought, her nose crinkling distastefully at the memory of having ridden in with a war band into an abandoned Chernakozy camp. And with the way the wind was blowing, if there were Chernakozy upwind from her, she would definitely be able to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was accepted knowledge among Agrafi's people that the darker-skinned Chernakozy might have a passing resemblance to her own people, but any resemblance ended there. Chernakozy men were slothful and rapacious, Chernakozy women were slatternly and licentious, and all Chernakozy were incapable of providing for themselves. The only thing Chernakozy were good for was waging war on the various tribes of the Plains. And at this, they were only good if they could force the people of the Plains into battles where there strange, smoke issuing sticks could be brought to bear. Fortunately, the people of the Plains had learned early on to avoid the mass groupings of Chernakozy fighters, using their longer ranged bows to prick and irritate Chernakozy war bands and lead them into ambushes. The Chernakozy had finally learned to stay in their strange, impregnable structures at the edge of the Plains, and to ignore the provocations of warriors like Agrafi. Instead, the Chernakozy would send mass groups of fighters out to despoil random parts of the Plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had been this way Agrafi and, twenty years later, it was still the same. Each side had learned about the other, but not enough to disturb the equilibrium. The tribes of the Plains had learned the Chernakozy were little more than beasts, who knew how to operate weapons they fought with, but little else. The Chernakozy leaders and sub-leaders who were captured spoke of Wizards of Sand who ruled incredible cities beyond the mountain ranges to the East of the Plains, from which mountain passes the Chernakozy had emerged from a generation ago. What these Wizards of Sand wanted in the Plains, the Chernakozy did not know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgrafi scanned the horizon once more and, seeing nothing of interest, nudged her horse with her knees, directing him to a nearby stream. She dismounted from him and removed her gear, gave her horse a friendly pat and let it go graze, while she took her own lunch, reflecting on recent events. There was to be a grand meeting of tribal leaders in two nights, to discuss an attack on a Chernakozy fort. Such attacks had been tried in the past, but with no success. One of the younger war leaders, though, had a plan. Agrafi snorted. Someone always had a plan. And they always failed. Outside of their forts, the Chernakozy could be killed by anyone with a modicum of skill and patience. Inside their forts...inside their forts, one would have as much success injuring Mother Earth by shooting arrow after arrow into the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her meal, Agrafi went to the creek for a cool drink of water. She knelt down, cupping her hands to scoop up water, and smiled at the young woman with long, dark straight hair and red-hued skin smiling back at her from the stream's surface. Both warrior and reflection smiled wistfully at the thought that the even features and enticing curves of the maiden looking at her reflection would no doubt mean that she would be married off soon, and have to remain in the roaming villages, rather than being able to go on these quiet patrols. But for now, she would enjoy her freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgrafi retrieved her steed and was once again moving. She was fairly sure that she wouldn't see anything before returning home, but she was to be proven wrong. About an hour after lunch, she spotted a thin wisp of smoke rising in the distance. She rode carefully toward the area and dismounted not far from the ravine from which the smoke was coming forth. She quickly moved up to the area and, looking over the edge of the shallow ravine, saw</span></div></div>",

There were one or two legitimate younger sons of nobility who had decided that being in the Patrol was better than being in the shadow of the eldest son.

The other men in the patrol were veterans, having seen more than one skirmish along the borders of the Wildland. In addition, they were shorter and decidedly paler than the swarthy Stepka.

Or at least that was the thought of her mother, Baroness Wendra, second wife of Baron Stefan (his first wife having died in childbirth). Baron Stefan, though, had five older children and Ridgeway was a thriving commercial center with stable political ties throughout the kingdom, so Baron Stefan was willing to indulge the child of his old age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not that Lady Anne was unseemly in appearance. On the contrary, having just reached her eighteenth year, she was considered a most striking young lady, with long, straight pale blonde hair, piercing violet eyes, fair skin and fair features and a slim yet feminine feature, kept fit with her time on the horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was the rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Anne wasn't merely the most accomplished horsewoman in the barony. She was the most accomplished rider in the barony, and probably in the neighboring provinces as well. And this included the use of any instrument that could be used from horseback, whether it was one used in sport or in war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Lady Anne was not without her suitors. She was a very fetching young woman and more than one nobleman wouldn't have minded marrying her (and incidentally into the ruling family of Ridgeway). But all her suitors saw her equestrian pursuits as something she should expect to put aside once she was wed, and Lady Anne would have none of that.

There were the Hallof, and then there was everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf their neighbors resented this labeling, they kept it to themselves.

The legend of centaurs in far lands could be traced back to the appearance of a Hallof rider, for the way they rode, it was sometimes difficult to discern where the human ended and the horse began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong ago the Hallof had established a series of tributary states around the Na-Hallof. For their neighbors, it was easier to render a portion of their crops, their catches and their craft than to suffer a troop of Hallof Calvary descending upon their lands. So the young men and women of the Hallof contented themselves with formalized combat among the various clans. In the spring, a young man or woman would gather a group of young and like-minded young riders to travel to far lands, selling their services as auxiliary cavalry to distant rulers, and returning with treasures and tales of bravery.

Fifteen citizens who are absolutely and unequivocally dependent on him, because in the nomadic desert lands of southern Mongolia there are far greater dangers than starvation and cold nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, our story starts here, but of course, it would be a lie to say that it had nothing to do with a certain woman, living in Holon Tolgoi as well, named Sarnai who in fact was the very reason that Temujin rode to Holon Tolgoi to manage his farm outside of the village. She had made him promise to settle down, if he survived the last war, he had fought in. But enough of the past. The present keeps going, no matter how long we dwell in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe year is 1230. While the high middle age is dominating Europe and the black death is haunting innocent Europeans, Temujin has just started yet another ride to Holon Tolgoi, accompanied by a small portion of his herd. He is planning to instate a local herder there to take care of a few oxen as well, since the population in Holon Tolgoi is on the verge of increasing. So, Temujin thought it would be a good idea to create a less dependent demand in the village. His Mongol horse, Khunbish, is stepping energetically through the rough, rocky wasteland. He gave it five liters of fresh water to drink, right before they took off. When they arrive, it will drink five more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have always been a thirsty one, Khun. Haven\u2019t you?\u201d Temujin says with a gentle clap on Khunbish\u2019 shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhunbish reciprocates the gesture with a loud neigh, which makes the herd around them shoo away a little, but with a firm \u201chiya!\u201d Temujin makes Khunbish gallop in a circle around the herd to drive them together again, where after they ride up in front of the herd again, leading them on the right path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n`Let\u2019s see what the deserts around Tolgoi have to offer us this time\u00b4, Temujin thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of enjoying the view on some snowy mountain tops in the distance, Temujin suddenly hears the sound of one of his oxen, tripping and falling to the ground with an excruciating loud roar that makes the entire heard panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemujin pulls the cords of the bridle to make Khunbish turn quickly to the left. With invigorating fury, Khunbish races around back around the herd, performing aggressively fast jumps into the herd every now and then to make the animals gather closer. It only takes a few dozen seconds to get the whole herd of two oxen and five cows driven together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrrrrr.\u201d Temujin says to calm Khunbish down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he gets of the Mongol horse, he slowly walks towards the remaining ox, which has fallen and is bleeding rather badly out of its leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy now.\u201d Temujin says calmly, as he steadily approaches the ox. He is considering ripping a sleeve of his deel off and wrap it around the leg of the ox. Two oxen aren\u2019t much to bring to Holon Tolgoi, but on the other side, the materials needed to make a new deel aren\u2019t easy to acquire either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Temujin stands there for a few seconds and ponders what he is going to do, he notices a crack in the ground, which, he realizes, is expanding more and more every second. This is probably the reason, why the ox tripped. Its foot must have gotten stuck in there during the galloping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Temujin realizes the severity of the situation, he is already looking at a five-meter-wide opening, which has uncovered a huge ravine underneath it. His ox is still laying on the ground, no more than a few inches from the cliff, adjacent to the ravine. He has never seen anything like this before. What is down there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with his background as a fearless warrior, Temujin now has to swallow a small lump in his throat. But as he regains his confident courage and steadily walks towards the edge of the cliff, he notices what looks like a bunch of stone stairs, which seem to shoot out from the rocky wall right underneath him, almost as if to form a staircase down into the ravine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued, Temujin takes a while to ponder his decision about what to do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could explore the staircase, leading down into the ravine, a little, but he reminds himself that he doesn\u2019t know yet, why the ravine suddenly has opened itself up, and he certainly doesn\u2019t know what or who is behind this. Usually, when something opens, like a gate for instance, you\u2019d expect someone or something to go through it. Right? This could be dangerous perhaps. And also, there are people in Holon Tolgoi who depend on him to make it back there by the end of the day. Furthermore, what does he do about his wounded ox?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemujin has to take a few minutes to process all of this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it was because it was the song that greeted him when he first came on watch every day, and it was the song that sent him to sleep every night. Perhaps it was because his Captain always sang it with that smug smile on his face as he went about his business. Or maybe it was because the song, just like a thousand other oddities, always made the Captain stranger than he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, Nelson hated the song with a passion. Not that he hated the Captain. Oh no, Nelson specifically banished that thought from his head. Although the Captain assured his crew that, of his many talents, reading their minds was not one of them, nobody quite trusted that statement from the Captain. Not that anyone thought the Captain was a liar. Nelson specifically banished that thought from his mind as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Captain was...different, there was no arguing that. According to the Captain, he came from another world, where the world behaved differently. That made Nelson's head ache, when he had to think about it, which was quite often.The Captain had set about a lot of changes when he had shown up one day on the Island of Nervis. Twenty years ago, the Island of Nervis was a land of warring tribes that straddled the Cape of Tarthon. It been a haven for pirates and cutthroats, and subject to raids by the great Empires whenever the raids on their commerce became too troublesome. And then the Captain appeared one day, as if out of thin air. Of course, to hear the Captain tell it, that is exactly what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd twenty years later, the island of Nervis was a unified kingdom, and though it's Navy was small, her ships were a match for two or three of even the best ships any of the Major Empires could throw up against her. Not that anyone wanted to. The Kingdom of Nervis had become a major center of Commerce, and the Empires willingly (if sometimes grudgingly) paid port fees in return for keeping the seas of the Cape of Tarthon free of pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParticularly when, a decade ago, the worst pirates were the Captain and the rest of the burgeoning Nervis Royal Navy. But once the recently united Nervis established its sovereign control of the seas about her, those days ended. The new King of Nervis found it was more profitable to be respectable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the Captain, he could have held any position he wanted in the kingdom. Given his abilities, he no doubt could have been the King of Nervis. Instead, the Captain seemed happy with the title of Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy, a title that seemed to give the Captain no end of personal amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once a year, the Captain became the Captain again, as he took a select group of young men to be trained as future officers for the Royal Navy. These young men were called Cadets, and it was an honor to be chosen for the cruise. At least for the families of the Cadets. After a few days of sailing with the Captain, and his continuous drills and examinations, the honor was lost on the young Cadets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Nelson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain spotted young Nelson on the deck and grinned, and Nelson braced himself for what he knew was going to be another of the Captain's grilling examinations. Before the Captain could approach him, though, the lookout shouted at the top of his voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steam on the horizon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNelson's heart race tripled, as he knew that could mean only one thing: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Mugow peered south through her telescope from the top of the sentry tower, the men garrisoned at said post took the opportunity to surreptitiously observe her beauty. Mugow had the slender curves of a young girl just blossoming into a woman, with flawless light olive skin that hinted that perhaps at least one of her grandparents came from south of the Wall. Her hair, though, was the flawless black night color that was common to the women of the Northern Kingdom, and there was no hint of southern ancestry in her soft brown eyes. If it were not for the Warrant she wore openly on the right breast of her tunic, one or two of the men of the garrison might have been tempted to forcefully sample her ripening beauty, regardless of the fact that she, like them, wore the tunic of an Imperial soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mugow Kwai also wore the Warrant of the Emperor, and to dishonor that Warrant was to bring not only a painful death to the man who dishonored that Warrant, but also that death to his kin, and a public dishonor to his ancestors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugow collapsed her telescope and re-entered the sentry tower. She was either oblivious the covert glances she was receiving from the men of the tower garrison, or simply chose to ignore them. She exchanged a few words with the garrison commander and asked if there was any messages she could deliver for him. The commander thanked her for her generosity, and handed her two scrolls, one for the commander of the next tower garrison she would visit, and a report for his immediate superior. With a slight bow of her head to the garrison commander, she took her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugow carefully adjusted the objects on her belt and spent a few minutes stretching, before beginning her run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing unusual about a runner along the top of the Great Wall of the Northern Kingdom. Each garrison commander always had one or two of his men whom he used as a fast messenger to his immediate neighbor to the east or west. And then, of course, each tower kept dung and firewood ready to light its beacon, in case of invasion from the South. And the major outposts had stables of horses, so that more detailed information could be sent to the Generals as soon as the warning fires were lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, all the Generals had their own messengers, both foot and horse. There was even talk that scholars and mages of the Imperial Court were developing a method by which mirrors could send messages over the miles, though nothing had come of this, save gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were the messengers who wore the Warrants, such as Mugow Kwai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were merely runners, though they ran great distances with relative ease. They were trained in a number of skills, and carried an odd assortment of light and collapsible tools on their belts, including a dagger which rumor attributed a number of arcane traits to. Whether any of these rumors were true or not, only the messengers who wore the Warrant knew. What was known, though, were those who wore the Warrant were resourceful, insightful people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of this insightfulness was the fact that a garrison commander who might be reluctant to tell his superior about a shortcoming in his command might be more open to someone holding a Warrant, since an observation to a Warrant messenger would not (necessarily) be traceable to a commander making an observation. And the Warrant messengers were trained in a number of disciplines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Messengers bearing the Imperial Warrant reported to High General Towhi Chongdain and, if necessary, could speak with his authority. But that was in theory, and in the history of the Warrant, only one messenger had ever ordered a large movement of Imperial troops. In reality, the most 'authority' a Warrant Messenger had ever asserted might be the commandeering of a few men or materials, or perhaps an immediate audience with a Minister or General. And even such urgent audiences were always made in unfailingly polite, if determined, tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of these thoughts were going through the mind of Mugow Kwai. She was more concerned with her present mission. It was not an important one to the Empire, but it was important for her. It was the first time she had ever been very far away from the Imperial Army's Headquarters, and now she found herself running the Wall! And the officers! They were not only respectful to her, but some seemed overwhelmed at the opportunity to talk to a Messenger with a Warrant. Mugow had already accumulated a tome of things memorized to report. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugow had to constantly remind herself that the men of the Wall were the important ones, not her, no matter how reverently they treated her. True, she was treated with respect in the Imperial City, but that was always tempered with the fact the Imperial City was overflowing with important people, and she was, after all, an untested Warrant Messenger. But here, she felt as if she were truly the eyes, ear and speech of the High General, and not simply a young woman whom someone once thought might have promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugow allowed the run to balance her thoughts and to purge herself of her giddiness. For a garrison runner, the distance to the next tower would be about fifteen minutes, but Mugow could easily run it nine, eight if she felt the reason to be there faster was unusually compelling. And since she was running the distance at the more \"leisurely\" pace of nine minutes, Mugow's training brought her to a halt even before she realized why she was stopping. Her hand reached toward her belt and plucked her telescope as she peered at the small dot on the horizon her peripheral vision had spotted and which made her subconscious brain bring her to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugow expanded her telescope and looked out at the distance. The sight she saw made her gasp. It was</span></div></div>",

Hopefully, our Dwarven adventure will not be just a caricature either. Not that I would object to following a stout Dwarven warrior, wielding a broad axe as big as himself with ease.

But they are not kings as men understand kings. Men rule under men with force, with persuasion and with guile. When a man rules, he bends other men to his rule. The men who bend do so willingly, understanding the necessity, but it is not a natural state for men, and within a generation, men will chafe under a yoke, no matter how light it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy contrast, a dwarven king is almost a physical manifestation of his people to united so that they can work toward a common purpose. And thus a dwarven king will always work for what he perceives is the common good of his people. That is not to say that a dwarven king is without flaws, for the dwarves themselves have many flaws, as do the folks around them. But if a human king gathers wealth, it is to appease his own avarice. A dwarven king's \"avarice\" in amassing treasure is to reflect the glory of his people, and is seen as such among his subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a dwarven 'kingdom' is not what an outsider might think it to be. Let us take, as an example, the dwarven kingdom that is Deyrnas. While it is true that many of its citizens will be born, live and die without seeing the sun directly (though they will know its light, through methods magical, mechanical and mundane), not a few will spend their time above the ground. There are the merchants, of course, who travel to other dwarven kingdoms and the cities and towns of other races. And in small protected valleys, there are terrace farms and shelter pastures that provide the wheat and cattle for the bread, beer, butter and mutton that grace dwarven tables. And of course there are the legendary dwarven warriors. Not all dwarves are armed with axe and hammer, for there are times when it is necessary to keep (and kill) an enemy at a distance. And dwarves are very good at devising and using devices that keep (and kill) their enemies at a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are all sorts of small entrances into Deyrnas, from the hole that allows the shepherd to bring his flock and himself inside the mountain, to shafts that allow the sun (but not the elements) to enter the upper chambers of Deyrnas, and each of these has their wards and protections. But it is the Great Gate of Deyrnas where the skill of the dwarves is most evident. It is the gate from which the strength of Deyrnas will issue forth when their allies call, and it is the gate which any enemy must possess when assaulting Deyrnas. The road to the Great Gate is bounded by rock and walls, with a tower on either side of the gate. Mounted on top of each tower is a giant arbalest, manned by two skilled dwarves, and shielded from most attacks. The walls and rocks on the approach to the gate are riddled with tunnels and holes, where dwarves skilled with crossbows can shoot at approaching enemies and move quickly to another position. And then there are those among the dwarves whose knowledge of the approach is without equal, and are thus able to help foil any deception on the part of an approaching force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus the story starts with our hero, who is</span></div></div>",

Maybe that's not a good analogy, but I always wondered who exactly strikes out on their own, not for their own fortune and glory, but for the good of their fellow dwarf? A tunnel opens up an unexplored cavern...who goes and explores it? The kingdom is getting a little too crowded, or resources are being played out...so who goes and finds a new cave? What skills come into play?

So dwarves guard there underground dwellings zealously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here our tale starts, with one Tarkan Sandsmith, whose family is renowned for its ability to find what is needed in and under the desert. Tarkan wants to find a new cavern, that perhaps some of his kin can found a new home in, But mostly, Tarkan wants to make a name for himself, one that will be told in generations to come. And Tarkan plans to make this quest...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed that there had never been a time that the men of the Kingdom of Ancra and the dwarven tribes of the Punican Mountains were not allies, but save for the markets, the two races rarely had need to intermingle with each other. In addition, the dwarven race had always been reluctant to allow their womenfolk to venture above ground, so generations could pass before a dwarven female might be seen by the humans of the Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these were, in the words of the ancient curse, \"interesting times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Punican Mountains were only a part of a great range of mountains that stretched for thousands of leagues. The Kingdom of Ancra consisted a number of passes and valleys that connected the great steppes to the east and the green fields and vast forests to the West. As such, the Kingdom straddled the major trade route between the civilizations that existed on either side of the Kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one can imagine, the wealth of the Kingdom of Ancra had attracted more than one envious eye, from both East and West. But even among their own folk, the dwarves of the Punican Mountains were known for the superiority of their strongholds, and these skills they gladly lent to their human allies. Add to this fact that the men of Ancra were unequalled in their skill with any missile, whether it be an arrow or ballista projectile, and the Kingdom of Ancra felt itself safe behind its defenses against any foe that might rise up against it, either from East or West.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then five years ago, Hocox the Remorseless began uniting the tribes of the Great Steppes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were sea kingdoms beyond the Steppes of the East, this much was known. Traders from these kingdoms would come and sell their goods at the markets of Ancra, and sometimes travel beyond, and the traders from the Kingdoms of the West would also venture to the East, and bring back tales of ships as huge as small towns that would sail across endless seas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road that stretched between the Kingdom of Ancra and the Kingdoms of the West with the Eastern Sea Kingdoms was commonly referred to as the Spice Road, and stretches of it went through an ever-changing control of various tribes of horsemen that roamed the steppes. There were even a handful of walled cities along the Spice Road,that had grown out of markets and bazaars that had traded for generations with the horsemen. Through a series of treaties, bribes, threats, tribute and military adventures, the Eastern Sea Kingdoms kept the roads clear for their merchants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Hocox the Remorseless brought all the horsemen of the Steppes under his rule. And not just the Horsemen. Mountain goblins and other unsavory creatures also fell under his sway. The nearest walled cities along the Spice Road were known to have been pillaged and razed by Hocox and his hoardes. What fate had befallen the Eastern Sea Kingdoms, no one knew, but it was kknown that the hordes of Hocox had fallen upon the Kingdom of Ancra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there they were stopped. For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walled and guarded passes of the Kingdom were such that it limited the amount of force that Hocox could bring to bear at a strongpoint, and the men of Ancra had centuries of tradition and experience in defending their walls. But the horde of Hocox was seemingly infinite, and though Hocox had no knowledge of conducting a siege, he was learning. In addition, Hocox had at his service the mountain goblins who, though crude and ignorant in their knowledge in comparison to the dwarves, did know something of the nature of stone. And the cheiftans of the mountain goblins held the lives of their tribesman in little regard, thinking nothing of throwing away the lives of a hundred goblin warriors to test the strength of this rampart or that bastion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, the Kingdom of Ancra held. And although the kingdoms of the West had made tentative offers (knowing that if Ancra fell, the hordes of Hocox would pour unchecked into the West), the men of Ancra were content (for now) with the aid of their oldest and only allies, the dwarves of the Punican Mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir James Raconis commanded the garrison on the wall guarding a minor pass. Even if the wall were breached, the valley behind him led to a narrow pass that was guarded by an extension of fortress that held the Kingdom's main pass to the East. Still, it would not do to give Hocox an avenue in which to bring more force to bear on the main gate. The wall must hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to that end Raicheal Calcitegold had been sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne on hand she was very clearly a dwarf. She stood only four foot tall, and although the men of Ancra were of average height (Sir James being an exception, at six foot tall), they still stood a foot and half over their new dwarven companion. She was stoutly built. Not fat, by any means, but she had wide shoulders and their was a certain strength in her physical stature. She wore chain mail over her leather jerkin, and wore her blondish-red hair in braids, as was the dwarven custom among both sexes of her races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the men might have been surprised that she had no beard, or any signs that she had ever had one, as it was speculated that dwarven women were bearded as well. But Raicheal's face was smooth and attractive, with a small mouth and nose and sparkling green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Raicheal's firm, pronounced bosom, even clad in chain and leather, definitely spoke of her being a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men of the wall definitely noticed. They had been on their posts for months now, and the few hamlets in the valley behind them had been vacated, so that Raicheal had been the first woman any of them had seen for weeks. If Raicheal noticed their reaction to her gender, she pretended not to, and the ever present scowl on Sir James' face made sure that Raicheal was always treated with respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was awake, Raicheal was in motion, often with Sir James in tow, pointing out possible weak points that must be shored up, and advising him on the probable tactics of the slowly increasing number of siege engines that were being brought to bear on the wall Sir James was pledged to protect. Initially, Sir James made sure that Raicheal slept in his presence, if only to ensure that nothing untoward happened to her at the hands of his men. But as time passed, he kept her nearby more so that he could have her counsel when the wall was attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so one night, five weeks after Raicheal had arrived, both she and James were awaked by the sentry. The sentry led the pair to one of the walls towers, and handed Sir James a dwarven telescope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think they realize that we have these,\" the sentry said as he handed Sir James the telescope. One of its attributes was the ability to focus starlight and allow the user to see objects at night almost as well as he might in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir James' grunted in agreement, happy to have any advantage he could. He almost immediately spotted what the sentry had woken him up for. He handed the telescope to Raicheal. Raicheal looked around, found a block to stand upon, then looked out. She immediately spotted the object of interest as well. A small troop of enemy soldiers were escorting a <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Far beneath the Grulgreas Mountain, it has set for ages, a shadow of its former self, though parts still stand unchanged, a tribute to the skills of our hero's ancestors. Long ago, a great underground battle was waged her and, as the ancestors of our hero were forced back across the great bridge, rather than allowing their ancient enemies to cross it, they used their arts to destroy it.

Add to this that only in fivedwarves is born female, and it becomes very understandable why few dwarven women ever leave their caverns, Even when a new home is established, woman traveling above ground only do so when absolutely necessary, and do so in closed wagons, and in disguise, This is why some races believe that even dwarven women have beards, or that dwarves are not born like other races, but are formed from rocks and stones,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyatee Ardless had never left her home, and never desired to,.

The dwarves were unyielding in the prices they set for their wares, but considering their skills were unmatched, no one really complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few dwarves that the world saw were male. They all stood five foot tall (*more or less), and were just as broad in the shoulder. All were bearded (with some stuffing their beards in their belts) and what few words they uttered were in low, gruff tones, They wore leather and mail, and were unequaled when it came to the battle axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs to the women of the dwarves, there were many theories. Some even said that there were no dwarven women, but that dwarves sprang from the rock, wholly formed. Others said that dwarven women were indistinguishable from dwarven men to outsiders, so that non-dwarves had met dwarven women unawares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was that dwarven women never left the realms of the dwarves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwarven women were almost as strong as their men, and just as skilled in the dwarven arts. But here the comparisons ended. Dwarven women were taller and more slender their men, and dwarven men would swear their women were just as fair as any among the other races. Dwarven women were rare, though, as only one child in four was born female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevan Karlikoveny was considered one of the fairest of dwarven maidens, with skin as smooth and as pale as silver, and hair as bright as molten gold. Though she had not yet reached her majority of one hundred and sixty eight years (just seven years short).. her beauty and skills had already begun attracting suitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Devan didn't want that life. She wanted to see the world beyond the caverns she had grown up in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there was no way around the customs of her people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was one way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarne Korliveny, king of her people, had called a contest, open to all blade smiths. When the dwarves of the lands held a gathering of Kings in two years, he wanted to wear an axe that had no equal.among his peers.

She smiled back at him brightly and, for a moment, he forgot that she wasn't human. Well, there were hints of her otherworldliness, but one could dismiss them. She stood an inch shy of five foot, but then the rest of Yohanna's sisters were only four or five inches taller than her. She was a bit broad in the shoulder, but then no more so than any young woman who grew up on a farm doing chores. Her eyes were a darker shade of grey than one might see, and there was a hint of broadness in her face, but one would really have to look to see these things, and the eye would dismiss them, or perhaps even consider them qualities of a \"striking\" beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Yohanna brought the hammer down, and all doubt of her not being human were immediately \"struck down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOscar had found Yohanna as a baby, while hunting in the woods at the base of the Iron Mountains. Although rare, there were stories enough that the dwarves of the Iron Mountain would abandon those of their young whom they considered too far removed from whatever the standard of a proper dwarf was. Most of the stories told of some obvious deformity, and if such a baby was found by a human, custom was to leave it where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept Yohanna was a beautiful baby girl in Oscar's eyes. Perhaps that was why the dwarves of the Iron Mountains had abandoned her to the elements, because she looked more human that dwarf. Oscar didn't know. All he knew was that he could not leave her to die. When he brought her home, his wife agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOscar was the village smith, well respected both in his trade and in his habits, and though there might be some mumblings, no one would openly gainsay his choice. And it was not like the village ever saw a dwarf. There were a fair at the village of Bergspass every year, where the dwarves would trade metals, tools and other objects for the fruits and wares of the humans who came from the surrounding areas, But outside of that fair, dwarves were hardly ever seen, preferring to remain under their mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYohanna was a happy, robust child, perhaps a tad stronger than those children of her own age, but she never taunted or teased her playmates, and actually kept another child out of serious trouble more than once. She did love watching her father at work, and would even help him at small tasks, all the while seeming to know instinctively how to stay out of his (and harm's) way in the smithy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then at thirteen, everything seemed to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women of both Oscar's and his wife's families tended to be a bit bosomy, and this trait was seemingly inherited by the adopted Yohanna. And as boys are oft to do, they become fascinated with this development in girls their own age, and sometimes wanted to explore these developments more intimately, usually with a rough grab or a poke before running away. Usually this resulted in a slap from the offended female, or a stern talk from an elder who has learned of this venture from the distressed, offended female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Yohanna's case, the slap resulted in the boy in question loosing a tooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the same time, Yohanna's interest in her father's smithy grew to almost an obsession. Oscar had taken two of his sons as apprentices already. He had hoped one of them would take over his own smithy someday, but both had married wives from other villages, and had become smiths there. Oscar had decided to look for a possible apprentice from among the boys of the village, but Yohanna had begged, pleaded at the point of tears, for him to take her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his better judgment, he relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the duties of the apprentice was to act as a striker, where he (or in Yohanna's case, she)  would swing a large sledgehammer in heavy forging operations, as directed by the master blacksmith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYohanna handled the sledgehammer as if its weight meant nothing, and swung it down harder than any man that Oscar had ever known. All in a lithe form that betrayed none of the strength she wielded without thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYohanna was also a natural farrier, having a natural skill with the large animals and able to bring a gentle mood to the most troublesome brute. She had already gained a reputation at the practice (a trade that Oscar had always done with reluctance), and even seemed to possess some skills at treating other ailments that a horse brought in might be suffering. This latter skill sometimes made Oscar think that perhaps Yohanna wasn't completely dwarvish after all, since legend held that horses could not stand the presence of a dwarf, and that the feeling was a mutually held one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whatever her ancestry was, Yohanna was well and truly the daughter of his heart, and her taking his place in his smithy was almost a given by the village and the countryside around. He only wished that she might find a husband, but there seemed no one who considered his daughter a prospective bride. Yohanna didn't seem to mind, though. She was content to be working at her father's side in his smithy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then one day, the contentment of father and daughter was interrupted by the arrival of a</span></div></div>",

They sing for the simple joy of it, and because of that, I imagine their songs are more beautiful than those of any siren.\u201d</i> \u2015 Betsy Cornwell, Tides<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves of Argen Tidivanen were unlike any elf, or any known race, of the world. What they were like, though, no one quite knew, as they kept to themselves, save for a small market on a cove of their island, a market only frequented by their elven kin. And even their elven kin were not allowed to go beyond the last trader's stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legends of the elves of Argen Tidivanen, or selkies as they were commonly called, were many, each one stranger than the last, and often contradicting each other. It was said that their songs could shape the waves and the thoughts of others. They could speak with the seals that thronged to their islands, and could transform themselves into seals, either by song or by donning the hide of a seal. It was said that selkie women were beautiful beyond imagining, and that their men were more fearsome than could be dreamt. That a selkie could be bound to service, if only there skin could be taken, and that selkies roamed the streets of harbor towns in the still of the night, sucking the life's breath out of any child whose bedroom window was left unshuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever the truth lied, the pearls and coral that came from Argen Tidivanen were unmatched, and treasures lost at sea decades ago would often emerge in the trading stalls of Argen Tidivanen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as our story begins, let us first pick a trade for our selkie hero</span></div></div>",

Ages ago,, the races of men and elves mixed freely, but that time has past, and as the rule of Man grows, the elves and other races have withdrawn to the depths of their own realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such place is the city of Dervandsby, located under the icy seas of the far North.

Both species are characterized by greater brain size, increased body height and smaller teeth relative to Pliocene Australopithecus in Africa. Here we report the discovery, from the Late Pleistocene of Flores, Indonesia, of an adult hominin with stature and endocranial volume approximating 1\u2009m and 380\u2009cm, respectively'equal to the smallest-known australopithecines. The combination of primitive and derived features assigns this hominin to a new species, Homo floresiensis. The most likely explanation for its existence on Flores is long-term isolation, with subsequent endemic dwarfing, of an ancestral H. erectus population. Importantly, H. floresiensis shows that the genus Homo is morphologically more varied and flexible in its adaptive responses than previously thought.</i> --- P. Brown, T. Sutikna, M. J. Morwood, R. P. Soejono, Jatmiko, E. Wayhu Saptomo &amp; Rokus Awe Due, <u>A new small-bodied hominin from the Late Pleistocene of Flores, Indonesia</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't really sure how I wanted to tackle the halfling character in our adventure. I felt I had to include a halfling character, especially with the success of the Lord of the Ring movies, as well as the Hobbit movies. So I decided to go a different direction instead, and went with a 'scientific' halfling,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halflings in our adventure look exactly like humans, save their stature. The average female halfling stands 42 inches tall, with the average male halfling standing 46 inches tall. Halfling society developed independently on a peninsula and a string of islands, separated from the rest of their world by a range of impassible mountains and unnavigable waters. The seas between their islands are quite navigable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfling society tends to be very class oriented, with movement between the various strata being very limited. Theoretically, the peninsula that the halflings reside on, and the string of islands, are all under the control of the port city of Jarta. However, the further away from Jarta one travels, the more autonomous the provinces become,. The furthest islands are theoretically protectorates, but in actuality these islands are under control of various tribes, with only a few fortified enclaves maintaining a royal presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfling features tend to run along Scandinavian lines, with brown eyes unheard of, and dark hair very rare. Halfling women with dark hair and blue eyes are usually considered exotic beauties. (The halfling equivalent of Helen of Troy was supposedly such a woman),<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halflings knew there was a world beyond their kingdom, but until recent history, they only had hints of what might lie beyond the turbulent seas  surrounding their world. That is, until thirty years ago, when a dwarven ship, the Forge, was able to 'push through' the Maelstrom of Flores, thanks to an engine that combined dwarven magery and steam technology. A merchant's enclave of outsiders now exists in the city of Jarta and is under the protection of the present King of the Floresians (as halflings are known to outsiders). Non-halflings are not allowed to go beyond the city walls of Jarta, by royal decree. A few other races have made it to Jarta, but the vast majority of non-halflings are dwarves. Dwarves do not enjoy the best of reputations among the halflings they deal with, but at present, the dwarven monopoly on steam technology has given dwarves the upper hand, This may be changing, as halfling craftsmen and mages have recently built their own steamship, called the Balance, that will set sail. What this means for the future of the halflings and their world, and how the dwarves will react, is anybody's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as you prepare to enter this world as a halfling adventure, our first question is, what talents does your halfling bring into this word?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And that meant that Tarima Fisherson found himself as the sailing master of the only ship in the Royal Navy without sails. And by decree of His Majesty through his servant, the High Lord Admiral of the Navy, Tarima Fisherson was the senior noncommissioned officer on board a ship that moved through the water unlike any other ship in the fleet, whose method of propulsion was completely incomprehensible to Tarima except in the most superficial manner, and was going through a turbulence that was considered impassible until five years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it made perfect sense to put me on this ship, Tarima sourly reflected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, on the <i>Balance</i> it was Tarima who was always on the deck, rope around his waist, or below decks, or in the wheelhouse, always in three places at once, moving the crew by sheer force of will in the direction that the Captain wished them to move.

The mood of the men around him was an odd mixture of grim and festive. It was the first night of the hunt for the wyrm. For the most part, wyrms had been eradicated everywhere in the kingdom, save in the foothills of the Segila Mountains. And even there, the wyrms were never seen, save perhaps once or twice in a generation when a wyrm would come down from the mountains, taking a few heads of cattle in the middle of the night. The local ranchers would respond by forming a hunting party, with the men arming themselves with crossbows with enough force to pierce the tough hide of the wyrms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older men who had participated in the last wyrm hunt, fifteen years ago, went about setting up camp with grim countenances. They knew that the wyrm they were hunting could easily be twice as long as a man was high, with vicious teeth and claws. The animal would avoid humans, moving mostly at night. But if the wyrm the were stalking felt threatened or cornered, the hunters could easily find themselves the hunted,  The younger men in the party, having never been in such a hunting party, considered it a grand adventure, and were already congratulating each other on the prowess the would display in the days to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the young men except Sica Redstone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wyrms weren't the only exotic creatures that lived in the Segila Mountains. Tribes of elves lived there as well, rarely ever seen, save as shadows in the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn occasion, under a summer moon, an elven female would appear to a young human male, luring him into the woods and engaging him in a week of wild abandonment..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next year, as the snows began melting, a child would appear just outside the main village, on an odd rock formation made of red stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children would be raised by the family of the young man who had disappeared for a week, though the task was one not that was happily embraced. The fact that Sica was obviously not human, with his slightly pointed ears and violet eyes, did not help matters. From his earliest memories, Sica was made to feel as an outsider. He was almost preternaturally attractive, with dark blonde hair that feel about the fair features of his face, and a lean athletic body that did everything it set out do very well. This only motivated the parents of the young women in the area to strictly forbid their daughters from keeping company with Sica. Sica also had a natural ear for music and rhyme, and a beautiful voice, but when he began singing, his guardians would quickly silence him as others made signs with their hands to protect them from whatever powers they supposed Sica had inherited from his elven mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sica had learned to keep quiet and stay in the shadows as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was not a better tracker in the foothills. The older men who had hunted wyrms in the past insisted that Sica be in the hunting party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sica finished his bowl of stew, a figure stepped in front of the fire.

Still, Luka's ears were more pointed than most, and there had been whispers that Luka's mother had a dalliance with one of the warrior/merchants of the local Elven clan before her marriage. But if this were a fact, it was a fact that was never confirmed by Luka's mother or father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as a young man of sixteen, Luka was a proven rancher and an outstanding horseman. And also something of a clown. Around the campfire of the herdsmen, Luka was known for his abilities as a trick lassoist and quick wit, able to make up outrageously funny lyrics on the top of his head (the latter trait Luka's grandfather had unsuccessfully tried to beat out of Luka).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka wasn't thinking of any of these things, though. His grandfather had been making noises of arranging a marriage for Luka with one of the daughters of an adjoining landholder. None of Avrador Ferra's daughters were prizes, but the oldest, Arias...Luka shuddered at the prospect of having to sire children on her. Luka sighed, knowing that as the future Avrador of his clan, he would have no choice in whoever he was arranged to be married to. Land and blood counted before all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luka was resigning himself to his fate, his eyes caught a figure emerging from the portion of the Long Woods that bordered the pasture that Luka was currently riding. With a nudge, Luka's horse moved toward the emerging figure and Luka deftly held his herding pike at the ready. Luke's sharp eyes made out the figure emerging from the Long Woods as</span></div></div>",

But I have come to expect nothing less than perfection from you,\" the older woman said, as she lifted the cup in her hand to her lips, taking another small sip of the hot brown liquid Xandril had recently served her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it was surprising that Xandril could brew and serve and excellent cup of tea. He was, after all, a Mivorean, which was both the name of the region, and the people that lived there. Strictly speaking, Mivoreans weren't a separate race, but the end product of the generations of the (usually) peaceful 'interaction' of the humans of the Empire to the north, south and west of their region, and the elves of the great forests and mountains to their east, an 'interaction' which continued to the present day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, strictly speak, Mivore had not existed since the second Dynasty of the Empire (the Empire was presently in its Fifth Dynasty). Speaking correctly and officially, Mivore was part of the Province of TianHu, and directly ruled by the Governor of said Province, who was directly appointed and served at the Sufferance of the Empress of the only True Empire. In reality, the region of Mivorean was ruled by a council of elders and were usually left to their own devices as long as the proper taxes were paid, the proper forms were filled and there were no major disruptions going on anywhere in the Empire. And the reason for this was simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMivore wasn't the only source of tea in the world, but the argument could be made that it was the source of best and most varied types of teas known to the civilized races of the world. There were teas for bringing bright thought to the drinker in the morning, and teas that eased the drinker into sleep at night. Tea to ease pain, heal sickness, increase stamina.;;the list was endless. And among the Mivoreans, there were many families well known (at least among their fellow Mivoreans) for their skills in different aspects of the tea trade. Xandril's own family had many members, past and present, known for their skills in harvesting different tea leaves, no matter how much skill and delicacy was required. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost famed among the Mivoreans were a class called the Brewers, men and women adept at creating new strains of teas, and bringing out the best of the old. Different skills were attributed to the Brewers, from being able to predict future events by merely reading tea leaves to being able to heal the sick and the infirm, if they had access to their own private collection of tea leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd among the Brewers, there were the Adepts, the ones considered steeped in the lore of Mivorean tea, and where considered truly powerful. It was rumored a Brewer Adept could cloud and control the minds of all but the most strong-willed, subtly alter the weather about them, and other equally remarkable (and unbelievable) arcane skills. It was the Adepts who would choose from among the Mivoreans who would train to become Brewers and who keep their eyes on the new apprentices, in case one had the markings of eventually becoming an Adept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXandril was one such young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXandril had been barely an adolescent when he had been honored by being to attend the Brewer College. And he had been barely been an adult when he had been removed from his apprenticeship  </span></div></div>",

Skill and sail had only recently opened the Grand Sea to the ships of the various kingdoms. Now, a line of walled cities dot the coast of the Far East, serving as trade hubs between the Western Kingdoms and the tribes of men who live in the great oak savannahs just a few miles inland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere have been clashes on occasion between the men from the oak savannahs and the men of the walled city, but for the most part, as long as the men from the West remain in their cities, the men of the oak savannahs are content to let them stay, trading the riches of their land for the goods which the men of the West create. And though the cities are run by various great merchants, they operate under various royal charters, and the Kings of the West have agreed that the walled cities will not press inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few venturous individuals have ventured into the oak savannahs, but most are content to remain behind the walls of the cities, allowing the riches of the Far East to come to them. On occasion, though, there are rumors of wondrous and terrible beasts, and the men of the oak savannahs come to the city for help. A guild of hunters has formed, who go out to kill these beasts. Some return to the walled city with great riches, rewards from the grateful men of the oak savannahs. Others do not return at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it is here our story begins, with our hero, a member of the Hunter's Guild, currently staying in the walled city of<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Considering what a jewel that Bemid-ji, it is only reasonable to conclude that a nearby ruler has not thought more than once to pluck that jewel for his own treasury. But the rulers and councilors of Bemid-ji have always been cunning in their rule and diplomacy. In addition, the Bemidian Navy is small but formidable, as is there army, and considering the profit that a free Bemid-ji has always turned for its neighbors, none are willing to see another neighbor \"kill their golden goose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there is the College of Wizards that resides in Bemid-ji. Considering the rare and precious commodities that pass through Bemid-ji every day, it is also reasonable to conclude that some of these substances would be able to serve the arcane needs of Wizards. And thus, a place of learning, studying and advancing the knowledge of Sorcerers was founded in Bemid-Ji.

Any fool could shoot his victim with an arrow or bolt from a distance, and getting up close with a blade always ran the risk of receiving a blade in return. But the silence of the garotte required one to be able to approach one's enemy quietly, and to be able to leave the scene of one's task with the same amount of stealth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalak was one who could do just that. Talak was an unassuming man in height and stature, with just the hint of a point to his ears that spoke of at least one elf in his near-immediate ancestry. Elven ancestry wasn't uncommon in the lower and serving classes, and it made it easier for Talak to be overlooked by his \"betters,\" particularly if he was properly dressed. And Talak had inherited the eyesight and hearing of his elven ancestor, so he was not able merely to blend in with the shadows; he was the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the Spring of the Thirty-third year of the reign of Amarkos III in the Grand Duchy of Tiennes, and Talak had just successfully completed a particularly difficult job given to him by the Guild.

Her name was Mirana Iceter, though she was more commonly known in the days of her youth as the Twin Axe. She was the youngest daughter of one of the many chiefs of the tribes of the North Men. When she was twelve, her father was betrayed by one of his advisers, and her entire family was slaughtered. The only reason that Mirana had survived was that she caught the lustful eye of the man who betrayed and killed her father. When she was brought to the man's tent, she was able to kill him, and escaped. With the aid of her father's only loyal adviser, Mirana somehow managed to not only exact her revenge on the men who had plotted against her father, but was also able to unite the North Men under her banner. At the age of twenty, Mirana \"Twin Axe\" Iceter gathered the hordes of the Northmen and marched to the South, destroying anyone and anything in her path who did not bend their knee to her and pay her tribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was here that the elven prince Finrod Faelivrin enters the tale. Finrod was the nephew of the king of Tithris, an ancient city and forest that laid in the path of the ravaging North Men. It was known that Mirana blamed the death of her father partly on a tribe of dwarves who coveted certain rare metals in her tribe's lands, and had helped in the machinations against Mirana's father. So Mirana held very little love for any race besides human. For his part, Finrod had only known the tales travelers told of the North Men, and had always been happy that they never left their frigid homes. But now they were marching south, and it was said they did not plan to leave a single tree or elf alive in Tithris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Finrod, at his uncle's behest, went north under a banner of truce, hoping against hope of saving his people. As for his own life, Finrod considered it forfeit the moment he started north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a strange thing happened. Not immediately. Although it was considered strange by some that Mirana didn't have Finrod killed as soon as he was brought before her.  But somehow, over the length of two years, Finrod's captivity, which seemed to be about to end in his death at a moment's notice, became a romance. And at the age of twenty-two, Queen Mirana, undisputed mistress of the lands of the North and the kingdoms that bordered on them, took Finrod Faelivrin as her Prince Consort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a year later, she gave him three children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the two decades from the moment he was presented to Queen Mirana, a strange alliance formed between the Elves of Tithris and the North Men. The North Men did not march further south, burning and plundering everything in their path, but instead took root, solidifying their hold on those lands they had conquered. Rule of law was established, and justice, though still rough, ruled the new Empire of the North, with the Elves of Tithris serving more oft than not as important councilors in the various courts of the Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on their eighteenth birthday, the three children of the Queen and her Consort presented themselves before their parents, and were sent on a quest, to determine which child would one day inherit the Throne of the North.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur hero is one of these three children, each one sent in a different direction, armed with their wit, their skill with horse and blade, and their determination. And we shall follow our hero as he/she leaves the court of the parents, heading...</span></div></div>",

Unlike James, Lance had done things big when he got out of the Corps, providing and coordinating security for 'on site' filming and movie shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance had been contracted to supply security for a Jennifer Lawrence film, based on the latest popular fantasy novel that everyone was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally, James thought the character that Jennifer Lawrence was playing looked just like her character in the Hunger Games, except with a distinct pair of pointed ear elves, but that was just his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble had began when the author of the book the movie was based on did an interview. All things considered, the interview went very well. The author gushed about the faithfulness the production crew had given his work, how great it was being a consultant and getting to work with Jennifer Lawrence and the rest of the crew, and on and on and on. He did mention a few details of his book that had to be changed to time constraints, etcetera, but all in all he knew his fans would be pleased with the final products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for the most part his fans were pleased. But not all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will always be purists who take exception to any change from the original work, no matter how minor or how necessary. Most of these will consent themselves with grumblings on blogs or in emails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once in a great while, someone will take exception, blame an innocent party, and make threats that everyone takes seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this case, someone decided that, for some indiscernible reason, Jennifer Lawrence was to blame, And begin sending her threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the unfortunate fact of reality that people who enjoy fame also attract the attention of individuals they would probably rather not, so most celebrities of any note have some type of security, But since the threat against Jennifer Lawrence had been directed against her due to her latest production project, the security around the filming was increased, This included putting security personnel among some of the extras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd James was the perfect height, coloration and had appropriate scars that made him perfect as one of the many half-elf warriors who followed Jennifer Lawrence's full elf character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with a sigh, and remembering both the paycheck he would be receiving and the favor Lance would owe him, James allowed himself to be dressed up every day as a half-elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the tenth day James, along with everyone else, had decided not to take the threat seriously. After all, when the anonymous notes read \"You will regret mocking magick,\" or some variation thereof, can you really consider it a credible threat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was going fairly well and, unlike all the rumors James had heard, actors and actresses were actually people who wanted to get along with everyone around them. Jennifer Lawrence had even joked around with the half-elf extras between takes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene was literally crawling with extras. It was a battle scene in something that was meant to be a rampart or wall or tower...James wasn't sure. But there at least a hundred extras who were being meticulously placed to crawl, brawl, fight, run, walk, jump...and it was all going to be added to be computer graphics. James wasn't sure exactly how the whole process was going to work, but he couldn't wait to see what it finally looked like. It was going to be something, he was sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a hooded extra pulled a silver ball out of his robe and threw it at Jennifer Lawrence. James wasn't the bodyguard type, but some instinct made him throw his body between the ball and a startled Jennifer Lawrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball exploded, and James found himself hurtling down a dark tunnel. He fell faster and faster and then lost all consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, he found himself flat on his back, looking up at....</span></div></div>",

She had her friends, her family, her academic and extracurricular activities, her boyfriend, and that was pretty much the whole of her world. It wasn't that she didn't care about other people not personally involved with her; it was that they simply did not exist,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was a very lovely girl, with an athletic body that was still very feminine, (naturally) blonde, long straight hair, and blue eyes that were, very unfortunately, sometimes quite vacant. The adopted daughter of an older couple who doted on her, and whose affections she happily returned, she was involved in all the activities a young woman in her late teens who was both smart and popular in high school would be involved in. She was a cheerleader, homecoming queen, Honors Society, various dance committees...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were, however, two odd things about Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was that she was very good with the sabre. As in, Olympic level good, She had been competing in regional and national competitions for a few years, and there was serious talk she might garner a spot on the national team,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this skill in and of itself wasn't that unusual. Her adoptive parents had met while competing in the Olympics years ago, Her mother was a noted sabreuse, while her father had won a silver medal with the foil. So no doubt it was inevitable that, when the little girl they had adopted had demonstrated even an inkling of talent, her parents would do everything to nurture it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was that Stacey had slightly pointed ears,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all the time, of course. That was the sort of thing that would get people talking, But if you happened to look at her at the right angle, and in the right light, you could, just for a moment, see the slight point to the top of her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey had seen the point of her ears more than once, but her parents quickly convinced her it was just an illusion caused by lights, shadows, lack of sleep, or whatever, so Stacey never gave a thought to it ever again, Her parents made no mention of it when they saw it, and her friends just thought they were \"seeing things\" on the occasions when they saw it,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Stacey's life was good, as far as she was concerned, but basically uneventful.

Yet for all its diversity, order was maintained (at least within the reach of an arrow from the main Avenues), water flowed through the aqueducts, the sewers under the city were a marvel in and of themselves, and the outbreak of disease was met with brutally efficient measures, particularly in the poorer sections of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there were the arenas.

There were hundreds of variations, but the game that had found itself to the way to the Arena was simple. Two teams, consisting of five horsemen each, would attempt to take a sheep's carcass from their own end of a large field and deliver it to a construct at the other end of the field. Whoever was able to deliver the carcass into their opponent's \"goal\" within a set time frame won the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust being able to pick up, pass and deliver the carcass while on horseback took morn than a modicum of skill. When you had other riders who were actively trying to stop you in your endeavors, it became both difficult and dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the Zhashi teams that played in the Arena, the undisputed champions was the Zhashi team led by Nullah Zahir, Ten horsemen he had, and even his substitutes would have been star players on any other team. In addition, all ten riders were true sons of the steppe, their hair shorn short, their beards untouched, their eyes as dark as storms rolling across the plains and their visage as fierce as the eagles that soared across their ancestral lands. And of the ten, Nullah was the fiercest, the most ablest of the riders, his sight sharp even at night, his hearing undiminished even in a storm, thanks to an elven wife his maternal grandfather had taken (a heritage visible by a slight point to Nullah's ears).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNullah was leading his team out of the arena after another victory when they were met at their exit by a messenger from<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For those who wish to contribute, I ask the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Please add more than just a sentence or two to your addition. Two or three paragraphs at a minimum would be nice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Please maintain a continuity with the storyline in your addition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Please <u><b>do not</b></u> make the word 'Continue' or anything similar one or both of the options the reader has to choose from<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) All good stories must eventually come to an end. However, I would prefer no storyline ends prior to Chapter 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) I understand that there are a number of special interests that some might deem 'fetishes' on WDC. I would prefer that they <b>do not</b> enter this interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) Remember the '13' rating when adding on to the story, particularly with any scenes involving violence or romance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reserve the right to edit or delete any contributions, though I will try to do so sparingly, especially if the contributor has complied with my guidelines above. In addition, for anyone who doesn't wish to contribute but would like to see a particular storyline expanded, just send me an email and I'll be happy to oblige. Be advised I am working on other projects now, and any additions you want me to make are going to be on a as time becomes available basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </td>",
