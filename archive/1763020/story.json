Each one of them had there own plan for what to do that morning. Alex was out doing gymnastics, Clover was out shopping, and Sam was checking out new books in the library. They all agreed that after they had done their own activities they would all met together to have a lunch break. Once the spies reunited, they left for the restaurant. They were all outside the door of their favorite restaurant when suddenly they felt something suck them up and they were teleported to WHOOP headquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello girls it's time for a mission, and an important one.\" said Jerry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, come on Jerry! We were about to eat lunch.\" yelled Clover as she heard her belly give a  growl of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only ones that are hungry girls. For the past there has been massive thefts on food across the world. The thefts seemed to begin at a small country called Starvania. Your mission is to try and find out what happened there and find any leads on whoever is behind this. Good luck girls!\" said Jerry as he pushed a button. The button transported them on to a plane heading towards Starvania. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the plane landed and they girl stepped outside. They all noticed how barren the land was. The few trees that were nearby were barely alive. The soil was dry and hard with no grass to be found. The only part of the surrounding that looked nice was the small lake with crystal clear water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now we need a plan to see if we can catch this thief!\" said Sam. \"Yeah, but how do we find someone that steals food?\" asked Alex. \"That's easy, we just need to find someone that isn't starving. There should be a village up ahead, we're bound to find someone that isn't suffering from a lack of food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but please don't try to talk about food so much. I'm still pretty hungry since we missed lunch.\" said Clover as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the spies began their walk towards the village Sam mentioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were too exhausted and tired from their long walk to realize how much time had gone by, but they knew they had been walking for quite sometime. The walk was taking it's toll on the girls. Normally they would have used their jets or some other gadget that Jerry should have given them, but Jerry had just sent them without gadgets. He was so concerned with getting this mission solved that he actually neglected to give them the tools to help them. The spies didn't realize that they were gadgetless until some time after they started their journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could Jerry leave us out here without any gadgets?\" asked Alex almost out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could have at least sent us a snack since we missed lunch.\" said Clover as a large growl came from her stomach and she began to rub it in hopes of giving it temporary satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax guys, we've got to be close to this village by now.\" said Sam trying to sound confident, yet her tone sounded uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've said that at least a dozen times now. If we were close to the village, you would have had to said it so many times. When we do get to the village, the first thing we should do id order some lunch.\" said Clover as she imagined pizza, ice cream, chocolates and other yummy treats. Of course imagine such sweet food on an empty stomach made her hunger even worse. Her growls from her stomach became louder and she desperately rubbed faster to try to keep it quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clover, you've got to be tough on a mission like this. A true super spy should be able to last long on an empty stomach, like me and Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, actually Sam, all this talk about food is making me hungry too.\" said Alex as a small grumble came from her stomach, almost as if on Que.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I'm not not Hungry!\" said Sam right before a growl came from her stomach and she too, began rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to get some food said Clover. Then the spies see... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

The Justice League was spread thin along with all the other super hero teams defending the planet with their lives. Things were no different for the Titans. They\u2019re numbers weren\u2019t great at the time. The youthful heroes were taking care of Earth\u2019s own villains who were taking advantage of Darkseid\u2019s siege. With all the major heroes busy who was going to stop them. Now the Titans were separated into smaller teams based on their abilities that work together ideally taking on villains who originally would be way out of their league. In their current circumstances though, with so much on the line, the Titans were fighting in a way never seen before. They were redefining team work. Together they were crushing individual villains one by one, and growing in power. The team of Starfire, Raven, and Terra were in the midst of one of their greatest battles. Sinestro had the upper hand the entire battle. In a last ditch effort Raven uses her abilities to launch an oil tanker at Sinestro in a middle of a monologue. Without hesitation Sinestro goes to defend himself, but Terra was reacting quicker as if she knew what her desperate ally was thinking sends a tremendous boulder through the tanker releasing a ball of flaming oil towards the surprised super villain. With little time to spare Sinestro begins to spread a wall of his random magics of the Anti-verse. With little to no hesitation Starfire was already barreling through oil ball of fire feeling her righteous anger fist forward. She makes it past the wall before he can complete it, but right when she reaches him she has a  horrendous revelation. She\u2019s terribly hungry. The vicious growl of her stomach works to her advantage scaring the wits out of Sinestro.<br>\r\n \t\u201cWhat kind of beast are you!?\u201d yells the frightened villain as Starfire collides into him.<br>\r\n\tThe two of them careen into the ground the fireball following in suit. Terra screams in horror seeing the fireball hit Star. Staring at the smoldering pile Terra begins to cry. She then notices a little black energy leaving the ball more and more. Raven had caught Starfire in one of her spells before the fireball had hit them.<br>\r\n\t\u201cStar!\u201d screams Terra elated.<br>\r\n\tTerra looks back towards Raven then hurries over to her friends. Raven gently puts down Star\u2019s body, and releases the spell. Partially exposed because of the fireball Star laid in front of the two girls scarred and seemingly broken.<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs she ok?\u201d ask Terra still afraid for her friends life.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d replies Raven. \u201cStar?\u201d<br>\r\n\tStarfire doesn\u2019t move. The look of concern grows on the others face. Suddenly Starfire stomach growls again, and she rolls onto her back.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m so HUNGRY!\u201d screams Starfire rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cUggh!\u201d sigh the two other girls falling over backwards.<br>\r\n\tThe three of them lay there.<br>\r\n\t\u201cMe too!\u201d says Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea.\u201d agrees Raven.<br>\r\n\tThere stomachs were growling like a brutal symphony of grunts. They lay there for a little while longer rubbing there stomachs. The battle had took a lot out of them. The hunger was making them feel severely weak.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis unbearable.\u201d says Raven still rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh huh.\u201d grumbles Terra also rubbing her stomach in agreement.<br>\r\n\t\u201cLets go home and eat!\u201d yells Starfire.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea!\u201d scream the girls in unison jumping up excited at the thought of a  meal. The same thought brings them all to their knees though. Reminding their stomachs what their greatest desire they to rumble in agreement. The girls all rub their stomach. Starfire taking the initiative gathers the two in her arms using their bodies to cover up flies quickly to the tower. There three separate on their own agendas. Star flies to her room to change while Terra heads to the kitchen. Raven goes to the communication room to see the status of the situation happening across there little planet. Terra reaches the kitchen first. She immediately starts rummaging through cupboards, the pantry, and the fridge to find nothing. She rubs her growling stomach in disappointment. Then Terra has an epiphany. The entire kitchen was clean, and there was no garbage to be found. No one has been in the kitchen in a good while yet there was no food. The Titans had  stocked up way before the battle on Earth, and it made no sense for it all to be gone. Star rushes into the kitchen.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou made it here first so whatcha make?\u201d says Star childishly.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d says Terra looking towards the ground.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid you eat it all?\u201d questions Star.<br>\r\n\t\u201cNO!\u201d answers Terra. \u201cDo you think I had the time to eat all that food?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d sighs Star rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have no clue.\u201d replies Star. \u201cNothing here makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n\tRaven walks into the room with a paler than usual look on her face that was noticed immediately.<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you heard the foods all gone.\u201d says Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe foods gone!\u201d yells Raven as a little spark of her power explodes from the side of her temple from her emotional outburst.<br>\r\n\t\u201cBy the look you had on your face I figured you knew.\u201d says Star.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea.\u201d agrees Terra \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou have to see it for yourself.\u201d says Raven now rubbing her growling stomach in disappointment.<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk.\u201d says Terra and Star nervously.<br>\r\n\tThe girls reach the communication room the monitor still on the news.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI repeat,\u201d says the reporter, \u201cIt seems all the fighting has been extinguished. All at once random heroes, and all of Darkseid\u2019s minions had vanished from the sky. Random battles with Earth\u2019s own villains are still under way, but by the way things look there are no male heroes in these battles. Or in that case any males on the planet. We currently can not cut back to the station because both anchor men have vanished from set including all the other male employees in the building. It seems this is happening all..\u201d<br>\r\n\tThe broadcast is interrupted by an incoming communication from Wonder Girl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDonna are you okay!\u201d ask Star before she even could get the chance to speak.<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I\u2019m Starving!\u201d yells Wonder Girl over her growling stomach. You could tell by her body motion on the screen she was rubbing her tummy. \u201cI know that\u2019s a terrible way to start\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot to cut you off, but I understand.\u201d says Raven. \u201cWe\u2019re all starving here too.\u201d<br>\r\n\tThe news of the other girls take Donna aback.<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy whole team\u2019s hungry too.\u201d says Donna as the communicators camera scans back across both Bumble Bee and Aquagirl. The two of them huddle in a corner rubbing their growling stomachs. \u201cRobin also disappeared from the battlefield.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll men on Earth have vanished apparently.\u201d says Terra rubbing her growling stomach. Seeing the other two Titans huddle in the corner rubbing their stomachs was a gruesome reminder of their own predicament. \u201cIt was just on the news.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou think they took the food with them?\u201d ask Star with a blank look on her face. She too was rubbing her rumbling stomachs intensely.<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I don\u2019t think they took it with them,\u201d sighs Raven, \u201cbut I do think the two are connected.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow?\u201d ask Terra. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense yo.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cDoesn\u2019t it?\u201d replies Donna still rubbing her roaring stomach angrily. \u201cAll at once the major battles on the planet stop at once, all the guys are gone, and I\u2019m sure we are not the only ones starving right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI agree.\u201d says Raven. \u201cThat\u2019s too much just to be a coincidence.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d ask Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cIts too soon to begin speculation.\u201d says Raven.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat sounds like something Robin would say.\u201d mumbles Star.<br>\r\n\tThe girls go quite for a bit. The silence gets broken by the sounds of a roaring stomach choir. The girls rub their growling stomach\u2019s in unison. The hunger was becoming unbearable.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll I know is we need to decide on something.\u201d  says Donna rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cThis is becoming too much.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea.\u201d agrees Terra. \u201cThe Earth still needs our help too. So many super villains are rampaging right now. We have to put them back in line.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you suggest?\u201d ask Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not flying anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n\tOn the other side of town. Donna Troy was putting her personal communicator away. They had just finished a battle with Jinx. Jinx was backed up by Gizmo, but in the midst Gizmo up and vanished. Jinx was left to defend herself. With three Titans still standing it was an unlikely effort. Aquagirl had sustained an injury, but nothing worth really mentioning. Now Jinx laid unconsciously on the side walk. She laid there unconsciously rubbing her stomach hoping the growling how hungry she is also. <br>\r\n\t\u201cDid they buy it?\u201d ask Aquagirl rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\tDonna falls on her back holding her stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cUgh,\u201d replies Donna, \u201cthey are coming.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI couldn\u2019t walk back like this.\u201d says Aquagirl. \u201cI\u2019m so hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cMe too.\u201d agrees Donna rubbing her growling stomach gently not to hurt her raw skin.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t think I can move I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d says Bumblebee.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt least you could fly!\u201d yells Aquagirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea,\u201d says Bumblebee, \u201cbut I\u2019m just gonna shrink down so I can fit in someone\u2019s pocket.

They passed all these sign advertising all kinds of foods. Starfire will power begins to bend. She had been watching the signs past, and it was just too much. She started barreling off towards a giant burger sign in the sky. Raven had been watching her the entire time. She was already halfway through her chant before Star took off. Star is engulfed in Raven\u2019s black magic before she can smash through the sign, and attempt to eat this giant plastic cheeseburger. Raven hauled Star\u2019s grumbling body back onto course.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy?\u201d screams Star rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah why?\u201d ask Terra. \u201cI could have used the laugh.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe don\u2019t have the time.\u201d replies Raven. \u201cDo you want to have to pick her up out of that rubble, and carry her back along with the other Titan\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI could\u2019ve eaten it.\u201d says Star disappointedly.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think I could have too.\u201d agrees Terra rubbing her still growling stomach. \u201cThe way I feel I could eat anything.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat some dirt?\u201d ask Raven rubbing her growling stomach now as well. \u201cIsn\u2019t it in easy access to you?\u201d<br>\r\n\tTerra shoots Raven a angry look.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy don\u2019t your eat dirt?\u201d questions Star.<br>\r\n\tThe other girls drop their heads, and continue their path toward the other Titans. They\u2019re journey slowing down minute by minute. Star kept bouncing back, and forth from billboard to billboard.  The flight was wearing Starfire down, but the needless use of Raven\u2019s magic now began to weigh on her. The hunger was steadily becoming more vicious the more signs they past. Raven was even beginning to feel her will power wear away. Terra remained laid out upon her flying stone. She held her stomach rubbing it to calm the growling. It didn\u2019t do a thing. How hungry she is now amount of rubbing is going to help her. Terra still kept watch on her communicator to make sure nothing happened to the other homing beacon.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe should just stop, and find some food.\u201d says Raven still rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWeren\u2019t you the one who said we didn\u2019t have time?\u201d responds Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy  do you care?\u201d says Starfire rubbing her rumbling stomach slowly.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure the others would be happy if we brought food with us.\u201d responds Raven. \u201cWhy are you complaining? I can hear you from here.\u201d<br>\r\n\tTerra\u2019s stomach bellows out as she rubs it. It seems as if her stomach was in agreement with Starfire and Raven. She still felt adamant about heading towards the others though.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe faster we get there at least we can search the area for something with them.\u201d explains Terra. \u201cIf we stop now we might not be able to get back going.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2018m too hungry to fight on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n\tTerra and Starfire rubs their growling stomachs from the painful reminder. <br>\r\n\t\u201cLets go.\u201d says Raven flying towards the Donna, Aquagirl, and Bumblebee.<br>\r\n\tThe other two follow right behind. Donna looks above to Raven and the others following. Raven is chanting her magic words, but she is facing directly at Donna.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is she thinking?\u201d thinks Donna. \u201cIs she aiming at me?\u201d<br>\r\n\tThen Donna realizes what\u2019s going on and turn her back towards Raven. She notices the huge creature behind them. Tentacles, eyeballs, slime coming from multiple mouths. She rubs her growling stomach knowing she is not ready for this. Bumblebee and Aquagirl notices the creature as well.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m probably going to be fighting this by\u2026\u201d thinks Donna.<br>\r\n\tBefore Donna could finish her thought Raven, Star, and Terra are chunking what they have left at it. The mess was getting angrier and angrier. Donna starts to grab any close object with weight, and starts hurling projectiles. Cars, Mailboxes, Light post, whatever she could put her hands on. Bumblebee and Aquagirl  rubbing their growling stomachs watch as the four girls go to work. The two felt to weak to help. Their attacks were having effect, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Raven, Star, and Terra land next to Donna. The four of them look at each other clueless on their next game plan. Their stomachs were all growling viciously as well. Raven looks over her shoulder remembering the other two figures that were behind them. There is nothing to be seen behind them anymore. <br>\r\n\t\u201cTheir gone?\u201d says Raven.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho are?\u201d ask  Terra rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe other two behind us.\u201d replies Raven. \u201cRemember there was two other figures there.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat just means we\u2019re not surrounded anymore.\u201d says Donna. \u201cI noticed them earlier also.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou didn\u2019t see this thing to it was almost to late.\u201d says Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI so hungry.\u201d says Star rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cGet out of our way!\u201d<br>\r\n\tStarfire goes flying towards the huge creature.  The other girls are shocked by her actions. As she makes a beeline for the monster two other figures are falling from above as well. The three all crash into the blob. Tentacles, mouths, eyes, slime went every where. <br>\r\n\t\u201cDid Star do it?\u201d ask Bumblebee still rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know what just happened, but two figures came in from above.\u201d replies Donna also rubbing her stomach. \u201cEither way we need to clean up this mess, find our Star, and get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI agree.\u201d says Raven<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood then.\u201d replies Donna. \u201cLets get started.\u201d<br>\r\n\tRaven does her chant and starts carrying chunks of the anamorphous creature, and placing the pieces inside one of the destroyed buildings next to them. Movement is now noticeable under the pieces. Star stands up covered in monster goop rubbing her growling stomach with a look of despair on her face.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m so hungry I want to eat this.\u201d says Star. \u201cIt smells so gross though.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea I wouldn\u2019t try eating that mess.\u201d replies Terra rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cThat probably make you sick.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea, it looks gross.\u201d says Aquagirl rubbing her growling stomach as well.<br>\r\n\t\u201cUgggh!\u201d exclaims Star as she blast away the rest of the goop.<br>\r\n\tTwo other figures could be seen  rising from the ashes from the remaining monster mess.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d yells Supergirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey what are you doing here?\u201d ask Raven.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe were tracking that thing.\u201d says Supergirl as Wonder Woman was rising from the ashes as well.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat for?\u201d ask Star.<br>\r\n\t\u201cTo eat.\u201d replies Supergirl rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cFrom my side of the universe those Sniorf are a delicacy.\u201d<br>\r\n\tThe other girls faces go blank.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe could\u2019ve ate that?\u201d ask Raven rubbing her  growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you girls hungry as well?\u201d ask Wonder Woman rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d says Terra. \u201cI wished we went to the alley first now.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d says Raven dropping her head still rubbing her growling and now angry stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d says Wonder Woman. \u201cYou did the best thing  in that situation. If we were enemies this could\u2018ve been bad if you girls didn\u2018t immediately group up. Especially seeing that we\u2019re all starving too. \u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea,\u201d says Raven rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d ask Aquagirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe should go find food!\u201d exclaims Starfire.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI agree with her.\u201d says Bumblebee rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want to know why Sniorf is here.\u201d says Supergirl rubbing her growling stomach in thought.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat kind of question is that now?\u201d ask Donna.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThink about it.\u201d says Raven. \u201cThose things are a delicacy.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d says Donna now rubbing her growling stomach from the thought of missing out on food. \u201cWhy do you have to remind me?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause they\u2019re on the opposite side of the universe.\u201d replies Raven.<br>\r\n\t\u201cExactly.\u201d says Supergirl. \u201cHow did it get here?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cCould there be more here?\u201d ask Starfire rubbing her growling stomach excitedly.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDoubt it.\u201d replies Supergirl. \u201cThey usually travel in packs so if there were there probably would have been with this one.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cAwwww.\u201d says Star disappointed.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want to know how it got here.\u201d says Supergirl. \u201cWe may even find more if we keep looking.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI curious too.\u201d says Raven still rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want to find food.\u201d says Starfire.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI agree with you.\u201d says Aquagirl rubbing her growling stomach in agreement. \u201cWhere would we look though.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Starfire had major head start on the other two. Rubbing her growling stomach Star went on a rampage. Wrecking building after building. Terra and Raven did not care to stop her. They are to hungry to even try. Raven watches Star as she destroyed the city in front of her. Something wasn\u2019t right. <br>\r\n \tOn the other side of town Donna was putting her personal communicator away. Still rubbing her growling stomach she sits down slowly on the concrete.<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what happened?\u201d ask Bumblebee. \u201cDid you convince them to come?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d says Donna disappointed. \u201cThey\u2019re so distracted by their stomachs I didn\u2019t get a chance to even to come this way.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cArggh!\u201d yells Aquagirl rolling on the ground rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with them?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know Starfire has the attention span of a humming bird.\u201d replies Donna. \u201cShe just took off, and the others had to follow her.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d ask Aquagirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d replies Bumblebee. \u201cWe have to think of something though.

I didn\u2019t eat a lot, but I did eat before I left as well. If the other girls are hungry that means the tower is devoid of food as well. I know the kitchen was full this morning when we left.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you think\u2019s going on?\u201d ask Aquagirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replies Donna, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think Bumblebee\u2019s going to find anything.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cUggh,\u201d cries out Aquagirl rubbing her growling stomach, \u201cdon\u2019t say things like that. We have to keep faith.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know.\u201d agrees Donna. \u201cI just have this feeling though.\u201d<br>\r\n\tStarfire has had enough. Now way to tire to continue Star was now just lying on Terra\u2019s rock as they continued the search through the city. Now with some thought though. The first place they are heading is the nearest burgershack. They\u2019ve already went through a couple restaurants during Starfire\u2019s rampage. Even through the rubble there was no food to be found. Now they were just going to examine the place to see if it was robbed. The trio lands by Burger Bandits. They approach the door. Star was still on one of Terra\u2019s floating rocks just rubbing her growling stomach. Raven and Terra walk to the back.<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt smells so good in here, but where is everything?\u201d ask Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think we missed someone.\u201d replies Raven. \u201cThey must of cooked some food and left.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense though.\u201d says Terra rubbing her growling stomach at the thought of someone running out with all the food. \u201cWe flew in. I didn\u2019t see anyone around. There\u2019s no dishes or filth to say this placed was used. How they cook the food?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d said Raven rubbing her growling stomach. The smell was starting to get to her. \u201cThen what\u2019s with the smell? You telling me it doesn\u2019t smell like food back here.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrench fries!\u201d yells Star sitting up rubbing her roaring stomach in excitement. \u201cThat smell is French fries.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea, it is.\u201d agrees Raven.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s probably the fryers.\u201d replies Terra pointing towards them. \u201cI\u2019ve worked fast food. It always smells like French Fries. You go home smelling like them too. It\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s weird though. The grease is completely clean. There\u2019s not even any burnt fries floating around. Someone was here though. The fryer are still on. The grease is still clear.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan I drink that?\u201d ask Star rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cIt looks delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest.\u201d replies Raven .<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea, you wouldn\u2019t have any insides left.\u201d agrees Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t have to think about my stomach.\u201d says Star.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea.\u201d says Raven and Terra at the same time rubbing their growling stomachs also.<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s not be stupid.\u201d says Terra. \u201cThat will kill us.

The other girls look in shock , and jump to follow their frantic friend. When Raven and Terra arrive inside the other restaurant they only find Starfire on her knees with a look of despair in her eyes. <br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d ask Terra.<br>\r\n\tStar points forward rubbing her growling stomach. There in front of her is a pack of raccoons ravaging away at the only edible food they\u2019ve seen. Disappointed the Star, Raven, and Terra slowly walk out rubbing their hungry, growling stomachs. They leave the kitchen area, and star digging through the trash in the dinning room of the Mexican restaurant. Slop only remained in the trashcans. The girls disgusted in themselves and the slop they were digging through, and went to clean up in the women\u2019s room. <br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy\u2019d we do that?\u201d ask Raven.<br>\r\n\t\u201cCause your just as hungry, just as desperate as the rest of us.\u201d replied Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea,\u201d agrees Star wearily, \u201chungry like the rest of us.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know,\u201d says Raven \u201cbut there has to be a better way.

Do you think we should waste our time going through another empty or animal infested building?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d says Raven. \u201cThere just has to be another way.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe give it one last go.\u201d says Terra. \u201cCheck one last building, and then while we are searching we can think of our next plan.

The two of them shrug off her comment. The girls leave the Mexican place, and go into the next little restaurant. A Chinese place with just as little to offer. Knowing this the girls enter the building not expecting much, but hoping for the best. The smell of fried noodles still lingered in the air. This stirred up the girls hunger even more. <br>\r\n\t\u201cOh my stomach.\u201d says Terra rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know.\u201d agrees Star also rubbing her growling stomach. \u201dIt smells so good I don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cLets look around.\u201d says Raven.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou look a little happier than normal.\u201d notices Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe might get to eat.\u201d says Raven with a little smile now rubbing her growling stomach as well.<br>\r\nThey excitedly move to the kitchen to see what was in store for them. On they\u2019re arrival they see a stock full of food. So much to feed a army. Star starts to shiver excitedly. Terra looks towards her with concern.<br>\r\n\t\u201cStar what\u2019re you thinking?\u201d ask Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m just so excited!\u201d yells Star.<br>\r\n\t\u201cMe too!\u201d screams Raven \u201cWoo!\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cJeez no!\u201d yells Terra realizing she was watching the wrong girl.<br>\r\n\tRaven body erupts with energy.  She lost total control of her emotions, and that was not a good thing. The restaurant was covered in black flames. Cans were popping, the walls were burning, and Terra and Starfire are in cover behind Star green energy.  Screams are bellowing through the kitchen. Terra and Star look at each other in worry knowing the screams were not coming from each other. Just as quick as it started the whole mess came to a quick halt. Raven\u2019s energy has now ran dry. She collapses from exhaustion. The restaurant was in shambles none of the food was remaining. Just debris and ashes. Raven lifts her head off the floor slowly.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d says Raven rubbing her angry stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAhhhh!\u201d screams Star frustrated.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d says Terra rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cIt has to be hard for you to keep control the things are.

We have a job to do, and Raven is correct.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy girls over here can\u2019t handle another battle.\u201d says Donna.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey don\u2019t look anymore battle hardened than the rest of us. \u201c replies Terra. \u201cYou\u2019re all just hungry like the rest of us, and being lazy.\u201d<br>\r\n\tDonna looks down rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess your right.\u201d says Donna disappointed.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky you might find some food on your next mission.\u201d says Terra.<br>\r\n\tRaven rubs her stomach growling stomach at the thought.<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease don\u2019t mention food right now.\u201d says Raven. \u201cSeeing that we are going back out there I don\u2019t need any distractions.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI understand.\u201d says Terra also rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cThe computer still shows action happening all over the planet. It\u2019s not as much before, but that is not a bad thing.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo many people went missing also. I wonder if this is a part of Darkseid\u2019s plan?\u201d ask Bumblebee in the background of Donna\u2019s communicator. She to was rubbing her growling stomach, but now she is standing. There was no point in laying around pretending to be really injured anymore.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d responds Terra. \u201cWe crush any who oppose us, return what little normality to this planet we can, and then get something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n\tAs Terra says the last part she slowly slides down to her knees. The hunger is getting to her to, and as hard as she tried to hide it she could not help but to rub the growling beast. She looks up to the other two in the room. Raven and Starfire look at her understandingly. <br>\r\n\t\u201cI think I should head back to Atlantis.\u201d says Aquagirl interrupting the moment.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAtlantis, Why now?\u201d ask Donna. \u201cShould\u2019ve you gone back when this all started?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI checked with them before the war, and they were untouched. I want to see if the disappearances happened there as well.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou just want to get something to eat.\u201d says Star.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea,\u201d says Aquagirl rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cbut I can bring food back. The entire kingdom can\u2019t be empty.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat seaweed?\u201d ask Bumblebee rubbing her growling stomach with a look of disgust on her face. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe could get some fish!\u201d yells Terra.<br>\r\n\tA look of disgust flashes over Aquagirl\u2019s face, but no one noticed. No one cared to notice.\t\u201cWe have a mission.\u201d says Raven rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cI know we are starving, but we have a world to protect. Order to restore.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wish we could order pizza.\u201d says Star rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou never let up do you Starfire?\u201d ask Raven.<br>\r\n\t\u201cForget it.\u201d yells Terra. \u201cThere\u2019s a major battle going down on the bridge as we speak. We all meet up there and assist. After that you\u2019re free to go Aquagirl.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you.\u201d interrupts Aquagirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnce together we can figure out our next game plan after the fight.\u201d continues Terra. \u201cWe are closest to the bridge so we will be the direct support. We won\u2019t wait for your team Donna so hurry. If we get in trouble we will need you as a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk.\u201d replies Donna. \u201cWe are moving out  now.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow?\u201d says Bumblebee rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cCan\u2019t we at least search around for food for a little? I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you deaf or stupid?\u201d yells Donna now rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cWe are all hungry! We have a job to do thought. So stop complaining. The same to you Aquagirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes Ma\u2019am.\u201d replies Aquagirl also rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe will see you girls there.\u201d says Donna to the other three girls across the communicator.<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood,\u201d responds Terra, \u201cwe are taking off immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n\tStarfire, Raven, and Terra immediately leaves the Tower, and heads towards the fight in the distance that was still going strong.  Rampant explosions were erupting across the bridge. When the girls get in view of what is going on  across the bridge they find Powergirl in a struggle with quite a few of robots of Brainiacs design. Donna\u2019s team now on the move were not covering enough ground.  Powergirl is holding her own, and has been doing so for quite sometime. The robots were not stopping though. No matter how much she pummeled them the robots would repair, and keep coming. It was beginning to look hopeless. Powergirl now collapses to her knees.<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot one of you could touch me. I\u2019m just to hungry to finish this.\u201d says Powergirl rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\tTaking advantage of the moment of weakness the robots close in. All five of them were approaching for a devastating blow. Before they could make it Starfire slams into one of them. Terra and Raven launch volleys at the remaining four while Star slung the one she carried off back into the group then started blasting star bolts. The girls send pieces of the robots flying everywhere. They now approach Powergirl to check on her condition.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you ok?\u201d ask Raven.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d ask Terra. \u201cThat should\u2019ve been a cake walk for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m to hungry.\u201d says Powergirl rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s unbearable.\u201d<br>\r\n\tReminded of their situation the other girls look down in pain.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea, we\u2019re starving too.\u201d says Star rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea.\u201d says Terra and Raven also rubbing their growling stomachs.<br>\r\n\t\u201cShame.\u201d says Powergirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea I know.\u201d says Terra.<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d replies Powergirl pointing behind the other three. \u201cWe\u2019re not done here.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ooooh.\u201d says Batgirl. Her stomach starts growling. \u201cOh I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d She rubs her belly in contemplation. \u201cWhy am I this hungry? I know I ate... Well I don\u2019t know how long I was out for. Where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019re in a cave.\u201d says Huntress walking in rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cI\u2019m starving as well. This place looks barron.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cHuntress how did we get here?\u201d ask a confused Batgirl still rubbing her stomach. \u201cI don\u2019t remember even getting into costume. I\u2019ve never been this hungry before in my life either.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d replies Huntress. \u201cI awoke to find myself laying next to two girls in a middle of a field. I was hungry, not as hungry as I am now, and I did not recognize any of the plant life in the area. The animals either.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo as far as we know we\u2019re on another planet?\u201d ask Batgirl shocked.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThats what I thought.\u201d replies Huntress. \u201cThen I looked...\u201d<br>\r\n\tHuntress stomach growls louder while she is rubbing it.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d says Huntress. \u201cWell I looked at the sky. I didn\u2019t know what to think then.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you ooo...\u201d says Batgirl trying to get up. She stumbles back to the floor light headed rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t get up too quickly.\u201d says Huntress rubbing her stomach. \u201cYou were out at least six hours. No telling how long before I woke up.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry, I got too excited there.\u201d says Batgirl rubbing her stomach. \u201cWhat do you mean you didn\u2019t know what to think?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet yourself together.\u201d says Huntress. \u201cThe only way is to show you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ve been by yourself for six hours?\u201d ask Batgirl. \u201cI\u2019m hungry enough to destroy every Gotham Burger in Gotham...\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cGross.\u201d says Huntress.<br>\r\n\t\u201c... and you\u2019ve been here awake by yourself for that long.\u201d says Batgirl finishing her last sentence. \u201cYou must be starving.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI admit that eating at Gotham Burger right now is better than this,\u201d says Huntress rubbing her growling stomach, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t by myself. I woke up next to two of you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s someone else here?\u201d says Batgirl on getting up again.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea she helped me carry you here.\u201d says Huntress. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her before. She comes off a little stuck up, but she seems good. She was unconscious next to us when I awoke.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d ask Batgirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe had split up to look around for some food.\u201d says Huntress.<br>\r\n\tThe thought of food made her collapse. Her stomach was growling even more.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI feel so empty inside.\u201d says Huntress on her back rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you ok?\u201d ask Batgirl also rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust let me sit a second.\u201d replies Huntress rubbing her still growling stomach. \u201cShe suggested we take a look around the area after we got here. We were supposed to meet up after we were done.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow are you supposed to when to meet her back?\u201d ask Batgirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe told me to think about her, and she\u2019d come back to the cave.\u201d says Huntress.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d says Batgirl confused.<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt means think about me, and I\u2019ll show up.\u201d says Emma Frost walking in slowly.<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d ask Batgirl.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell aren\u2019t you full of questions.\u201d says Emma sitting down against the cave wall.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m a bit confused.\u201d says Batgirl. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, but seeing that we\u2019re all in this together that means you know as much as I do. Well except that I\u2019m psychic as well. Now you know as much as I do about the situation.\u201d says Emma.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou find anything?\u201d ask Huntress rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDoes it look like I found anything? replies Emma rubbing her growling stomach also with her head against the cave wall.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d ask Huntress.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m hungry, and a little snippy.\u201d responds Emma rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cJust like you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea.\u201d says Huntress sitting up. \u201cSo we don\u2019t really know you so you can just call me Huntress.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd the other growling belly over there is Batgirl right.\u201d says Emma. \u201cI already know more than your code names.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea well we\u2019re not psychic.\u201d says Batgirl rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea,\u201d agrees Huntress, \u201c and I don\u2019t know how comfortable I am with you know what you know.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell we\u2019re from two entirely different places.\u201d responds Emma. \u201cMaybe even dimensions. I\u2019ve never even heard of the people or things from your memories. I couldn\u2019t do anything to you anywhere else than here, and I really can\u2019t do much here.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cThats fine I guess, but I still don\u2019t know your name.\u201d says Huntress rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat thing sounds like a dump truck.\u201d says Emma.<br>\r\n\tBatgirl giggles.<br>\r\n\t\u201cFunny.\u201d says Huntress. \u201cI still need to know what to call you.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have no problem giving my name.\u201d responds Emma.<br>\r\n\tA loud rumbling sound is heard. Everybody but Emma looks confused.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d ask Batgirl shocked.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWas that you?\u201d ask Huntress looking at Emma<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d says Emma laughing. \u201cAll of you need to calm down. Nobody here trust each other, but I\u2019m the only one who has told a lie.\u201d<br>\r\n\tBatgirl and Huntress looks at each other confused.<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe trust each other.\u201d says Batgirl rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYea, but the psychic already knows that.\u201d says Huntress. \u201cAnd what are you talking about lying?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy name\u2019s Emma. Emma Frost. I run a school for gifted children\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat sounds like a lie.\u201d says Huntress rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cYou taking care of the handicapped. Seems like you\u2019re trying to sell your self as good.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is your growling belly a lie detector?\u201d laughs Emma. \u201cThat shows we are from two different worlds. By gifted I mean mutants like me. Children gifted with powers from birth. I\u2019m apart of the X-Men.\u201d<br>\r\n\tBatgirl and Huntress look at each other confused.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey\u2019re pretty big. Loved and hated.\u201d says Emma. \u201cThe lie that a told is that I did find something out... Ow don\u2019t jab me with your elbow. Just sit there rubbing your stomach. They\u2019re good people.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d ask Huntress rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is Sue Richards.\u201d says Emma gesturing at the empty space next to her. \u201cShow your self.\u201d<br>\r\n\tAfter a few seconds Susan reveals herself reluctantly. Batgirl and Huntress look surprised.<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe is the Invisible Woman from the Fantastic Four.\u201d continues Emma.<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe Fantastic Four?\u201d says Batgirl rubbing her stomach looking more confused.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou never heard of the Fantastic Four?\u201d ask Susan rubbing her growling stomach.<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d says Huntress.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou see.\u201d exclaims Emma. \u201cThe FF is one of the biggest names from our realm just as the X-Men. The Fantastic Four though is known and loved by nearly everyone for their scientific leaps and bounds. For their generosity too. They\u2019re practically America\u2019s First Family.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow.\u201d says Batgirl.<br>\r\n\u201cThese two are vigilantes from where they\u2019re from.\u201d says Emma. \u201cPretty big names as well. If we were where they\u2019re from we would have heard of them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo we have no issues then why we shouldn't work together?\u201d says Susan now lying on her back rubbing her stomach now growling more than ever. \u201cI want to find some food!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI hear ya.\u201d agrees Batgirl rubbing her growling stomach also. \u201cI\u2019m so hungry I can eat an elephant.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYea I don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t work together.\u201d says Huntress also rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cAnd I\u2019m up to do some more looking around. We don\u2019t know why we are here, where we are, and if we don\u2019t get some food we will be powerless if anything comes up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYea, but I just got back.\u201d says Emma rubbing her growling stomach. \u201cI just need a little rest. We could split up. We\u2019ll meet up the same way we did before. Just my team will wait here a minute so I can catch my breath.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
