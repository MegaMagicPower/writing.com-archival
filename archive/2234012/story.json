            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The current king of Moebius grew concerned as he thought to himself about the current state of affairs: the planet was low on resources after Scourge\u2019s rule caused a large portion of it\u2019s population to be eradicated along with an abundance of it\u2019s wild life and that was not without mentioning the only survivors were living within Ovi Kintobor\u2019s sanctuary, in No Zone Prison, or were members of Scourge\u2019s Suppression Squad that now was lead by Miles. The fox rose from his throne as he walked over to his former leader who sat in front of him on his knees badly beaten and bruised as he escaped No Zone Prison recently and in his first move lead an attack on the home of the Suppression Squad in hopes of taking the title of King back however he underestimated his former allies with Miles in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re taking so long just kill me already...\u201d Scourge complained with a hoarse voice, Miles had the team Scourge brought taken away to be questioned for intel by Boomer using devices and methods that could make anyone sing like a bird but the fox wanted the green hedgehog to himself as he wanted to try something he had never done before on Scourge, after all why kill someone when you can keep them around as a guinea pig? \u201cOh you never understood Scourge but soon you will if I wanted to kill you I would\u2019ve done so long ago.\u201d With a smirk across his face Miles held his hands to show Scourge as they became covered in Moebius\u2019 equivalent of Chaos Energy: Anarchy Energy. Just like Chaos Energy it was a powerful energy that every being of Moebius had within them but some had much more than others to the point that with practice they could learn to manipulate theirs as well as other\u2019s Anarchy Energy to the point they could do things like preform what was seen as magic or go into their own kind of super forms. The only remaining Moebians that had a strong amount of said energy within them were Scourge, Miles, and O\u2019Knux primarily thanks to being the Moebian versions of prime universe beings that can use Chaos Energy in quite powerful ways. Out of the three however Miles was the only one who saw the potential in learning how to use the energy to the fullest however he still had much to learn and the best way to learn in his eyes was practice which he was about to do with Scourge based on an idea one of the many books in the castle\u2019s library presented: control over another person. \u201cWhat are you going to-\u201c The captured hedgehog grew somewhat concerned before Miles grabbed the sides of his head with the Anarchy Energy covered hands allowing the energy to spread from them to cover Scourge completely inside and out. \u201cAHHHH!!!\u201d Scourge pried himself out of Miles\u2019 grip and flailed on the floor in pain as the energy was changing Scourge to what the fox intended as the hedgehog\u2019s voice began to raise octaves his clothing changed into something similar to the uniform Alicia Acorn wore. \u201cWhat is happening to me?!\u201d The hedgehog cried out as he continued to change feeling organs moving and changing as breasts started forming underneath the shirt and his penis retreated and changed into a vagina within her pants. \u201cYou are becoming a perfect servant of my kingdom thanks to you we are low in population so I needed a way to get started fixing that.\u201d Scourge realized the predicament she was in and wished Miles had killed her instead as the fox was planning on forming a harem that included Alicia and Scourge\u2019s team. \u201cYou are...\u201d The hedgehog was about to try cursing the kitsune out when the final changes started that being within her mind as Miles only could imagine what was going on behind Scourge\u2019s now clouded eyes the energy disappeared off her as she gave a similar smirk to Miles\u2019. \u201cThank you for making me realize my place was at your feet your highness.\u201d The former rebellious hedgehog got up and bowed in front of her new master as the fox clapped before heading to the hallway. \u201cStay here as I take care of your allies.\u201d The hedgehog would nod as Miles would think to himself how exhausting that was imagining he could probably only do something like that five times within twenty four hours before he\u2019d be to exhausted to even walk luckily he did have an ace up his sleeve in the form of a piece of Anarchy Beryl. Anarchy Beryl was the Moebian equivalent to the Chaos Emeralds although there were countless pieces compared to the seven emeralds, the downsides were that they were less powerful than the emeralds and the only two places that had any were in the castle that the Suppression Squad called home of Devil\u2019s Island guarded by O\u2019Knux however the collection Miles had was the only usable product as the Beryl O\u2019Knux had kept the island he lived on afloat and taking or using an bit of it could send to the surface. With the Beryl was the method the three imbued with Anarchy Energy would use to go super as there wasn\u2019t enough of that energy even in their bodies to do that but it would take much more than a few pieces to do so. What Miles could do with a piece however was ease the amount of energy required to do what he had to Scourge as he entered the cell Boomer had tossed Fiona in as her screams soon filled the air.<br>\r\nWithin the next few hours Miles had made his way back to his throne with the fallen Descructix standing by at attention all in uniform and under the fox\u2019s service not to mention female with the exception of Lightning Lynx who Miles didn\u2019t change due to Boomer appealing that he deserved a boy toy of his choosing without Scourge being on the table. \u201cThis has gone quite well and I can see Moebius doing much better however with so much unrest and fighting in different dimensions threats may be bound to arrive here not to mention we will need resources from them soon.\u201d The fox thought to himself before he came up with an idea: he could conquer a few other realities to not only ensure the safety of Moebius but use them to make it flourish as well! \u201cScourge go tell the other Squad members to make preparations for Patch, Boomer and myself to start a journey across multiple realities.\u201d The hedgehog was confused but complied to her master as all the members came into the throne room Miles explained his idea and they quickly understood. \u201cAlicia I will leave you in charge of the planet and our new slaves.\u201d The Queen would nod her head in response thinking up of what kind of cruel punishments she could inflect on Scourge for so many years of torment while Miles was gone. \u201cI have packed a large bag full of Anarchy Beryl and set the portal for our first destination.\u201d The walrus informed Miles who smiled in response, \u201cThen let\u2019s roll out.\u201d The other two would nod as their journey of conquest began with...</span></div></div>",
