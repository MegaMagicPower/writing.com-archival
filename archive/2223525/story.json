He barely paid attention in class today because he was mostly interested in going out tomorrow night which was his 21st birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew was attending a junior college right now still figuring his life out. He worked part time as a server at a local restaurant in town. He had a small one bedroom apartment and mostly spent his free times playing video games or hanging out with friends. His mind was mostly set on turning 21 tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNowadays turning 21 didn\u2019t mean you were just old enough to drink it also meant you officially a man forever. 18-21 became known as the 3 years of hell for men Andrew\u2019s age. That\u2019s because they knew at anytime they could be selected for the gender draft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving your gender forcibly changed against your Will sounded like a nightmare. The only thing you got for it was a small government stipend of $1000. Basically a cheap apology from the government for changing your life forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew knew the reason why the draft existed. He learned about the gender drought and how he was born right at the start of it. It was a necessary evil to protect humanity but it also felt like science trying to play god sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever none of that mattered to Andrew anymore. Tomorrow was freedom day for him! His buddies Dave and Jake were taking him out for drinks tomorrow night and he couldn\u2019t be happier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew got back to his apartment as he noticed an odd piece of paper tapped to his front door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bright yellow letter with red letters on it that said \u201cUrgent\u201d on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew felt the lump in his throat as he slowly reached up and grabbed the letter and saw it was addressed to him...from the FGA...The Federal Gender Administration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a notice he was selected for the gender draft...</span></div></div>",

The letter and everything was totally official. Signed and stamped one day before he was free...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like something out of a nightmare. He was this close to freedom just to have it taken away from him right at the finish line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several days Andrew began the difficult process of telling his friends and family. His parents were furious and had their lawyer looking into ways to get him out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends, while supportive, couldn\u2019t offer much beyond their condolences. It was like they were saying goodbye already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the days passed and all resources seemed exhausted it seemed like Andrew had no choice. He didn\u2019t want to risk breaking the law and throwing his future away. Even as a woman he could at least make something of a life for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the final day Andrew woke up and got dressed. Looking at himself one final time. It was like saying goodbye to an old friend. </span></div></div>",

The facility he had to report to was a government operated transition facility. He was forced to sit and wait in a lonely waiting room until a woman in a lab coat came out calling his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrew Wilson.\u201d She said looking to Andrew who was the only person there. With no options Andrew stood up and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease follow me.\u201d She said leading him into a hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Andrew\u2019s surprise the lady he was following was quite gorgeous. She was a ginger with great curves and cute little freckles. She had a huge bust that bounced with every step she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Andy, so we are gonna take some tests first before we get started.\u201d She said having him sit at a table in a testing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next 15 minutes the lady doctor ran some tests with Andrew. They measured height, weight, bloodwork, allergies, and reflexes. Once all the tests were done she typed in the information into a computer which began to calculate everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...what\u2019s going on there miss...?\u201d Andrew began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctor...actually. I\u2019m Dr. Ann Van Husan. You can just me Dr. Ann.\u201d She said interrupting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry..Dr. Ann, what\u2019s the computer doing?\u201d He asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s figuring out what kind of female body will be best suited for you. Based on your body type, family history and everything. We want to make sure your new body fits you well. You won\u2019t make a very successful woman if we give you the wrong body.\u201d Dr Ann explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I see?\u201d Andrew asked out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...normally we like to wait till after the procedure. However...I think in your case it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll have it generate a preview.\u201d Dr. Ann said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began typing some things as an image soon populated on the computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/6f/16/6a6f16455f08063f64d6b997ede50cc4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/6f/16/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be me? A busty blonde chick?\u201d Andrew said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...quite the looker. You got lucky. Now...Lay down.\u201d Dr. Ann said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew obeyed and laid down on the table. The next thing he new Dr. Ann was strapping him down to the table as several metal arms began ripping off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...now?\u201d Andrew said scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep...no time like the present. The transformation is rather intense so try to relax.\u201d Dr. Ann said as she pushed a button as machine lowered a syringe down full of pink liquid and injected it straight into his veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Actually receiving mail was such a rarity nowadays, it felt kind of surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his head, to it caught the sunlight from different angles, Andrew watched the hologram logo. It seemed to rise above the surface of the envelope. It's colours shifting from a soft pale blue, to a pastel pink. Even the logo felt like it was mocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a party planned in two days time, he intended on facing that as a man. Celebrating with his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anomaly had seemingly come out of nowhere. Just a slight spike in male births one year. When Andrew was born himself, it was only a tiny difference. On the verge of being dismissed as a statistical blip. With 52% male births, and 48% female. Now he was 21. He stopped himself, the precision felt childish. Like declaring his age as twelve and a half years old. But ... technically, he wasn't 21 yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to become female. With the rate now far beyond statistical variance. It was 75% male, and 25% female. The world scared his parents, but as Andrew grew up this was normal. His classes were slightly male heavy, and their was a degree of prestige, of competition in having a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt college, one friend: Jack Williams had married his girlfriend. That had felt reckless and wild to Andrew, sure he knew Jack was exempted from the Gender Lottery, but that hadn't felt terribly real. Now he felt an icy sickness in the pit of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chirp came from his phone, and hoping for a distraction he pulled it out. The top of the messages was a confirmation. An e-mail, from the Federal Gender Administration. His hands trembled, he dropped his phone to the carpet. His last hope that his friends were pranking him as a birthday joke evaporated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" He told himself. \"No... maybe... it <i>is </i>because of my birthday!\" Hope surged. \"Maybe it's a message letting me know I'm out of the draw now. That I'm free from that risk. That my country needs me, as a man, to breed our way back to a healthier ratio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, even as he thought that Andrew knew it was a faint hope, a last desperate drowning man snatching at twigs.</span></div></div>",

A night of drinking and partying lay ahead of him... Spoiled now, by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA niggle at the back of his mind sniggered, and sneered that it wasn't a joke. That some would find out the day before their birthday. The lump of ice in the pit of his stomach refused to ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew didn't want to accuse all his friends, so hoping that he could discover who was behind it. Andrew opened the e-mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked genuine, at least to his untrained eyes. Nausea rose in his throat, after the formal letter explained the purpose of the draft. Everyone knew! His teeth ground, as he read the next paragraph thanking him for the sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the third paragraph, he hoped he was reaching the punchline for the gag. He tapped the link, and was lead to a new page. It was an program that claimed to show him how he could look as a woman. The range available was impressive. His DNA capable of producing a very beautiful woman. They were all wide-hipped, perhaps a limit set by the draft board... or just a hidden detail in his DNA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Andrew was oddly proud of that, before quashing that thought. This was joke software, not real. Andrew was invited to shape his future personally, and attend the clinic to receive his personalised dose of feminax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had to be the location for the party. Andrew convinced himself, looking the software over. Andrew mulled what sort of woman he'd want to present to his friends. What kind of prank he could play on them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew went to work designing his 'future female form'...</span></div></div>",

He wasn\u2019t used to drinking so much and it was already very late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow...if Hindsight is 2020 Andrew was soon about to learn a lesson about drinking responsibly...Even with his mishap last night...had he woken up in time and had gone to the transformation clinic he could have corrected his mistake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the government had a very low tolerance for anyone who missed their gender draft...Once somebody is more than an hour late an emergency squad is dispatched to find the gender skipper and forcibly transform them...It\u2019s not a pretty sight as the squads don\u2019t have finesse of the doctors so the changes are rougher and the victim feels everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Andrew woke up with a splitting headache....This was by far the worst hangover of his life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long shower...some aspirin, a lot of Gatorade, and some breakfast later he was better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time he was very late for his appointment and in totally honesty he had totally forgotten about the letter and what he did last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to go out for a jog with his buddy David. He put on some gym shorts and tank top as they met up together in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! I thought you would be at the clinic! Did you get a waiver?\u201d David asked a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA waiver for what?\u201d Andrew asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gender draft...we were all shocked when we heard you had been selected.\u201d David replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...that was real? Not a prank?\u201d Andrew asked as his memories were coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude...we would never mess with you in that. It\u2019s too serious.\u201d David replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh..:oh shit...um..I think I gotta...\u201d Andrew began to say before sirens and flashing lights appeared around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral armed SWAT guards emerged fully armed as David as and Andrew put their hands up as they circled them. One of them and forded Andrew to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cID positive....Andrew Wilson...Mr. Wilson you are hearty charged with gender draft abandonment...this is normally a felony that can result in up to 25 years in prison...however since we were able to locate you within 24 hours and you did successfully fill out a body application online we will forgo the charges in exchange for immediate transformation. Do you understand these charges as they have been read to you?\u201d The officer called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wait! Please don\u2019t use that profile i was drunk and didn\u2019t know what I was doing!\u201d Andrew pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe circumstances are irrelevant we cannot wait around for another profile and serum to be made.\u201d The Officer said as he produced a syringe filled with a brink pink liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much earning the officer injected Andrew in the neck. It hurt like hell as it was rough and not well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSerum administered successfully...The transformation will take roughly one hour to complete...once it is done you are required to report to your local gender draft office for new paperwork, identification, and registration...thank you for your corporation.\u201d The officer said as he released Andrew and the squad left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew laid there shaking. He body was aching as he could feel everything...like his insides were twisting around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrew! Are you okay?\u201d David said rushing to his friend for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...help me!\u201d Calling out as David gasped seeing the changes were already taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew\u2019s hair was growing longer and getting lighter as his fingernails were already getting longer...</span></div></div>",

Andrew adjusted the face to that of a cute girl. Adjusting the personality Andrew made her shy, nerdy, geeky, perverted, he masked out libido and gave her a heavy Strange speech pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew felt a rock hard bonner in his pants thinking about meeting this girl. \u201cI should probably create what I actually want to look like and change my personality back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly two doctors walked in. \u201cHey wow, I\u2019m not done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had a certain amount of time to create what you want to look like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait no just give me a moment!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly grabs it from your hands, before Andrew could grab it back they grab him and drag him into another room as Andrew he kicked and screamed. They strap him into a chair and plug the device into a computer. They stick a needle hooked up to machine in his arms before placing headphones on his ears. Before he could say anything he saw a pink liquid enter him. He felt his eyes grow heavy as he closed them he fellow into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew awoke but he couldn\u2019t see anything, everything was blurry. He began to panick. \u201cMe no seee!\u201d He was confused by the way he was talking, not only did it not sound like his voice but the speech pattern was off. \u201cOh right I\u2019m that girl now,\u201d she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeelings the weight on her chest she looked down but all she could see was the color cyan. She raised her hand to her chest feeling a wave of pleasure shooting through her entire body. She felt a heat rising in her crotch. Thoughts of men fucking her immediately filled her head which turned her on to her own embarrassment. A blush rushed across her pale skinned face appeared as she moaned. She began to rub her wet hairless pussy making her let out high pitched moans. Her small dainty hands fingered her pussy making her moan as she orgasmed. She kept coming faster and faster orgasm after orgasm each causing ripples of pleasure throughout her body. As she did her other hand was exploring as much of her new body as it could. Her hand was small but it felt even smaller as she groped her breast and ass. Finally she let out the most intense orgasm yet it left her tired, panting, soaked pants and full of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly someone came the door. Her face immediately flushed she looked at who had just walked in. She could make out a figure in blue but jer vision was to blurry to see. Andrew\u2019s face immediately became flushed and she cover face with her hands. \u201dMe sowwy!\u201d Andrew was so embarrassed she was ashamed that this person caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour finally awake, I\u2019m nurse Higans. I\u2019ll be taking care of you right now. Don\u2019t be embarrassed, it\u2019s okay to be curious with a new body, not to mention those who undergo the gender draft are often have higher libidos than ordinary women and you maxed out your libido so with that your probably the horniest women in the world. So don\u2019t feel embarrassed about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew nodded \u201cwhy me talk weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s what you put in the personality section. Is that not you what you wanted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Me no want this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you should\u2019ve programmed what you actually look like. But it\u2019s ok many men program the women they\u2019ve always wanted to date instead of what they actually want to look like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse helped Andrew made adjust to her new body. She learned to put on a bra and change herself. She had picked a new name Xeniko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXeniko was given thick nerdy glasses that helped her see. was given an I-pad she started watching anime and watching analysis videos on them. She had become obsessed with anime and all things related.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now time for her to leave. She walked out of the facility wearing a thin sweater, black yoga pants that showed off her ass and uggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where nanites are infused into the subject carefully to match their new female body in a way that will work well for the patient and allow them to live the most product female life possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Code 13 is administered from a special pistol style weapon. It shoots a small non lethal projectile into the target administering the nanite serum directly into them. The problem is these nanites are simply pre programmed to give the victim a very sexy female body to insure they will be able to reproduce and level out the population numbers. It\u2019s a rough process and is very rough on the body.

She'd objected and protested the unfairness, the injustice, the whole mistake... She'd been introduced at the deep end to her new role in life. Her head literally held down as she learned her new place in saving society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was mortified, when she realised her face was cum smeared.

That something needed to be done to address, to reverse the situation. Emotionally, it was very different looking down at that envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just wasn't fair! He wanted to rage. Surely enough had been changed to avert this with him having to surrender<i> Lil' Andrew</i>. There were the changes in the law. Most sexual offences brought instant feminisation, and it was no longer three strikes and you're out. It was now, three strikes and you're a woman! There had been protests about this. Marches, rallies, decrying feminisation as not a punishment. The prisoners on death row, were reprieved. The most dangerous kept in prison, just now as women. But many, of the non-violent offenders were reassigned to help solve the new problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew didn't want to become a woman. He didn't want to be treated as if he ... she, were a criminal. His mind raced, as he considered his options. He could go on the run, become a draft dodger. There was some sympathy for those selected, but it wasn't universal. Many women despised men who fled their responsibilities. Infuriated by the assumptions they were escaping. There were additional penalties for law breakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew swallowed, if he had to become a woman, he didn't want to be a top-heavy, wide-hipped beauty, whose figure screamed out that she was one of the converted. Rapists ended up with the most extreme bodies, and a hormone boost. Their IQ's dampened down, as the libido was shot through the roof. Little more than breeders, they were rarely not pregnant. Passive, wide-eyed creatures, they were insecure and needy. Many men happy to tolerate their clingy demands for the arm-candy they could earn in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer it lay on the doormat, the worse the anticipation felt. With a shudder, he dipped down, and swept up his mobile. He needed a coffee this morning. Now more than ever! His fingers were careful not to even brush against the envelope, as if it were contagious, or touching it would make it somehow more real.</span></div></div>",

It felt like the longest drive in his life, even though the clinic was only 15 minutes away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside they sat quietly until two men lab coats appeared and called out Andrew\u2019s name. Claire stood up wanting to go to but the men shook their heads forcing her to wait out on the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings Andrew, I\u2019m Dr. Chase, this is Dr. Mathews.\u201d Dr. Chase said shaking his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow us.\u201d Dr. Mathews said as he led them into an examination room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room was a cold metal slab with straps on it. It looked like something out of a science fiction movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...so..We know you don\u2019t want to do this but there really isn\u2019t much option. So let\u2019s just get down to business okay? I need you to strip.\u201d Dr Chase said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the way?\u201d Andrew asked a bit more scared than he thought he would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Dr. Mathews said with a rather stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew reluctantly stripped down nude as he was instructed to sit on the metal slab. There he was laid down and strapped in so his arms and legs couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...Uh...do I get a say in anything or do you know what I\u2019ll end up looking like?\u201d Andrew asked getting more and more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. You will end up just a normal and average girl your age. Pretty normal and average features. It\u2019s less than 1% chance you have the bimbo mutation.\u201d Dr. Chase said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...the what?\u201d Andrew asked nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bimbo mutation. In rare cases sometimes another transformation happens shortly after the original hyper sexualizing the subject. However it\u2019s super rare. You shouldn\u2019t worry.\u201d Dr. Chase said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worries Andrew as he was ready to do this but Dr. Mathews was already preparing the anesthesia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Andrew, you will go to sleep and wind up a nice and normal girl.\u201d Dr. Mathews said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew was scared he didn\u2019t want this, but he had no choice. He saw the mask being put on his face as darkness took him as he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Chase was preparing a syringe full of clear liquid as Dr. Mathews looked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really hate lying like this...\u201d Dr Mathews said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...it\u2019s for his own benefit. If we told him the truth it would only cause panic.\u201d Dr. Chase said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure there is no other way?\u201d Dr. Mathews asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have our orders. New females changed after 18 have to be hyper sexualized. We will give him the lowest dose of the bimbo formula. It will keep his mind in tact but change his body and libido. He won\u2019t even change for another day or so after the original change. If he comes back we just say he had the rare one in a million mutation.\u201d Dr. Chase said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t like this. It feels wrong.\u201d Dr. Mathews said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...however our orders are clear....so stand aside.\u201d Dr. Chase said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Mathews reluctantly stepped aside as Dr. Chase administered the formula. </span></div></div>",

You struggle to keep your eye on the doctors as the drowsiness creeps up your body. You don't feel it, but your neck surrenders to the inevitable, as your head sinks backwards, giving you a fixed view of the ceiling and the lights. The colours fade from your vision, greying, then engulfed in a whirlpool of midnight blackness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the drug flow through your veins, it penetrates every organ in your body, every cell is immersed in the concoction. Even your breathing feels laboured, every breath an effort. It takes all your effort and concentration just on that, as the doctors go to work around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a vague awareness, that feels disconnected from your ears, but you pick up snatches of their conversation as you drowse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be popular....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she enjoys her new home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few laughs are mixed in with the conversation, and you don't like that... at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistantly you feel your body transform. It's unsettling in the extreme, feeling your flesh rebel against your will. Your chest getting flabbier and flabbier. Becoming so heavy, your breathing becomes a struggle again. Your eyelids are too heavy to lift to reveal the extent of the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, the drugs and the unfamiliarity make them feel more extreme. You feel them jiggle and shake as you're transported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey is noisy, almost painfully so. Puzzling out the source of the noise takes your drugged brain the entire flight. It's only the bumpy landing that confirms your guess work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dopey from the drugs, you originally thought it was a kindness to set the new women up away from their previous life. From the embarrassment of an open transition. But, now it feels cruel to rip you away from everything familiar, when even your body is proving to be untrustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat rushes into the plane, as the doors open, dry... desert dry, and you wonder how you'll adjust to Arizona, or wherever you've been brought. Eyelids still resisting your efforts to open, you make out some speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you guess it's speech, but the language is entirely unknown. It could still be Arizona, you tell yourself as a bleak joke. The trolley bed beneath you is wheeled through the building... airport?... and you hear more of that language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's still incomprehensible to you, but you pick up the tone. There's a worrying lustiness to the male voices, and a mix of pity, or envy from the female ones. Softly you whimper, as you feel some control return. A finger now able to twitch, and some toes respond to a command to wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat is still oppressive for the entire trip, and you hear a heavily accented, \"Welcome home...\" from a gruff voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of other female voices.... That'll take some adjusting '<i>other females</i>', just doesn't sit right. Once you see your new body, you'll have to adjust but at the moment it's still a blind assumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass into the shade, of you guess an umbrella. The babble of female voices surrounds you, and you feel the relief as their bodies block more of the Sun from warming you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey poke and tweak your vulnerable body, muttering to themselves. Their fingers exploring, caressing things that are now smooth, hips that are wide and full. You half gasp, half whimper as someone tugs sharply on one nipple. The rush of pain, tells you the damned thing is far more sensitive than you've ever experienced before. It also felt bigger, rounder... and further away. The sudden release made it bobble and dance before settling. You're certainly blessed, is your assumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sun shines through your eyelids, and the parasol. The stimulation causing you to blink, and moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout consciously willing it, your arm lands heavily across your face. Blocking out the painful brightness. The female voices drift back from you, as you struggle to fully wake. Each breath reminding you of the sloshing heavy chest holding you in place. Your other hand lying by your side resting against warm, smooth flesh.... Your warm, smooth flesh. It crosses your body, resting on your taut, tiny tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer to waking, you try to raise it to your face to your parched lips. The bouncing impact, the obstruction of your bust makes you want to mewl in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling yourself tilted forward, from lying flat, to a half-upright sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mumble a \"thank you...\" as a raw whisper through parched lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answers you in that same language, and you feel the chill touch of glass at your lips. Reflexively, you swallow the water as it's carefully poured into your mouth. Your throat bobs, and the glass is removed once you've emptied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel weak as a kitten. Your body aching from head to toe, hungry beyond belief. Finally, your eyelids start to respond. Opening a crack, your heavy head lolls forward, and your first vision is of a blurry cleavage... Your blurry cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft wailing, \"no...no...no...\" spills unbidden, but heartfelt from your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes snapping wide, the back of your scrawny arm wiped across them clears them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou erupt from the seat, the heat smashes into you like a hammer. Sending you to your knees. An outstretched hand waves away the assistance offered. It's the woman who gave you water. Your chest heaves, as you draw deep breaths one after another. Until you manage to get to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/fc/da/f3fcda6874923f7d258d284d47d2311d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/fc/da/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... safe to say, I've had a reaction.\" you mutter bitterly to yourself. The doctor's laughter now seeming appropriate, if cruel. A laugh you'd have joined if it wasn't yourself as the butt of the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you see it's only women that are nearby. The word 'harem' leaps from your subconscious, taking on a whole new significance and reality you'd never given it before. It's a garden surrounded by high walls, whether to keep voyeurs out, or you in... You shudder, in either case, it does both.</span></div></div>",

It's something you fantasised about as a man. A blow-job without the risk of accidentally brushing against teeth. The reality is terrifying.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For support, Andrew decided to take Claire to the clinic, though it did take her a good while to get ready, the rustle of clothes and light squealing emerging from her closet as she selected an outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imagebam.com/image/e8ab391348243892\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imagebam.com/image/e8ab391348...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never especially bothered Andrew before, the way she waggled her fingers and smiled at male pedestrians as he drove her \u2014 an arm around her dissolved her into a fit of giggles and kisses that drove away any observer\u2019s thoughts of winning her \u2014 but now it seemed a grave portent to Andrew, a picture of his future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a niche belief that slowly made its way into mainstream, with manifold studies on the topic, that, generally, there was a difference between the \u2018Serumed\u2019 and \u2018Naturals\u2019. Of course, anyone could see that former convicts were, er, far less academically gifted than either one of their feminine peers, but it would take a few well-placed questions to figure out that the lass at the bar with the low-cut blouse giggling at every clumsily-worded flirt was, more often than not, a former man, compared to their more conservatively-dressed counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it had been a constant rankle at the back of his mind, that the busty, outgoing, effusive, fashion-oriented, and more-than-a-little-ditzy Claire may have been\u2026 well, a man. Andrew had only asked once,  received an affirmative answer, then left it at that. He was far more loathe to broach the subject than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe now was the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Claire,\u201d Andrew started, carefully keeping his tone and gaze even. \u201cHow was it like for you.. um, beforehand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn uncomprehending vacant gaze was his answer, so he gave it another shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you like\u2026 before the serum?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire\u2019s face split into an open grin, and Andrew\u2019s stomach lurched. \u201cOh! You shoulda said so!\u201d A manicured finger probed her lip, and she gazed at the horizon for a tic. \u201cWell, I def\u2019nitly \u2018member being taller\u2026 less, uh, soft.\u201d She giggled mischievously at her own remark. \u201cAnd, um, I think I was learning something about\u2026\u201d Her nose wrinkled cutely in concentration as she sounded out the word: \u201cMye-crow-bye-oll-ohgy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short look at Claire\u2019s smile of triumph was enough to shatter Andrew\u2019s hopes. Sure, he loved Claire, and was planning on popping \u2018the question\u2019 a few years down the line, but, ending up like her?! That was far from ideal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire must\u2019ve seen some flicker of despair on Andrew\u2019s face, because she leaned over and held his hand tight, all the while cooing, \u201cOh, don\u2019t be sad, honey. I don\u2019t miss it much; cookin\u2019 an\u2019 cleanin\u2019s <i>soo</i> much more fun than all that reading!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew could definitely feel his face twist into a grimace, and apparently some semblance of realization wormed its way into Claire\u2019s thick skull. \u201cUh, and I\u2019m sure that they\u2019re just calling you \u2018bout a problem with your D an\u2019 A, after all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew stiffly nodded. That faint hope still shone in his heart: the ripped paper was nigh-illegible, save for the \u2018PRESENCE REQUESTED IMMEDIATELY\u2019 excerpt. One of his friends, John, had recieved a similar letter, and attended the clinic only for a quick handshake and a warm smile from the County Gender Director. There was still hope for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence hung in the car for a good bit, until Claire broke it with a \u201cHey, Drew, can I ask \u2018ya somethin\u2019? Like, if you\u2019re going to be a girl n\u2019 all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew rounded one of the last turns before the clinic and returned a numb, \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire squirmed guiltily before blurting out \u201cCouldyoumakemeyoursponsor, <i>pleeassee</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took in a big breath before continuing. \u201cSo, I \u2018member when they let me out, they told me that I could bring in someone and dire - deerec- choose their changes a bit? And, uh, even though you don\u2019t wanna be a girl and all \u2014 <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">which is kinda rude, I think</font> \u2014 I thought I could\u2026\u201d More animated squirming, that sent her prodigious bust sloshing, \u201cUh, make you my sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood drained from Andrew\u2019s face. \u201c<b>No</b>. Absolutely not.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pouted theatrically and clenched her tiny fists to the ample bulge in her blouse. \u201cAw, come on! We could be twinsies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew shook his head, lip curling in disgust. The idea of going around as a ditzy twin of his girlfriend was some kind of sick nightmare. Giggling at vapid soap operas together\u2026 Squealing in unison at trips to the strip mall together\u2026 Going to a <b>bar</b>. A shudder went down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019<i>mon</i>, Drew! I\u2019ll even tell \u2018em not to do all the brain stuff to ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew turned to her in surprise, nearly running through a red light in his fixation. \u201cY-you can do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire\u2019s usually-vacant smile had more of a catlike quality to it this time. \u201cMhmm. They said they\u2019d take all of my \u2018sug-jest-yuns\u2019 into \u2018count.\u201d Her smile brightened as she added, \u201cAnd I can still love you \u2018n stuff, just not in the, uh, sexy way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew ran his tongue around the edge of his lips as he pulled into the clinic. It was a tempting offer, to be sure. Sure, he might come out the other end the busty twin of his current lover, but at least he might be able to maintain some of his dignity. A bimbo in form alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, he had seen speeches given by some \u2018Serumed\u2019 where they had looked quite modest, and sounded quite astute. It all depended on the administrator, he supposed. Claire \u2014 or whatever her name might have been before \u2014 might just have gotten unlucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the car door, he decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Louder for Claire to hear, \"But we suggest, you do accept some feminine mannerisms, as part of your new change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" Claire agrees, \"They're fun... It's fun being a girly.\" She does  little excited bunny-hops on the spot. Her chest very mobile, heavy and eye-catching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if it makes me girly, like that.\" you mutter through gritted teeth to the scientist. Again, you receive a nod. Taking your arm, as if you were already transformed, he guided you around the lab. Claire was fascinated with a scene outside the window, so you're free to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't do that.\" he assures you, \"You can be as big a tomboy as you like, wear jeans and jogging outfits if you prefer. But the serum, will help you walk with wider hips, make you more comfortable with a womans' body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod along, there's nothing you object to. Since you're going to have to be a woman, you might as well have Claire as your slutty, bimbo sister. A companion into this scary future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning close, he confides a secret. \"Claire wasn't drafted.\" Looking around, he checked she was still fascinated by the man in the nearby park. \"Claire was punished. A <i>three strikes and you're a woman</i> case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you say comprehending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her changes were beyond her control. That's why her IQ has been simplified, and her body made so busty, and submissive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour was short, and as you circled around the lab, you wandered back towards where you could be overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't mind being a sister to Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not quite what you meant when you said, you didn't care how you looked. But, you give a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... That'll be cute.\" you answer, for her to hear. More quietly, \"Only if I'm a tomboy, and not submissive like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last minute thought occuring, \"I don't want to be busty like her either!\" you growl the last objection through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Claire picking up on the parts she liked, \"We can be sisters... like twinsies, and share clothes....\" she giggled, \"and boys... They're yummy too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's last observation made you queasy, still male, you don't relish finding boys yummy. That unfortunately is part of the deal, part of the draft. Hell, it's the whole point, so you grit your teeth, trying not to grind them, and give her a tight-lipped smile.</span></div></div>",

She's not happy, but soon her instincts kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGnawing seductively on one forefinger, she 'accidentally' catches herself. Before smiling apologetically to Dr. Chase, and Dr. Matthews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching, she starts sucking on her pinkie, playing with it, as it slips between her incredible lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can make you the woman you deserve to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a tight smile, even now those words feel like a threat.

Dr. Chase draws the thick, pink liquid into a syringe. As a tight-knit group, you enter the next room. A comfy sofa in the centre. Dr. Matthews gets you to stretch out on it, while his colleague prepares to inject you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle of anticipation comes from Claire, and you're glad you're not going to be one of those flighty, girly-girls. You couldn't imagine being as submissive and easily led as she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe needle surprises you, making you jump and hiss. More in surprise than pain. Looking to your arm, you see the mix enter your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's you committed now, the room seems to swim, and your head lolls back onto the sofa as your neck turns weak. The overhead lights are blinding, but even that fades too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the sense of time passing, and as you feel the chill in the air, you realise you're waking. It's an effort, like you're trying to surface from a deep dive. Air burning in your lungs, you work your arms and legs fighting to surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking with a groan, you hear the difference already. Eyes still closed, you concentrate solely on your breathing. You feel your chest rise and fall. A twitch at the corner of your mouth. Surely, they all feel too big on waking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9b/f0/0a/9bf00a803266a8822838c7ca1c7b5220.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9b/f0/0a/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes fluttering open, you take in Claire's excitement, as she bounces on her heels.

After you spit out a particularly stubborn strand of hair, you follow the two physicians\u2019 gaze downward and your flush reddens from embarrassment, rather than exertion. The shift-like fabric of the tank top has fallen away from your left tit, exposing nearly the entirety of the ballooning flesh. With haste, you grab the black fabric with a red-tipped hand \u2014 the damn quacks did your fingernails too! \u2014 and manage to drag it far enough to at least cover your areola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up is harder than before; you have to rest one toothpick-like arm on Claire to counterbalance your weighty prow, and another clenched firmly to your underbust to avoid giving the doctors any more free shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all\u2026 this?\u201d you snarl, gesturing to the entirety of your topheavy torso.

You\u2019re staring at Claire\u2019s deep cleavage and hiked-up skirt, a cold pit of terror growing in you at your lack of reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve requested, there was no direct alteration to your intellect,\u201d says Dr. Chase. You heave a sigh that\u2019s a lot harder to manage, what with your cow-tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you should settle to the Barbie baseline in about, hmm, a month or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze. A droplet of sweat falls from your chin and streaks a cold path on your breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Matthews blinks, his face befuddled. \u201cDid\u2026 you not read your draft letter? You <i>did</i> pick a convict Barbie for your sponsor; to expect <i>no</i> mental effects is\u2026 well\u2026 delusional.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestures at Claire, who has made herself busy with your new ID, twisting it back and forth to make the holographic Venus symbol flash a bright pink.

Males born were 75% of all new births. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 3 out of every 4 babies born being male the government had a crises on its hand and used all its resources to find a way for more females to be born. However after years of tireless research the best they could come up with was a serum that changes males into females. The problem is the serum only works on adults. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other options the government began what became known as the Gender Draft, or Gender Lottery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically any babies born after a certain date were entered into this lottery which starts at age 18 and goes until age 21. After 21 you are removed from the lottery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis program was designed to get the population as close to 50/50 males and females and possible. While successful this draft is hated by many who feel like their freedom is taken from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Andrew Wilson, and tomorrow is your 21st birthday.
