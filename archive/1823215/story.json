        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome, now let\u2019s get started, I\u2019m into the anime Soul Eater.  I do not own Soul Eater, its characters or any part of the franchise.  I do however own this interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nNo:<br>\r\nScat/pee/etc. (if it goes in the toilet, LEAVE IT OUT OF MY INTERACTIVE!),<br>\r\nUsing one of the soul eater character\u2019s as your character. Please, please, make your own character.<br>\r\nNo using stuff from other anime\u2019s; FOR EXAMPLE: Sasuke (I have nothing against him, but I\u2019m tired of seeing him in anime\u2019s where he doesn\u2019t belong), or using CHAOS like Shadow or Sonic, cause again, NOT from the Soul Eater universe.<br>\r\nFYI:    THIS ALSO INCLUDES KINGDOM HEARTS ( I love the series, almost addicted really, but I don\u2019t want to see a single key blade in this.  You can have your person\u2019s weapon form or their partner\u2019s weapon form to be something that looks like a key, but if you make it a key blade,  I WILL DELETE YOUR CHAPTER)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVore:<br>\r\nI will not allow any form of vore, except for soul vore, but you MUST use this one the way they use it in the anime. The only other exception I'll make is hard vore, and I mean like when a lion eats an antelope, tearing each lim off. Exceptions to these include snake characters (lamias, nagas, gorgons, etc.) who are allowed soft vore and possibly unbirth. (any one who does not obey this rule will have their chapter deleted WITHOUT mercy.) [i don't hate vore, I just want to keep this interactive wiithin the SE boundaries]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelationships:<br>\r\nRelationships are encouraged.  HOWEVER, I will not allow it go as far as characters having sex, alot of the guys in soul eater are known to be perverts so what think is entirely part of their character, if you do feel like you want to take it that far please only do a little, and don't go into detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChapter length:<br>\r\nI will allow for some short chapters, but if you make a short chapter that isn\u2019t for a continuous decision change, I WILL delete it.  Chapters must be at least 1 DECENT paragraph long.  Easiest way to do this, PROVIDE DETAIL.  The more detail you can provide, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no restrictions on gender so you can make them whatever gender you want<br>\r\nEX.  Male, female, herm (this is BOTH male and female genitals), etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther thing I will not give restrictions to is species. THOUGH if you 'God Mod' your character I will delete your submission.  No this doesn't mean no phoenixes, but you can't make your character one they. (Example of something allowed: naga/lamia, taurs, harpies, cyclops, ogres) [also worth mentioning I will allow your character to be an 'angel' or 'demon' but know that evil is evil and good is good, so no good demons and no evil angles, btw a fallen angle counts as a demon.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad grammar or spelling:<br>\r\nNO TEXT LANGUAGE!!!! (EX. For The Win, for the longest time I thought I meant Fuck The World)<br>\r\nANY TEXT LANGUAGE WILL EITHER BE DELETED OR FIXED, DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THERE IS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRequirements:<br>\r\nPlease watch the whole Soul Eater Series BEFORE starting this interactive, I will KNOW if you add something that was not mentioned in the Soul Eater series, and please keep in mind this interactive takes place AFTER the LAST episode in the series.<br>\r\nIf you CAN use English please do, if it\u2019s Basic English like if it\u2019s a second language to you, try your best and I\u2019ll help where I can as far as grammar and spelling.<br>\r\nAlso, if you choose to be a weapon, please provide a link to a picture of that character's weapon form(s)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOTHER THAN THAT:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGO WILD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Soul Eater belongs to Funimation.  \"You should be watching.\"<br>\r\n</td>",
