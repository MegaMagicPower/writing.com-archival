No Slytherin is going to hurt us! I live with one...two...\" he continued to mumble, \"Well a lot of Slytherins and they're harmless. We should just go ask him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn again to catch the green crest of Slytherin on his robes before he darted quickly to the side of the hallway.

You weren't expecting to make  a choice. You were much too busy watching that kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...

He jumped away, obviously quite upset. You made your way towards the boy. When he realized you were coming to began to back up, like an animal trapped in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KID! Are you follo....\" started Sirius with his fist out. You push him aside. Honestly, sometimes you couldn't understand what was up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is James Potter,\" you said as you extended your hand, \"and this is Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid snarled and slapped your hand away as his eyes stayed on Sirius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't shake hands with you conspirators or the traitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conspirators?\" Remus asked, interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traitor?\" Sirius said accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're up to...I know...\" the boy hissed, \"I'll catch you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me assure you that we are up to nothing at all and we are not conspirating or traiting... is traiting even a word?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot, you can't even speak your own language,\" the boy laughed and threw a potion at your feet. A small explosion occured when the small vial made contact with the ground. An unsettling need to itch your legs took you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rat!

And in so doing it improved the lives of James, Remus, Severus and Sirius, even allowing Severus to befriend these three, to make a true quartet of equals. In another world, they might have settled for a less loyal housemate, instead of inspiring a precocious young Slytherin to overcome his preconceptions long enough to bridge the divide between the rival houses.</span></div></div>",

Wouldn't that be great!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the poster wearily, and didn't like the shifty look on the man's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... um that's great!!\" you say, unwilling to draw her wrath. Not when you'd likely be in her house with her as a prefect. In fact, all the Blacks had been sorted into Slytherin, and you were expected to be sorted there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your life, mother had told you all sorts of things of how mudbloods were 'creatures of dirt.' You'd never seen one before, but at least you tried to pretend to agree with what your family said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, your other older sister, Narcissa, came skipping into the room, absolutely beaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never guess what happened!!\" she chittered. You rolled your eyes. \"What?\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucius asked me out on a date!!\" she squealed, swooning onto the seat next to Bellatrix. Your eldest sister began teasing her in that other language girls used, it pierced the ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you thought, the same thing was happening to Narcissa. You had hated it when Bellatrix had brought over that Lestrange jerk into your house last summer, He'd picked on you mercilessly and made you sleep outside while he used your room to do who knows what with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's what the evil @#$! deserves...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left fuming the rest of the way to the castle. Finally the train skidded to a stop, and you exited along with the other first years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked toward the side, and noticed Narcissa leaning indolently against a boy. Just as you suspected, he seemed the exact same sort that Lestrange guy had been. You hissed at her, and took a seat on a boat next to a thin boy with unkept black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, neither you, nor the boy next to you said a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the boy spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you excited about going to Hogwarts?\" he asked somewhat nervously. You sighed, \"Not really, all my family has been Slytherins, and they're expecting me to be the same\" you cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" he replies blankly.  He shuts his eyes tightly, as if debating whether talking with you might infect him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your name then?\" he wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black,\" you reply, \"Sirius Black.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy bites his teeth, before forcing a smile. \"Well, nice to meet you then Sirius, my names James Potter\" he replies, holding out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shot of alarm banged against your head, the Potter's were one of those wizarding families mother had described as 'blood traitors'. Yet he didn't seem so bad, and what did they know anyways? You weren't slaves to their will like Regulus was!! But you couldn't imagine what would happen if your sisters wrote to mom, telling her that you'd been interloping with the 'wrong sort'!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of doubt spread over you, should you shake his hand? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You strutted to your table and glanced over at the Slytherin table. The seething look of extreme hatred that contorted your sisters' already hideous face's was priceless. On the other hand, James was all but whooping in glee, pumping his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took quite a while for the hoopla to calm down, when the sorting continued. You cheered along with the other Gryffindors when a first year would be sorted into your house. So far, you had cheered Alice Chambers, Lily Evans, Frank Longbottom, this extremely pale Remus Lupin kid who somehow reminded you of a werewolf, followed by the rat-faced kid Peter Pettigrew, but you had cheered the loudest when James got sorted into Gryffindor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice going!! I knew you'd get sorted into Gryffindor!!\" you congratulated once he had taken a seat next to you.

He woke up from the dream expecting to be in his bed. No... instead he was in a train compartment. Now he rembered. <br>\r\n  As he sat up the compartment door opened. There in front of him was a boy with messy jet black hair and a boy by his side. <br>\r\n  \"James, James Potter, and your name,\" James said.<br>\r\n   \"Uh... Remus, Remus Lupin\" Remus repiled.<br>\r\n   \"This is Sirus and can we sit down. We tried to sit with Lily Evans but that girl has a bad temper.

I mean it is said there has never been a wizard who was not good. If you want everyone to hate you go ahead,\".<br>\r\n     Remus was shocked. His dad's cousin was not a bad preson. He acutally was always nice. He loved the way that Sirius and James were joking. Maybe he would like them after all.<br>\r\n      \" Remus do you want to be in ou group? It is a group were we pick on Snape. Who would like him any way? That kid needs a big make over,\" said James.<br>\r\n        Now Remus knew what they were doing they were going to play a trick on them. What was so wrong with Snape? He soon would find out.<br>\r\n        The plan was to play the make up jinx on Snape. Remus had to do it. Then they would pour butober pus all over Snape.<br>\r\n         He walked into the compartment with Snape in it. \" What are you doing here?\" asked Snape.

He looked like a girl. \"Better go and wash that of grease ball\" said Remus.<br>\r\n             The paln was going alright and they poured the green liquid on Snape. Huge boiles formed on his face. Snape got what he desevered.<br>\r\n               A teacher came up to them and told them to change into their robes. Remus did as he was told.

So what if he were a werewolf?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, a tall lanky teenager with red hair, with a 'P' on his chest approached the Gryffindor 1st years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings everyone, my name is Arthur Weasley and I will be escorting you all up to the Gryffindor Commons, if you would follow me\" he said. Remus and his fellow first years did; he seemed friendly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus was immediately entranced by the moving staircases and the talking pictures. His father had told him of how wonderous a place Hogwarts was, but it was entirely different seeing it in person. He was walking up the staircase when one of the steps dissappeared under him, causing him to trip over and fall. Laughs echoed through the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to want to watch for the trick steps, you'll do well to memorize them,\" said Arthur, also sounding somewhat amused. \"Though they do tend to change unexpectedly however\" he finished. Remus shrugged and got back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, they reached a portrait of a Fat Lady. \"Password?\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lapis Illuminati\" said Arthur, and the next moment, the portrait swung open to allow the 1st years through. When Remus ascended the staircase to the dormitory, he found all his stuff had already been taken up. James immediately sprawled himself onto bed, \"I can't wait until the term starts!! I'm really looking forward to Defense Against the Dark Arts!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus fancied himself a smile, it was a miracle that he even had the chance to come to Hogwarts. \"I heard Slughorn's a good teacher, though my father proclaims that he is a traitor to the Slytherin house\" said Sirius. James let out a chuckle, \"And what does that make you Sirius?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius rolled his eyes, \"Well, my mum and dad are going to be quite displeased to learn I ended up in Gryffindor,\" said Sirius, his voice containing a large measure of cynicism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say\" replied Remus, \"My father told me every member of the Black family has been Slytherins ever since Hogwarts was founded.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius gave Remus a sardonic looks, before bursting out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest with you,\" said short, mousy Peter, \"I'd have rather gone into Slytherin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius gave out a snort, \"And I also bet you that half the Slytherins that were sorted wish they were in Gryffindor, though I probably wouldn't be able to say that about Severus and Lucius, my father introduced me to them when I was little, I don't say I really like them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that greacy looking wretch and that pale kid?\" cried Remus. \"Yeah,\" bellowed Sirius, \"Narcissa absolutely fawns over Lucius, it's absolutely sickening, and Severus, who knows what's going through that kids mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite nice people you've gotten to know\" uttered James, \"I only hope your roomates are not quite as unpleasant\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something Remus had to agree with.

Hurry up!! It's not as if the IRA delivered them!!\" your sister Petunia shrieked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!!\" you responded in an artifically sweet tone. You walked back into the house. \"So, did Vernon write back to me!!\" Petunia cried, her eyes bulging from her gaunt face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, \"Yes that rhinocerous did\" you snapped, tossing her the letter. \"You just cannot accept the fact that I have such a handsome boyfriend!!\" she hissed, before storming away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stormed toward the family couch in the living room. Handsome? The only reason those two were together was because they were both possessed some magical power that broke whatever mirror they looked into!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, this made you pay super close attention to your mysterious letter from that Hogwarts place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou broke the seal with a letter cutter and read over the letter you received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Miss Evans:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The Hogwarts Express will leave on September first from platform 9 and 3/4 from King's Cross Station. Be sure to arrive no later than 9:00.  Term will begin September 1st and we will await your response by owl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbus Dumbledore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWitchcraft and Wizardry? That stuff was purely fantasy, yet there was something legitimate about the school listing that came with it that convinced you this wasn't one of Petunia's jokes. Besides, it souded like a highly prestigious school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you finished reading the letter, you were going to tell...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the Hogwarts of the past, here you can live out the school experiences of James Potter, Lily Evans, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin or Severus Snape. At this time, a young firebrand who goes by the self-styled nickname, 'Lord Voldemort' is recruiting members to join his Death Eaters. Yet school goes on as usual in this Hogwarts of 30 or so years before the present. Their decisions will greatly impact what is in store for the next generation of wizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Potter: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather of the boy who lived, James is much like his son, in that he is highly skilled in Quiddich, has a knack for breaking school rules, stands for justice, and an expert at practical magic use. He is generally well liked by his fellow Gryffindors, and is seen as a leader. That is, everyone except Lily Evans whom he loathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirius Black:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' partner in crime is a loyal friend whom would give his life for him. The first in his family ever to be sorted into Gryffindor, he is constantly at odds with his sisters, Bellatrix and Narcissa, and the rest of his family, all of whom were Slytherins. He views himself as different however, though he does possess a mean streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus Lupin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, it seemed like this shy, introverted boy would be unable to attend Hogwarts because of his 'illness', yet Dumbledore, recently appointed as the Headmaster of Hogwarts, made special arrangements for him. Nonetheless, he is afraid that others will find out whom he really is, and naturally avoids others. It could also be the fact he is picked on mercillessly by Slytherins, most notoriously Lucius Malfoy and his gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily Evans:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been pleasantly surprised upon receiving an invitation to attend Hogwarts, but quickly made up for lost time with steady reading. Not surprisingly, she has a high affinity for academics, and is a stickler for rules. She absolutely abhors the antics of James and his band of hooligans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeverus Snape:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as a boy, the young Snape already possessed an alarming knowledge of the dark arts and a mad lust for potion making. It is all 'that creepy kid with the greacy hair' does in his spare time, at least when he isn't spying on James' gang, whom he claims are trying to take over the school. Not even Slytherins would dare speak with him, for Snape sees enemies everywhere.
