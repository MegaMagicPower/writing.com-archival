He's changed a lot this year; and in his eyes for the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately his football team had to stop because they couldn't find a coach, but that didn't matter. Besides it meant Rob could spend weekends chilling instead of working out and training for football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob's got blue eyes, dark blond hair and has a reasonably athletic body, about 170lbs which is 4 more than he was when he played football though it doesn't show on his 5'11'' body, yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, the more Rob though about it, the more he loved the thought of spending this summer just lounging around, partying and just generally enjoying himself! For the year he had managed to have a dorm room to himself, but he had recently received a letter from the dorm manager that a transfer student from another college would be moving to join Rob's college and so would be sharing the same room as Rob, with his permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob is a friendly lad, and has no problem at all in accepting a new room mate. In fact, he buys some party food so that they can get to know each other with a bit of a party feel to the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour before the new room mate is set to arrive, Rob gets changed. He wears his favorite jeans, but they're a little bit tight. Rob's about to look over in the mirror to see why, but there's a knock at the door. His new room mate, called Adam (Ad for short), is early. He gives the mirror a miss and eating a crisp on the way goes to meet his new room mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens, and Rob meets Ad for the first time. He is about the same height, but with dark hair. He is also . . .</span></div></div>",

His eyes light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What a welcome' he begins, 'I'm Ad. This is amazing! Though really I shouldn't! All i've done recently is eat and party, and what with not playing football this year I should change my lifestyle.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ad, I know how you feel. I mean I used to play football too until this year, and the college life has got me hooked too! But you've gotta remember we ARE college lads, and this is what we do! Now grab yourself a beer and a burger, we've got the whole summer to relax!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'With that attitude I can tell we're going to get on! But can I unpack first dude?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob has no objection and Ad unpacks all his things and gets used to his new pad. He drinks a fair few beers and has a good chat with Rob whilst doing it. They are both the same height and build and have a lot in common!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour they start on the food. The time flies by and after 30 minutes of talking, drinking, eating and having a good time, they realize . . .</span></div></div>",

I wasn't even as if Rob was even chubby, he was slim + 4lbs he had gained recently from his more relaxed lifestyle. He looked down at his t-shirt, which was maybe a little small but nothing too drastic, and decided to spark the fire a little bit. He whips off his t-shirt and sits their eating his 3rd pizza and on his 7th beer, shirtless, and just letting himself relax and not worry about a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAd had been relieving himself in the toilet at the time, and wasn't expecting the view he got. Rob was sat their, with his small jeans looking a little snug on his thighs and waist; pizza in on hand beer in the other, and as bloated as ever. His small roll of chub just crested his belt which was undone and slightly pressured into his small stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'WOAHH' begins Ad 'CHILL OUT WITH THE FOOD BIG MAN!' He yells. Rob ignores this and carries on, on purpose, with his food fest. Ad watches in amazement as Rob finishes off the last food and beer in the dorm and lets out a huge burp to compliment it all. Rob knew that what Ad says in the next 5 minutes will determine whether he will get Ad to gain weight without him knowing or not. Rob acts drunk and Ad being a half decent lad helps Rob to his bed. He lifts Rob up over his shoulder and comments on his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How heavy do you want to be chubbs' he says, 'I mean look at this!' He squeezes Robs small belly, which despite being bloated is still slightly soft. 'Mate, your going to be a bad influence on me!' Ad lifts Ad into his bed and leaves to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the key Rob needed, hearing Ad almost admit he might gain a little weight without wanting to by living with him, was more than enough for Rob. He was going to let Ad feel what it felt like to be the butt of the gain jokes. But how should he do it?</span></div></div>",

Rob opened his laptop and searched online for weight gain powder and after some research, he found exactly what he was looking for...<br>\r\nThe powder arrived two days later and as soon as it arrived Rob promptly dumped the old Muscle Maintain powder in the bin and replaced it with the Weight Gain Powder, -that luckily had been the same exact colour.

Josh sat down with a plate of steamed vegetables, rice and a breast of grilled chicken, which he'd done on the George Forman grill his dad had bought him as a going-away-to-college present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude,\" Rob said, between bites.  \"When you said you wanted to keep your figure, I didn't think you were on a diet.  You gotta live a little.

He had a perfect set of 8-pack abs, sitting below an ample pair of pecs that jutted just perfectly out from his torso, shoulders that just begged to be massaged, and of course those amazing biceps that lived inside his tanned, paper-thin flesh, jumping every once in a while with the little movements that come from being human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" he said.  \"I showed you what I've got.

He was a football star, who all the girls adored, and a little partying this year wouldn't change any of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, get a load of this, stud!\"  With that, the shirt was off, and the damage done to his body was revealed.  He still had remnants of his old body, with good strong shoulders and a half-decent set of pecs.  It was clear, though, that his body was starting to go.  His pecs, reasonably impressive though they were, were starting to sag a little, and his arms appeared softer and less defined than they would have been if he had been playing football regularly.  Nowhere was his laziness more apparent than his waist, however.  His jeans clearly gave away the roll of flab that was starting to make its way there, just enough to sit about an inch over the waistband, and he was starting to get flabby around the love handles.  His six-pack abs, which had stood out proudly only a few months before, were buried under this new layer of fat, with little hope of being able to surface again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed.  This guy was obviously in denial, or else just hadn't been paying attention to the way his body was going to pot.  He'd seen friends go through this before, in fact, one guy had been a model before he got fat from all the partying that came with his profession.  \"Have you taken a good look at yourself lately, Rob?\" asked Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a mirror around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there's one in my room.\"  Rob led the way, feeling rather suspicious of what was going on.  Rob was actually a little afraid of what he might see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look in the mirror, and tell me what you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see me,\" said Rob, as he looked at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look carefully,\" said Josh, moving a little closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob thought about it, not knowing what he was looking for.  And then it hit him.  His jeans had been tight when he put them on, and he didn't know why.  He hadn't had a chance to look.  Now he could see, and he was shocked.  He pinched the roll of flab at his waistline, and said....</span></div></div>",

You've probably had it easy your whole life too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true,\" Josh said, calmly, as he moved closer to the sobbing Rob.  \"Look, I haven't told too many people this, but I used to be incredibly obese.  When I was fourteen, I was around three hundred pounds and climbing.  I'd eat fatty foods all day long.  I couldn't stop myself.  I actually had an addiction to food.  My parents put me on a diet and got me exercising around that time, and it took me three years to finally get a hold of these puppies.\"  He patted his abs.  \"That's why I was so concerned when you sat down to eat all that food.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Come on!  One more rep!\"  Josh was encouraging Rob.  They were on the bench press, and Rob was pressing 175, a full 25 lbs. below his normal maximum.  Josh was spotting him, and doing a great job of it, too.  Josh could see that Rob was struggling, so he put his fingers under the bar, ever so gently.  This gave Rob just enough lift to be able to complete the rep.  His arms jerked upward, and Josh took the bar and placed it back in the rack.  Rob just lay there, out of breath, sweating through his T-Shirt, his face purple and vein-ridden with the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Rob, panting.  \"I didn't realize I was that bad off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man, this is just a starting point, and 175 is nothing to sneeze at.  Most guys can't even do 100.  You'll be pushing over 200 in no time.\"  Josh clapped Rob on the shoulder, then reached out with his other hand to help him up off the bench.  Rob took his hand and, with a slightly pained grunt, he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh clapped his hands together and, grinning, said \"All right, my turn!  Load about 270 on there!  That's my warmup weight.\"  Josh winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood God, thought Rob.  That's 90 pounds more than the guy weighs!  And he says that's his warmup weight???  Rob didn't believe him, but he loaded the weight on anyway.  He wanted to see just how fit his buff new roommate and now trainer really was.  Rob loaded up the bar (the plates felt a little heavier than he remembered, particularly in the case of the 45s, though he was still able to manage them), and Josh laid down on the bench, his rock-hard pecs moving hypnotically up and down as he took a few breaths before beginning.  He lifted the bar off the weight rack and brought it right down to his nipples in a perfect, fluid motion.  Before Rob knew it, the bar was in the air again.  Josh did ten perfect reps like that before putting the bar back on the rack.  With every rep, Rob watched in awe as Josh's magnificent pecs flexed with every movement, squeezing inward with the upward motion of the bar.  When Josh was done, he sat up and looked at Rob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asked, and Rob realized that he was staring at his roommate, slackjawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, nothing, I've just never lifted that much before in my life.  And you're only ten pounds heavier than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong, little buddy, six pounds heavier than you,\" Josh winked at his roommate.  \"Remember you have this\" he poked Rob in the gut \"now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Rob exclaimed as he reflexively took a step back.  Josh just laughed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, little buddy.  We'll turn that pudge into something more like this\" he flexed his pecs \"in no time.  You used to be in shape.  You'll have muscle memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob smiled and said \"All right, meathead.  If that's your 'warm-up' weight, let's see you pump some real iron.  How does 290 sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled and nodded.  He got down on the bench again.  When Rob had put the new plates on, he did ten more perfect reps, though Rob could see he he had to work a bit harder at it this time, noting the decreased speed at which the reps were performed.  For Josh's third set, Rob added another 10 lbs onto the rack, for a total of 300 lbs.  Josh got through the first seven all right, but then his pecs started to fail, and he called for a spot.  Rob put his fingers under the bar, just gently enough to give Josh some support.  Josh pushed upwards, finishing the seventh one.  He seemed to hesitate for a moment, looking unsure whether he wanted to put the bar down on the rack or keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, meathead.  You can do it,\" said Rob.  He looked Josh right in the eyes as he said this.  \"Show me what real muscle can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh grinned through his efforts and brought the bar back down to his chest, Rob supporting the bar the whole time with his fingers.  He pushed back up again, straining with the effort.  Rob was glad he had worn his loose workout shorts.  The sight of Josh's massive pecs pumped full of blood was enough to send blood to one particular part of Rob's anatomy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one more to go.  Josh pressed the bar down again, and then pushed, slowly but surely, upwards using all of the strength his barrel chest contained.  He stopped about halfway up, and looked almost as if he was about to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" said Rob.  \"I've seen you push this bar nine times.  You can do one more.  You're not copping out yet.  Push it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it took.  Josh summoned a store of strength that could only have come from sheer determination, and pushed the bar swiftly up to its maximum height.  Rob quickly took the bar and guided it onto the rack.  Damn, that thing's heavy, he thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was lying there, catching his breath, his massive chest heaving as he did so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Josh breathed.  \"I've never been able to get through a full set at that weight.  You're a good spotter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Rob said, though his eyes were on his roommate's pecs the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waved a hand nonchalantly in front of Rob's face.  Rob snapped up and looked at the model before him.  \"Come on, doughboy.  Let's do some incline presses next.\"  Josh headed off to the dumbbell rack, but before he did, Rob was sure he gave him the slightest wink that didn't seem altogether innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Rob was lying, sore as all hell, on the couch in the dorm.  Josh was in the kitchen, getting some food together for them (healthy food this time).  Despite the soreness, though, Rob was stoked!  He couldn't wait for the next time he got to work out with Josh!  Even taking into account Rob's least favourite part, running on the treadmill, which Josh made him do for a minimum of 20 minutes to burn the layer of goo that had settled in around his once tight abs, he wanted to go back to the gym the next day.  That, and they had only worked chest and back that day.  He wanted to see how much Josh could curl with those arms....</span></div></div>",

Then he wouldn't have anything to brag about.  The very thought of his chiseled abs softening and expanding until they were hopelessly covered by a giant belly of fat made Rob meliciously giddy.  He knew he had to make it happen.  At the same time, he would watch his own weight, and when the time was right, he would reveal an amazing body and laugh openly at Josh, the former stud, and his horribly obese body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weekend, Josh went to visit his uncle in another city, so he wasn't around.  Rob set to work quickly.  He bought some weight gain powder from the local health food store, as well as some appetite stimulant and sleep inducer.  That way, Josh would be taking in more calories through his supplements and his intake of food, while also being too lethargic to work out.  He replaced Josh's protein powder supplement with the weight gain powder (luckily they were the same colour), and shot Josh's food full of appetite stimulant.  He put the sleep inducer into Josh's milk.  Rob couldn't wait for all this to start taking its toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Monday....</span></div></div>",

With a physique like yours it's your right to point out the deficiencies in others.\" Rob said, but his thoughts said defferently. &lt;enjoy the food&gt; Rob thought, &lt;Soon YOU will be the one whose the butt of MY jokes!&gt;<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     They both entered the kitchen and the table was laid. \"Wow, thanks Rob, you're a real pal!\" Said Josh as his stomache rumbled loudly. \"Well I guess that means it's time to eat!\" Said Josh with a big smile on his face. &lt;Yeah, keep smiling&gt; thought Rob. Josh began to did in, but so did Rob. &lt;The beauty was,&gt; thought Rob, &lt;Since Josh liked the \"healthy\" food, all the stuff on his side was spiked! He wouldn't even give a second thought to why I am eating different food than him!&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Josh noisly inhaled his food and drink. All the while Rob was smiling inwardly. In a short amount of time Josh had inhaled all his food. Staring miserably at his plate his belly rumbled, for he was still hungry! \"Uh, Rob you didn't happen to make more of my food did you?\" &lt;Must act surprised!&gt; thought Rob. \"Well actually yes I did, I thought you would be extra hungry from jetlag.\" replied Rob plausibly. Loading up Josh's plate with ALL the extra food he make for him. Josh quickly set to work on this! While Josh was stuffing his face Rob prepared Josh's \"healthy\" parfait dessert. Really it was loaded with sleeping drugs and digestive aiders. Rob used a glass two times larger than the one he thought Josh would have used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Just as Rob finished putting all the layers of Josh's dessert he found that Josh was already done his extra helping. \"Dude,\" he said eying the parfait \"I hope that's mine!\" It is Josh, say, did you like the way I made your meal?\" asked Rob innocently. \"Yeah, it was great dude.\" said Josh as he started work on the parfait. \"Well it's more convinient for me when I make my dinner to make yours as well, is that okay?\" asked Rob, hoping for a yes. \"Sure that sounds great!\" said Josh halfway done the parfait. Rob noticed how taught Josh's abs were, straining to hold back all the food Josh had just eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rob just watched as Josh spooned in the last half of the parfait. The dopey look in Josh's eye told Rob the sedatives were working. As Josh finished, face flushed from the effort of stuffing so much food into his shrunken bell, he said: \"Wow Rob, you really outdid yourself, if I keep eating like this I'll get even fatter than you!\" He said jokingly. Josh, struggled to rise from the chair but managed to waddle to his bed and lie down, fast asleep. Seeing Josh's round gut and the abs holding in his bloated stomache slowly dissapearing from the digesting food, Rob found the thought of it thurning him on. \"That's the plan Josh, that's the plan\" whispered Rob quietly as, surprisingly ,he gave Josh a short, but plesureable belly rub. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
