Cities rise to dominate the skyline in all corners of our fair land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as I'm sure you all know, we are far from perfect. Far, far from perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it be war or internal strife, I'm sure we would all agree on the fact that America hasn't made the best choices in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven today, we are threatened by choices we've made in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat am I speaking of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWar? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPolitical Corruption?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnarchy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite. If you would do me the honor, my dear reader, look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf today's health experts are correct in their assumptions, and if you are like many Americans today, then you will have just seen your stomach -but not as toned as it used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that's it, my dear audience. The choices that threaten us today are choices regarding food in a society where food is more than abundant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words, we're getting fat. Maybe you've even noticed this metamorphosis that is apparently sweeping the nation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a friend of yours has put on weight recently, having been a beanpole all his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the lifeguard that was completely ripped at the beach last summer now sports a gut from partying too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the quarterback on your high school's football team suffered an injury and outgrew his uniform while recuperating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps it's even you that's put on the weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter which angle you look at the situation from, the facts remain the same: pants are getting tighter, bellies are getting bigger, and the numbers on the scale are going up nationwide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as we speak, a tale begins to unwing in a small town in Tennessee...another in lively seaside retreat in California...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you so wish, other tales are writing themselves in other places, and you can transport yourselves there with but a click...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ah, you wish to hear of a tale that is taking place in the country! A good choice indeed! Our story begins on a small country road, with few cars traversing it. Fields or corn, beans, or other vegatables line both sides of the road. In the distance, small clusters of buildings disrupt the sea of produce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZooming in on one of the few vehicles making its way down the highway, an old, white van, speckled with dirt from travel, takes shape in our mind's eye. At the steering wheel, a middle-aged woman of flaxen hair eyes the road ahead carefully. For her age, she is beautiful, and several deep emotions can be seen within her deep, blue eyes. Like most middle-aged women, she is no Athena, but neither is she overweight. Taking her eyes off the road for a split second, she glances in her rear view mirror to steal a glance of another of the van's passengers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis passenger, for whatever reason, sits in one of the seats further back in the van despite the availability of the front-most passenger seat. He is young, perhaps sixteen or seventeen at the most. Like the van's driver, he is blond, but more of a honey blond, whereas the lady driving has hair the shade of platinum blonde and his hair falls just short of his eyes. He is fairly short, coming to perhaps 5'4\" or 5'5\", and his lithe form denotes his physical fitness. His stance, one that consists of glaring hotly at the passing vegatables, is firm, and yet his features are fair; most people would define him as cute or hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver and passenger of the white van are both silent. A tense atomosphere rules. This, my dear readers, is where our story begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = <br>\r\n <br>\r\nChris sighed, glaring out the window as his mom's van hit another bump in the road. Glancing down to his black iPod, he shifted through a few songs before finding one that he liked. Smiling slightly as a Rascal Flats song began to play, he shifted back into his stoic position of observing the scenery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sigh, this time coming from the driver's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christopher, honey, you've been like this since we left Atlanta. Don't you think it's time to give it a rest?\" Brenda Jacobs, formerly Brenada Jones, asked her son worriedly as she glanced at him through her rear-view mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris's response to his mother's question was to increase the volume on his iPod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda sighed again, this time more heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christopher, you know that you brooding won't change the fact that I married Rob, don't you?\" Brenda asked her son again, and to her relief, this time the music stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean I have to like any of it.\" Chris mumbled. He then threw his iPod into the adjacent seat, suddenly tired of any and all music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's not to like?\" his mom asked, exasperation evident in her voice. \"Rob's a great guy, he's got a good job, a big house, and Stephen's always been friendly towards you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob and Stephen,\" Chris started, referring to his stepfather and stepbrother, \"are idiots. And you forget the fact that they live in the middle of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I admit that Sheridan isn't the most...populated town in Tennessee...\" Brenda responded, slowing down as they entered the city limits of the town called Sheridan. \"Nor does it have the greatest shopping...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could probably break the telephone book in half.\" Christopher retorted, rolling his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may...\" his mother paused momentarily to glance at a sign on the side of the road. \"This is a new beginning for us, Chris. I know you miss your father. So do I, but no amount of us wishing will bring him back from the dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd back in Atlanta, we were both drowning. Neither of us hardly got to spend time with the other, you were getting into trouble at school, and I was working, what? Twelve hours a day just for that cramped little apartment? We were lucky that I met Rob when I did. You know that he's never done anything to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW, Mom.\" Chris suddenly erupted, before sighing heavily. His right hand found it's way up to his right ear, and he fingered a diamond earring, a habit he always lapsed into whenever he was nervous, embarrassed, or frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all of that...it's just a lot to go through at once. Give me some time.\" Chris mumbled, idly reaching over to the deat next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda was about to reply when the sound of music sprang up again. Glancing back through her mirror, she saw that Chris had resumed listening to his iPod, and had also reclaimed his stlawart stance of gazing out the window indifferently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda held in the urge to sigh, and a slight smile graced her features, making her appear to be years younger than she actually was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all these years, you're still my baby...,\" Brenda thought fondly of her rambunctious child. \"I'll give you time, Chris, I'll give you time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming the door to his mom's van shut, Chris stretched his limbs and resisted yawning. It had sure taken long enough, the drive to get to this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he and his mom had had their \"talk\", as his mom would call it, he had resumed listening to hi iPod, and had turned to observing the landscape of what was to become his new home town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he had thought, Sheridan hosted only the bare minimum and nothing more; a hardware store here, a small supermarket there, and row upon row of white-washed or brick houses, all with perfectly manicured lawns that had seemed to sport at least one lawn knome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been surprised when he had seen a movie theater, and had actually looked up to scrutinize the building that had to have been the high school he would be attending; a town like Sheridan couldn't have more than one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't ten minutes later that he and his mother had arrived, much to his loathing, at their new place of residence. As Chris now stared up at where he would be living, he had to honestly admit that Rob actually DID have a nice house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a red brick house, two stories tall with several windows on both stories, and Chris surmised that it was an older house, like many of the other houses in Sheridan. It was located on a lane on the outskirts of Sheridan, actually, and a large farm populated by growing vegatables of some sort or another was actually located directly across the road. If he squinted, Chris could actually see the farmhouse -a quaint, cabin-like establisment nestled in the shade of a forest on the far side of the farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brenda! Chris! You made it! How was the drive?\" a voice suddenly pierced Chris's thoughts and, shuddering, he turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob, or Robert Jacobs, his new stepfather, was a friendly man, he grudgingly supposed. Rob and his mom had met, not quite two years ago, when Rob had been visiting Atlanta on business (Apparently, Rob was the manager of a Sheridan area branch of an Atlanta-based company.) Unlike he or his mother, Rob had a deep reddish-brown hair color that had faded somewhat with age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris scrutinized his stepfather as he met his mother in an embrace, a bulge straining the lower portion of Rob's plaid button up shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite the stories his mom had told him of Rob being on the football team when he was younger, the Rob of the present was no such athlete; any muscles he had once had had given way to a considerable belly and meaty limbs. His mother had also told him that Rob was a wonderful chef. Such was probably the reason why Rob now found himself as heavy as he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFixing brown eyes onto him, Chris flinched, but was not spared as Rob strided over to his own small form and gripped him within a bear hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris! How's it going? How was the drive from Atlanta?\" Rob asked with a chuckle, his belly shaking as he patted Chris on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long.\" Chris replied tersely, straigtening his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive had indeed been long; he and his mother had actually left yesterday to get a head start on the long drive and had spent the night in a hotel along the way. Head starts aside, it had still taken them most of the day, and it was only now, at sunset, that they had arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha...I'd say it was...but you're here know and that's what matters.\" Rob said with another laugh. \"Stephen's inside if you want him to give you a tour of the house while I help your Mom with some of the stuff in the van.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Rob's prompt to go and meet with his wonderful new stepbrother, Chris, iPod still in hand, sauntered into his new place of residence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of the house, Chris thought, was surprisngly modern compared to it's exterior. The living room, which was just off the anteroom the dront door opened into, was large and dominated by a comfortable looking leather sofa and a pair of matching leather recliners. A big screen television, while nothing fancy, was in one corner, while a streamlined, black stereo was in another. A large bay window let the dying rays of the sun in to coat the room in varying shades of orange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he hear...music? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, now that he had noticed it, Chris was sure that he heard music coming from somewhere inside the house. As he wandered through the house, Chris realized that said music was of the Country genre, and what was more, that it was a Rascal Flats song. Eventually, his wanderings led him to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen, Chris noted, was far more plain than the living room had been. The walls were a simple white and without embellishments, the cabinets a pale and faded green. In one corner set a well-used set of table and chairs and the wooden floor seemed ancient as it creaked beneath his weight. The source of the music, Chris found, was coming from a radio placed on top of the microwave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris! You're finally here! How's it goin', man?\" a voice asked quite suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris shuddered, surprised for the second time that evening by what ke knew to be members of his new family. Turning towards the voice, Chris saw Stephen, his stepbrtoher, who had apparently been hidden behind the refrigerator door, which had been open. As Stephen came towards his stepbrother, Chris blanched and saw that his stepbrother was clothed in only a pair of boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike his father, Stephen had the same reddish-brown hair as well as the same blue eyes, and while Stephen wasn't heavyset like his father, his frame was definately one that said \"well-fed\" in how his stepbrother's stomach pooched over the seam of his boxers in a slight belly and in how his chest was not muscular but instead soft with the slightest bit of fat. His face was a bright one, one that was handsome in a gentle way and appeared to be made for laughter. To Chris's dismay, Stephen was also taller than he was, but then again; a lot of people were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling slightly and rubbing the back of his head, Stephen blushed slightly at his half-nude form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about my lack of clothes, I was just washing my car out back and I got a little wet. You caught me grabbing a quick snack right before heading up to change.\" Stephen chimed as he went over to close the refreigerator door, a sandwich clutched in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his stepbrother's explanation on his lack of clothes, Chris eyed the radio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you liked country music.\" Chris offered, changing the subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! But really, how could any citizen of Tennessee NOT love country music? Rascal Flats especially.\" Stephen replied mid-bite as he wiped away a drop of mayonaisse that had fallen onto his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Chris's opinion of Stephen went up slightly; he hadn't known that he and his stepbrother had similar music tastes. In the past, Stephen had always struck him as more of a Guns N' Roses type of person, while Chris himself was more of a Simple Plan guy. Apparently, in the past they had both somehow skipped noticing that they both had interest in at least one genre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your Dad told me to get a tour of the house from you...?\" Chris offered after a few moments of silence, deciding that he still didn't like Stephen. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, Chris rocked back and forth in a rocking chair on the porch. Stephen had given him the tour just half an hour earlier; in all honesty, not much had been left. He had examined the living room and kitchen beforehand, so all that had been left were the formal dining room, the bedrooms (His own bedroom a convert of what had been a guest bedroom), and the bathrooms. Following the tour, Stpehen finally left Chris to put some clothes on, and Chris himself had wandered back outside and sat down on the porch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had glared at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowed by the rows of vegatable across the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowed by the porch railing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowed by the sky again until he had ran out of items to glare at and tired of glaring in general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocking back and forth in the rocking chair, Chris's whole wolrd at the moment consisted of the repetative sounds of the rocking chair slowly moving back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack and forth....back and forth....back and forth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris stood up and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe a walk,' Chris thought as he came off of the porch and began to round the side of the house. 'Stephen did say he was washing his car out back. I wonder what kind he has?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly picturing Stephen driving down the road, Chris laughed outloud, and was about to turn the corner when-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething hit Chris hard in the back of the head and he stumbled. Swearing, Chris looked towards the ground to identify the offending object. A football stared up at him innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking it up, Chris raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, dude! I didn't think in a million years that that was gonna hit you but it did! My bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Chris saw two figures jogging towards him from the next house over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first, the one who had spoken, smiled at him in apology, and Chris knew at once he must be a football player at Sheridan High School. Like Stephen, this newcomer was also shirtless, dressed in only a pair of faded jean shorts. But unlike his stepbrother, he displayed the toned arm, leg, and chest muscles of a football player dedicated to weightlifting. Blond, curly locks swayed slightly and blue eyes shone with mirth as Mr. Football came to a stop. Sweat shone on his bare chest and stomach, and in the light of sunset, he looked every part of the Baywatch lifeguard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris snorted. Typical jock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, at least it didn't go through a window, right?\" the blond asked with a smirk and extended a hand. \"Name's Lukas Campbell. I'm gonna guess you're Stephen's new stepbrother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky you. Guy's a laugh riot at parties. Oh! This is my own little brother, Baylen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to the second figure (Who, Chris noted, was fully clothed), Lukas gave his little brother a quick noogie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike his elder brother, Baylen was far from being Baywatch material; where his brother was toned, he was lanky and slim, and instead of curly blond hair, this younger brother's hair was straight. Perhaps the one similarity the two shared, other than both of them being blonds, was the fact that they both had blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a freshman this year, the brat.\" Lukas said with a smile. \"Of course he's gotta get pumped up if he wants to replace me two year from now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas then flexed his right bicep, and by the expression on his face, Chris guessed that Baylen was resisting the urge to roll his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. We're in the same class then, I think. Juniors?\" Chris asked, picking up the forgotten football and handing it back, and to his relief, Lukas came out of \"Big Brother Mode\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! We are!\" Lukas exclaimed, clapping Chris on the back. \"Sheridan High's a great place; everyone gets to know each other. You'll like it, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, with a wave of his hand, Lukas was bounding back towards his own yard. Lingering behind, Baylen offered him a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind my brother; he's an egocentric football fanatic, but he's a good person. Most od the time.\" Baylen said with a shrug. \"And it was nice meeting you by the way! We'll probably see you tomorrow at school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, the younger Campbell brother jogged off as well. Idly, Chris massaged the spot where the football had collided with his head with a hiss. Well, THAT had definately been a change of pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. I see you've met the Campbell brothers. They're quite the characters aren't they?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sighed. Another new person? Already? Were Stephen Jacobs's new stepfamily that much of an upset in this small town?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, nice to meet you. Yes, I'm Chris Jones, Stephen's new stepbrother, and no I DON'T like Sheridan. And nothing you can say or do will make me change my mind!\" Chris shouted and turned in a huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at him was a startled brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...it's nice to meet you too then. I'm Adam, I live at the farm across the road. I thought I'd bring you some veggies in welcome.\" Adam said with a chuckle, holding up a basket filled with some tomatoes, green beans, and corn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...thanks. That's...nice of you.\" he muttered and breathed in deeply. \"Sorry about that...it's been a long day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, it's understandable. Sheridan's quite a ways from Atlanta after all, and not nearly as flashy.\" Adam responded,running a hand through his wavy, brown hair and Chris stared. \"Stephen and I are pretty good friends. He told me where you were from.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Adam in, Chris saw that, like Lukas, he was physically built, but from years of working on a farm. His face was kind and cheerful, and Adam's hair and eye color were both brown. He had on a dusty tank top that left little to thought and a old pair of faded jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Chris replied. \"I can't say that I really know my stepbrother yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing melodically, Adam handed the basket of vegetables over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's...a unique individual. Went through a hard time back when his Momma died. Believe it or not, he was actually looking forward to to you all joining his family.\" Adam explained, and Chris realized that the farmer was subtly advising him to treat his friend well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...never told me that.\" Chris said meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now you know.\" Adam said with a grin and began to walk off. \"Was nice meetin' you! We'll see each other tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Adam as he crossed the road and began the walk back to the farmhouse that Chris had seen earlier, Chris looked down at the basket of vegetables. All of a sudden, he felt very tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back inside, Chris deposited Adam's gift onto a table, stopping short as he smelt a delicious aroma in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding that his feet were moving of their own volition towards the kitchen, Chris decided that he had learned three things today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The neighbors were weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. He still hated Sheridan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. If it was Rob who was cooking, then he was indeed a good cook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~.~</span></div></div>",

Go try it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaylen sighed as he jogged across their backyard. The last rays of sunlight stretched his shadow across the flatland. Coolness finally pervaded his drenched tee shirt, gym shorts, and tired body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he have made the freshman football team, Baylen probably would have already been done with practice by now, messing around with his friends after the workout. Not that he had many friends on the football team, but he certainly wouldn\u2019t be doing THIS every evening with nobody else save his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas had made sure his brother knew all the plays. The weeks preceding tryouts were made up of carb-loading, work outs, hot days, pushups, water breaks, more push ups, running, water breaks, sit-ups, crunches, and lost lunches. Lukas spent those afternoons of try-outs clutching the meshed fence, barking and screaming from the sidelines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was inconceivable to Lukas how his brother might have gotten cut. An hour\u2019s shower allowed him to wrestle the facts. As the shower diminished to a steady trickle and the last steam wafted past the shower curtain, possible conclusions began spinning through the golden drenched mop that was Lukas\u2019 head\u2026 He was the captain\u2019s brother; scion of what could be a golden line of football championship heritage- how could those coaches so quickly jump to cut a legacy player? After all, Dan Miller\u2019s brother made the team- and he must have weighed around two hundred pounds, and he was, what, a freshman? OK, so maybe he was trying out to be a linebacker\u2026 But that still didn\u2019t rule out that Roraback kid, who reportedly didn\u2019t even want to be there! Lukas searched his memories of afternoons spent observing the tryouts from an overlooking hill. Had it been Roraback who was that poor mope who tried to sneak out of practice and run home? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Lukas thought of it in hindsight, he observed Baylen  probably was one of the lighter guys trying out for the team- at least, ruling out the guys who were under five foot who carried vocal pitches similar to girls when they talked\u2026 but they all definitely didn\u2019t WANT to be on the team. Not like Baylen. He knew Baylen. Baylen got up at five in the morning to\u2026 Baylen took cold showers and drank eggs for breakfast\u2026 or then again, was that Lukas himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Lukas sighed, as Baylen jogged back to the line he had denoted in the lawn with a long stick, \u201cLet\u2019s make this one count, bro- take a deep breath,\u201d he said, taking the heavy bowling ball from his brother\u2019s arms for a moment. \u201cAnd I want to see you hurl that thing! You need to get some serious distance with if you want to be shot put champ. So spin yourself around if you have to,\u201d he suggested, swerving his waist back and forth while slowly extending his arm out, thrusting it forward, \u201cGet some uhm\u2026 you know, momentum! Okay?\u201d he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaylen nodded, and Lukas slipped the bowling ball into his little brother\u2019s arms. His shoulders suddenly lowered, due to the impact, making Baylen flinch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas bit his lip, \u201cAlright, show me what you\u2019ve got!\u201d he called, hoping to somehow empower his brother\u2019s efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaylen grit his teeth, and thrust the ball up but pulled it close, holding on as he spun around. Then, extending his arms outward, he let it fly far\u2026 to the side, toward the living room window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball blasted through like a wrecking ball, completely demolishing the glass with such a crash that even their new next door neighbor, Christopher, caught up in his own self-imposed isolation, had to part the bedroom curtains to see what had just transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers stood silently for what seemed to be a long time, arms hanging limp to the sides, dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, there was a painful creaking noise that built up to a crescendo of shattering crockery, ending in an ominous thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas softly leaned over to the side, balancing on one foot, cocking his head, both hoping to see the insides of the Campbell family living room somewhat intact, praying the actual destruction didn\u2019t match up with the terrible, dissonant sounds that had just blasted his eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe silently ran inside, leaving Baylen paralyzed in fear in the front lawn. The elder Campbell brother returned sprinting out the porch after a few frenzied minutes, armed with a briefcase and his car keys. He tapped his little brother on the shoulder to follow him as he sped off for his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter assessing the damage, Lukas decided that they were going to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only the fifth time that summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue truck made a sweeping arc into the parking lot of some gas station a few miles south of Sheridan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas glanced over to his brother, parking the car. \u201cWant anything?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChocolate milk\u2019s cool, I guess,\u201d Baylen shrugged, scotching himself upright and drumming his fingers on the dashboard. Lukas chortled before nodding his head to the side, his signal for Baylen to fill up the tank. The younger Campbell hopped out and started for the pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas stepped out of the car and leaned back, flexing his back as far as he could, folding his arms behind his head. It was almost four o\u2019clock by now, yet the sun still pulsated high in the sky. The golden disk shined vibrantly, illuminating nearby clouds to a bright yellow tinge, as if they too had been born of beaten gold, and not merely touched by it. But even with the clouds, the sun glistened intensely, unobscured and unhindered by its neighbors as if they were merely heavenly illusions or simply did not exist in the presence of its glory. It beat down temperate rays on Lukas\u2019 bare midsection. The blond remained in the heat, trying to let the real heat of the situation he had just abandoned dissipate into the air, but in turn, a few pressing issues came to his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tall gas station display sign loomed like a giant sundial above him. Taking a look at the price of unleaded made him click his tongue as he wondered just how big a hole in his pocket would be burned as a result of the refill. But the sign also cast a longer shadow. It seemed to tell Lukas it was now getting past four o\u2019clock. While the sun still beat high in the sky, like all things, it could not remain frozen at its peak forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas shook his blond locks before glaring at Baylen, who, to his surprise, was still caught up in the menial task of pumping; still shaking his head, he headed to the station, determined to get a move on as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd sign that read, \u201cNo shirt, no shoes, no service\u201d, deterred his approaching paces. Lukas grumbled, heading back to the car to open the trunk and retrieve one his semi-glossy football jersey shirts, a green one, from the briefcase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeeding down the long stretch of highway, Lukas popped on the radio. Baylen twisted the knob labeled \u2018Seek\u2019 shifting through a station of classic rock, a pop type beat, the thundering voice of a preacher, and finally settling on the chords of a country tune he knew his brother would approve of. Baylen cracked the seal on his chocolate milk and took a sip, relaxing in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dared to ask as soon as the song came to a close, \u201cHow bad was it in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas widened the side of his lip and breathed in, making a soft, anxious hissing noise, \u201c. . . Not good. Not good at all,\u201d he shook his head, mumbling assessments, \u201cMuch worse than I thought. The uh\u2026 window broke, you know that much already,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd from what I saw\u2026\u201d he admitted slowly, keeping his unchanging eyes on the road, \u201c that bowling ball rolled off the counter into mom\u2019s china cabinet- completely wrecked it, and the whole thing tilted right off into dad\u2019s big screen TV\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaylen gagged. His throat stopped up as he lost his breath, nervously coughing up his mouthful of chocolate milk, not only spattering it all over his tee shirt, but also spilling more on his pants due to his slipped grasp of the bottle. He turned pink from the shock and embarrassment as he was now drenched in milk, his mouth and even nose dripping. He frantically looked for napkins or a rag to clean himself up before his brother could find out and see him pathetically soaked in chocolate milk. But just then, his brother\u2019s deeper facetious voice broke in, \u201cYou alright there, Bayl?\u201d he snickered, having only heard his younger brother\u2019s reaction to the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Campbell sighed resignedly, even though his brother had not unlocked his steady gaze off the road and had still to see his mess. On the other hand, Baylen had now locked his own gaze down at his dribbling self, \u201cUh yeah\u201d he said, \u201cCan we pull over for a bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s Liquor Store was situated in the outskirts of Galven, a town which itself lay on the border of a region which, for all intents and purposes, was designated as \u2018dry county\u2019. The local religious and tee-totaling groups held considerable influence in the town itself, making business as usual hard for the alcohol retailer. Yet old Sam Coleman prospered and business continued, albeit in different dimensions than expected. Its distance was not so much an exile cast upon the liquor store by the town, as it was a way to best adapt to its underground market, a boon for both buyer and seller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue truck pulled up into the small parking lot. Peering over, Lukas noted his younger brother moping up the remains of the spilt chocolate milk with his white tee. The shirt was quite drenched and stained a light brown. The elder Campbell brother shook his head, \u201cThat won\u2019t do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaylen shrugged, \u201cMeh, whatever. You packed clothes, I hope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas shook his head. Twisting to the side, he slowly exited the truck. Baylen sighed, seeing his brother head off to the liquor store. He knew his brother drank but he had never thought he actually bought the alcohol himself. Crossing his arms, foot tapping, he sighed. Outside, Lukas took a cursory look at the liquor store and suddenly slipped his green jersey off once more and tossed it through the open window into his brother\u2019s lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaylen stammered, \u201cL-Lukas! Weren\u2019t you about to head in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas smiled, \u201cEeexactly,\u201d he walked around to Baylen\u2019s side, \u201cBesides, I need someone reputable to watch over my prized jersey while I\u2019m gone, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaylen sighed once more at the sight of Lukas making his way over, \u201cHold on Lukas... Aren\u2019t they going to card you or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas held up a hand, shrugging \u201cNo worries, Bayl,\u201d he assured. \u201cI\u2019ve got this all planned out, you see-\u201c As the elder Campbell began his explanation, he carelessly tried to lie back against the car\u2019s hood. Suddenly, his bare elbows burned against the heated surface, \u201cAhh! What the hell?\u201d he yelped, springing to his feet. The dull pain subsided in a moment. Lukas smirked in spite of himself so Baylen joined in and chuckled too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until a pair of sandles came flying at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep an eye on my kicks too, okay, bro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Baylen pulled off his shirt, Lukas was only reminded of his amazement of how slim his younger brother was in spite of his efforts at training him in the past two months or so. Various drills, pushups, and weight lifting had only given him the slightest hook to his slender arms. His legs were in no better condition, his chest remained narrow and flat, and his stomach, while trim and even, still appeared soft and untouched by various crunches. While Lukas wasn\u2019t expecting that much from his freshman brother, he did remember that he began undergoing a growth spurt in his last year of middle school and started developing muscles shortly thereafter. But the only development Baylen\u2019s growth spurt was granting him was that in a vertical direction, for while Lukas observed he was shooting up like a bean sprout each and every day, each and every day he was more and more appearing to seem like a \u2018bean pole\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse was when Baylen draped the jersey shirt, which was form fitting for Lukas for the most part, which now loosely hung slack over his lanky frame. Lukas tried not to do a face plant. At least Baylen was as tall as he was- had he been a few inches shorter like other boys his age, the jersey might appear like an oversized nightshirt, or even some sort of weird dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukas shrugged and headed over to the liquor store. \u2018He\u2019ll shape up in time.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo shirt. No shoes. No wire from the cops. And for old Sam Coleman, that was good enough for service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nThe high beams spread about as the blue car rolled down the highway at a staggering twenty miles per hour. A drowsy Baylen sat bolt upright in the driver\u2019s seat. He was frightened, much unlike his intoxicated brother, snoozing comfortably right beside him. The occasional midnight driver might come clipping down the road, jolting the younger Campbell to pick up the pace before he\u2019d nervously hit the brake, attempting to get the car back under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaylen really wished he at least had a driver\u2019s license.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Willow Court, Illinois...to understand the story unwinding in this locale, perhaps it is best that you learn some of the local history first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo begin, Willow Court is neither town nor city, but instead a community; a suburb, if you, will, of the city of Springfield, Illinois. Graced by mild summers and by pristine and snowy winters, the avenues of Willow Court are lined with ancient willows planted nearly a century ago. Accompanying the willows, elegant and extravagant homes are evident in Willow Court, for with the planting of the willows had come many affluent families, some retiring from living in busier Springfield, and others coming from as far as the growing metropolis of Chicago. As the years passed, Willow Court established itself as a community of and for society's wealthy and elite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things change. Businesses and corporations go bankrupt or change hands. The old pass on and the new point the compass of destiny in new directions. Time goes ever on, unceasing in her eternal march; caring not for the destruction she leaves in her wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer march brings us to the point in time where our story opens. Willow Court, having suffered a century of erosion, is becoming diluted. This bastion of the rich is, to its horror, being encroached upon by those lacking the lineage, the birthright of those coming before. It is being invaded by...new money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, our story unfurls as yet another new family makes Willow Court it's home, drawing the attention of all of the older families in the neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut especially, it calls forth the attention of the family just across the street from these newcomers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a withered hand reached towards the curtains...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up to draw back ivory curtains of the finest satin, Victoria Bryant glanced coolly through the willows framing the street to the house parallel to her own. Amidst the swaying boughs of the willows, she could spy several people eagerly carrying boxes into said house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman well into her seventies, Victoria Bryant was elegance personified. Her long wisps of silver hair were bound into a tight bun atop he head, and her blue eyes called to mind images of a blizzard howling in winter. While her face had once been one of beauty, age had indeed ravaged her in several wrinkles that she tried to keep well hidden. For a woman of her age, her thin form was dressed as if she was attending a ball in a modest, black gown. The only embellishments she offered herself were earrings and a necklace of pearl, and a faded band of gold on her ring finger. An incident twenty years past that had claimed her mobility as well as her husband now left her bound in a wheelchair. A severe expression was on her face, the matriarch of the Salyers family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"William, enlighten me.\" she turned, the ancient gears of her archaic wheelchair squeaking, \"It appears that we have new neighbors. Am I erroneous in believing that they are not of the upper class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your insight proves to be flawless, mother.\" a middle-aged man, William, replied as he lounged on a nearby sofa, boredly examining his fingernails. \"They are the Reynolds family, composed of a mother, a father, and four children. Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds are both prominent lawyers from Chicago. Their eldest son will be a freshman at Springfield College, while their three other children passed late admittance exams to attend Springfield Renaissance School.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt forty years of age, William Bryant had, as of now, been spared from most of time's ravages. He had long been active in his youth, evident in the broad and healthy form he now sported in his later years. With hair of chestnuts and eyes of almonds, it seemed to be that he had taken more after his father than his mother. Dressed in a sensible, yet snazzy suit, he wore the same severe expression that his mother wore, although he also seemed to radiate a kindness his mother lacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As does your ability to gather information.\" Victoria noted, issuing forth a slight sigh as she closed her eyes. \"Willow Court really is being fed to the hounds, though, is it not? Not only must we put up with that raving family of environmentalists a few houses down, but now this? And right across the street as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our family has never been one blessed by luck, mother, as I'm sure you know.\" William droned. \"If we are, by some means, fortunate then they may be the type that keep to themselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria gave a ladylike sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we can only hope...In any case, Vincent, Mary, and Edward are forbidden from interacting with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already informed them as such. As you say mother, we can't have them picking up filthy habits...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving the heavy cardboard box onto the upstairs landing with a final burst of strength, Tameron Reynolds fell to the hardwood floor, breathing heavily. Adjusting his silver-framed glasses, he blanched, realizing that his room was still all the way down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful there, P.B. You don't want to overexert yourself. Sweat too much and the gel will melt right out of your hair.\" Tameron turned to see his eldest brother, Ben, walking up the stairs with a cardboard box of his own gripped in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNineteen years old and fresh out of high school, Benjamin Reynolds was...not your normal teenager to say the least. Well trimmed from years of dancing (Yes, dancing. Tameron's brother was currently enrolled at Springfield College as a Dance Major.), Ben had inherited his mother's height as well, both factors attributing to his lightly muscled lanky form. His hair, a deep brown, also inherited from his mother, was currently tied back into a straight and immaculate ponytail. Dressed in a simple black tank top and a pair of form-fitting black jeans, he looked every part of the dancer that he was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrarily, at fifteen years of age, Tameron Reynolds, a sophomore at Springfield Renaissance School, was the second youngest out of the four Reynolds children, and also the most sedentary. This was evident in the chubbiness that seemed to coat Tameron in every orifice. While he was far from being fat, he seemed to have just enough fat in every area to make him appear, according to his siblings, like the Pillsbury Doughboy (Which was where his nickname, P.B., had come from; Pillsbury.). Taking after his father, Tameron had blond hair, which he liked to spike up with hair gel, and brown eyes set behind a pair of glasses. His mouth was currently fixed in a pout, and he was dressed simply in a pair of blue jeans and a tee shirt that tended to cling to his soft belly and the slight breasts he'd been developing as of late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to call me that until I die a horrible death, aren't you?\" Tameron questioned blandly, rolling his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" Ben offered as he ascended the landing, sitting his box down to take a breather. \"Or at least until you lose that little belly of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Ben had shot in a few quick movements to give Tameron's stomach a quick jab, to which the blond yelped and jumped slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been another attributing factor to Tameron's nickname; when someone poked or jabbed his stomach, he squealed like the Pillsbury Doughboy as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTameron sighed deeply as his brother quickly picked up his box and jogged down the hallway, snickering. Deciding that it was probably best to pick up his own box and proceed along to his room, Tameron quietly stewed over everything that was wrong in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother was an idiot, for one. It wasn't as if Tameron could help that he was a little on the pudgy side...well, perhaps a bit more than pudgy. Excessively chubby was a good word, really, but that's beside the point. Actually, both of his brothers were idiots. And his little sister? Pure evil. But then again, all younger siblings are pure evil, privately at least. It didn't help that his new school encompassed grades 6 through 12, meaning that his sister, a 6th Grader, would be able to torment him at school as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he didn't like their new house. It was spacious, yes, and indeed it was very beautiful, but it felt...cold. As if it was just a place where the previous owners, if there had been any, just ate and slept at; not a place where they lived. And the neighbors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor shivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier he had thought he had seen the visage of an old and eithered woman glaring at his family from the house across the street, but in an instant she had disappeared, hidden by embroidered, white curtains. Of course, he COULD have been seeing things but...something about that old lady made him feel icy inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd let's see, what else? Oh, yes. He missed Chicago. His friends there, all the entertainment the city offered,...the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing and puffing as he brought the box in to what would be his room, Tameron flung not only the box, but himself as well onto his bed. Luckily, the movers had gotten hear a day earlier with their heavier furniture, and had set it up throughout the house per his mother's instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few brief moments, Tameron was able to relax, his hands clasped peacefully atop his stomach as rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tired already, nii-chan?\" Tameron heard a voice, coupled with sound of small steps, and felt his stomach lurch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine Reynolds, like Benjamin, wasn't exactly the most normal sibling one could have. At five feet and in the 6th Grade, she was actually one of the more intelligent members of the family, and had aced her admittance exam to Springfield Renaissance School. Of course, that didn't mean that she didn't enjoy antagonizing her elder brothers, especially Tameron, as they were both the youngest at only three years apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Jas?\" asked Tameron, propping himself up slightly, looking over his belly at his little sister. \"Did you finish helping Mom in the kitchen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her brother's question, Jasmine, from her position in the doorway, walked fully into the room and over next to where Tameron lay perched on his bed, a thoughtful expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking after their father as well, Jasmine had blonde hair and wasn't tall like Ben was, although she had green eyes -a mystery when one considered that their father's eyes were brown and their mother's were blue. She tended to keep to herself for most of the time, in her room on the Internet (She seemed to have a bit of a passion for Japanese culture), reading, or writing poetry; several notebooks of which she'd already filled. Today she was wearing a white shirt with the picture of a smiley face sewn onto it and a pair of bellbottoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarily, Tameron stared back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cogs and gears in his sister's head were turning. NEVER a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing after a few moments and plastering a smile onto her face, Jasmine skipped over and patted her brother's soft belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gained a few more pounds, I think.\" his sister said, giggling, and then dodging as Tameron swiped at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how would you know, you little demon?\" Tameron asked fiercely, fighting down a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would never admit it to his sister, but he HAD noticed his shirts becoming a bit clingier, his pants a bit more snug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm your wise and omnipotent sister!\" Jasmine said airily. \"That and when we learned we were moving last month, you spent the rest of our time in Chicago lazing about the house more so than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh.\" Tameron said after a few moments, the edge gone from his voice. Placing a hand on his belly, he grimaced. \"Did I really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, brother of mine, yes. But before I forget,\" Jasmine drummed her forefinger on her cheek momentarily in though, \"Mom told me to inform you that Blake is having a fit downstairs. He's missing something from his computer, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" Tameron asked incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Blake; as scatterbrained as ever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation suddenly pierced by a scream of despair, and even Jasmine flinched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake! Yo idiot! Shut the hell up! I'm trying to hook up my stereo! That requires, I don't know, CONCENTRATION, maybe?\" Ben shouted from somewhere down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stereo? You mean so you can listen and/or dance to that GIRLY MUSIC?\" Blake yelled back from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's NOT GIRLY! For the thousandth time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not when you compare it to those TIGHTS you wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Ben's thumping footsteps sounded in the hallway as the eldest Reynolds sibling bounded through the hallway and down the stairs, presumably to throttle the second eldest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking their heads, both Tameron and Jasmine had melancholic expressions on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're adjusting to the move nicely.\" Jasmine noted sarcastically, then heading towards the door. \"Shall we go see who managed to win this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It's not as if we have anything better to do, I suppose.\" Tameron agreed, heaving himself up and joining his sister in walking downstairs to see which of their brothers had killed each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show downstairs was comical to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon heading downstairs to see the scuffle their brothers were in, Tameron and Jasmine had followed the sounds of their shouting to the backyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight that had greeted them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was apparently at a stalemate. Benjamin, who was more flexible, prevented Blake's legs from moving by winding his longer ones around them and also had his younger brother in a headlock. Blake, not to be taken down that easily, had chomped down onto one of Ben's arms and was thrashing about madly. As such, both had fallen into the dirt and had gotten rather filthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laughing at them, both Tameron and Jasmine had tried to break their brothers' fight up, but neither had any success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Mrs. Reynolds decided to make her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Beeenji.... Blakey.... please tell me that I'm not seeing the two of you fight.\" a voice called sweetly, and all four Reynolds children froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing towards the door to the backyard meekly, they all blanched. Mrs. Maxine Reynolds leaned against the doorway easily, a smile on her face, but a deep and raging inferno burning in her blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mom.\" echoed both boys, suddenly off the ground, dusting themselves off as their mother waltzed over to examine them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a beige pair of slacks and a light red sweater, Mrs. Reynold's clothes told nothing of her career as a lawyer, but her posture and tone simply screamed it. Her beauty was classical, and her face was lit with lines caused only from laughing her whole lifetime. Like Benjamin, she was tall and slim, but elegantly so. At the moment, her brown hair fell freely around her in a brunette waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the facade, Maxine clucked her tongue and openly glared at her two oldest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Benji, we've been through this before. As the oldest you're supposed to set an example for your siblings; not attack them.\" Maxine chided, punching Benjamin in the arm slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Blake...Blake, Blake, Blake. How many times do I have to tell you to control your hyperactivity?\" Maxine asked, turned to Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast, but certainly not least, of the Reynolds siblings was Blake, the second oldest. At seventeen years old, he was a junior in high school; and easily the wildest of his siblings. Like Ben and Mrs. Reynolds, his hair was brown, as were his eyes, and fell just past his ears, one of which being pierced by a small silver loop earring. He was perhaps ten or fifteen pounds overweight, lending a softened look to his overall features, but was a thin person overall. Partial to dark colors, as well as the Internet, MMORPGs, and all things electronic, Blake was wearing a long sleeved black and red shirt, and black jeans like Ben was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mom. I'm sorry.\" Blake apologized gruffly, shuffling his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, Maxine sighed and then nodded. She then turned to head back into the house, motioning for her children to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, love; just remember who pays for your EverQuest subscription.\" Mrs. Reynolds reprimanded, noting as she led the group into the kitchen, a scene of organized chaos, like most of their house at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that you all forgot that we're still in a state of getting everything organized.\" Maxine droned, eyeing her children as they lined up into a row. \"Your poor father is still struggling outside by himself, mind you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting awkwardly, the Reynolds siblings looked down at their feet in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why,\" Maxine began, and then pointed at Benjamin and Blake, \"As punishment for that little brawl, you, my rambunctious boys, are going to go help your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! What about P.B?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And P.B. gets left out because...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth brothers spoke at once, but were silenced by yet another glare from their mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tameron, I recall, wasn't wallowing around in the back yard like a pig.\" Mrs. Reynolds said sternly, folding her arms. \"Now, scoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing harshly, both boys left, although not without a snide comment or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's just the one that looks like a pig...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, let's get fat! Then she'd coddle us too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuming, Tameron glared at both his elder brother's backsides. One day, perhaps he'd strap them both to a table and force feed them until they got fat. THEN they would all be even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to them, Tammy Wammy!\" his mother cooed, and before he knew it, Tameron was locked in one of his mother death hugs. \"They're just being aloof; it's a big brother thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Tameron shouted, blushing as he tried to release himself from his mother's grip. \"I hate THAT nickname more than I hate P.B.! I'm fifteen! Are you ever going to stop babying me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Maxine answered cheerfully and laughed as she let Tameron go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTameron inwardly cursed. He supposed that it was his mother than had passed on her malevolence to Jasmine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't think I don't have a task for you too,\" Maxine said, then pointing at Jasmine, \"While your brothers help your father and while your sister finishes helping me -like she was supposed to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine giggled innocently as Mrs. Reynolds walked over to the refrigerator and pulled out one of her trademark chocolate cakes, at the sight of which Tameron had began drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a gift for our neighbors! Some of them at least...I'm not quite sure what to get the others yet...\" Tameron's mother trailed off, dashing his hopes that the cake was for their own consumption, and handing him the decadent sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our neighbors?\" Tameron asked weakly, remembering the vision of the old ladt he'd seen earlier. \"Or wait...do you mean those people we saw a few houses down...at the house with the girl just sitting there on the lawn...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTameron had forgotten about them in the excitement of unpacking, he supposed. He did remember, however, that they didn't quite seem to suite the neighborhood, what he'd seen of them at least: A girl, who had looked to be meditating, and a boy around his age that had appeared to have been talking to a tree. Even their house appeared off, decorated in bright and vibrant hues while the other houses in the neighborhood tended to sport more subdued and somber colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'd like you to take it to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The United States of America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArguably, the most powerful, as well as the most prosperous nation on Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you know what else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe're getting fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, according to the scores of health eperts these days. Havn't we all ran across the occasional article proclaiming \"Americans Keep Getting Fatter\" or \"Obesity Still On The Rise\" at least once during our forays across the Internet? But I digress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story will focus on the supposedly growing waistlines of the USA. Some locations will be fictional, some will be real, and some will be a mixture of both. As for the weight gain, who knows? The tales compiled here could have happened or may happen in the future if America continues on the path towards obesity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                     RULES<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Grammar. Come on, guys. I'm no grammar Nazi, but let's at least know the difference between \"your\" and \"you're\" okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Chapter Length. At the very least, try to write a few paragraphs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Gender. Yeah, some of you won't like me for this, but I write male weight gain. Thus, guys are the main focal point in this story. However, girls can act as encouragers or gain weight secondarily, IF their weight gain advances the male's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Common Sense/Creativity. Exactly what it says. Characters aren't going to have changes of heart in regards to weight gain in a single chapter. Or two. If you find that you simply must be rash, at least be creative in doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                            IMPORTANT NOTE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I deleted some chapters? Why? Honestly, this story is one I've put a lot of thought into and I didn't want it to head into a downward spiral by being taken in an unintended direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, please refrain from adding chapters to this interactive as, while they may not be there presently, many chapters indeed have been planned. In other words, unless you're my longtime partner in crime, Some Guy, or myself, back off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if you believe your style of writing to be similar to either mine of Some Guy's, please contact me, and maybe we can work something out and I'll allow you access to write. I'm not completely heartless, you see, but neither will I be moved on this matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I'd like to thank everyone who has supported \"A Growing Nation\" and I hope you'll continue to do so in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest Regards,<br>\r\n                         <br>\r\n                           - Palos/Mizu<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
