Sydney closed the curtains and turned it up a little louder with a smile. She knew it wouldn't bother her father, Frederick, as he lived in the other wing of the house. Sometimes she loved that her father was well off, though there were other things missing from her life. Her mother, for instance. She had never worked up the courage to ask her father about her. The last time she did he went into a fit of rage and disappeared from the house for days. Something had obviously hurt him very badly and she didn't want to be the one to make him feel like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her book, the newest Martin novel, and sank back into her bed. The mounds of cushions softened her fall and in the dim light of her bed side lamp she was once again snug and warm and settling into her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew, a loud crash woke her from  slumber. She jolted awake and dropped the book on the floor with a loud thump. For a moment she didn't know what had happened and then it dawned on her that she'd fallen asleep. She shook herself awake and jumped from her bed. The crash resounded in her mind. It was sharp and high pitched, like the sound of glass breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing from her room, she hurried along the dark corridor, ignoring the darkened foyer over the balcony and tore into her father's room without so much as a knock. There she saw turmoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed had been turned upside down, the bedside table lay on it's side with all of it's contents strewn across the floor. The dresser mirror was cracked in a spider web and the curtains had been torn down from the poles. Worst of all, the huge sash window had been smashed inwards, glass scattered on the plush carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought she ran forward, and peered out of the window into the dark night. A lone car was racing down their driveway and off into the night with a screech of tyres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Sydney was unable to move. Finally, the rain that pelted her got through and she realised she was getting wet. As she pulled herself back in she heard another crunch of glass and that's when she realised, her feet were lacerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happened? Where is my father? Who was in that car? What now?</i></span></div></div>",

It was not until she could no longer see the car when she stopped and fell to her knees, crying. Someone had broken into her home and had taken her father. Worse, there was nothing she could have done to stop it. \"Why did I fall asleep!?\" miserably, she asked herself. \"I could have done something, given dad a better chance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney buried her face into her hands, sitting near the edge of her driveway, struggling to compose herself as the rain continued to fall. She remained there for several moments before something blew into her lap in the wind. Pausing, she lowered her hands and was surprised to find a torn piece of fabric from a denim shirt or jacket. She picked up the fragment and saw that it was a sewn on badge of some sort. \"What is this?\" shaken, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badge was an insignia of some kind. It was eight swords, forming a star, with a ring in the center that held a star within it. Sydney had never seen such an insignia but then it dawned upon her that, whatever it was, dad must have torn it off the clothes of his kidnapper. Who ever had taken him belonged to whoever the insignia represented. Determined to find answers, Sydney limped back into the house where she first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Normally, I never dared to venture in as he was always so protective of his belongings. He had explained that it was an impulse with childhood origins, living in a bad neighborhood. \"Where to start...\" Sighing, I asked myself. \"His desk, perhaps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carefully moved through his papers but found nothing of use other than we were far more well off than he had led me to believe. Or was that a clue? I looked deeper into the financial records and found that our wealth had exploded only about a year before when dad took on a new job with some unknown agency. It was definitely a clue. I moved on to his filing cabinet only to find that it was locked. Not to be detoured, I pulled a hair pin and began to pick the lock. Something I had learned from a rather detailed mystery novel series I enjoyed reading. Within seconds, the filing cabinet was unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know...\" smiling, I muttered. \"It actually worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombing through the files, I found that dad had worked on a number of high level cases for this agency only I could not find the name of it. All the files said was Employer One in reference to who dad was working for. I moved to the last file in the cabinet and found an incomplete case which had a picture of the very insignia I had found on the road while chasing the suspect car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Agenda Guild.\" Reading the file, I said. \"So that is who took dad. He must have been close to blowing their operation wide open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back through the other files, hoping to find some contact number but found nothing useful. I then turned back to the Agenda Guild file and found three possible people in three locations dad was considering investigating. Each person had a file describing them and possible connections to the Agenda Guild. After acquiring all I believed I would need for my own personal mission, I decided to fly to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only recently she had convinced him to upgrade his old model to a more modern Smartphone.  She smiled to herself at the memory, then reached out for the device and switched it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first thought was to check his call history.  Just before she did so, she hesitated.  Was this a breach of her Dad's privacy?  How would she feel if he went nosying through HER private calls?  But this was an emergency - she hadn't disappeared in to the night, possibly snatched by some kind of lunatic stranger and he had, so under the circumstances she felt justified.  The last few days call history was unsurprising - the University he sometimes worked for, a local pizza place, his bank, Eliza, the lady who came to clean the place every now and then.  The most recent person he had spoken to was his friend Arthur - Sydney knew him well and had done since she was a young child - he was one of her fathers oldest friends.  Without further consideration she pressed the call icon.  It rang a few times and a middle aged man's voice came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Arthur?  It's Sydney here, it's Jack's daughter, something's happened.  My Dad -\"  Something instinctively told her to stop.  Maybe she had read too many thrillers but suddenly she didn't feel safe talking on the telephone.  What if it was bugged?  What if this was something way more serious and complex than she could imagine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sydney?\" Arthur's tone was worried.  She realised she hadn't spoken for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur, is it okay if I come over to speak to you?  I'll explain when I get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Are you okay?  Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm okay,  I'm sure everything will be fine.  I'll make my way over, thanks Art\".   She cancelled the call and stuffed the phone in her pocket, then made her way back over to her room where she grabbed her bag and coat and pulled a pair of boots over her bandaged feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she began to descend the stairs, she heard a crash come from the direction of the kitchen.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she peered through the bars down onto the expansive lobby, she saw only darkness punctuated by shadows. There was no movement. She didn't expect to say any, not there anyway. She carried her bag down the steps with her, each pace she took downwards muffled by the carpet on the stairs. She was glad her father had opted for that one. She left the bag at the bottom of the stairs in case she needed it for a quick getaway and slowly made her way to the back of the house where the kitchen was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boots thudded quietly on the tiled floor and she walked deliberately, placing her feet down one by one and being as quiet as possible. She made it to the kitchen door where another thunderous crash from inside had her jumping. Her heart thumped wildly in her chest as she reached forward and rested her hand on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she pushed it open. It moved without sound and inside she could make out the shape of the island in the centre of the kitchen, the utensil rack hanging above it hanging by one chain and half of the items scattered across the kitchen top and floor.

Sydney screamed through the hand but nothing but a muffled whimper escaped as she felt herself being dragged into the shadows. She started to struggle but a familiar whispered voice caused her to hesitate. <i>\"Be still if you want to live!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney froze, recognizing the voice of her uncle Jack who she thought was out on a business trip in the former Soviet Union. Jack kept a firm hold onto her hand, holding the other securely over her mouth as she heard an unnatural sound that sent a chill down her spine. It sounded like a child's scream but distorted, as if through an old metal pipe. Then she saw the dark figure of what looked like a child come into view. Only, as it turned its head, Sydney saw that it was not a child, at least not anymore. Half of the creature's face was metallic, like that of a broken doll only worse. Its one eye was blue but the other was red, searching the darkness for movement. It rose its hand to look at a paper in its hand and Sydney saw that it was human except for the hand; it was robotic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the longest time, Sydney remained still and silent as the odd creature looked about then moved on, letting out another haunting scream and was gone. It was several long moments before Jack released Sydney and allowed her to turn to face him. \"What- What was that thing?\" shaken, Sydney asked. \"It looked like a little boy but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was a powerful man, standing at six foot five with muscles that would make an Olympian weight lifter jealous. He brushed his longish black hair aside, revealing his deep blue eyes. \"That 'thing', as you put it, <i>is</i> a little boy.\" sadly, he replied. \"Your father and I have been working hard to stop the monsters who had 'created' them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this horrified Sydney. \"What!?!\" almost screaming, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are called 'The Collective'.\" serious, Jack explained. \"They are a group of mad scientists who have pulled their resources to bring humanity into what they see as the next evolution of mankind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By turning kids into machines...\" shaken, I asked. \"That's insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father and I have been fighting this group for decades.\" after looking about, Jack said. \"Your mom has been fighting them too.... from the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is with those maniacs!?\" horrified, Sydney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded. \"Your father did not want you to know this but now they are onto us and that places him, me, you all in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone took dad.\" gulping, Sydney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" almost whispering, Jack said. \"They took him but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack came down to my level. \"Sydney, they were after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSydney's eyes went wide before she...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
