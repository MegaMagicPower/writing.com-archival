Seriously, he did not make such undignified sounds, no matter how much people insisted. Especially a certain blonde pun-terror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for this one time, he allowed himself to cheer with no restraint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde swordsman and hunter-in-training was outside of Beacon, using a secluded spot near the Emerald Forest as a private training ground. Pyrrha and he would either us this one or the roof of the dorms whenever they trained together. However, this time the redhead was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Jaune had finally discovered his semblance! The blonde teen was beyond ecstatic. Many people had speculated about what it could be; Ruby thought it would be flashy, Nora thought it would be heroic, and Yang thought it would explain his bad luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe that last one was more mockery than speculation... but still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of their friends had guessed correctly though. To be fair, neither he had expected it to turn out like this. It wasn't anything that enhanced himself, like Ruby's speed and Yang's super-saiyan semblance, nor could it be used offensively or defensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune had to admit that it was a bit humiliating that his semblance couldn't be used on himself, seeing as it actually enhanced others; girls to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde knight had discovered his semblance earlier in team JNPR's shared room. Their team could be a bit chaotic in the morning, and that often resulted into bumping against each other. Being the clumsy dork that he was, Jaune had accidentally stumbled into Pyrrha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason she didn't seem to mind it all that much... probably because she was such a great and understanding partner. Certainly not anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what had stuck out to him was that making contact with her while using his semblance had <i>changed </i>her. Now, everyone knew that Pyrrha was a fit girl; it was to be expected from such a renowned fighter, who worked out regularly to stay in shape. That meant that she had some muscle definition -- though not overly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever his semblance was called, changed that. It had been very subtle, but Jaune had noticed how her muscles had grown a little, becoming more defined and gaining a tiny amount of size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one had said anything about it; not even Pyrrha herself. Not that surprising, seeing as Jaune wouldn't have seen it either without the close contact. However, it had made him think and consider the consequences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small test later on at their table during breakfast with their sister team -- team RWBY, of course -- had confirmed his suspicions. While handing over another stack of pancakes to a hungry Nora, he had briefly made physical contact with her, with his semblance activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again one of his teammates had grown a bit more muscular. It didn't work on men though, as he had tried it out on Ren without any results. Jaune should be disappointed that his semblance turned out to be like that, but the blonde swordsman was feeling anything but down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt helped that he absolutely loved muscular women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune wouldn't freely admit it unless he was completely wasted, but muscular girls turned him on immensely. He often glanced at Yang and Pyrrha when they didn't look, gazing at the defined muscles on both the blonde brawler and red-haired spartan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this semblance? He could finally make his fantasies come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am so going to enjoy this!\" Jaune grinned excitedly as he thought about all of the girls he could use his semblance on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who would be first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune arrived at the dorms, heading straight for his shared room to recollect his thoughts. He'd need to think carefully about what to do next. There were many girls he could use his semblance on, but maybe someone close to him would be the best option, since physical contact was the only way he knew how to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Pyrrha? No, she's training right now... Maybe Nora? Oh, wait, Ren took her to the cafeteria for pancakes...\" Jaune muttered to himself as he narrowed his eyes at the floor. He walked without really watching his surroundings, \"Ugh, who should I pick?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only people who would be suitable would be his friends from team RWBY. Hell, he'd be lying if he denied having thought of Yang with huge biceps. Or Blake with massive muscular thighs. Or even Weiss with a wide, sinewy back. There was also-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jaune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde knight almost jumped out of his skin as Ruby appeared in front of him. She was smiling widely at him, her silver eyes locked onto his blue orbs. He hadn't noticed her coming to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Ruby! How's it going?\" Jaune responded quickly, trying to cover up his surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Ruby was as socially awkward as him, and didn't see it, \"I'm doing alright. Just bored, I guess. Yang took Blake to run some errands, and Weiss is in the library, studying for Oobleck's test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that next week?\" Jaune raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Weiss.\" She deadpanned in return, getting a laugh out of him. She giggled alongside the knight, \"Anyway, what are you up to? You kinda left all of a sudden after dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing special; I practiced my swordplay outside, and now I'm not really doing anything.\" He told her smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a very close friend, Jaune didn't want to tell Ruby about his semblance just yet. He would keep it a secret for now. Speaking of which, why not use it on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! How about we play the new zombie survival game together? That way, we can both do something fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was his opportunity. Jaune thanked the Two Brothers for Ruby's geekiness. Of course she would suggest something like that, though in this case, he didn't mind at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune grinned, \"Sure, I'd love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting up the game console in team RWBY's dorm proved to be less of a hassle than he expected. As it turned out, Yang and Ruby always kept their games close by; ready to fire it up. He figured the two sisters were the only ones who played. Weiss was too strict and focused on her school work, while Blake was the type to keep to herself and read her books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he was pleasantly surprised as Ruby pulled out the latest edition of a favorite franchise of his. He hadn't been able to buy it due to his training, but at least he had the opportunity to play the game now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough there wouldn't be much gaming involved in what was going to come next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune glanced at Ruby, who smiled happily as she turned on the console, turning her focus to the game. If there was something that he knew from personal experience, then it was that Ruby would be solely fixated on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Weiss' chiding of the scythe-wielding team leader's addiction to games was something that had come up more than once at the dinner table, and right now, Jaune hoped he could use that to his own advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take you down!\" Ruby challenged him, looking up with her silver eyes filled with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned widely, \"Bring it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game started shortly after, and the two teens began competing against each other, trying to survive the hordes of fictional monsters. It was easy to get immersed into the game, but Jaune's mind wasn't all into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he took subtle looks at the girl at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby Rose was young, but she was definitely attractive. While not as developed and beautiful as her older sister, there was no denying that she was pretty in her own right, looking cute with those red-tipped locks of black hair and captivating silver eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jaune wouldn't lie; she had a nice figure. Again, she wasn't as buxom as her blonde-haired sister, but she was definitely more of a woman than Weiss when it came to physical appearance. It also helped that those black stockings were so tight around her toned thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young knight knew that his dorky friend and fellow team leader was incredibly pretty, and it made using his semblance even more fun now that he got the chance to turn it on her. With that in mind, he began his little plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune sacrificed his chances on winning as he began focusing on the reaper next to him. His aura surged as his semblance was activated; a soft white glow appearing around Ruby, affecting her yet seemingly invisible except for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was surprised. Was physical contact not necessary after all? Jaune discovered that simply focusing on someone close by was enough for his semblance to work, which would definitely come in handy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I'm winning!\" Ruby cheered loudly; unaware of the changes happening to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite girl's clothes began to fill out, becoming tighter in certain areas as Jaune grew her through the use of his semblance. Despite wearing material that concealed a lot, it failed to hide the subtle signs of defined muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer black sleeves began to display bulges around her upper arms; thicker triceps from beneath, while her biceps swelled larger. Ruby's arms grew by the second as more muscle mass was added. Her forearms followed suit, becoming thicker and meatier. Each time she pressed a button on her controller, her forearms would tense and inflate slightly, tendons tightening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune's eyes drifted over to her stockings-clad legs, which were now getting bigger and more defined, instead of just slightly toned. The soft fabric was stretched thin across her enlarged thighs; bulky quadriceps took form, and the young huntress' calves were like large heart-shaped rocks. From behind, her hamstrings grew thicker, and her cute butt became rounder and firmer as her glutes inflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult for Jaune to remain calm as he watched her become bigger and more muscular. Luckily for him, Ruby seemed to be oblivious to the transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth affected her back and chest too, morphing them into tapestries of interwoven muscle fibers. Her tiny waist began to accommodate toned abdominals, which quickly turned into a solid six-pack. The girl's obliques joined in as they became defined, and had deep lines separating them. Much to Jaune's surprise, even her breasts grew; gaining another cup size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune deactivated his semblance after a few moments. By the looks of it, he was largely successful; Ruby had grown muscles all over her body, along with a few other changes that excited him, such as her enlarged bust and a bit of added height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game over!\" Ruby declared proudly, gaining the knight's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen flashed as it displayed the end scores, of which Jaune's was much lower than hers. Still, Jaune didn't mourn his loss, for he -- or Ruby to be more precise -- had gained much more.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Their gaming session was suddenly interrupted as the door swiveled open, revealing the white-haired member of team RWBY. Weiss looked surprised by his presence, but was quick to piece things together. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, did you at least finish your homework before playing games?\" There was no real bite to her voice; just resignation in case Ruby hadn't done what Weiss had asked of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pages seventy to eighty about Dust chemistry have been memorized, and I've written a report about the weak points of an Ursa.\" The reaper, who unbeknownst to her had become more muscular, responded as she rolled her eyes, \"I've done my homework for today, Weiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe W of the team nodded courteously, \"That's good. I'm glad to see you're working hard. And it's nice to see you, Arc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same to you, Weiss.\" Jaune responded in kind, trying to not get on the shorter girl's nerves, \"How did studying in the library go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it went well. It's mostly empty this time of day, with a lot of the other students choosing to visit Vale or practice, while the upper years have their own classes. The peace and quiet was appreciated.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, probably because said peace and quiet was hard to find when you were part of teal RWBY. Between Yang's personality and the situations the team got themselves into all the time, he wasn't surprised Weiss chose the library as her relaxation spot. Blake was the only other member to visit the place, seeing as the girl had a habit of going to the adult section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we continue playing our games here?\" Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune smiled softly. It wasn't difficult to see that she was trying to be considerate with Weiss, who would probably want to continue working in silence. To his surprise, however, the heiress shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all. You deserve to unwind a little, after all.\" Weiss smiled the tiniest bit, which was nothing more than the corners of her lips rising somewhat. Still, it was a genuine gesture from the ice princess, \"I'll be reading my book in the meantime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's grin grew wider as she replied excitedly, \"Thanks, Weiss! Come on, Jaune. Let's play another round!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you're on!\" He raised his controller and joined in on the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his mind wasn't fully occupied by the game. Again. He thought of Weiss instead, glancing at the lithe girl sat on her bed, pale eyes focused on the heavy book in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no secret that he had had a small crush on Weiss earlier on in the semester. Aside from his cringy advances, Jaune had tried asking her out to the dance, only to get rejected. By now he knew she just wasn't interested, so he tried to be a good friend to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't mean he was no longer attracted to her. Jaune's crush had simply changed into admiration, appreciating the girl's grace and beauty from afar. So now that he had an opportunity to use his semblance on her, Jaune found himself prepping his aura and semblance discreetly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Ruby or Weiss noticed the white glow surrounding the heiress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was similar to earlier. Foreign energy seeped into Weiss' lithe body, infusing her tendons and muscles and forcing them to grow. His semblance expanded its reach all over her form. Jaune's mind began to picture how he wanted to reshape her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of Weiss' most striking features were by no doubt her soft legs, so pale and smooth. They were incredibly alluring in those high heels of hers. He knew without a doubt they would look better with some muscle. So he began focusing on them in particular, pumping them full with aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss' thighs broadened out a bit, hamstrings and quadriceps growing larger. It didn't take long for them to get toned up a bit, becoming visibly more defined. Small ridges and splits appeared in between the individual muscle groups. Similarly, her calves bulged and swelled. Not overly so; Weiss was graceful and delicate, and he wanted to keep her that way, so giving her a fitness girl physique seemed more appropriate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune pictured her waist in his mind, keeping it small but growing the girl's abdominals and obliques in proportion to it. Smooth muscle appeared underneath her dress in the form of a toned stomach. Each square was round with beautiful definition, making it seem as if Weiss worked her abs every morning before going to class. Jaune quite liked the image of the stern girl hunched over her books while exercising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her arms some extra mass as well. Again, not enough to make her seem bulky or anything, but to give her that fitness look that many girls on social media sported. If companies were aware of how fit and curvaceous Weiss' new muscles made her, they'd be lining up to have her sponsor their products by taking pictures of herself with said merchandise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Jaune arrived at her chest. Another fact that was hardly a secret nowadays, was that Weiss felt a bit insecure about her assets. It didn't help that Ruby -- the girls younger than her by at least two years -- was rocking a larger bust than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to be kind to the white-haired girl, he developed her chest muscles a bit more than the others. The breast growth was only minimal sadly, which was proof that Weiss was unfortunately cursed to have little natural cleavage, but Jaune remedied that by growing her pectorals. The twin slabs of meat gained several inches, creating a muscle cleavage instead. They pushed outwards against her dress, and when combined with the slight breast expansion she had gained at least a full cupsize; maybe even two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune disengaged for now. His semblance had done a good enough job on Weiss, turning her lithe body into a fitness model physique of excellent quality. The girl in question was still focused on her book, however, meaning she hadn't noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I win again!\" Ruby cheered, causing him to jump slightly in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue enough, the screen was announcing his demise at the cute team leader's hands, \"I guess so. Well played, Ruby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please keep it down a little.\" Weiss spoke up, eyes flickering over to them, \"I'm trying to read over here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Weiss!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Ruby? Have you by any chance been eating too many cookies again?\" His latest victim inquired curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby frowned in apparent confusion, \"No... Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help but notice your stockings are filling out a bit more than usual. Your sleeves look tight as well.\" Weiss explained carefully. Jaune had a feeling he knew where this conversation was headed, \"Don't you feel uncomfortable?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that you mention it... My clothes do feel a bit tighter than when I put them on this morning.\" Ruby put down her controller and stood up, inspecting herself more closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-haired huntress in training rolled up her sleeve, recoiling in shock as her muscular arm was revealed; small veins standing out. Ruby's forearm was thick and shapely, but the same could be said for her bicep and tricep. Ruby involuntarily turned her wrist, causing the muscles to tense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did this come from?! I don't remember being so... <i>big</i>, when I woke up this morning!\" Ruby panicked slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stepped in quickly, \"Calm down. Let's take a deep breath, okay? There has to be a logical explanation for this. Maybe your workouts with Yang caused this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has a point, Ruby.\" Jaune added, watching his friend settle down, \"We're trying to become Hunters and Huntresses; it's only normal to be in good shape. And let's admit that Yang's workouts are a bit over the top.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you've got a point there.\" Ruby relented. She rolled up her other sleeve and gave her arm a tentative flex, watching her bicep pop up like a round orange, \"I suppose it's not too bad. And it'll make it easier to carry Crescent Rose around. But how did I not notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss huffed as she stood up and walked around, \"See? You dolt; giving me a heart attack like that is-- why are you looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you might want to check a mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune let out a sigh as the two members of team RWBY began a heated debate about their new sizes. Now, to be fair, he knew they would have found out sooner or later. At least his involvement in their growth was still kept secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he couldn't help but admire what he saw. Both Ruby and Weiss were attractive, with the former being cute and the latter graceful, and their new muscles made them even sexier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was definitely bigger than her partner. She was bulkier, though not by a large margin, and her muscles had more definition. Her shoulders were wider; the red hood covering her sinewy back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Weiss, she was leaner than her leader. The muscle mass on her frame made up for her previous lack of curves, doing so in the shape of her firm butt and muscle cleavage, but also accentuating her slim waist and smooth belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, how about we let the matter rest for a while, and clear our heads.\" Jaune eventually spoke up, worming his way into the conversation. Luckily, his friends didn't seem to mind, \"I think we just need to calm down. It's getting late anyway, and I don't think arguing over what might be happening will be very fruitful. Besides, we've got classes in the morning tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to convince the two of them -- even Weiss. They nodded in agreement and did as he proposed. Once he'd said his goodbyes, Jaune left the room and returned to his own. He wasn't lying when he said they had classes tomorrow; he needed his rest to recharge his semblance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause there were bound to be more girls for him to bulk up. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune entered his team's shared room in a state of excitement. The joy of finally having discovered his semblance was enough to make him smile the entire way there; a shit-eating grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the added hope of finally fulfilling his dreams of muscle waifus was almost threatening to make him faint. He was just so happy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the dorms he had tried his semblance on one of the female students who had come here for the tournament. As it turned out, he could use it without having to make physical contact. Just concentrating on the person was enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaune? What got you in such a good mood?\" His red-haired partner questioned him, noticing his large smile. Pyrrha Nikos, champion of Mistral and grade A beauty was sat at the desk, wearing her school uniform. The way her stockings hugged her toned legs, and her shirt curved around her generous bust made Jaune's heart skip a beat, \"You look a lot happier than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spartan's kindness immediately loosened his lips. Pyrrha was the most supportive person in Beacon, who he could come to with any problems that he had, and receive nothing but kind words from. Honestly, Jaune didn't know what he would be without his friend's support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the fact that she was gorgeous. Hair as red as blood cascaded down her shoulders and surprisingly toned back, and eyes as green as emeralds stared at him with nothing but kindness. Her figure was similar to Yang's; still very feminine, but more toned and muscular, which was right up his alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I finally discovered my semblance!\" His chest swelled with pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large smile immediately blossomed on the invincible girl's face, \"That's wonderful, Jaune! I'm so proud of you right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank, Pyr.\" He responded, using his affectionate nickname for the redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike usual, a small blush appeared on the teenager's cheeks. Come to think of it, Pyrrha only had those reactions around him. Huh... must be allergic or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does it do?\" Pyrrha asked innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the question, wasn't it? Jaune debated whether or not to tell her, but ultimately he decided to just come clean. While it was definitely an unorthodox semblance, the blonde knight knew that Pyrrha would not judge him for it, and he could trust her with this knowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus he told her everything he knew. The explanation didn't last long; he could grow any girl's muscles, maybe even help them more -- though he hadn't tested for anything like that -- and it required him to mentally will the person to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha listened attentively. It was probably a good thing to tell her all of this, seeing as she knew a lot more about aura and semblances than him. He'd been absent during one of miss Goodwitch's classes, which had covered the subjects, due to feeling ill at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally finished his explanation, his champion of a partner seemed to be impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... That's certainly quite the extraordinary semblance that you've got there, Jaune.\" The way she spoke made it sound as if it was a big deal. Maybe it was, if Pyrrha was so certain about it, \"It's definitely a supportive semblance. I don't see how it can be used in combat on enemies, but it would benefit your allies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune nodded, \"I thought the same.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half-truth, really. While yes, he did know that it could maybe give his teammates a boost during combat, his first thoughts were more about his fantasies that included powerful amazons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just a teenager, alright?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should ask miss Goodwitch for more help. If anyone would know more about this, it would be her.\" Pyrrha said with an apologetic smile, \"Sorry for not being of more use to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk like that, Pyrrha! You've been a great help so far when it comes to my training, and you're also the best friend I have -- don't tell Ruby, though.\" Jaune flashed her a bright smile, \"I'm sure I discovered my semblance because of your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, even he knew that he was not the most observant person in the school. Jaune was dense; this was a stated fact that he knew all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was difficult not to notice the sudden glint in Pyrrha's eyes as she squirmed in her seat, rubbing her strong thighs against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's another way I could be of help to you?\" The red-haired Huntress-in-training spoke up hesitantly, \"Say, what do you actually think of girls with... you know, <i>muscles</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... well, honestly? I think they look great.\" Jaune admitted reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to confess such a thing, but so far Pyrrha didn't seem to be disgusted with the idea. Besides, he knew that she could be trusted with his secret attraction to muscular women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Pyrrha looked away contemplatively. The champion fell silent, causing their conversation to take a somewhat awkward turn. Her green eyes then locked on to his blue ones, \"Jaune, what do you think of testing your semblance on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis partner gave him a sheepish yet determined look, \"I mean, we want to know more about your semblance, right? Well, I think you should use it on me so we can properly see what it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his semblance -- the one that gave girls muscle -- on his partner; the beautiful and talented Pyrrha Nikos?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he in heaven?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. Are you really sure about this, Pyrrha?\" Jaune asked her, wanting to be sure that her mind was made up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-haired spartan nodded firmly, \"I am. Go ahead and use your semblance on me, Jaune.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pyrrha stood in the center of their room, still dressed in her school outfit and a determined expression on her face. The red-haired spartan was ready to undergo the test. While surprised by her steadfast resolution to do this, Jaune was beyond ecstatic; his partner would willingly bulk up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you ready for this, Pyrrha?\" He asked her one final time, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha showed no signs of having second thoughts, \"I am. Go ahead, Jaune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all he needed to hear. Drawing on the inner power that was his semblance, he began charging it using his vast pool of aura, and aimed it at the spartan. He simply needed to focus on her own aura, amplifying it with his own to start the transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds, nothing out of the extraordinary happened. Pyrrha suddenly gasped, however, as a white light began to radiate around her body. It wasn't bright, but still noticeable enough even without darkness to highlight it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever before had she felt this way. Pyrrha's entire frame shivered as a weird sensation coursed through her body. It was strange, but not necessarily bad. In fact, the process was -- dare she say it -- very pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" The champion hissed, feeling her body warm up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was spreading to every corner of her body, making her experience pleasure that she could only compare to orgasmic bliss, similar to whenever she had private moments; always perverse and including the image of a certain knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she enjoyed the pleasant sensation, Pyrrha also became aware of the sudden tightness of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyrrha, you're growing!\" Jaune said as he stared at her with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, her muscles were expanding at a rapid pace, causing her school outfit to become a bit too tight. The heat intensified all of a sudden, which made her knees buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop, Jaune! Just keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer veins throbbed angrily as her muscles grew larger. Pyrrha clenched her fists while her forearms became more vascular and beefier, widening as a hefty amount of muscle mass was packed on to her arms. Her biceps inflated and swelled, with more than five inches added to her already nice peak. Even her triceps underwent the change; thick cables took form under her skin, as muscle fibers grew and grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha could feel her skin widen around her neck as striated shoulders appeared. Each deltoid got bigger by the second, and kept up with her traps, which were beefing up considerably. The jacket was already torn in multiple places, and the shirt that she wore underneath was faring no better. It just couldn't handle her widening back. It quickly turned into a muscular ravine; striated and defined muscles dotting it, like crevices and hills on a landscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels... so good!\" The redhead managed to say through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasure filled her entire being as her toned legs bulked up considerably, becoming wider and thicker as Jaune's semblance continued to affect her. Meaty thighs soon touched each other, and the vastus muscles on her legs resembled teardrops, but incredibly hard and defined. The young huntress-in-training's calves ballooned ad swelled larger, which made it difficult for her long socks to contain them. Similarly, her stockings were showing small rips here and there as her legs turned into sturdy pillars of solid muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Jaune gaped, staring at her chest, \"Your breasts! Growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not particularly well-constructed, his observation was indeed correct. Pyrrha's torso now had two large book-sized pectorals of beefy meat on it, supporting a pair of sizeable breasts. A bright blush coated the champion's cheeks as she saw her bust inflate, turning not one, but three cup sizes bigger. Her shirt was now more like a top, and exposed her rock hard abdominals, of which each was like a cobblestone; they were that defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the growth stopped and the euphoric feeling passed away. Pyrrha was left standing in their room as a panting mess. She felt as if she had just done a grueling workout, but without the soreness. If anything, she felt amazing! The spartan had grown taller too, standing almost a full head taller than Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha grabbed the remnants of her jacket and tore them off of her muscular body, noticing that with her new strength, she hardly felt any resistance whatsoever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, a bit too tight, huh?\" Jaune remarked lamely, still shocked and in awe of Pyrrha's new physique. His eyes drank in the sight of her exquisite form, \"Still, you look great, Pyrrha. And I mean <i>really </i>great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo words could describe the happiness that Pyrrha was feeling at that very moment. Her heart soared with delight, and it thundered in her broad chest like a mighty war drum. Jaune was finally noticing her! He was actually interested in her! Well, she assumed he was -- but still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jaune.\" The now muscular amazon responded with a fierce blush, and a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seriously, I never thought my semblance would be this effective. Those biceps have to be at least eighteen inches if not more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was happy with the attention, but something else wormed its way into her head. For some reason, she felt closer to the blonde knight than ever. It was as if her very soul was connected to him now, desperate to be close to him -- to please him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how to fully explain it. Perhaps his semblance had affected her in more ways than just giving her large muscles. According to doctor Oobleck's lessons, aura was directly linked to one's soul, and she had just been bathed in Jaune's. Her theory wasn't concrete, but it could be possible that by using his semblance on her with full force, he had unknowingly chained her to his very will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause she couldn't think about anything else but Jaune. A common occurrence; true. Yet this time it was different. Just standing next to him made her happier than ever, and the way he clearly enjoyed watching her bulky musculature made her shiver in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha knew that if he were to ask her to strip, she would do it in a heartbeat. If he asked her to do a task, she would comply wholeheartedly. Hell, even if he asked her to do something selfish for him, like beat up Cardin, she would not question him even once. That was the extent of the hold that his soul now had on hers. The redhead could feel nothing but undying loyalty and love for the knight, wishing to serve him as his trustworthy amazon warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it unnatural and morally wrong that he had such control over her due to his semblance? Maybe. Did she care? Not in the slightest. Pyrrha no longer cared for anything, except for this handsome knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that you're enjoying yourself. Do you want to see more?\" Pyrrha whispered seductively, leaning forward to give him a good view of her meaty pectorals and massive bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune's cheeks flushed, \"Well, if you insist...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead giggled in response, striking poses that accentuated her amazing musculature. Her muscles were incredibly big, and each flex and pose showed off just how impressive her new body was. Biceps the size of fruits popped up, abs as hard as rock tightened at her command, and legs as wide as pillars bulged at the slightest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ripped body was a haven of well-defined muscle. Pyrrha's curves were out of this world too, as she displayed by bringing attention to her firm breasts, or heart-shaped butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like this, Jaune? Do you want to touch my body?\" Pyrrha practically moaned as she invaded his personal space, pushing her dense muscles against him. Due to her new height, he had to look up at her now, \"This is all yours. Both my heart and soul are yours, and yours alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... quite the confession.\" Jaune blinked in surprise, \"Where is this coming from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've loved ever since the start of Beacon. It's just... I was never confident enough to act on my feelings.\" The champion explained, wrapping a bulky arm around the blonde knight. Her round bicep rubbed against his back, \"But when you used your semblance on me, those feelings got stronger. I don't know why, but it feels as if I've become connected to your aura, desperate to be close to you. Jaune, I think your aura doesn't just change people physically, but also makes them crave to be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-be with me?!\" Jaune exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only explanation that I can think of. Any girl that is affected by your semblance will be like me; loyal and in love.\" Pyrrha purred as she enjoyed the physical contact with the teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jaune, that was a concept that blew his mind to bits. Fantasies of muscular women who wanted to be with him popped up by the dozens in only a few seconds, and his heart sped up a bit faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould he do it? Could he conquer the women of Beacon, turning them into his amazons?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pyrrha's confession overwhelmed his mind. Could he do it? Could he turn multiple girls into musclebound amazons of perfection, and make them loyal to him? He'd be changing their very lives on just a whim. This was a debate of morality and principles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he thought about it, however, the more he believed he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune reflected on his own life. For as long as he could remember, he had been this unimportant boy that barely anyone paid attention to. Ansel hadn't been too kind to him; his social awkwardness and clumsiness had resulted in numerous bullies, who loved to remind him of how weak he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, he could see that same behavior even now in Beacon, where he was supposed to have fresh start. Cardin and his team for example. Those four bastards have been bullying him for a whole semester by now, despite him trying to be better and helping them out in Forever Fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause that was what he did, wasn't it? Jaune always tried to have the moral high ground, yet it didn't do anything for him. In fact, all it did was result in more grief. The negativity of his past experiences wasn't gone; it was buried within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo was it wrong for him to jump at the opportunity at a better life? Was he throwing away his morals by choosing this power, which would make women crave for him? Maybe so, but Jaune no longer cared. Besides, if they would be happy to be with him, he didn't necessarily ruin them. They'd be happy around him, and he'd be happy too. That was all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made up my mind.\" He declared with a surge of confidence.Eyes as hard as granite stared into his partner's, \"It's about time things go my way. I've been bullied, ridiculed and ignored enough. If people don't like the kind Jaune Arc, then they'll be forced to like the new one. And for that, I'll need my trustworthy amazons at my side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha nodded fervently, \"Anything you say, Jaune! As long as I get to be by your side, I will follow you to hell and back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Besides, it's partially your idea.\" Jaune smirked as he eyed her sculpted muscles. He regarded her round biceps for a few moments, \"And we'll need the muscle -- figuratively and literally -- to make this plan work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's something I have plenty of.\" The redhead chuckled confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove her point, Pyrrha sauntered over to the nearby dresser, swinging her hips from left to right, which made her firm glutes shake sensually. The blonde was pleased with ripped her backside was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe champion threw her beefy arms around the furniture and gripped it tight, muscles tensing in response. With an audible grunt she lifted the whole dresser, carrying the supplies inside with little effort, as she showed off her impressive strength to her crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? This is actually quite easy for me, yet few people could hope to match my feat.\" Pyrrha stated happily, before dropping the furniture to the ground again. It landed with a dull thud, and the wood was cracked where her fingers had dug in. The red-haired muscle girl turned to face him, \"I can also feel that my aura reserves have increased dramatically, so my muscles are pretty much invulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune hummed appreciatively. She wasn't the only who felt different though. As weird as it sounded, he could feel some kind of connection to the tall girl in the room, as if he could sense her very presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be the link between their souls. Jaune knew it to be true; his aura practically glowed from her in a certain sense, and while giving her an incredible power boost, it also allowed him to feel her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove. Loyalty. Devotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were among a few that Pyrrha felt for him. His Semblance hadn't simply augmented her crush on him, but had also assured complete control over her. Physical power in exchange for one's mental autonomy; that was his Semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pleased smile formed on his face, \"Pyrrha, stand perfectly still for me.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPyrrha quickly obliged as she stood up as straight as an Atlas soldier saluting his superior. The redhead's body was perfect. From the way her muscles were sculpted to how they enhanced her already sensual curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune stepped forward and began to rub his hands all over her body. He groped and squeezed whatever he could, touching Pyrrha without asking her if she thought it was appropriate, because he knew she believed so. The young knight could sense her excitement surge as he felt her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing how hard her muscles were, yet so soft because of her velvety skin. His hands dipped lower, feeling the sinews of her broad legs and the gentle curves of her defined quads. Jaune smirked devilishly as he suddenly spanked her muscle butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" His partner gasped -- though not of displeasure -- and blushed prettily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he expected; her ass was incredibly toned, but that made it all the juicier. The transformation had caused her glutes to swell larger and become firmer, but a small layer of fat had been left behind to accentuate her bottom. Jaune liked that. After all, her muscular butt was irresistible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyrrha, I want you to flex your biceps for me.\" He ordered her, getting more excited by the second. He just couldn't get enough of her amazon appearance, \"Flex them hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Jaune.\" The champion fighter gave him an honest smile and complied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her beefy arms, the tendons in her forearms tightening as she made two fists, and then tensed them for her. Two large orbs sprang up immediately. Veins crisscrossed over the striated muscles, and Jaune quickly reached out to touch them. His fingers caressed the warm muscle, feeling how dense and hard they truly were. Not only that, but Jaune figured they had to be over 18 inches big. Maybe 20 in total. Pyrrha was definitely a professional bodybuilder at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jaune, your hands feel so good on my huge muscles.\" Pyrrha moaned audibly. The red-haired huntress' cheeks were flushed and her breathing was heavy. The link established by his semblance allowed him to pick up on her feelings of pure love, \"If I had known you liked big women, I would have worked out every day for you. Growing my muscles until I'm the strongest and buffest person in the whole kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune whistled appreciatively, \"Honestly, I think you're almost there. There are guys like Yatsu, but I've never heard of a girl as big as you. And I should know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll grow even stronger than him! Anything to be your perfect dream girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha grunted as she increased her efforts, flexing her arms even more. The veins that crawled across them pulsed. The striations became a tiny bit deeper too. Pyrrha's green eyes were shut tight as she bared her teeth, forcing her brawny biceps to expand further! Jaune watched with rapid attention as the peaks of her biceps took on an inch and a half, throbbing with untapped potential. Eventually she stopped and let her arms rest at her sides, panting from the exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an incredible display, Pyrrha!\" Jaune said, looking at her bulging muscles with newfound appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being somewhat winded, Pyrrha was still able to smile, \"I'm glad to hear that. Someone like you only deserves the best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was then that Jaune distinctly perceived that his power was evolving and was speechless when he realized how his semblance had changed. The fire-red-haired Amazon noticed the boy's gaze, asking him worried what he had. Jaune, smiling enthusiastically, replied to Pyrrha:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pyrrha! I know it sounds crazy ... but I feel my power has evolved! Now I can change the very fabric of reality around the girls I grow up, as if they had always been tall, muscular and in love with me!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Seriously?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular girl exclaimed. To prove to his rider that he was telling the truth, the blonde drew once again on his appearance, this time to change the reality around the girl. First of all, their room became slightly larger and the size of Pyrrha's bed increased a lot, until there was enough space to contain all her powerful and beautiful body. The remains of the uniform torn by the growth and power of the Amazon dissolved into bright dust, as if they had never existed. Then, on the powerful and sensual body of Pyrrha, new clothes appeared out of nowhere that were consoling to his current state of war semididea. The chest was wrapped in a spandex bandeau bra, without straps, red and with gold trim. She bandaged her breasts so tightly that it looked like a second skin, with a prominent and provocative draining. The golden figure of a rampant lioness was sewn on the back of the bra. Shorts appeared in the lower part of her body, the same material and colors as that of her bra, which came to cover just a quarter of the powerful thighs, wrapping her shapely goddess buttocks in a sensuously tight way. On both sides of the shorts two lionesses and roaring heads were sewn, which seemed to come to life thanks to Pyrrha's prominent muscles and curves. His hands found themselves wearing fingerless gloves, the same material and colors as the rest of the clothing set that he was receiving as a gift from his beloved Jaune, with golden lioness heads on everyone's back. Finally the legs wore spandex legwarmers with the same colors and the usual lioness heads. They wrapped like a second skin, the calves up to below the knee, leaving it barefoot. Those clothes, especially the bra and shorts, seemed to be designed to tighten the parts of the body they wrapped around terribly as an anaconda, but did not cause pain, torment or annoyance, but pleasure, lust and sensuality, as if that heavenly constriction tightened and strengthened the muscles . Pyrrha sensed it and got excited, admiring the clothes that his beloved had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Oh, Jaune ... this sports uniform is fantastic ... mmm ... it's like feeding the fire of love he felt for you ...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon moaned smiling, biting her lips in pleasure and embracing her own body. She also realized that her beloved had also given a personal touch to her hair, making it longer, red and bright and making it weave into a single braid that descended over the left shoulder. After stopping to draw on her semblance and admiring her contorted woman like a goddess in love for a few minutes, Jaune took a framed photo on her desk to show it to her, saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>See, Pyrrha? This is proof that I really changed reality, at least as far as you and your new body are concerned!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon recognized the photo almost immediately, which was taken in the courtyard of their school. In the original reality, the photo portrayed Ren smiling and placing his arms folded in his usual stoic but gentle air, with Nora embracing him around his neck, making an eye with his usual cheerful and smiling child's face, with Pyrrha and Jaune alongside who smiled like two good friends but thanks to the semblance of the latter, the image had been drastically changed. In the photo, while Ren and Nova seemed to have remained unchanged, Pyrrha appeared in her new form of tall and muscular Amazon, including her new sporty outfit, while she was intent on doing a bodybuilding pose on her knees and flexing her arms, raising her biceps like mountains, while behind her Jaune gently wrapped her arms around her neck, smiling lovingly, as if she had just found paradise. Pyrrha was excited and moved to see that photograph, then gave Jaune a smile and gave him a loving hug, delicate and powerful at the same time, as a sign of admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jaune is fantastic ... not only have you made my body powerful and helped my heart to open up for you, but you have made my life fantastic ...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said it, the Amazon's mind was hit by the \"memories\" of the new reality. These memories came alongside those of the original reality without ever suppressing each other. From birth, the girl possessed an enviable muscular potential, a beauty capable of conquering men and women, as well as a divine sensual sensitivity, all three surpassed only by her nobility of mind. When he entered the Beacon Academy, students could not avoid giving him looks of admiration, envy and desire, both from boys and girls. Only in Jaune, when he met him for the first time, did he manage to win his heart, after the latter had confessed to him that he loved strong and muscular and beautiful women at the same time. It was another fact, however, that left her surprised! If in the original reality Jaune was poor in combat and was always targeted by bullies, in the modified one things were different. The blonde's battle skills were in fact far superior, equal to those of an elite student of the Beacon, so much so as to be able to keep even Cardin and the rest of his friends in line and it was popular almost when Pyrrha, who had put together only a few days after their first meeting at school. The Amazon looked surprised at Jaune's face and, judging by his gaze and smile, it was clear that he too had become aware of the latest changes due to the use of his semblance. Moreover, always according to the new reality, he was even an expert in satisfying a girl's sensual desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wow, Pyrrha! Maybe I won't be able to use my skills to make myself big and muscle, but every time I upgrade a new Amazon, I become more and more skilled and prepared in battle! I could even become the best Beacon hunter, plus my charisma on the girls will increase accordingly.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Oh yes, Jaune! You deserve this and more, my beloved! You deserve everything and even more!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon exclaims happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Remember Pyrrha! Only you and I know the truth about my power! For everyone else, this new reality is the one they have always known, they can't realize what changes I make on girls, at least that I don't want to! You understand that, don't you?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Don't worry, honey! It will be our little secret! The only thing I want is to love you and make you the happiest man in the world ...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>So, Pyrrha ... know that you are doing a great job so far ...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys looked at each other with loving joy and full of desire. He gently brought his lips close to those of the Amazon, who the latter had gently lifted him by the hips, making them lift their feet off the ground a little, and both exchanged a beautiful kiss, and both closed their eyes to enjoy the magical moment. Jaune, probably always because of the changes due to the use of her semblance, knew which points of her beloved's beautiful muscle body to touch, making her moan with desire and pleasure. For Jaune, finally discovering his semblance and using it to finally have a fantastic life was the most beautiful thing in life that had ever happened to him and he wanted to enjoy it to the fullest!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>3482/5000<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of tender and sensual intimacy, Jaune decided that the time had come to plan to recruit new Amazons through her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Do you think Pyrrha? You will soon have sisters!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy said with indescribable enthusiasm. Pyrrha, even if he tried not to show it, his heart was divided by a bitter bit of doubt. On the one hand, he was happy to have Amazonian sisters with whom to have fun and, together, to serve Jaune's happiness with loving loyalty. On the other hand, however, she feared that if there were other strong, muscular, tall and beautiful Amazons like her, she could risk being bound only as one of the boy's many concubines and this did not find him right at the bottom, even if now his will was dominated by the latter. After all, she had truly fallen in love with Jaune before the power of Jaune manifested itself, her feelings for him were pure and sincere, that her ascent as an Amazon goddess had only amplified beyond belief. Those of the future Amazons would have been dictated only by Jaune's power and will! In short, Pyrrha realized that she was jealous for the prospect of having to share her love for Jaune on equal terms with other girls, only because they would be transformed into Amazons like her, whose souls would be linked to their new master. Something she wouldn't have endured! Suddenly she realized that Jaune was looking at her and remembered then that he had acquired, thanks to the use of his semblance, the ability to understand the girls' wishes and feelings. He had already understood, looking into the eyes of his first rider, what passed in the heart of the latter. Pyrrha blushed and suddenly felt unable to bear the gaze of her beloved and covered her face with her hands and began to cry in shame, sitting on her bed. For a few seconds that seemed minute, she felt unworthy to be the Amazon her Jaune wanted, to be able to bask in the love he felt for her, to be able to contribute to her happiness with muscles, power and beauty as a goddess that had been given to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pyrrha ...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn hearing Jaune's voice, so calm, tender and full of understanding, the Amazon awoke from the warmth of self-pity and looked towards him. The blond looked at her and smiled at him with the sweetness of an understanding father and a romantic lover. Then he sat down next to the muscular girl and began to caress the voluminous braid of his beloved, making her blush, no longer with shame, but with sweet passion. Then he started talking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Forgive me ... I had no intention of making you feel uneasy at the idea that you would no longer be the only Amazon by my side. Know, however, that even if I am surrounded by hundreds or thousands of muscular girls, you will not only be my first rider and bodyguard for me ... you will be my queen for me, while the others will be simple concubines in your comparison. I will pour my admiration and affection into them, but I will give you all my love and passion, because you are ... my invincible goddess. For the other Amazons you will be their older sister, leader, mother and alpha, and you will be able to command all of them, both as soldiers and as concubines.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing those sweet words, Pyrrha felt again in seventh heaven, smiled and dried her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Furthermore \u2026</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune continued, as he got up from the bed and stood in front of his beloved, with a smile of adorable mischievousness that would make his heart melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Just to make sure that future Amazons consider you their supreme leader ...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he knew that he didn't need physical contact to use his powers, Jaune put his hands on Pyrrha's breast, massaging him with tenderness so determined that the girl moaned with aphrodisiac pleasure. Drawing on his power, Jaune again wrapped his beloved in the white aura. Pyrrha felt the shiver once again, the warmth and finally the growth ... he closed his eyes to enjoy the moment, madly biting his lips for the lustful pleasure that those feelings caused him. His muscles and sinuous curves grew larger, stronger and more sensual, doubling. Jaune was unlikely excited to feel the breasts under his hands growing like beach balls. With the boy's powers, Pyrrha's new sports uniform adapted to the new growth, but it also became more tight and tight, causing the girl a pleasant torture. When he decided it was enough, Jaune cut off his power and let go of his beloved's breast, who continued to stifle amiable moans of pleasure. She too, after a while, began to massage her breasts wildly, with the grace of a goddess in love. The boy could not help but admire the muscular queen of her heart as she basked in the lust of her own body. Then he politely ordered him to stand up and she performed without rebelling. The boy felt once again that his warrior and playboy skills had once again increased thanks to the new growth of the Amazon. Almost breathless, Jaune admired a muscular goddess, about ten feet tall, stronger and more muscular than any person in the world, whose sensual and shapely beauty made even adult women look like little girls. The Amazon looked at his beloved with lustful devotion and affectionate loyalty, folding both arms for him, making his biceps grow up to forty inches! She then went to her knees, thus allowing the boy to caress those mountains of flesh and power. To the touch those biceps were soft, but also hard and strong like steel, making the boy more excited than he already was! This of course cheered the red-haired amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You will see Pyrrha! All the other Amazons we will recruit will have only 70% of what you now own: Muscles, beauty, power and sensuality!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy said excitedly, continuing to caress the muscles of his rider with loving care. The girl then whispered in Jaune's ear, with the sweet and benevolent tone of a temptress:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Let's 85% treasure ... so we would both have more fun ... and they too ...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the words of his first Amazon, Jaune was looking forward to giving him sisters worthy of his strength and sensuality, and thus creating something that would become both a legion and a Harem. He only had to decide who would be the first chosen of his gift.</span></div></div>",
