Others may also survived, but no one knows where they are since all the people were separated by the crash except for those three girls. In order to protect themselves, they had they bag that is full of clothes with them. Therefore, when then left the plane, the three girls had some clothes with them. They stayed on some kind of wood and began to flow. Several hours later, the girls found something weird---their body are getting tickled somehow when the water get on their body. Pretty soon, the girls are laying on the piece of woon and laughing like crazy. \"Hahahahaha....hahahaha....hahahaha...my feet..hahahaha...hahaha...\" Then, they began to itch their body. But they were too ticklish to have enough power to take off their shoes. Luckily, another hour later, they arrived on the island. They began to change clothes and shoes. Since it is at noon, pretty soon, their clothes dried out.<br>\r\nWhat are they going to do then?</span></div></div>",

When they were still in the sea, they already have a big idea about how the island like. It is all surrounded by the beach (absolutely, it is an island), and in the middle of the island, there is a huge forest. Beside the forest, there is jungle. On the other side of the island, there is a really high mountain. Beside the mountain, there is a valley. Then, Leslie and Kelly begins to talk about where to go, and Alice is pick up the dry clothes. Since those two girls are all barefoot (they have shoes in the bag, they are on the beach now) and their feet are always covered in boots or sneakers, an \"evil\" idea comes up to her mind. She decides to tickle the girls feet. Slowly sneaks to the girls, Alice is then ready to attack. Suddenly, she grabs Leslie's feet and begins to tickle her. \"hahahaha..stop..hahahah, Alice, hahahaha...I know it's you..hahahahaha..stop..hahahaha.\" As Leslie is begging, Alice stops her tickling. \"You know I am extremely ticklish, aren't you?\" says Leslie with several drops of tear in her eyes, but only Alice sees that. \"So..sorry, I don't know that.\" answers Alice, feeling guilty. \"Well, put your feet on my lap, I will forgive you.\" says Leslie, with a evil smile in her face. \"A..Ah? Ok.\" Alice doesn't realize that she is in Leslie's trap. She then put her feet on Leslie's trap. Quickly tug off the sneakers Alice put on just now, Leslie gives Alice some tickle on her soles. \"hahahahahahaha...hahahahaha..\" laughs Alice. \"Well, now, we are balanced.\" says Leslie. \".......\" Alice is getting a little angry, but she also feels it so funny. <br>\r\nAfter the some tickle fight, the girls put on their socks and shoes.<br>\r\nLeslie is now wear a pair of high-top converse sneakers. (I am sorry to use the name from B2T, but I love B2T), with her ankle socks, jeans and t-shirt.<br>\r\nAlice is wearing her boots, ankle socks, shorts and her t-shirt.<br>\r\nKelly is also wearing her boots, they are like winter boots, but thinner than winter boots. She likes ankle socks too, but she does have some pantyhose in her bag. But now, she has her bare feet in the boots. She is wearing skinny jeans and t-shirt. <br>\r\nNow, they decides to go separately, because they can ask others for help if one is in trouble. Although there is no signal on the island, their cellphones have super bluetooth. Therefore, they can communicate with each others easily. The battery for cellphone can be charged with solar energy, so they don't need to worry about the power.<br>\r\nAnyway, who are you going to be?</span></div></div>",

But then, your mind comes back to where to go again.On your side, there are only the jungle, beach and the forest. You don't know what there are inside the forest, it can be nice or dangerous. It seems that the beach is safe enough, but the sea water is really weird. You don't know if there will be some weird creature in the sea or not. The jungle looks wet, and it is wet.

There are a lot of big trees, but not a lot of bugs. That's kind of nice. Then, you enters the jungle. After walking for a while, you find something weird. When you are walking, it gets harder and harder to move for another step. \"oops.\" You think. Just as you think, you are sinking. Soon, your shoes and feet are inside the mud. It is not really mud, more like slime. Then, you feel that something is pulling you shoes. Since your shoes are really loose, the bottom of the shoes soon leave the soles of you feet. But luckily, right before the thing pull your shoes away completely from you, your toes clamp them. \"Geez.\" You think. But then, something is now tickling your soles. \"hahahahaha...hahahahaha..help!!..hahahha\" you are laughing loudly, hoping someone can hear you. Although you have the cellphone, you totally forgot it. Suddenly, a vine wraps on your waist and pulls you up from the slime kind of mud. Your shoes are still stuck between your toes. When you are just trying to relax, another vine wraps you ankle together. \"no!! hahahahah..hahahaha...hahaha..not..hahahaha..my..hahahahah...fee..hahaha...feet. ..hahaha..\" you are tickled on your feet the next moment. Then, you think about you shoes.\"my shoes, if I put them on, my feet will be safe.\" you say to yourself. But unfortunately, your converse sneakers just fell on the ground and you are about a meter high in the air now. You cannot get it! You then feel hopeless. You don't want to be tickled forever on this island. But soon, an idea comes to your mind. Although the vines are still tickling your feet, you are focusing on your shoes so that it doesn't feel that ticklish then. You begins to swing and eventually, you get you shoes back on your hand. Quickly hit the vines with your hand to keep them away from your feet for a second, you put your shoes back on. Just as you expect, the vines cannot do anything to your feet when you have your shoes on. Finally, the vines give up. Then, you are free again!<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do next?</span></div></div>",

This is really not something that would take long but for Leslie, this process takes forever, only because her feet are so ticklish and the grass keeps tickling her when she is tying her shoelace. Finally, a few minutes later, Leslie finishes the lace of her left sneaker. But at this point of time, she hears something. *sha*sha*pluhhh*sha*. It sounds like something stepping on fallen leaves, but the *pluhhh* sounds like a bird flips its wings. But anyhow, this is not a good time for Leslie to stay there and try to figure out what this sound is. She decides to hide in the tree, so that the creature cannot find her. She slowly, and quietly goes towards a bunch of trees, but on her way there, she finds the lace of her right converse is tangled on a big stick. It is so tangled that if she wants to untie it, she would have to spend another two minutes, which she does not have.<br>\r\nWhat can she do?</span></div></div>",

It is so agile, totally not affected by its big body size. Right after that, it turns its head up and makes a really high and loud piping sound. You put your hand on your ears and try to prevent the noise from getting into you ear, but it doesn't work well as expected. You feel so weak, and you sight begins to blur. You cannot control your body, even though the sound is over. You sit down on the grassy forest floor, and stretch out you legs, gasping. Of course, while you are doing that, the bird is walking towards you. And apparently, you do not realize that. The high sound is quite harmful to human, and your brain is not working properly right now. It probably won't take you long to recover from that, but clearly the last thing you have is time. A few second later, the bird is standing right before you. It bend down its neck, and aiming its pointy beak at you. Its beak reach down to your tummy and scratching lightly on your belly. Again!? Tickling!? You get awake from the faint. Same time, you burst into laughter. But that's not the worst part. It seems the bird is not satisfied with your laughter, it decides to \"wing you\". It bites on you t-shirt, and rips it apart, leaving only underwear on your upper body. You scream:\" No!!! That's my only shirt!!!\". But the bird does not care about you protest. It reaches down its wings and brushes it on you tummy. The only two thing you can do now is laugh and shift backwards on the grass. But neither way helps you. This tickling lasts for a little while.

It seems to be working, the hard gel splitting and cracking around your foot.  Sensing success is near, you redouble your efforts, violently hammering at the gel for everything you're worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt finally shatters as you bring your foot up against the top of it again, the cracking sound almost covering your squeal of delight.  With your sudden freedom, the gel hand finally retreats, sucked away as the main flow of gel passes you by, leaving a black layer of gel on the ground behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the gel is safely away from your tree, you lower yourself onto a 'V'-shaped spot where two branches grow, seating yourself comfortably in the base of the 'V'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling secure, you examine your left converse.  The toe has completely melted, and the gooey, warm rubber has pushed between your toes, slowly hardening as it dries.  You attempt to wiggle your toes, and find it much harder than usual.  You groan as you realize you'll have to sacrifice your sock if you don't want your toes glued to the inside of your shoe.  Reluctantly, you reach through the open toe of your converse, grab the toe of your sock, and pull it off.  A shriek of laughter escapes you, as your warm, hypersensitive sole reacts to the rough-feeling cotton being yanked across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the sole of your left foot up, and look at it.  The gel managed to melt a hole through the rubber around the ball of your foot, framing the ball of your pinkish, hypersensitive foot through the rubber.  The rest of the sole of your shoe is smooth, and feels rather thin.  It's obviously much weaker than it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least your shoelace is still intact.  You let your feet dangle, the slight breeze from their movement tickling the toes and ball of your left foot, and caressing your right foot.  You grin, as you think back to the thrill you had felt yesterday, letting your shoes flop around on this ticklish island, risking their loss.  Well, you've managed to lose both your socks, and one sneaker, and almost get the other one destroyed.  You smile at that.  Getting back to your bag on the beach will be fun, to say the least!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the gel again, remembering suddenly that Kelly and Alice were supposed to be coming for you.  Worry courses through you, and you text them both, getting no response.  Part of you yearns to try to find them now, while another part of you says it would be wiser to wait until the gel has hardened...</span></div></div>",

Besides, its not like the grass has managed to tickle her for more than a brief second before her foot returns to her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Leslie continues on her way, slight giggles escaping her lips with every step, as grass brushes against her sock-clad soles.  Her toes scrunch slightly inside her converse, just barely enough to keep her feet within her shoes as she walks.  What Leslie doesn't notice is that, as she walks, the friction of her heels dragging against the inside of her converse is beginning to slide her ankle socks down her heels, little by little.

It's nearly waist-high, and she won't be able to just step over it.  Looking to the sides, all she can see is vine-covered tree trunks, and brush too thick to just walk through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she steps up to the log, Leslie is surprised to feel some grass tickling the bare arch and heel of her foot!  She squeals in surprise, half-shuffling her foot forward to get away from it, nearly losing it in the process!  She looks down at her feet, and realizes her converses are almost completely unlaced at this point, the laces trailing behind her feet.  She then carefully lifts her right heel out of it's shoe, and spots her sock balled around the arch of her foot.  How had she not noticed that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looks back to the log in front of her.

Looking down, she could see they were her favorite pair of old low-top Converses, the ones she'd had for years.  She gave another slight squeal of excitement at seeing them, happy that they hadn't been lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in the sand next to them, quickly stripping off her remaining shoe and sock, then brushing the sand from her bare soles.  As she pulled them onto her bare feet, her excitement waned a bit.  As attached to these shoes as she was, they were old, and her friends often asked her why she kept such a ratty pair of shoes, when she had newer ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoes showed every bit of wear and tear she'd put them through.  They'd been worn everywhere from beaches to hikes in the mountains to shopping trips in the city, and they'd been beaten and battered as a result.  Both shoes were riddled with holes and tears, and their soles were completely worn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie looked at the shoes as she loosely tied their laces.  They were too small for her, and the only reasons she could still wear them were the splits on either side of her toes. and her love for wearing her Converses loosely enough she could slide her feet out at will.  On the inside, the splits were nearly three inches long, running from the backs of the rubber toecaps nearly halfway down her arches.  The outer splits were two-and-a-half inches long, running from the toecaps back behind the balls of her feet, her little toes completely exposed through the splits.  Even loosely tied, the splits stretched upwards, clearly showing the pink skin of her feet through them, the remaining stitching straining to contain her feet.  Two smaller splits showed at the backs of her heels, giving faint glimpses of the pink skin behind them as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd worn through the soles at the balls of her feet long ago, and a pair of half-dollar sized holes clearly showed the balls of her feet on the inner portion of the sole, as well as the space beneath her big toes.  Two large cracks ran completely across the balls of her feet, the only thing keeping the part beneath her toes attached to the shoes were the rubber strips that ran around the soles.  The remainder of the soles were paper-thin, worn completely smooth by time and near-continuous wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she knew these shoes were on their last legs, she still kept them, and wore them.  Despite the numerous splits and holes, they were still the most comfortable shoes she owned, and she'd sworn she'd wear them until they fell off her feet.  Even on this ticklish island, where those splits and holes made her vulnerable to tickling, they still brought her comfort, and lifted her spirits some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking herself from her brief reverie, Leslie stood, leaving her other Converse and sock lying on the sand, and traced the trail with her eyes into the...</span></div></div>",

If she was to find what had taken her bag, she'd have to follow the trail, and deal with the humidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her beloved, battered Converses one more time, wiggled her toes, then set off across the sand towards where the trail met the edge of the jungle.  It took all of a few steps for her previous sense of excitement to wane a bit, as she felt grainy flooding into her shoes through the holes in their soles and the splits in their sides.  Comfortable and familiar as they were, they definitely weren't going to keep her completely safe from whatever ticklish traps lurked in the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked into the shade at the edge of the jungle, she sighed slightly, both at the temporary coolness, and as she felt the gritty sand giving way to damp dirt that stuck to the exposed portions of the balls of her soles.  It wasn't something that she had really paid attention to before.  In fact, she had quietly enjoyed being able to feel those slight changes in the ground underfoot, despite wearing shoes.  Now, though, she felt...conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, she knew it would be easier to tickle her feet than it had been before.  On the other hand, it felt a lot like one-upping her earlier risk-taking, and another slight thrill of excitement wriggled its' way through her, somewhat offsetting her trepidation.  If she had made it as far as she had, first with her shoes coming unlaced, then with one bare foot, why couldn't she make it just as far with these shoes, holes and all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning slightly at that thought, she pressed deeper into the jungle, feeling, and resisting, the faint tickles on the balls of her feet, as the air and ground around her grew steadily wetter, carefully tracing the footprints in the soft earth.  The jungle pressed in closer to her, vines beginning to snake up massive trees, and the undergrowth growing much thicker, as she continued on.  As sweat began to trickle across her brow again, she came to a rather muddy patch.  She lost the trail there for a moment, then spotted it again on the far side, though she couldn't figure out where the footprints had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a quick look around, and decided there was one of two things her quarry had done.  It had either swung from some low-hanging vines above the mud, or it had cut off through the brush, where the ground was firmer, though she couldn't see any trace of its' trail in the brush from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the options posed their own problems, especially as some of the vines around her seemed to be writhing a bit.  She knew the ground itself, and the plants as well, were likely to tickle her, and that made simply going through the mud seem the best bet.  However, knowing what she did, she also couldn't rule out the mud itself being some kind of trap, and that thought disturbed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with what seemed to be a lose-lose-lose set of choices, she chooses to...</span></div></div>",

It was much cooler, and thicker, than she had expected.  That thought was replaced a moment later with a spontaneous giggle, as its' cool caress turned to a much more ticklish sensation, as it oozed down her sole, and started squeezing between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there for a moment, her foot sinking a bit deeper, before she realized she needed to move quickly, and try to keep as much of the mud as she could out of her shoes.

She could feel the laces on her shoes loosening a little, every time she pulled them free of the mud, that ominous slurping sound accompanying every step forward, as her heels popped free with every step.  What she didn't realize, though, was what that slurping sound had covered, the faint sounds of her already-weakened shoes slowly pulling her shoes apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Leslie, she was out of the mud fairly quickly, thought it wasn't as fast as she had originally thought.  Strangely, as she set foot on more solid ground, she could feel the mud ooze back out of the gaps in her shoes, back into the patch of mud behind her.  As thankful as she was for that, she couldn't ignore how the ticklish sensations hadn't left the toes of her left foot at all.  As the rest of her foot, and all but the ball of her right foot, had been relieved of the ticklish sensations, she was luckily able to suppress her laughter to giddy little giggles every time the toes of her left foot hit the damp dirt underfoot.  Finding a log that at least had a little space between it and the brush and vines, she plopped her butt down on it, and took a quick look at her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer left shoe was worse off than her right, probably because she'd stood on it for that extra moment, letting it sink into the mud.  The sole of her shoe had been torn free of her shoe at the front, leaving her foot exposed from toes to ball, and about an inch of it behind the ball of her foot hung limply, pulled free of the rubber edging.  The splits along the sides of the upper had spread, too, coming within an inch and a half of merging with the also much-expanded heel split, which now encompassed almost her entire heel.  Her entire left arch was now exposed, along with almost all of her out-step.  Her right shoe had fared better, the sole still being there, though definitely looser where the split crossed it.  The splits had grown too, though not as drastically as on her left shoe.  Both of them had come untied, and partially unlaced.  She noticed in passing, though, that the mud had left her skin clean, and the dirt didn't seem to be sticking like it had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tied her shoes again, as tightly as she dared this time.  The splits in her left shoe gaped obscenely, allowing her to tie it a bit tighter than the right one, though she was quite ginger with how she pulled the laces.  She resolved, as she tied her shoes, to avoid any other muddy patches she encounters, as she seriously doubted her shoes would survive another encounter like that.  She needed to find the thief, and fast, before the jungle managed to leave her barefoot in its' ticklish embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood, she felt a sensation behind her, and spun around to find a mass of vines had crept up behind her while she was assessing her shoes!  With a half-squeal, half-giggle, she took a half-step back as the vines reached towards her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she escape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But at this moment, the vine drops the phone, rockets toward you and wrap you on you waist. The vine lifts you up in the air, about 4 feet off the ground. Right in front of you, from the bushes, gracefully walks out a girl with pointy ears. On her back a quiver is held, and in her hand is a bow. She has some clothing on, but they are made of leaves. On her feet is a pair of sandals, and it seems like the sandals are from a human society. It's an elf. \"Elf!? Do elves really exist?\" Although you were scared by the vines at the beginning, this emotion is now replaced by stun. \"Yes, I am an elf and I am the lord of this portion of forest, where is bushes circles around.\" The elf has quite some pride. As Kelly has heard something about elves. Some elves have the ability to communicate tree, and some can communicate with water, or something else. Apparently, this one can communicate with plants. \"What have you done to Leslie!!?\" After the stun, Kelly's mind is now filled with anger. She wants to save her friend. \"Oh, that ticklish girl with those odd footwear in you hands, she is over there. She deserves this, how dare she try to steal things from my land. And you, you'd better worry about yourselves.\" After saying this, the elf keeps her mouth shut. Kelly looks the way she points at, seeing Leslie lying on a wooden bed, tied by vines. Her shirt is sitting on the ground, and her socks are missing. Leslie's eyes are shut tightly. Kelly angrily turns her head back and look at the elf's eyes, trying to see through her. At this moment, the elf speaks again, \"Don't waste you power, save some for laughing. And by the way, I suddenly feel like that I need to have some new clothes, and yours look good. I guess, you should take them off for me, or I can do it for you.\"</span></div></div>",

Same time, another two vines wrap around each of Kelly's legs, leaving her very little space to move. \"You stupid elf, I dare you have a fight with me!\" Shouts Kelly. \"I will, but you will regret then.\" says the elf, calmly. Following her voice, the forth vine come out from the tree and takes off Kelly's shirt. \"Stop it! No, hahaha--haha,no--haha\" protests Kelly, but it doesn't work. But the worst thing is, after her shirt is off, the vine on her waist begins to tickle her belly button and the other vine begins to tickle her armpits. \"Haha, stop--hahaha, you--hahaha--bi--haha--bitch--hahaha\" Kelly cannot resist the tickling, she is too ticklish to handle it. While she is laughing hard, the elf walk towards her, then stops right before her. The elf put one hand on her right boot, moves along her leg, up and down, and finally stops at the ankle. \"You know, if I have these, I will be able to conquer more land. Thank you for bringing these to me.\" While saying that, she hold the boot tightly and pull it downwards. The boot slides along Kelly's leg, tickles her a little. Finally, her boot gets taken off her foot completely, revealing a tiny size 5 foot. The elf strokes her right foot, making Kelly laugh even louder. Kelly tries to kick her with that foot, but the elf catches it. \"Bad, bad girl. How come you are not wearing those thing stuff you are friend is wearing. And, how dare you try to kick me. You will be punished for this.\" says the elf, and quickly, she pulls the other boot off Kelly's feet. Same time, the two vines that wraps around Kelly's legs now are coming for her feet. The end of the vines strokes lightly on her feet at the beginning. \"Hahaha--no--my--haha-my--haha--boots--haha.\" Kelly's laughter shows her fear. She tries to kick away the vines, but she fails. One vine now ties tightly on her left big toe and the other one tickles between her toes of her left foot. \"Nooo-haha-hahahaha.\" By now, Kelly cannot even finish a whole word. The elf taps on her right sole a few times then says, \"Thank you for your stuff, you and your friend will be released in a few hours. Bye\"<br>\r\nThen, the elf turns around and start to walk away.</span></div></div>",

A few seconds after that, a laughing sounds comes out from the bushes. \"Nooo-hahahahaha, no--hahaha, hahaha.\" It is so beautiful to Kelly. Because during the talking, she figures that the elf can only control the plants in the area they are in, and the bushes are not part of those plants she can control. Of course, then the bushes will tickle her it she falls into those. Since the elf is tickled so hard that the only thing she knows is laughing, the vines release Kelly and Leslie. Kelly retrieves Leslie's converse and put them on her feet, but only temporarily, because she needs to get her stuff back. She pull on the shoes and walks towards the elf. The elf is actually in a terrible situation, for her. The grass sneaks under her soles in the sandals and brushes her feet. Her leaves-made shirt is totally ripped by the bushes. Her smooth bare legs are covered dirt that vibrates which tickles her a lot. In the elf's hand are Kelly's boots and Leslie's socks. Kelly grabs her boots and Leslie's socks, decide to leave. But just that second, a new idea comes out of her mind. She looses the straps of the elf's sandals. \"hahaha--haha--pleasss--hahaha, don't--hahaha!\" the elf begs while laughing. As the straps are loosen, the sandals are getting taken away from the elf's feet. Within a second, the sandals are half off her feet and her heels are exposed to the grass. \"hahaha--hahaha--haha!\" The elf's voice has become a little raucous because of laughing too hard. She kicks her legs crazily and her left sandal flies off her foot and hit Leslie. <br>\r\n\"Uhh, what, just happened? haha--hahaha.\" Leslie sits up and accidentally sets her feet on the grassy floor. The grass tickles her feet, makes her laugh. <br>\r\nWhen Leslie sits up, the elf kicks off the other sandal off her foot, and it lands right into Leslie's hands. <br>\r\n\"What's this...\" wonders Leslie. <br>\r\n\"I will tell you on our way back.\" answers Kelly.<br>\r\n\"haha-hahaha--please--don't--hahaha-leave--hahahah--me--hahaha--me-- hahaha, alone--hahaha\" begs the elf. <br>\r\n\"It would be great if we get a slave to do something for us.\" Thinking about that, Kelly break a vine, ties it on the elf's hands and pulls her out. \"Thank you....\" says the elf, then she faints.</span></div></div>",

The two girls just had a little tickle fight, of course, a friendly one. Now, they are laying on the grass, expose their bare feet to the warmth of the fire, gazing at the elf and waiting for her to say something. As expected, they elf opens her mouth, \"Puny human, untie me.\" The elf says that in an angry and superior tone, making the two girls fairly uncomfortable. \"Huh, someone is quite rude. Rudeness is not a good quality for a SLAVVVVE.\" Saying that, Kelly gives a contemptuous smile. Then, she walks to the elf's bare feet. \"Wh--at, what are you doing...hahaha--haha--stop--hahaha.\" The elf was scared by Kelly's move, then laughter fills her mouth spontaneously. Kelly's fingers stroke the elf's bare feet, scratch on them occasionally. \"Pleeeeee---se--hahaha...noo-hahaha..\" The elf's feet are so ticklish that she cannot help laughing even though Kelly wasn't trying to tickle her hard. \"I wonder how you keep your feet like this in the jungle.\" Kelly sighs, but still stoking the elf's feet.

Looking at her sand covered feet, she suddenly got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly wandered around the forest, looking for the patch of vines where the elf had kicked off her shoes. \"Why does she have to be so ticklish?\" She thought aloud. Then, she saw it, the vines that had tickled her, except now they were perfectly still. She looked to the left of them and saw two leaf sandals. \"Yes!\" She cheered as she picked them up. \"Now I just have to get out of here and---Hey!\" The vines that she had thought were still had grabbed her and were pulling her toward them, two of them prying off her shoes. \"My phone.\" She thought. Kelly quickly pulled it out, trying to text with one hand. She hit four letters H-E-L-P then send. Then, she got pulled to the vines, one of them knocking the phone out of her hands. \"Hahahahahaha---stop that---hahahahahaha---noooo---haha..\" She laughed as the vines tickled her feet. Some of them tortured her soles, while others tickled her heels lightly and yet more still tickled her toes. \"Hahahahaha---stopitstopitstopit---hahaha..\" The vines began tickling between her toes, and some creeped up to tickle her thighs. \"Hahaha---not there---haha!\" Then, the vines switched tactics, tickling her belly, sides and underarms all at the same time. Kelly's feet were sensitive,  but her underarms were her true weak spot. Of course, it also didn't help that her belly and sides were ticklish too. She laughed and howled, trying to twist out of the tickling vines that held her spread eagle, but it was no use. The vines were simply too tight. \"Come on, Leslie.\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at camp, Leslie had bound the elf's hands and feet. She had tied her hands to a tree branch, so her arms hung up, and she had sat her on a log. The elf's big toes had been tied together. Leslie waited for the elf to wake up, and when she did she said,\" Sleep well?\" The elf looked around, then at the vines that held her immobile. \"You promised you wouldn't tickle me again!\" The elf protested. \"No, Kelly promised, not me.\" The elf twisted in her bonds, then gave up. \"Just get it over with.\" Leslie smiled, then pulled out two feathers. She ran them down the elf's soles. \"Hahahaha!\" The elf's feet were sensitive to the slightest touch. \"Kelly was right, how do you keep your feet like this?\" Leslie asked, continuing to tickle the elf's soles. The elf didn't respond, she was too busy laughing. Leslie dropped the feathers, instead scratching the elf's arches. \"Hahahaha---stop it human---hahahaha!\" Leslie didn't listen, of course,  to the elf's pleads. Instead she continued stroking the elf's soles for five more minutes,  then stopped abruptly. The elf hung there, panting. Then, she watched as Leslie walked to her torso. She gently squeezed the elf's sides. She yelped, then began laughing again as Leslie began tickling her ribcage, poking her fingers between her ribs. \"Hahahahaha---not there---hahaha!\" Leslie continued this for five minutes before suddenly tickling her underarms, vulnerable because her arms were hanging up. The elf hated being tickled in the armpits, it was her second most ticklish spot. \"Hahahaha---please stop---hahaha!\" Leslie spider tickled the elf's underarms for what seemed like an eternity,  but it was just for five minutes. Then, still wiggling her fingers in one underarm, she untied the elf's arms. The moment she did that, the elf clamped her arms down, then glared angrily at Leslie. She didn't seem to notice, instead walking back to her soles. She lightly tickled them while she untied her, just so she could hear the elf laugh. Then, her phone rang...</span></div></div>",
