(How it got there I will NEVER know.) The gun had a little dial on it labeled \"Turn this to how small you want to shrink something and then pull the trigger\". (It was printed in very small print.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, who would believe something like that? I thought it was a joke. So I turned the dial down to \"pretty darn tiny\" and pointed the shrinker gun at my wienerdog, Pete. I pulled the trigger and a green ray flared out of the gun barrel and zapped Pete. I threw the gun down. I was really surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first I thought Pete had disappeared. Then I heard this tiny yapping in the grass. I knelt down and there was poor little Pete, and I do mean \"little\". He was no bigger than a charm on a charm bracelet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to pick him up really carefully just using two fingers, but I guess he was just too small for that. He gave out a tiny little \"yelp!\" and I could see that he was ready for doggie heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt terrible and thought about throwing the shrinker gun away, smashing it, burying it in the woods... But then I thought, Noooo... I could have some fun with this thing. I'll just be careful not to turn the dial so far down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got a matchbox and put Pete's little corpse in it and buried him in the backyard. I said a little prayer over Pete's grave and I made a solemn vow. \"Pete,\" I said. \"Your death will be avenged.\" I'm not sure what I meant by that, since I was the one who killed him, but it made me feel better.</span></div></div>",

It was like the sun was trying to send me a message or something.  Oh well.  I don't believe in stage lighting cues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared down at the shrinking gun, letting it grow warm in my hands from the heat of my excitement and nervousness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's odd</i>, I thought to myself thoughtfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there it was, in fine, fine, minuscule print: \"Partial Shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What on earth does that mean?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sidewalk a few feet behind me, I could hear the panting sounds of the neighbor lady hobble-jogging past my house.  I turned around, ignoring the loud party mix of danger theme songs universal to television shows, gun in my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Neighbor Lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in midrun; don't know why she'd STOP if she thought I had a gun.  She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, this ole thang? It's just a toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI twirled it around.  I threw it up in the air, caught it on my nose, let it slide smoothly down my shoulder and arm, hopped it onto my knee, bopped it to my toes, and then kicked it back into my hand.  Globetrotters, watch out.  Here I come!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman from next door smiled at me like she thought I was crazy, but cool. \"Can you do that again?\" she said breathily, and not from being too unhealthy to jog for ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, yeah!  You know I can do it, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tossed it up into the air.  It hit my nose.  Fell to the ground.  Bounced up in the air again.  Went off prematurely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd shrank poor Miss Abernathy's left bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pool was like a giant lake and her bikini parts that remained floating in the water were the size of boats. The grass blades were almost as tall as her! She was also naked and vulnerable to attacks by bugs or possibly other animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me? This is not good... I gotta find mom and dad!\" The 3 inch tall naked girl thought. She ran through the grass towards the house and banged on the backdoor, \"Mom! Dad! Open up! Please!!!\" Alice squeaked. Suddenly out of the bushes came out Monty, Alice's pet dog. He ran to Alice to take a closer look at her, \"Monty! It's me, Alice! Help me get mom and dad's attention!\" The tiny teen said and pointed at the door. Unfortunately Monty did not recognize his owner and thought Alice was a toy, so he caught her with his mouth.

She came over with her tray and sat down across from me. I already had my brown bag open. It was my usual lunch - baloney on white bread with mayonnaise and a banana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarlene pushed her hand in my face and wiggled her finger. \"Look at this cool ring I found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a crackerjack prize to me,\" I said, and bit into my sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think it's a diamond. It sparkles.\" She kept gazing at it and rubbing it. Her eyes had a faraway look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" I said, \"Snap out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head and opened her eyes wide. \"It's so sparkly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well don't hypnotize yourself with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that's what was happening?\" And she giggled. She was always making fun of things I said, and maybe sometimes I was joking, but this time I was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned at her. \"I saw your eyes. You were going into a trance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just found that funny. \"Sure... Booga booga booga...\" and she rubbed the ring at me and mocked me. I couldn't resist her charms. I felt my mouth twitch into a smile and I knew I would be laughing with her. But then something happened that wiped the smiles off our faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green light like a laser beam shot out of the ring and hit my banana. Before our eyes the banana made a little squeaking noise and shrunk down to the size of a crayon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe just stared at it for a moment, then started talking at the same time. \"What was THAT?! Holy cow! Did you see that? Your banana shrunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, we couldn't figure it out. Why a ring would shrink a banana was beyond my scientific knowledge. Darlene said \"Let's ask Mr. Thompson (science teacher) about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo...\" I said. \"Let's keep this to ourselves.\" The wheels were turning in my mind. and there were suddenly lots of new possibilities in my life.</span></div></div>",

It's safe right here on my finger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, be careful, Darlene. Don't do anything dumb with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed back at me over her shoulder as she flounced away, sticking her tongue out and popping her eyes. I shook my head sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am the reasonable one in the couple. Darlene is the flake. She's fun, but uncontrolled fun can be dangerous. I was Darlene's contol. At least, that's the way I saw it. I think she knew she needed my stability to counterbalance her flightiness. But I never heard her actually say that. She was just too busy having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went on to Math and didn't think any more about the ring until the screaming started in the hallway. Of course, everybody ran to the door to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to tell you a little more about Darlene so you will understand what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarlene has a nice figure and I love it, but she doesn't have what you would call a \"big\" chest. Don't get me wrong. I love Darlene's small girls. They are soft, round, firm, and perky. No complaints from me. But nobody describing Darlene's chest would use adjectives like big, huge, large, outstanding, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I say, it doesn't matter to me, but apparently it does to Darlene. I have often detected little signs of her envy of girls with big chests - snide remarks, frowns, that kind of thing. Now back to the screams in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was a prize in our school for the girl with the biggest chest, the trophy would go to Marba Chanelle. So it was shocking to see her running down the hall and instead of the usual bounce show - nothing! I mean she might as well have been a boy. No wonder she was screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't just her. Four of the biggest girls in school were running right behind her, and it was a bounce-free environment. A babble of voices erupted around me and questions were flying. What? How? Why? Who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh! I thought. I had an idea of who the \"who\" might be - a certain envious impulsive female who had recently found an interesting ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was the responsible half of the couple. \"No, Darlene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up from the swing. \"You know what will happen if you don't give me that ring, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran though me. She was threatening to break up with me. But this is important to us, I thought. I touched her arm. \"It's for the best, Darlene. You'll thank me later for keeping the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snatched her arm away from me. \"I ... don't ... think so.\" She opened her front door, went in, closed it, and I heard the distinct \"click!\" of the deadbolt being locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and started back to my house. What did I care? Let her break up with me...  Then I thought about my life before Darlene -- the lonely geek with no girlfriend. I was just about out of her yard when I stopped and rethought the situation. Was it worth it to lose her over the stupid ring?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around and trudged back up the walk to her door. I knocked. The door opened a crack. Her hand came out, palm up. I dropped the ring in it. She opened the door all the way and put her arms around my neck. \"Thanks, Stevie. I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you,\" I said, and we kissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me in the morning,\" she said, smiling. She was happy now with her victory over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I said. See ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, going to bed, I let out a big sigh. Being a little love slave wrapped around Darlene's thumb wasn't good for my ego. But I didn't want to go back to being a lonely geek. Why did she always win? Just once I'd like to call her bluff. But she was so cute. What if I pushed her away and she ended up with someone else? No. I couldn't risk that. It would kill me. I might as well try to enjoy being a slave.</span></div></div>",

They should never have trusted me. When I found the giant chrome projector with the words \"Shrinker Ray Prototype\" scribbled on the side with a Sharpie - well, my curiosity got the better of me. \"Where's that ON/OFF switch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe switch was part of a big control panel - adjust this, adjust that.

And if you don't, Best Buy has a very generous return policy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this giant chrome shrinker gun didn't come from Best Buy, so I hesitated for a few seconds before I threw the switch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first nothing happened, then a low humming sound swept quickly up into the ultrasonic frequencies and a blinding green ray flashed right in my face. I had the sick feeling of falling and then, there I was on the floor, only a few inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed my hands together and laughed heartily. \"I knew it was a setup! The job, the lab, the whole shtick! Just to get me shrunk! Hahahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't think I was in my right mind right then. Maybe shrinking the brain has an effect on your ability to think clearly? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, does the mind have a size? You can't see it or touch it, so maybe everybody has the same size mind no matter how big or small their brain might be? Once again, I was glad to be at the California Advanced Research Laboratory, where answers to questions like that just might be found. </span></div></div>",

One of the projects at C.A.R.L. was developing a new breed of goldfish that would be tiny enough to seal in small vials of water that could be made into jewelry, a brooch for a woman to pin on her dress. Doctor Hookenline was chief investigator on the goldfish project. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the lab before I could hide and spotted me running across the floor. \"Vass is diss? A leetle teeny man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snatched a goldfish net out of his back pocket and neatly trapped me with it. \"Why... It's leetle Stevie! Why you so small, boy? Hee hee hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Hookenline! How do I get big again? I accidentally triggered the shrinker machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja, serves you right for being too nosey. Don't be so nosey, Stevie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Doc, I won't be so nosey. Just make me big again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Stevie. I got a job for you to do first. This is very lucky for me, you being so small now. You just right for the job.\" He scooped me up and dropped me in a specimen bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard him rattling around with the lab equipment, then he picked up the specimen bottle and dumped me into a new container -- a terrarium. It was spacious - for little me - and had a soft layer of green moss, a few plants, and... \"Doctor Hookenline! What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Stevie. He won't bite you. Hee hee! That's a red-spotted salamander. He's pretty, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaped like an alligator, and just as big (to me), the salamander had smooth glossy red skin with black spots. His round head was as big as mine. He quietly observed me with his two jet black eyes. \"Doctor Hookenline... Get him out of here! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Red, Stevie. He vill not eat you. You are too big. Make friends. Hee hee hee hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc!\" But he just turned and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed looked at me for a while, then he came creeping toward me. He was a cautious type. When his soft round snout was close enough, I balled up my fist and popped him right in the nose. He jumped back to the other side of the terrarium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" I yelled. \"Ya want some more? C'mon! C'mon!\" And I danced around in my fighter stance, fists up and ready. But Red seemed happy enough to leave me alone. He kept his distance while I walked around checking out the terrarium. Every now and then I would look at him and shake my fist, just to see him flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the look and smell, it seemed to contain pieces of apple, cheese, and nuts. Next to the cap he placed what was for him a small vial of water. To me it was a jug I could barely lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc?\" I said. \"Am I gonna be big again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Stevie. Don't you worry. Just one leetle job for you to do. Maybe I pay you extra, huh? Now you get comfortable and rest. I come get you soon,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc!\" I yelled, but he was already out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed eyed my bottlecap of food. \"Get out of here! Go eat a bug!\" I yelled at him. He cringed back. Stupid salamander...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Stevie!\" It was the Doc again. I stretched. I couldn't believe I had allowed myself to fall asleep with big Red in the cage with me, but he was over at his log doing his own napping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc scooped me up in his goldfish net. I contemplated making a run for it, but I had a vision of getting accidentally squished by one of the Doc's big shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put me in a glass bowl on the counter. \"Okay, try this on, Stevie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like one of the CO2 cartridges I use with my pellet gun. Attached to it was some gadgetry and a harness. \"What is it?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your scuba gear. Try it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled to get into the harness. \"This tank is pretty heavy,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. In the water the buoyancy will make it seem light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not full of CO2, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not. Compressed air. Does it fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mask is kind of loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it off. I fix.\" And he put me back in the terrarium and left the lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see that the little \"job\" he had in mind must involve some underwater work. Scuba diving was something I had done before, but not when I was the size of a toy.</span></div></div>",

You decided that you should tell Katelyn about the little toy you found earlier, but you just couldn't find the right way to tell her. Suddenly, you get a brilliant idea. You decided that you should just show her then tell her and give her a little surprise. So, since you remember that Katelyn always goes to the bathroom in the morning and does her morning beauty things. So, you quietly get out of bed and tiptoe to the bathroom. Being only in your boxers, you figure that you're fine. So, you carefully climb onto the bathroom counter and pull out your shrinker. You aim it at yourself and press the button. As you watch the bathroom around you grow bigger and farther away, you just can't wait for Katelyn to see you so small. When you stop shrinking, you're not sure how small you are. You begin to pace while waiting for Katelyn, but yet she still doesn't come. Since it's been so long, and you're getting tired, you look over to the side of the counter and see a fuzzy white thing. It looks rather inviting, so you walk over there, and sit down on it, and begin to doze off sitting there. When you awake, you notice Katelyn is standing right in front of you, and reaches down and picks up the fuzzy thing you are on. As your seat is rocketed into the air, you grab onto it for dear life! You watch Katelyn while you're flying, and notice her yawning and scratching her head. So, basically, you come to the realization that getting her attention in the morning wasn't exactly the brightest idea. Of course, she then brushes her long brown hair behind her ear, and then it really hits you: you're on a Q-tip! As you get closer and closer to the ear, you come up with the best thing your quick-mind can think of...</span></div></div>",

After the concert, your friend went outside to wait for her parents. You knew, your mom would be hear any second, and that security was allready kicking people out. However, you wanted to get a drink from the concession stand, because your throat was dry from all that screaming. When you got to the stand, you saw a wired looking man on the phone arguing. He noticed you, and asked what you wanted. When you ordered a small sprite, he nodded his head, and went back to arguing, while fixing your drink. He muttered something under his breath, and went in the area behind the counter ,where you figured he kept all the supplies. While he was back there, you noticed a white cup on the counter, and assumed it was your sprite. You left your money on the counter, and gulped down what was inside, while walking towards the exit. You drunk the drink so fast, you did not realize that it was not sprite. It left a terrible taste in your mouth, and you felt woozy. You immediately blacked out right on the spot. When you woke up everything seemed different. You thought someone had kidnapped you and began to panick. Without thinking you ran until you hit a giant, soft wall, and fell back. It was then that you realized you had shrunk! You began to freak out, but before you had time to think, the giant wall, which happened to be a girl noticed you!</span></div></div>",

You didn't stick around to be noticed, and bolted for the door, that the manager had left open. Once you were inside, you hid under a make up desk and tried to think about the situation. After a couple minutes your heartbeat was back to normal and you were trying to come up with a plan. However, your thinking plan was over, once you started to hear heavy foot steps come towards you, and you heard several boy's voices. The boy's voices sounded awfully familiar, and you realized you were in the Lax Act's  dressing room! \" Oh no!\", you muttered under your breath. Luckily, they were all ready dressed, and ready to get back on the tour bus. Jason started to practice dance moves, while Chris started to sing. Marcus sat on a couch, drifting off to sleep, while DJ checked his phone for texts. You decided the best thing to do would to be to go up to one of them and ask for help.

Many ruffled their frills and one junior lieutenant's ear ridges flushed a bright cerulean blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZor Ztan let the reaction die down, then made the announcement they all were waiting for: \"The shrinking machine has been reinstalled on what is now the fifth planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officers dipped their frills in approval. Thanks to the First Zyzyxian Invasion Force, the original fifth planet was now in a million pieces. The Second Invasion Force was dedicated to success. The shame of the First Invasion could then be buried in the great Hall of Memory on the home planet - Zyxizaria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZor Ztan adjusted the horizontal position control on the viewscreen and the view shifted from the green and blue third planet to the banded clouds of the fifth planet. \"You see that giant red spot? That's where the shrinker has been installed. It will be a slow process, but this solar system will eventually be shrunk out of existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA junior officer, the same one that had flushed blue, piped up with an impertinent question. \"What about the earthlings? Will they not notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZor Ztan's frill rippled with annoyance at the interruption in the smooth flow of his presentation. \"We have determined the earthlings will have enough intelligence to rationalize their experience. They will not believe that they are shrinking. They will develop a theory that the rest of the universe is expanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's preposterous!\" said the junior officer. \"Why would they believe the entire universe was growing bigger when it would be so much simpler to assume they were shrinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZor Ztan was more than just annoyed now; his frill went rigid with anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe junior officer's flush changed from the blue of curiosity to the deep purple of anxiety. Angering Zor Ztan was not the way to get a promotion in rank. He bowed to Zor Ztan and said \"I respectfully withdraw my remarks, honored Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZor Ztan's frill relaxed and refolded itself neatly around his neck. \"Your remarks have been deleted from the record. Now let's discuss plans for our return voyage to Zyxizaria. We have decided to take one of earth's two moons with us. Undoubtedly, when they develop astronomy, they will find it puzzling that they are the only planet in their solar system with only one moon. But that will be a small puzzle compared to the \"expanding\" universe! Haz haz haz haz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the assembled officers laughed with Zor Ztan \"Haz haz haz haz!\"</span></div></div>",

I sent in the coupon and the P&amp;H money. My friend Bobby did the same,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later, Bobby called me. \"Stever! I got the gun! It came in the mail today. Come on over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped on my bike and headed out, stopping by our mailbox on the way. Sure enough, there was my package from the Acme Shrinker Gun Company. I put it under the hold-down straps on the back of my bike and took off for Bobby's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was out in the yard with his shrinker gun and I yelled at him when I was still a half a block away. \"I got mine, too!\" I screeched to a stop on his driveway and snatched my package out of the hold-down straps. I ripped it open and there was my gun. It was the same orange plastic as Bobby's gun. They looked like 99 cent water pistols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked with raised eyebrows at Bobby. \"Are you sure these things work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby just smiled a sly smile and reached into his pocket and pulled out an action figure. Or was it? It was moving and I could hear a tiny voice. \"Bobby, you moron, change me back right now!\" It was alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked closer at the little naked figure in Bobby's hand. \"That's your brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Bobby said. He looked like he was pretty proud of his ability to shrink people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scratched my chin. \"What happened to his clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby laughed. \"I shrunk him when he was in the tub. You should have seen him swimming around in there. He didn't know WHAT happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you change him back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby's grin faded. \"I don't know. The gun didn't have any instructions with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going to happen when your Mom finds out you shrunk Kenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby was looking more worried now. \"I don't know. Nothing good, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should give these guns to the police. Somebody is going to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" said Bobby. \"They wouldn't have been on the cereal box if it wasn't okay. We have to keep them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't like it,\" I said. \"Suppose you dropped Kenny with him so small. The fall would kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it wouldn't! Watch!\" And Bobby tossed little naked Kenny out onto the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny screamed a tiny little scream as he went sailing through the air... Yiiiiiiiieeee!... But when he hit the grass, he immediately jumped up shaking his miniscule fist and cursing Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surprised. \"It doesn't hurt him to fall like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Bobby. \"I've been tossing him around before you got here. Maybe it's because all his molecules have been compressed and now he's like super dense, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" I said.</span></div></div>",

A green ray shot out of his gun and hit my left arm. My arm immediately shrunk to a ridiculous size. You ever see those pictures of Tyrannosaurus Rex with the tiny arms? That was my left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooops!\" Bobby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot!\" I screamed, swinging around my right arm, the one with the gun, and what do you know, accidently shooting Bobby in the leg. No, really. It was accidental. I'm not the type to seek instant revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby went down like the World Trade Center. He didn't have a leg to stand on. Well, he had one leg, but the other leg was verrry short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby rolled over on the ground and aimed his gun at me. Hate in his eyes. I had a moment to wonder why I picked such hateful people to be friends, then the air was filled with the smell of ozone as we blasted each other with green shrinker rays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, we were standing in the grass, and I do mean \"in\" the grass because the blades reached up over our heads. \"Now you've done it...\" Bobby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me! You're the one that shot first! My arm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an accident!

To be naked as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny was still angry. \"You morons! Stupid idiot jerks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Bobby with one of those \"Now what do we do?\" looks, but he was looking at me the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerks...\" Kenny said, but he didn't sound angry anymore, just disgusted.</span></div></div>",
