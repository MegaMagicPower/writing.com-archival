The question is, where will you start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is the small, independant village of Trillian which is having problems. At first, crops and equipment were disappearing, but now several villagers have gone missing. Is this just a series of coincidences, or something more sinister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nations of Rylestia and Coninze, over a dispute about borders, have declared war on each other. Though there have already been a few small skirmishes, each side is interested in keeping their own forces alive. Thus, they are taking a more active position in hiring mercenaries, spying for weaknesses, and taking prisoners for interrogation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a story about the ruins of castle Dormduo. They say that after having become too gluttonous, god punished the fortification and all of those within it by sending fire and brimstone from the skies. While no one knows whether there is truth in this story, one thing for certain is that there are still treasures hidden in the catacombs beneathe the ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile one should always be an upstanding person, thievery was always a fallback option when everything else failed. The southern coastal city of New Forazio was a city of decadence. Fine foods, large structures, scantily-clad entertainers, and lots of money to go around. So much money, in fact, that perhaps no one would notice if a few coins went missing into your own pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, with such a large world, there are always more paths to take. Which path is right for you?</span></div></div>",

But as she continues towards you, the rest if her emerges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face was human, but the rest of the body was that of a millipede. Five feet wide and seven feet tall, it is able to tower over you when it lifts its front part up. The beauteous face that once looked so innocent was now grinning evilly. The rest of the giant bug is still coming out of the shadowed path, and you worry just how long the body is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hello, little human. What brings you to my home?</i>\" Its/Her voice definitely sounds female, but rings in an otherworldly way around the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I a-assume y-y-you're the millipede q-q-q-queen?\" you reply. It is an effort to say even that much, and you're surprised your voice didn't freeze in fear halfway through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin broadens even more. \"<i>Indeed. You are talking to none other than the Millipede Queen Vyl. Although company is rare here, so I can suffer informalities from a visitor. Feel free to address me simply as Vyl.</i>\" Her eyes lose a bit of their evil, and her grin turns into a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still a bit shaky, but after recovering from the shock you regain a bit of composure. You're still scared out of your wits, but reason finds a home in your brain once again. In a situation like this, it's best to act as guest and scout out her home for a future raid. \"If you are okay with it, Vyl,\" you respond at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glance to the shadowy path reveals that the end of her enormous millipede body is emerging. If you were to stretch her out, you would say she's probably at least a few dozen meters long! That's ridiculous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Millipede Queen - Vyl - pulls her body into a tight circle inside the clearing, leaving a reasonably large space for you to sit in and no way out. With a wave of one her front legs (which can move like arms, due to some kind of special joint), two smooth tree stumps pop up from beneath the dead leaves, one the size of a table and the other the size of a chair. A tree branch from outside the circle of her body sets down two cups of some liquid, which you suppose you'll have to drink. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree branch retreats, and Vyl gestures for you to sit down. Reluctantly, you have a seat on the chair-sized tree stump with the 'table' between you and Vyl - her face at least. You peer down at the cups on the table, and notice that the liquid inside is translucent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Relax, it's just water,</i>\" Vyl consoles as she lifts her cup. You lift yours just as Vyl sips from the 'water'. Wanting to complete the facade as guest you take a sip, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happens. It is, actually, just water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So let me ask again, what brings you here?</i>\" asks Vyl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came looking for a for the 'fear of the forest' in these woods,\" you lie. \"There are rumors flying around town that something big and eerie lives in this forest and is kidnapping people. I heard the name Millipede Queen mentioned a few times, so I decided to come and slay it to allay the village's fears.\" You quickly look up at her. \"But you aren't something that needs to be slain. In fact, you're quite hospitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes, when something bad happens the first thing humans do is blame it on something they don't know enough about.</i>\" That, you thought, is entirely true. You have no reason to suspect this lonely...person...is behind the kidnappings. Ever since you arrived she has done nothing but welcome you as a guest. \"<i>I do get lonely at times, but I would never dream of taking innocent people from their homes.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you,\" you say, to your surprise you mean it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's why I appreciate visits like these. They do much to distract me.</i>\" Vyl takes another sip. \"<i>It's been a while since I've heard from the human world. Is there anything you can tell me about developments since a couple years ago?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you find yourself filling her in on recent events in the local area. You tell her who married who, what countries are at war, which people got captured, and other such things. Throughout the conversation, you discover that the Millipede Queen - er, Vyl - has a surprisingly good sense of humor, as well as a natural curiosity. The more you talk, the more you feel that this nice, bug, couldn't possibly be behind the kidnappings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you begin to wonder. If this person-bug-whatever isn't kidnapping the villagers, who is? The old man at the bar explicitly said that his sister, the Millipede Queen, was behind the kidnappings. Your mind runs in mental circles trying to decide whether Vyl is the kidnapper or not. Finally, you get frustrated enough to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vyl, I have a question,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ask away, little human.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I met a man at the bar in Trillian,\" you begin. \"I asked him about the kidnappings, and he said that his sister, the Millipede Queen, was behind them. Do you know who told me that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVyl scowls. \"<i>Yes, I know who that is. Indeed, my brother does sometimes wander through Trillian in human form, but he is always telling lies. His name is Kol, and he is called the Millipede Lord. If one of us is kidnapping people, it's him.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. \"Thanks Vyl. I think I know what to do now.\" You get up from your stump and set your cup down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Going so soon?</i>\" Vyl asks. \"<i>Kol isn't going anywhere, and there's so much more I'd like to show you.</i>\" She uncoils her body from its circle and gestures down the dark path, which didn't look foreboding anymore. \"<i>The entire dark half of the forest is my home, and you've only seen the front room.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think to decline, as you need time to prepare for Kol. On the other hand though, the offer strikes you as curious, and Vyl probably has some invaluable information about Kol.</span></div></div>",

Once they buy it, he need merely wait for his victims to come to his home.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where would that be?\" you ask as you begin to walk down the dark path leading away from the clearing. Vyl is right behind you, holding some kind of torch in her right leg. The firelight glows rather than burns, so as not to give off too much heat or light. Under normal circumstances, you'd find this weird. But hey, you're walking into a dark forest with a giant millipede that has a beautiful woman's face who is talking about her brother. You crossed the weird line a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>His lair is where anyone would least expect it, merely five minutes away from Trillian. It is, put simply, a giant ditch in which he curls up in to sleep. Once an adventurer or treasure hunter reaches the edge, they are too close to even have a chance at running.</i>\" Vyl explains it all with a slight frown on her face. \"<i>I never approved of his methods of attaining humans. They are much more interesting when they come voluntarily, and to talk in friendly manner as opposed to trying to grab some treasure or other.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly aware of rustling in the leaves beneath you. In fact, it sounds similar to the rustling noise Vyl is making behind you. Looking down, you see dozens of little millipedes crawling through the dead plants. An urge to yell rises in you, but you suppress it with great effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh, allow me to introduce you to my subjects,</i>\" Vyl says. \"<i>The Millipede Queen is not an empty title. Unfortunately, these millipedes have no mind of their own, so I control them all directly. They don't offer much in the way of amusement, but they're fun to play with when I get visitors.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustling sounds gradually quieten, as the millipedes crawl ahead. You look back to Vyl, who smiles charmingly and beckons onward. It doesn't take long to reach another clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one looks much like the last, except three times as big and with several more pathways leading away from it. The moon illuminates the clearing, and on a cloudless night like tonight the clearing seems to be painted a pale color. Some oddly shaped rocks and trees lie around the clearing, perhaps as decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This is where I entertain my guests,</i>\" explains Vyl. \"<i>They lie on one of the trees and I make them laugh like they've never laughed before. Only visitors I'm fond of come here. Also, if you so wish, the path with the black flower next to it is the way to the guest sleeping clearing. It hasn't been used in some time though, so who knows what might have grown in there. I haven't checked recently.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVyl flashes a smile at you. \"<i>Would you like me to make you laugh? Or would rather rest and regain your strength? I'll have breakfast ready when you wake up.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cock your head, confused. \"Breakfast?\" you ask quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Only vegetables, fruit, and water I'm afraid. We millipedes lack the means to cook meat or create any kind of juice. Well, would you like to laugh or rest?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply...</span></div></div>",

The shape is roughly like a chair, but there is extended at both sides, meaning that your legs are laying flat on the wood and the tree extends up above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVyl begins to curl up in front of you, a writhing mass of legs and segments. However, as she coils around her body seems to be emitting a strange blue glow. The color soon envelops her form, now only a silhouette, encasing Vyl in a dome of blue light. Then the silhouette changes shape, shrinking and morphing. By the time the blue light dulls, the silhouette is now a body about your size<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before you is a very young, very beautiful maiden, with skin that looks silky smooth and pale blond hair the falls gently to her feet. Curves in all the right places, her body would make any woman green with jealousy. And her clothing was not chosen for its modesty: two leather garments that were little more than underwear held her large bosom and hid her round butt. She was beautiful and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuh, who are you?\" you ask incredulously. How had this person suddenly taken Vyl's place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo blue eyes smile kindly at you, and now that you examine it the face looks very familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you've already forgotten the name of your host?\" the woman says in a silky voice that soothes you tremendously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHost? No...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vyl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beauty giggles softly. \"Why of course. Who else?\" Her voice lost its otherworldliness during the transformation, but you can tell it is indeed Vyl, the Millipede Queen. It is almost frightening to think of this young maiden and the Millipede Queen as the same person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But, how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already told you of Kol's human form. Well, here's mine! What do you think?\" Vyl asks excitedly, her demeanor completely different to the one she had as a giant millipede. \"Impressive, is it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's one way to put it...\" You shift on your tree seat a little bit, wondering what the point of transforming was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVyl's attention immediately returns to you. \"Oh I'm sorry! Silly me, you want me to entertain you, don't you?\" She bounces right up to you, and you swear her clothes are going to fall off. They don't though, and she places her face right next to yours. \"You wanted to laugh right? But there might be a better way to entertain you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of her fingers, Vyl grows a tree exactly like yours across from you and sits in it. She rests her feet on the wooden structure and leans back, displaying her body for the world to see. However, you were the only one watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to tickle me, or should I tickle you?\" Vyl asks, very nonchalant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not quite sure you heard right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry... What?\" you say, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked who should be tickled, me or you? I'll be entertained either way, so which way entertains you most?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a... different, pastime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something I do with all my cute guests.

She lifts her hands in front of you, smiling into your eyes....and to your horror her nails grow longer....half inch...inch..then out to an inch and a<br>\r\nhalf of pure tickling menace. A small, piteous moan of terror escapes your lips as Vyl begins to wiggle them purposefully...you strain against the binding roots<br>\r\nbut they give not a fraction.......you are trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Poor boy.....you NEVER expected these, did you now? Too late...\" she chortled,clicking her nails together..\"I have you now..and youre going to laugh until you're<br>\r\nexhausted..and maybe longer.....\"  Those deadly claws eased into position at your armpits as you shook your head in denial...\"Oh no...no. Vyl...not the nails please<br>\r\nplease...I'll do anything, don't tickle meee.....\"  With a wicked smile,she cooed..\"Oh yessss,baby.....<span class=\"cred\"><b> Kootchie Kootchie Koooo</b></span>.....laugh,sweetie\" Her<br>\r\ntalons caressed the hollows of your underarms with excruciating precision, eliciting peal after peal of tortured laughter from your parched throat.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Vyl teased and stroked your sensitive pits for what seemed like hours, giggling and taunting you all along the way.....\"Awww..is the boy ticklish HERE,too?\" ..she<br>\r\nmused as her claws tapped your writhing belly. The fresh howls of uncontrollable mirth gave her the answer..... \"Yes he issss.....<span class=\"cred\"><b> Tickle tickle tickle</b></span><br>\r\ngonna tickle you all night,honey.......no mercy......\" Your body spasms from the sensory overload..and you sob desperately...\"STAHAHAP....oh stop..please...Vyl<br>\r\n...I give up....I surrender....noooo......no moreHEHEHEHEHE\" Tears stream down your cheeks as the deadly nails continue their fiendish work.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    At this point<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One silky curved leg steps over yours and she sits down on your lap, her face inches from yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this stage,\" she smiles gently as her hands take your forearms, \"I find a little constraint is in order.\" Your sleeves fall down your arms as she lifts them over your head and pushes them into the wood above you.

It becomes clear that her plans are far from over when you feel a single digit in each hollow of your underarms. You gasp in surprise and stare Vyl in the eyes, pleading with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Vyl, wait. I need a minute.' you beg, your breathing still irregular. Vyl nods in ascent, and relief floods through your body. It's short lived, as each digit starts drawing large circles, just around the edge of each pit. It sends a tingling through your spine, not enough to tickle but just enough to put your nerves on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I do believe your minute is coming to an end, my pretty little thing. Was there anything else you wanted before we begin?' You rack your mind, urgently trying to come up with something to say. You pull a blank, your thoughts scattered by that single finger, sensitizing everything in it's path. A particularly larger circle brings a finger to the very edge of your breasts, and you jump a little at the contact. 'Maybe soon, little one, I will explore them, but now, I do believe my attention is needed elsewhere.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, your reprieve is over. Five fingers on each side dig in hungrily, scrabbling away at the sensitive hollows. Although you knew it was going to happen, you are still surprised. Your initial shriek of laughter becomes a steadier stream of full belly laughs. She doesn't keep up this technique for long, switching between stroking wiggles and drilling, switching it up whenever your laughter becomes too steady. The wiggles cause little giggles to intersperse the tenor of your laughter, and the drilling digits cause you to squeak and squeal uncontrollably. Barely a minute of this passes, but it feels like forever. All the while, Vyl smiles and laughs along with you whenever you make a new noise or your laughter becomes comically high. Leaning forward, her face barely a whisper from yours, she begins to whisper '<i>Kootchie kootchie koo, who's my ticklish little girl</i>' her breath ghosting against your skin, sending shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass as you writhe beneath the beautiful woman, torturing your underarms and sending shivers rocketing down your spine, before you finally feel the tickling decrease. Her fingertips massage the skin lightly, drumming a small pattern into the flesh before steadily a finger is removed, one at a time. When there is just one left, it abandons that technique to begin drawing circles, starting in the very centre before they grow wider once again. You can't speak, your breathing yet to return to normal, and you can't stop fidgeting beneath the beautiful woman on top of you. Through your tear blurred vision, you can see her beaming down at you. Noticing the dampness around your eyes, she leans forward and you feel her lips kiss and nibble them away. She doesn't stop, continuing her journey down your cheek and finally planting little nibbles along your neck. You squeak and squirm against her, but find yourself also exposing more of your neck for her to play with. This tickling is more teasing and pleasurable, and although she's still absentmindedly drawing circles around your underarms, you find yourself relaxing slightly into the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, little one,' she whispers in between nibbles, her breath adding to the ticklish feelings. 'We can explore how sensitive these are.' She accentuates her request, the circles large enough to brush against the edge of your breasts again. She draws another two circles, slowing down each time as she makes contact with each breast, before carrying on. 'Or we can visit yet another ticklish spot on this delectable little body.' Her fingers slowly make their way down each side, tingling the skin the as they went, before resting on the crease of each hip. 'What would you like to do next?'</span></div></div>",

You suddenly feel so cold where she is not touching you, and although the tickling was torturous, the more teasing touches were pleasurable, and you want to explore that feeling further. You don't have to think for more than a moment before you smile seductively to your host. 'What would you do, to explore how sensitive I am?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answering smile sends a chill down your spine, and you can't stop yourself from squirming beneath it. 'Well, I suppose I'd have to start with these.' she begins, her hands beginning a slow and luxurious journey back up your sides before they flatten themselves either side of your breasts, careful not to touch them yet. 'And I suppose we should begin with finding out which area produces the best results.' You know she's teasing you, and although your trying not to let it affect you, your shuffling gives you away. She pauses again, and you compose yourself. You hadn't even realised your breathing had become laboured, and you work to take calm, deep breathes. When you're quite done, she carries on. 'Now, I think we should begin down here.' she runs her hand along the bottom edge of your breasts, following the curves delicately before her hands meet in the middle. 'But this seems to be in the way.' she complains, sliding a finger of each hand just under the cloth, her fingers quickly exploring the inside of each breast before she flips the bottom edge up. She continues the fold, revealing just the underside of each breast as she went. Her fingers grazed the flesh just beneath the fold, from a quick swipe over each nipple as her hands swept apart from each other, going around each side of your body and meeting again behind your back. You arch away from the touch, inadvertently placing your body directly against hers. Your skin becomes warm from the contact, but she once again pulls back to examine her handiwork. 'I think that will do nicely for now.' she murmurs, running her hand along the now uncovered underside of each breast. 'No need to rush things. We have plenty of time to thoroughly examine these. Now. Shall we begin.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question turns out to be a rhetorical one and fingers begin to scrabble away at the crease beneath your breasts. You practically jump out of your skin at the sensation racing around your body. You hadn't really known what to expect, you'd hardly been in this situation before, and who'd have thought your breasts would even be ticklish there. And they certainly are. The skin, so soft from their lack of exposure, and already a sensitive area on any woman's body, is alight with nerves, and her expert fingers are sending electric bolts of ticklish agony through your body. You automatically arch your back, trying to pull away from her fingers, but you simply extend your ribcage and expose more skin for her to play with. You thump back down against the bark, wiggling and squirming in your seat the best you can. Which isn't a lot. If anything, you are merely making matters worse, your struggling slowly shifting the cloth around you chest up and away from your juttering breasts. Vyl watches the progress eagerly, and with every millimetre of flesh you inadvertently uncover, you provide more skin for her fingers hungrily fly over. Her touch changes the higher over your breasts it becomes, lighter the closer they get to the cloth barely covering your dignity, before diving back down to dig in the spaces above your highest ribs and below your jiggling breasts. Your laughter changes in octave, getting higher as she taunts your breasts, although the higher she gets the more moans become intersperse with giggles. You are torn between wanting it to end and wanting this whole ordeal to be over, your body squirming for something more, and yet your lungs begging for it to be over, all the while your brain reminds you that you asked for it.</span></div></div>",

Vyls stops her assault suddenly, although she doesn't move her hands away. Each one cups a breast as she examines the sight before her. The cool night air falls upon your flushed skin, and although you should feel embarrassed at this new development, you simply don't. Vyl seems to have an aura around her that makes you feel comfortable, with a slight tingle in your spine. She's not safe, but for some reason you're fine with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, my darling girl, it seems it is time to explore further.' She begins, her fingers remaining cupped under each breast as a thump explores higher to start massaging and grazing a nail against the side of each nipple. The sensation causes you to suck in your breath and arch your back, pushing your breasts deeper into the touch. 'Well, isn't someone a greedy little girl.' she scolds, allowing her hands to fall away from your chest altogether, going instead to suddenly attack your stomach. You shriek and buck from the sudden change, but she doesn't budge and it doesn't last long before the fingers move away from your body altogether. 'You're just such a greedy.' Two hands squeeze your sides. 'Little' A single fingertip swirls around your bellybutton. 'Girl' The fingertip dives in, wiggling and grazing the wall of your navel as another tickles the area just beneath. You buck wildly, hips barely moving an inch. Still, the whole thing seems to have the desired effect as Vyl enjoys watching your body write and bounce around. She keeps one hand torturing your bellybutton while the other plays with the area just above your pant line. With each buck and wriggle, your pants lose a little of their height, once again revealing more flesh for Vyl to play with. Before you once again lose your dignity in another area, she suddenly stops and drops her hands away from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're basically hanging from your encased arms, your bottom having shuffled out of a sitting position as it tried to dislodge it's tormentor. You begin to try to right yourself, but Vyl places one hand flat on your stomach, freezing you in place. 'Now, I think it's my turn to be a greedy girl.' she states, leaning her face down and wrapping her hands around your side level with your highest ribs. 'You've been having all the fun, and I haven't been able to have any. It's only fair, right.' Her voice is somewhere between a purr and a request, leading you to think she will actually wait for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't. And suddenly you feel a warm pressure lapping at the underside of your left boob, and you understand what she meant. She was going to be a very greedy girl, and your body was the only dinner available. It didn't tickle straight away, the long laps of her tongue in the crease beneath your breasts felt warm and pleasant, and you arch your back as much as you can to open up your flesh to her greedy mouth. She laps and licks the skins of your left breast, ensuring no area is untouched before transferring her mouth to the other. You begin to pant beneath her, a moan falling our of your parted lips. You feel her lips smile on your skin, her nose nuzzling into the space. Her long licks under your right breast become shorter, lapping at the area, the change in friction tingling the skin there. Teeth join in, gently scraping against the tender skin, before these too become interspersed with ticklish little kisses. You buck slightly at the changing textures, not quite tickling yet, but not quite not either. Goosebumps start prickling your nipples as you become more aroused, and you shiver from the cool air on your now sensitized nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVyl decides to pick up the pace a little, and you feel movement on your right side. It begins with a simple, a rhymic tapping on her fingernails on the back of your ribs. You couldn't possibly stretch out further than you are, although your body seems to want to. The kisses travel upwards too, teeth grazing the area around your right nipple and kisses and licks begin to cover the area in a light sheen. She plays around, never quite touching the centre, always playing between tingling and tickly without making you laugh outright. As well as being physically taut, your nerves feel tight and highly strung. You can't catch your breath properly, panting and moaning as she plays with you. The fingers on your right side start gliding round, wiggling gently over the front of your ribs now, still not enough to tickle, but the teasing touches make you try to wiggle away. It's now that Vyl captures your juttering nipple in her mouth, sucking and lapping at it, erecting it in her mouth. You moan once before the hand beneath it finally starts to gain friction. She digs in, drilling her thumb into the bones while her fingers wiggle furiously in the gaps. You shriek suddenly and can't stop the giggles from falling out of your mouth. Her mouth on your breast holds you in place and shoots arousal through you while her hand tortures your ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets this carry on for a minute or so before transferring her mouth to your other breast, the hand torturing your ribcage stopping immediately. You don't have chance to catch your breath before the left hand takes over. Her mouth heads straight for your nipple, enclosing her wet lips around it and blowing delicately on the tip. Her tongue licks it in quick motions in between ghosting breaths, and your moan gets caught up in laughter as her left hand starts scratching down your sides. You try to rotate your body away, but she won't release your breast from her mouth, and you are once again caught up in moaning giggles as she mouths your nipple to attention and tickles your side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like an eternity later, but she finally leans away once again, licking her lips as she looks into your eyes. 'Well, that was fun. I think I got everything. Did I miss a spot?' she asks, and you shake your head quickly no. Your body is alive with feeling, everything tender and sensitive, you're not sure you could go another round without going insane. 'Well, the funs not over yet. You have another decision to make. Now, I could tickle up here still.' Her hands return to cupping your swollen breasts, before fanning out and falling down, indicating your whole upper body. 'With this.' She bring her mouth down to your quivering stomach, centring herself over your bellybutton with her mouth and teasing her skin with her tongue. 'Or' she breaths against your stomach, causing you to suck it in away from the tingly breath. 'We could explore this.' You can't see, her face and breasts blocking your vision, but a finger points over your trousers, following the seam between your legs from belt to thigh, grazing over your area. You fidget beneath the finger and bite your lip. </span></div></div>",

Her mouth is so close to your stomach, her finger only a slight pressure, right over that spot between your legs. You need some release. Your body is singing with want and need, so you jerk into her touch, just once. 'Please'. You murmur, trying to get some friction down there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, my darling girl. All you had to do was ask.' She smiles up at you, a glorious smile, tinted with mischief. 'Although we are going to have to make some. Adjustments.' Her hand moves away from your crotch, and a whine escapes your mouth before you can stop yourself. 'So greedy' she scolds again, getting up off your altogether. She slinks her way to your feet, gripping the hems of your trousers as she starts to pull them down. You lift yourself best you can to help their progress, and she finally gets them the entire way off and discards them to the side. You're now down your underwear, unless you still count your open shirt. Which you probably shouldn't, since it's not exactly covering anything up. You expect Vyl to carry on with your underwear, but she doesn't seem inclined to do so. Instead, she comes up to knee height and pushes them apart. Both your legs fall either side of the log, opening your legs for her. She nods to herself before sitting where your legs used to be, straddling the log once more. Her hands start at your thighs and travel down, leaving a trail of goosebumps in their wake. When she gets to your calves, you feel that odd clay like substance from earlier now encase them, and when she removes her hands they are stuck in place. A shiver runs down your spine as you realise how completely immobile you are, and Vyls hungry expression doesn't ease your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, isn't that much better.' she purrs, knee to knee with you, her hands traveling up your thighs. Your muscles contract in an attempt to put your legs together, but you're not going anywhere. You squirm as best you can as her fingers draw patterns in the sensitive flesh between your thighs. 'Now. What do we do with this.' she asks, her hands finally meeting in the middle of your legs. Her left hand drops out to let her right trace over your pants. They follow that same line, up and down, up and down. Her light touch tingles and tickles, and you're once again panting and moaning as she continues her path, up and down, up and down. Her left hand seems to have gotten bored, as its returned to tracing patterns on the inside of your right thigh. She etches forwards, her legs now straddling you over your stretched out ones. Her new leverage means she can turn her right hand into more of a claw, and she uses it to tickle your crotch, right in the space between your legs. You thought you'd be thankful for the friction, and why would you be ticklish there. Once again, Vyl seems to have found a spot on you you didn't even know you had, and you start giggling. She takes full advantage of her new knowledge, tickling and tickling in that spot, her touch heavy enough to send you into a hysterical mess, but light enough not to give you any release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What a good little girl. So ticklish everywhere. And so greedy for it. Whose my greedy, ticklish little girl?' she taunts you, but you can only just hear her over the sound of your own laughter. Her words seem to make the whole thing worse, and you shriek through your laughter. 'I am feeling so hungry, my greedy girl. Isn't there anything I could eat.' You don't know whether to scream yes or no. You need her to, your body needs it, but she is just too skilled a tickler. Is it wise to add her mouth to the mix?</span></div></div>",

The relentless tickling slows, returning to the stroking up and down, up and down, allowing you to catch your breath, moans replacing your giggles. Vyl's other hand goes up to cup your face, stopping it's shakes and calming you down. 'Hush now, my precious little girl. My intrepid adventurer. My beautiful treat.' You whimper a little at her words, trying to hide your eyes as a blush creeps over your face. The hand at your crotch suddenly returns to tickling and you squeal and look at Vyl. She's smiling down at you, her eyes hooded as she becomes intoxicated once again by your writhing form. Without being able to stop herself, she lowers herself and her lips meet yours, swallowing the giggles still trickling out of you. She just won't stop, stroking and scratching at your crotch, forcing the laughter from your throat and your body to shake beneath her. Now, with her mouth over yours, her body covering yours, you can't move, barely able to catch your breath but not wanting to break the contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ends the kiss all too soon, leaving you to shiver alone, feeling cold again without her. You realise her hand has stilled but rests still between your legs, touching but not helping. You try to push yourself lower, but your body is stretched to its limit. You feel a whine fall from your mouth without your permission and you find yourself pouting up at the beautiful woman above you. Her smile looks positively wicked as she gazes down at you. Your knees bob as you try to push them together, try to do something to relieve yourself. Her hands rest atop them, nails scratching across the caps delicately. You wish you hadn't drawn so much attention to them as you burst from fresh giggles. You try to shake them more, to dislodge her hands from their perch, but she's stuck to you like glue, nails traveling all over the top before venturing underneath and attacking the sensitive skin there too. Your laughter becomes a little more desperate at the new sensation and your whole body starts shaking as you try to escape her hands. Growing bored of their perch, the hands travel higher, squeezing the sensitive flesh between your thighs. How could you allow her such easy access?!? Her nails drew patterns that ventured higher and higher before her hands disappeared into the crease where your thighs met groin. You start to question your previous decision. How could anything she did with her mouth be worse than this. At least you'd have had some release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm going to make you scream for it, little thing.' Vyl murmured in your ear, bringing her body low enough so her breath ghosted against your neck but not close enough to touch you anywhere else. She was making this so. Difficult. Teeth clasped around your earlobe, forcing you to gasp and jut forward. Taking advantage, hands ventured beneath your ass, attacking the crease there too. You nearly scream before dissolving into high, desperate laugher. You can feel Vyl's smile against your neck as she begins peppering those kisses again, travelling down your neck and collarbone, nibbling and kissing as she went. The cloth that had covered you before blocks her path, and she just rips it away with her teeth. You gasp and she captures it in a kiss, enjoying the feel of it in her mouth. She pinches your ass cheek, forcing the same response from you so she can capture it once again in a kiss. One hand continues it's assault of your bum while the other returns to your upper body, grazing nails against your breasts. It tickles and forces moans out of your mouth that she steals with kisses. It's becoming too much. You become light headed, but just before you can pass out, the hand still on your bum comes back round to the front, returning to it's up and down, up and down. More moans intersperse the giggles, so the hand taunting your breasts travels lower, squeezing your side, forcing your laughter to rise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how much more of this you can take. You can barely breath, but still the tickling forces laughter from you, the arousal moans. You're going to let her use her mouth down there, you have to, if it'll make it stop. And you need to it to stop. And you need release.</span></div></div>",

Your screams of laughter from the hand squeezing and scratching against your sides interspersed with the groans and moans from the other hand traversing your crotch. Your breathing became laboured as as soon as you managed to get some air into your lungs it was simply ripped away again. Vyl's hands seemed bored with their perch, and so they found new spots. The one gliding over your crotch so cruelly travelled lower, caressing your inner thighs, gently at first and getting steadily faster, nails gliding and scratching as they went. You tried to shake away, the touch feeling glorious at first turning torturous as it elicited squeals. The sound seemed to please Vyl, as as soon as the first one left your mouth, she seemed even more motivated for it's return. As the next one spilled out of you she captured it in her mouth, caressing your teeth with her tongue. The hand that had been tickling your side slid behind you, finding the gap between your back and the tree stump and gliding up and down your spine, making you shiver. Vyl seemed to shiver along with you, leaning closer to you and moulding her body to yours before she did it again, luxuriating in your full body shiver. She let her hand carry on, enjoying your body's reaction as she nibbled and lapped at the crook of your neck. You squeal again at the teeth on your neck and try to bring your chin down to cover your neck. The hand on your thigh disappears and you feel fingers in your hair gently pull your head back, opening up your throat to her hungry mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the mouth on your throat and the nails on your spine kept your breathless and squirming, you were able to relax into her hold on you and calm your aching chest. The nibbles and licks covered your neck, Vyl making sure no area went neglected, before she started leaving a trail of kisses up your throat aiming for your ear. She nibbled the sensitive skin just behind the shell of your right ear, titling your head away and ensuring she had full access to what she wanted, before her voice whispered 'What about now, my little treat. What do you want?' she asked, rolling her hips against yours. </span></div></div>",

We need to get back to the town as soon as- AHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady screeches  as dozens of millipedes crawl up her legs. You don't understand why she is making such a racket until you look closer- making sure to keep a distance from the insects of course. To your surprise they are... tickling her? Though she manages to knock off a few she soon collapses to the ground, hundreds of millipedes crawling in and out of her loose clothing, waving their little legs and feelers all over her armpits, breasts, feet, and thighs. It's pretty gross but you know you can't intervene or they will swarm you too. After another minute the poor girl is dragged into another smaller hole off to the side, still thrashing and struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can follow her you hear a loud crawling noise to your right. It's her, the Millipede Queen! The insect woman's body stretches back into the pit she came from; hundreds if not thousands of pairs of tiny, hair-like legs extend from her shiny brown carapace. This carapace tilts up near the front, where her very human upperbody sits above the many forward-facing legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou size her up for weak points. Her body is tilted up near the front, between her forward-facing legs on the front a fleshy underside lies exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n If not for the insect body you'd have to admit she would have looked very pretty: she has short black hair, dark eyeliner, a large chest covered by a shell-like bra, and a muscular physique. She looks at you with her dark eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmm. More fun? That peasant girl was getting less entertaining every minute. But an adventurer like you could prove amusing for quite a while. Why don't you come over here and play a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't going to take this monster's teasing.

You watch as she stumbles from side to side obviously disorientated for the hit \"curse you human\". It was now or never so as she tries to compose herself, you get behind her and jump on top of her. \"GET OFF ME\". Using your arms to cover her eyes, she starts trying to shake you off. Holding on tightly, she hits the walls a few more times which hurts you to some extent \"I swear when I get hold of you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing what strength you have, you cling on literally for your life \"THIS ISN'T FUNNY HUMAN\". Looking up you could see the opening at the top was within arms reach so taking your chance, you leap for the hole but just as you did, the Queen has moved to the side. What you thought would be an easy escape turned out to be harder than you expected. Nonetheless you made it halfway through the hole and managed to hold onto a vine that was holding your weight with no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you had to do was pull yourself up and out of the hole, the only problem you had was you didn't have enough strength to do so \"I can do this\". With dropping back down not an option, you hang there not being able to making any advancements in escaping \"what do we have here?\". In your attempt to escape, you somehow forgot about over sized millipede that was trying to escape from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking me hit the wall and jumping on top of me, making me blind for short while wasn't very smart of you\". Using her long body, she came up to eye level with you \"I thought you'd be out by now, but here you are\" she smiles \"maybe you secretly want to stay here\". Looking out of the hole, freedom was so close \"for your information, I don't exactly have enough strength to pull myself up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could always drop down\" you shake your head \"and be trapped in there with you........that is not option for me\". Your predicament excited her highly \"so what are you going to do.......just hang there?\". You try to pull yourself up but once again you fail \"I'll do it.....even if it takes me forever\". You look at her, seeing the smug smile on her face \"to be honest I thought you'd have done something by now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't you worry about me......I have something planned\". Moving toward you, her legs start attacking your body \"lets see how long you hold on for\". Her legs were so skilled at tickling you, it took a matter of seconds for you to break down and laugh \"hahahahahahaha no not that please hahahahahahaha\". Taking advantage of his position, she focuses most of her attack on your underarms \"such a ticklish human\" running her legs all over you, you squeal, shriek and laugh which only urges her on \"that's it let it all out human, there's no escaping me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tickling consumed you, you was hoping she didn't notice how turned on you was getting. \"I could tickle you all day human but that would get in the way of my real intention for letting you hang here\". Giving you one last tickle, she stops and smiles at you \"you're really ticklish for a........\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With your body being broken down physically and mentally, you could feel yourself start to lose consciousness but noticing this she doesn't let you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't human, you've already passed out once\" breathing deeply, your face red, your body covered in a think sheen sweat, you lay slumped against her \"I must say this is very disappointing, I thought you was going to be a challenge\".

Your stubbornness infuriating her, she goes hit you with her tail again, but being prepared for it, you jump up and land onto her \"you like to give it but can you take it\" you start tickling her body and to your amazement, she's just as ticklish as you \"HAHAHAHAHAHA NO HUMAN STOP\" giving her all your worth, she rolls over onto her back giving you more to tickle \"how's that feel Queen?\". Raking and squeezing at her body, she laughs uncontrollably and your fingers have their way with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHA I'LL KILHILHILHIHL YOUHOHOHOHOH HUMAN\". Seeing she was becoming weak from your attack, you try to come up with a plan to escape \"tell me how to get out of here\" she shakes her head and laughs \"NEVER\". Since she wasn't going to help, you think of another plan \"how can I get up there?\". The biggest mistake you could make was ease up on tickling her which had given her enough time to regain some sense and send you into the wall for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the worst thing you could have done human, now prepare to DIE!!!\". She lunges toward you but in her anger, she hadn't considered the space between her and you so when you move aside, she went head first into the wall.

Sighing, you decide to go back, thinking to yourself this isn't the best idea. You stop a few feet away from her \"are you always like this when you don't win?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you with tears rolling down her face \"losing isn't the reason I'm upset\". \"Then what is?\", she turns to face you \"do you know what its like to have people being afraid of you, to be left alone months at a time.......to be called a freak\". This was new for you, something like her that people feared, had feelings \"so you're upset that you're alone?\". She nods \"you realize that doing some of the stuff you did to me is one of the reasons why people are afraid of you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it........I like tickling people\". Not sure why you did it but you walk closer to her \"you said you was going to eat me\" \"what did you expect I was going to say\". Understanding her, you nod \"well we had a deal remember?\". You begin to walk away \"I can help you\" she says making you stop and turn back toward her \"help me with what?\" \"the disappearances........I know who's responsible\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do.....who\"?. \"It will come at a price\", you look down at yourself \"well as you can see I don't have any money\". \"I don't want money\" she eyes up you body making you gulp \"I.......I'm not sure\" \"just half an hour that's all I ask\". \"I couldn't stand a few minutes\" \"I'll go easy on you\". You folds your arms \"so in exchange for information I have to let you tickle me for 30 minutes?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and nods \"all the information you need......I'll even point you in the right direction\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose.........\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that she's dead, we're becoming Mortal again.\" The ghost explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, we can still continue to have our immortality through one other method.\" The ghost says. \"And.. What's that?\" You ask. Suddenly, some ghost hands appear all around here. Just.. Hands. Ghostly looking ones. Blueish in color. Two hands pull off your boots and socks. \"Hey! Why did you do that?\" Suddenly, the ghost hands start to tickle you. Two of them tickle your feet, two tickle your armpits, four tickle your sides, and the others hold your ankles, feet, hands, and torso still. You start squealing and laughing like crazy. \"HAHAHAHAHA NOHOHO! STAHAHAP!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, sorry bud.. That's uh, just how it works. I- it's nothing personal, honest. Honest. Honest truth. 100% truth, and nothing but truth. But most of us are over 100 years old, and if we stop being immortall.. Well.. We die. So, sorry to break it to ya. Bad news right here, but.. Ya. Ghosts can harness tickle energy as immortality, so, sorry.\" The ghost says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't respond. All you do is laugh and giggle as the hands dig into your toes, armpits, and sides. You're laughing so hard there are tears in your eyes. What now?</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, perhaps violence is the only thing that will loosen her tongue.

You tried one more time only to feel another finger on your right arch. And then another. And another. And quickly ten scribbling fingers finding their way on your helpless soles.

Aaaaand what do the bad boys get when they misbehave?\" Her cristal voice echoing madly in your mind, teasing and taunting. But of course you couldn't answer. Nothing except mad laughter would come out of your incontrollable mouth. Now she was playing with your toes, pinching and scratching in between them. It was even worse. You were losing control of your body, slamming the bed and desesperately trashing against the restraints, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and placed herself between your legs, facing you, still wriggling her fingers on your poor helpless soles. \"Admit it and I will stop, you juste have to say ooone thing to stop the torture. I know you are close to your limit..\" She slid her perferctly manicured hand up your legs, all the while wriggling them and keeping them in contact with your body, slowly, agonisingly slowly up your legs to meet your inner thights and send you in news waves of laughter, even stronger than before. She liked to see you squirm like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then leaned on you, not stopping the ticking even an instant, closed on your wild and sweaty head, covered in tears, and whispered into your hear \"Or, is it that you like that?\" while sliding up her hands to meet your extra hard staff and give it a little squeeze. Caught off guard, you let go a little moan. She smiled, pleased with your reaction. \"Good, because I'm far from finished with you\" with that she placed her hands on your belly and started dancing her fingers on it. You went berserk. You lost complete control of your own body to her devious fingers. Your mind became foggy and your thoughts unclear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHAHAHAHAAAAAA CAHAHAHHAA A CANT AHAHAHA PLEAHEHEHHEHSE STAAHAHAHAHAP NO MOAHAHAHAHAR\". But her fingers just went even faster. You were losing it. \"You know how to stop this sweeety. Cmon, it's not that hard. Say the words.\" She then layed her head on your body, her hands busy with your belly and sides, to give a smooth wet kiss to you inner thights. That feeling was more like electricity than tickling. But it was too much. Your mind could not keep up with her devious treatment. Other kiss followed, you bursted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ADMIIIIIIT AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH\". She stopped. You were now laying in front of her, your body shaking, covered with sweat, completely helpless and at the mercy of your merciless ensorcelling captor. \"I knew it.

What have you done to end up completely hopeless, all trussed up and at the mercy of a complete stranger, which reveals herself to be a merciless tormentor? You barely remember how it all started, now laughing and thrashing with all your might, tears running down your pretty face. You lost count of time, it seems to you that the torture has been going for hours now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement could also be applied to the barmaid, but not for the same reasons. She was completely mesmerized by your reactions, the feeling of your soft skin, squirming under her sharped nails, provided her with pure bliss and satisfaction. Without forgetting your beautifull laughter, she was enjoying herself to the fullest, so much that she may have forgotten at some point the reason why she was tormenting your defenseless body. But it eventually came back to her, as she realised that she paused the interrogation a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided that the time to break your will has come. She identified that your armpits were one of your most critical zone, and so she focused on that area, while gently laying on your chest, her head only inches fron yours, purring softly into your ear. \"Sweety, I didn't expect you to last this long. I'm beginning to actually wonder if you like it\" she chuckled. You actually heard those words, but you didn't manage to respond, as you were now in silent laughter, only sound coming from your mouth were incoherent words and your heavy breathing. \"I know that you do, you would have ended it otherwise. The truth is that you love being trapped, completely defenseless, at the mercy of my devious fingers\". Those words were echoing in your head, hypnotizing you while your mind was trapped in a transe state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt something wet on your neck. It was a new sensation, it felt like electricity, waking you up from the transe. You turned your head and met the deep blue eyes of the barmaid, looking at you with intensity. \"You liked that, I knew it. If you behave well I will give you more...\". You could only mutter indistinct sounds \"noho... ahah... plehahase no more please stahap please let me gohoho...\". In response she just sorted her tongue and licked the soft skin of your neck, slowly, all the way up to your jaw. You couldn't contain a little moan that escaped your lips. She then placed her left hand on your tummy, tickling your stomach, distracting your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be good?\" She whispered in your ear. \"Please... ahaha... please no more aha.. .\" \"But things are just getting interesting...\" with that you felt her hand leave your belly and slowly untugging your bra. You offered absolutely no resistance. Then you felt the light touch of her index on your right nipple, teasing then pinching its extremity, making it grow hard in a matter of seconds. Then the sensation of a wet kiss on your neck was rewarded by another moan escaping your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now completely trapped in that transe state, the arousal messing even more with your thinking, with the barmaid occasionnaly switching from teasing and fondling your breasts to tickle them lightly. She asked again \"Will you be good?\". Then you felt her other hand aid the first, and your mind went blank, only filled with pleasure and arousal. You moaned. \"I didn't quite catch that, say it louder\". She squeezed your breasts. Another moan. \"Come again?\". \"Nnnhm yes nuhm\" you whispered. \"Say <i>I will be good</i>\" \"Nnnhumm I will be good nnnmm\" you muttered. \"Louder\" she commanded, squeezing your sides and teasing your button. \"AHAHAHA I WILL BE GOOD I SWEAR AHAHA\" you cried.

With a sidestep and a block, you keep the broom from hitting you. Now it\u2019s your turn to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chopping motion using both your hands, you knock her weapon out of her grasp.

Then with a gentle squeeze, you cut of her air supply, rendering her unconscious in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back and lament how this all could have been avoided if she had just listened to you. Well, no time for regrets now. You pull some rope out of your sack that you keep for situations like this. Taking her arms and legs, you bind her in a very effective hogtie. It\u2019s a matter of personal pride that no one has been able to escape from your hogties yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you\u2019ve got her bound, it\u2019s time to keep her from screaming when she wakes up. Taking her bedspread, you rip off a piece and shove it in her mouth, tying it off around her head.

Luckily you know a method that will loosen the tongue of anyone who crosses your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove her shoes and set them down by the bed. This technique has not failed you yet and you don\u2019t believe it will today. You take off her socks, revealing a pair of soft, smooth feet. With anticipation you watch her; waiting for signs of consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour patience is rewarded. She starts to moan and groan; slowly twisting her body in her binds. Once the full realization of her predicament hits her, she panics; using her full strength in an attempt to break free. She tries to scream, but the only thing that escapes the gag is muffled cries. You examine your handiwork with pride; she won\u2019t be escaping any time soon. Leaving you to do what you need to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good. You\u2019re awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman tries to look behind her to get a glimpse of you, but her bondage is somewhat limiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to ask you nicely. But it appears that \u2018nice\u2019 is not in your vocabulary. So I\u2019ve decided to ask you again with the same hostile intent that you have shown me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a single finger and gently touch the sole of her left foot. She stops moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGranted, my method is more subtle, but the effect is just as devastating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide your finger down the length of her sole. She gasps; not daring to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I want to know is any information you have on the strange disappearances occurring in this land. A location, a list of suspects, any similarities of those who have been taken, anything you know that could help my investigation. I want you to think about your answer over the next few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, you scramble your fingers down her right foot. Her eyes go wide and she immediately starts squealing. With ease, you use one hand to bend her toes back and the other hand to tickle up and down her sole. You move slow at first, then suddenly speed up, then go back to slow again. The constant changing of your technique means she can\u2019t get use to it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe young woman puts her face on the floor and lets out deep, uninterrupted laughter. She has given up all hope of breaking free of the ropes and merely laughs like a little schoolgirl. Luckily most of her laughter is swallowed up by the gag; you doubt anyone outside this room could hear her. After five minutes of constant tickling, you stop. You wait for her laughter to die out before speaking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m about to un-gag you now. After which you\u2019ll have two choices. You can choose to tell me what I want to know, or you can choose to remain defiant. This includes shouting for help, insulting me, or just keeping silent. This choice will of course lead to more tickling. And while I can guarantee it will last a lot longer than five minutes, I cannot guarantee that it will be limited to just your feet. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just looks at you, not even trying to answer. You lift her head up and pull the gag out of her mouth, waiting for her reply.</span></div></div>",

Since you have already determined that her feet are ticklish, it may be prudent to see where else she is ticklish. With a little bit of effort, you manage to pull down her skirt half way down her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman starts to struggle a little more. It appears you got her attention. With one smooth motion, you place both hands on her hips and give it a nice squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives out a long squeal followed by steady laughter. Encouraged, you continue squeezing and fondling her hips. Whatever energy she had was wasted on what little movement she is afforded in the constraining hogtie. You move your fingers across her midsection, just above her skirt line. You keep up a digging motion, giving her a deep muscle tickle. At this point she has to use the rest of her energy just to pull in oxygen in-between screaming laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou believe you were starting to get your point across. Now you just needed to drive it home. Your hands slowly migrate northward, tickling her stomach. Her laughter started to come down to manageable levels; it appeared the young barmaid wasn\u2019t as ticklish on her stomach as on her hips. You were going to go back to her hips when her tired body jolted and she let out a shriek. You stop tickling and notice where your hands are. Most of your fingers are still covering her stomach, but you notice one of your fingers is buried deep in her bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. Let\u2019s see what she has to say after this, you think. You start tickling her stomach to get her laughing again, then without warning, you burry your middle finger in her bellybutton. She gave one last scream before dissolving into silent laughter. She buries her face into the mattress as tears begin to leak out of her eyes. You remain perfectly content to just sit there wriggling your finger while she howls in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s been more than half an hour since you last asked her. You might as well ask her again, since you probably tickled all the resistance right out of her. But part of you wishes that she will stay uncooperative. Something about tickling a helpless woman has you all excited. At any rate, you remove her gag and wait for her laughter to die out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your chance to stop the torment.\u201d You tell her. \u201cAnd trust me, it will be the last chance you have for a <i>long</i> time.

I was about half way home when I saw her. About a block away was a young maiden with long black hair. I was wondering what such a beautiful young woman was doing out by herself when I saw it. It was a plain, nondescript carriage coming up behind her. The carriage itself was wholly unremarkable except for the speed at which it was traveling. The horses were going at full gallop. It wasn\u2019t until the carriage was in front of the maiden that the driver brought the horses to a full stop. Just then, the door to the carriage opened, and I saw several arms reach out and pull the young woman into the cabin. Her scream was silenced as soon as the door was closed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen intently, taking in every detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just stood there, stunned. I had never witnessed a real kidnapping before. I didn\u2019t come to my senses until the carriage had taken off and pulled up right next to me. The door opened, and I saw two men. I could not get a good look at their faces, because it was so dark, but I did see that one of them was holding the young maiden. The other one reached out and grabbed my arm. I tried to run away, but his grip was strong. He started pulling me into the carriage when the driver stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one saw us.\u201d The other man replied. \u201cWe can\u2019t just let her go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe only have enough room for one, remember? Give her here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man handed her up to the driver. He took her arm and looked right into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are to tell no one about this. If you do, you can be sure we will find you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then flashed a badge and let her go. The door closed and the carriage sped off into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the emblem of the royal guard.\u201d The barmaid said, finishing her story. \u201cWhen I saw that I knew it wasn\u2019t just an idle threat he told me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back, considering the implications of what she just told you. If the guard of this countries royal family is behind the kidnappings, than perhaps one (or all) of the royal family was masterminding the disappearances!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can you tell me of the royal family?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the king has always been a good ruler. But lately he has been acting strangely. In the last couple of years, he hasn\u2019t stepped foot out of the palace. And he almost never makes public speeches anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe queen remains her old loving self. She can often be seen out and about, giving money to the poor. Sometimes she even goes without an escort. Everyone loves her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe prince is another story. Ever since he could walk he has been getting into trouble. Stories of wild parties and orgies have leaked out of the royal palace. He may ruin formal dinners and spoil foreign relations, but I\u2019ve never heard of him doing anything especially devious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe king and queen also have a daughter, but I don\u2019t know much about her. The princess has only been seen once by the general populace, after which she went back inside the palace and hasn\u2019t come back out since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a minute to digest the information. Whatever course of action you take now, it will eventually lead you to the palace. You turn to your still bound informant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I get to the castle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cPlease! You can\u2019t pursue this any further! If you show up there asking questions, whoever it is that is responsible will know I talked! I won\u2019t be safe anywhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at her face, seeing the fear in her eyes. You think for a second before deciding what to do.</span></div></div>",

A super conveniently placed ladder! Something! You were about to give up and try walking through the front gates when something caught your eye. There was a section of the castle walls that was partially collapsed. There was a pile of bricks on the ground and above it there were some loose bricks that, if you were lucky, you might be able to jump up and grab them and use them to climb up onto the battlements. You quickly look around to see if there are any guards or sentries that might see you. When you don't see any more, you charge at the wall to get a good running start, and then jump off the pile of bricks and manage to grab one of the bricks sticking out of the remains of the wall. Fighting the urge to shout out in delight, you start climbing the jutting out bricks with some effort. When you grab the second or third from the top, you feel some shaking from the wall. Paling and swearing under your breath, you pull your legs up and use the wall to jump up and, just barely, grab the top of the wall that leads onto the battlement just as the wall crumbles a bit more and the bricks fall onto the ground with a bang.

Knave...\" With a disappointed sigh, you gently but firmly thrust her gag back into her mouth, uncaring of her outraged attempts to avoid it. Almost idly, you tear away a broad strip of her mussed skirt with your strong hands, binding it around her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may be so bold, my lady, that was very foolish.\" You lecture, tone calculated to produce maximum outrage in your bound victim. Judging by her continued shaking and trembling, it is highly effective. \"I will inquire again later, when you are prepared to cooperate with an agent of the public well-being  ..but for now, I told you that you would be punished for impeding the just in their duties, and I am as good as my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother grunt through her gag tells you exactly how good she thinks<i> that</i> is as well as her prior religious invective had. Heedless of her protests, you begin tying off other ropes on the crude bed-posts, settling in for a more thorough interrogation of the suspect. Said suspect groans and grunts to herself continuously in her firm hogtie, rubbing her wrists raw as she grinds against the ropes. At times, she seems to simply be trying to shift her skirt or shirt into a less revealing location; her struggles only further reducing what little dignity she has.        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the ropes in position, you kneel down beside your suspect, untying the running line holding her wrists to her ankles. You can feel her shake next to you as you grab one bare foot to keep steady, even that small contact making her giggle reluctantly. She springs apart under her own tension as you undo the bind, and you deftly flip her over as she flops like an asphyxiating fish. With the ease of considerable experience, you straddle her bare midsection, back to her head, and grab two of the ropes adhered to the footboard, passing them smoothly through her ankle bind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the 'tricky' part; you spin around on the spot, feeling the wench buck beneath you, groaning further pleas and protests into her gag, You reach under her, undoing the knots on her wrists, and grab one of her newly freed arms easily with one hand as the other snatches up a noosed rope. As her other arm flails, trying futilely to knock you off, you bring the two together, tying it off nice and tight. That done, you pin her remaining arm under yours. She's strong- but you're stronger, and soon her last free appendage is safely bound and stretched to the edge of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more tugs to ensure a firm hold, you slide off your prisoner, giving her belly another little spider-tickle absentmindedly. Bound tightly in a 'Y', lying half-naked on the bed in her own establishment, the wench rolls back and forth, moaning into her gag desperately striving for the slightest purchase against the uncaring restraints. There exists none.              <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, my lady,\" You say regretfully, settling down beside her, letting her feel you through the shifting mattress. \"I am sorry that it should come to this.\" Gently, you grab the mussed hemline of her shirt and tug upwards, revealing a shapely belly toned by life's more arduous requirements, quivering as the cool evening air strikes its owner anew. Casually, you give her a poke, perilously close to her navel, and she sucks in, showing the outlines of her ribs clearly as you carelessly dash her chemise over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the firm, round breasts also exposed, but resolve to leave those for later. For the moment, you take it slow, walking your fingers over her nude body, feeling her tremble and shudder at your unwanted touch. Your finger your way down her ribs and sides, confirming an impressively ticklish response for each. For the moment, you dance your fingers over her, letting the wench realize for herself how powerless she is to stop you. There is no need to hurry as you caress and tease her; after all, you have all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter savoring her bare, sensitive skin for a time, however, you begin to grow impatient, stepping up the tickling. Leaving her curvy hips and feet for later, you instead begin to work over her sides in earnest, lobster pinching from just above her hips to her ribs and back. She squeals into the gag, muffled laughter bubbling out as you play with her body, quietly delighting in the feel of her firm, warm flesh and soft skin under your fingers. Up and down, squeezing and prodding, up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allow her to settle into the routine -even slowing down whenever you reach the bottom of her ribs, an especially weak point- but then leap to her hips without warning. The shocked wench howls quietly into her gag, thrusting up and bucking wildly as you squeeze against her effeminate hips. You stay on her through every minute thrash and squirm, probing all the while, working your hands expertly to stimulate the deepest nerve cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just think- you could have avoided all this,\" You drawl, sliding one arm under and holding her close as the other teases at the upper reaches of her pelvis. \"Had you only seen what was just and cooperated.\" The hand around her side -unbeknownst to her, holding a large feather- wiggles in to swirl around in her navel, you other arm leaving off her hips to hold her quivering belly steady. Pressed up against her soft, sweaty body, you feel her squirm and squeak as you swirl the tip of the feather around in her bellybutton.       <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Indeed, you\u2019re constantly edging it further into the belly button in order to maximize the tickles you draw from the belly button clit and the tiny know hidden within its folds.

After that, the silent laughter takes her and her lungs and ribs are barely keeping up with her oxygen demands. Her laughter slows down and her squirming relaxes as she tries to draw one more breath through the mind-bending tickles coming out of her sensitive belly button.

Alas it was no use as his hands slip and you both plummet into the darkness, screaming. \"You idiot!\" The wolf shouted over the sound of your screaming and the wind blowing over your ears \"I thought it would be funny!\" You shout back as you both continue to fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep going for a good 2 minuets, the walls of the hole streaming past you dangerously fast, your grip tightens on the wolf, hoping he'll somehow break the fall when you finally hit the bottom. \"How deep-\" you begin to ask but you're quickly cut off as you both land on something squishy and slimy \"-oof\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" The wolf says starting to panic and struggle<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry,\" you say, finally letting go of him<br>\r\n\"It's not that!\" He says \"it's...agh!\"<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" You ask beginning to worry, it's to dark to make anything out but by feeling down you discover that the wolf is being sucked into whatever this squishy thing is. Panicking you grab his ankles try to pull him back out, but it's hard to get a grip with all the slime. Eventually you manage to get your arms stuck (well done -_- ) and start to get dragged in as well! It is at that moment that you realise the horrific truth, your in a mouth, you landed in some creatures mouth and now your being eaten! You struggle with all you might but it's no use as you dragged further and further in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice in the creatures throat is all the large cilia, big enough to be seen anyway in the dull glow coming from inside the creature. They look like fine hairs waving around, the next thing you notice is how much they tickle as the wave over your skin, causing you to smile. The more of you dragged in means the more of you that's available to be tickled and it's getting harder and harder to suppress your giggles. You look ahead to see you wolfs feet as he squirms and wiggles, you hear his hysterical laughter from further along. Another worrying thing you notice is his shorts dissolving in the slime, looks like your clothing isn't going to protect you very long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both slide along, further and further as more of you slips into this tunnel of tickling, everything from your waist up is inside and the top of your cotton shirt is already beginning to dissolve. Giggles keep leaking out of you mouth your left more and more exposed. You look up to see that the wolfs boxers have been left untouched, at least the creature is letting the both of you keep your dignity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll to soon your whole body has entered the throat and the slime has dissolved everything but your (males:) boxers/ (females:) bra and panties. You laugh and squirm with the cilia tickle every inch of exposed skin. The throat is snug and presses against all of your body leaving no space of your skin unreachable by the cilia, your toes, thighs, ribs, ears... nowhere is safe as you laugh like a madman. However, deciding to make the most of a bad situation you work up the strength to torment the wolf some more: it is his fault for letting go after all. You reach up with your hands and start to tickle his feet. His laughter shoots up and you think you hear some foul language but it's hard to make out. Just in case you punish him by grabbing his ankles and then pushing his feet into the hairy walls giving the cilia complete access to his cute sensitive feet and toes, he goes ballistic and struggles all the more- this time you defiantly hear some swear words. You soon stop torturing the poor wolf as your own tickling is taking its toll. Very quickly it becomes too much and you pass out. <br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up pinned on your back by a very angry wolf, with one hand he holds your arms above your head (and your still covered in slime- yay :/ ). \"What the hell where you thinking?\" He snarls \"what where you even doing, wondering about the forest?\" You explain to him that you where investigating the disappearances that had been occurring and when you found exposed like that you couldn't resist. \"Well you want to know where they went?\" He asks \"here! This is where people have disappeared to, they're trapped in this godforsaken place!\"<br>\r\n\"Where is here?\" You ask, trying to struggle out from under him, you don't like his tone<br>\r\n\"The tickle labyrinth, filled with creatures and traps to tickle all who dare enter. I've been investigating, trying to find away to save those people until you came along and ruined everything, now we're trapped here as well!\"<br>\r\n\"You where stuck in that hole! Either way you where going to end up here!\" The wolf scowls at you and you give a triumphant grin \"so what was that thing anyway?\" You ask, thinking back to that strange creature<br>\r\n\"It was a tickle worm, eats you and then tickles you as you past through its long body before finally releasing you. I think it gave you a good taste of what you've gotten us into, but maybe you need another.\" He grins wiggling his clawed fingers menacingly and closes in on your armpits... \"Tickle tickle...\"</span></div></div>",

After it we will become bond as master and servant, one who wins obviously becomes master while other becomes servant. It will let us share magic energy and be much more effective in battle together.\" She explains<br>\r\n\"If we both get same perks, what's the difference between master and servant?\" You ask<br>\r\n\"Well... the master gains control spell over the servant.

Starting with your first clue, the papers detailing the names of people kidnapped you stumble across something. Underneath is a paper that appears to be a map of Trillian and the surrounding areas, only with red circles drawn in various locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudying them for a minute you realize based on your digging on the way here that these are approximate locations of where the kidnappings happened! But why would these gnolls have evidence of their own crimes? Unless they were investigating same as you. But then why be so defensive? The unconscious gnoll behind you was proof of that. You had no idea what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have long to ponder either. The growling behind you made it clear the gnoll had awoken. What hadn't been made clear was the backup that had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entire row of snarling gnolls surrounded you from a few feet away. They were well-armed, brandishing axes and blades of varying sizes. As you went for yours, you noticed the line part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough stepped a tall woman, dressed in light metal rainments. Her hair was very short, and blonde, her pale skin giving a northern air to her. She reached into a satchel at her waist and pulled out a curious bauble. With stern gusto, she presented the royal seal. \"Agent Iren. Trillian special forces. I assume you'll come quietly.\" Her tone was lined with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were REALLY confused. The Trillian army working with gnolls? Something was afoot here and you didn't like it one bit. But you had to admit this woman did seem legitimate. Not saying that was a good thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had enough space to make a break for it. All you needed was a distraction. You readied a knife to throw from your belt. However, as you extended your arm Iren was on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith inhuman like reflexes, Iren jabbed her hand up into your forearm, making it instantly numb and then went for your throat. You had half a second to realize what happened before you were unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your body slumped to the ground, Iren slapped imaginary dust from her hands in a mocking gesture. \"They never do take my advice.\" She quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in a dungeon cell, well lit by torches. As you tried to pull your hands up to your face you were met with pain in your arms. Your wrists were in metal shackles chained to the ground with little slack. Your attempts to move your legs revealed the other half of your bondage. You were sitting on your butt on the floor, with both ankles going into a single hole in a small stocks in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could start planning your escape, you heard a familiar voice. \"Good to see you're awake\" said Iren as she entered the cell. \"I've been eager to speak with you\" She spoke as if you were two friends meeting in a tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me?\" You asked plainly. \"Hmmf. It isn't obvious? You've been sticking your nose where it doesn't belong. I'm here to find out where.\" She gave a smirk that implied she enjoyed your predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to tell me everything you know about the disappearances. Simple enough?\" She mocked. \"I know as little as you do\" You complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't imagine what she wanted to know from you. You didn't feel threatened though, whether she was involved with the kidnappings or not there was nothing to gain from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter\" Iren removed her leather gloves and cracked her knuckles. \"This is what I'm trained for.

It's Trillian law that I'm responsible for your well-being.\" She said in a friendly manner. You couldn't imagine what she was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to feel your boot being unlaced. You spun your ankle in protest. \"What are you doing?\" You said in surprise. \"Making you comfortable. I've been trained to be accommodating to those I seek info from. You'd be surprised at the success rate.\" She explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had heard of agents of other kingdoms offering prisoners with court worthy information full meals. You would have asked for that instead, but given you tried to throw a knife at this law official, you opted against it. Iren pulled off your other boot, then yanked your socks in one quick motion. You rubbed your bare feet together. Iren placed your footwear to the side of the stocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set her plan in motion. She put the large satchel she carried on the ground and began to dig through it. \"Have you ever seen a Wyvern during early molting? They look akin to giant four legged birds. The feathers over their scales produce a nerve toxin to ward off predators as it induces massive pain to the biting creature as a defense.  However, in small doses their toxin acts a stimulant, heightening awareness. It absorbs right through the skin making it perfect for medicinal purposes. And what I... Have in mind\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had hoped you heard her wrong but then you felt it. An itchy sensation moving over your trapped bare feet. You slid them under and over each other, trying to dodge the feeling. \"You're moving an awful lot.\" Iren teased, revealing you had been duped out of your shoes. \"You wouldn't happen to be... ticklish would you?\" Iren was clearly enjoying her game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twisted your feet in every direction,  unable to escape the feather. Every so often you would get a feather down a whole sole or between a pair of toes, and squirm frantically. \"It would be very unfortunate if you were ticklish, seeing as your feet are trapped.\" Iren continued to tease. \"At least admit your feet are ticklish, and I might be merciful\" Iren went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The venom isn't permanent, but it will make your feet even more ticklish than they already are.\" Iren was picking her words carefully to torment you. She was right about the venom. Whether it was mind games or not, every stroke felt worse. Your feet were sweating from how much you wiggled your toes to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feather kissed every inch of wrinkling flesh, sweeping back and forth, up and down without mercy. \"The longer you resist the more venom you absorb, the more ticklish your feet get. Keep this up and you won't be able to wear shoes for days! Every single touch will tickle, tickle tickle.\" Iren breathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou refused to speak, refused to allow your resolve to crack. This woman was mad! You knew nothing, you just had to hold on to that. \"Until you tell me everything you know I'll just keep going, you want to know the best part?\" She slowed her feather stroke to a crawl and looked you in the eyes \"This is just one feather.\" You immediately felt a second plume added to torment your feet. Now able to switch patterns, Iren got between your toes and down your soles with at least one feather every pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot getting a single respite was wearing at you. Your mouth held back the pressure with all you could bear. Unfortunately, Iren decided to break your resistance. You felt a sharp point dig into your right arch then scribble up your sole while your left was poked by the same feeling, forcing you to burst out giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to hold out this long when you're this ticklish? Big mistake. Now I shall have to break you to make sure I learn everything you're hiding.\" Iren said in a complaining tone as she dragged her quills over your flesh, leaving pink trails on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No morhore ticklinhing! I cahan't take it!\" You pleaded with Iren. \"You had plenty of time to confess earlier. I warned you. You have left me no choice.\" Iren explained. \"You could leheave my feheet alohone!\" Your sentence trailed into laughter. \"I will stop once I'm sure I've left you with no will to resist\" the blonde agent answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how shall I approach this?\" Iren asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You tried to wiggle your foot around, but ties around each of your 5 toes kept you from doing this. after a couple seconds, Iren seemed satisfied and then did the same thing with your left foot as she did with your right, tying each toe back so that you could not curl your toes or wiggle your feet around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright! that looks pretty good to me!\" Iren said, admiring her handiwork. \"Look, i don't really know anything about whatever it is you gu-\" your speech is cut off by Iren. \"Hold that thought, Mrs. Ticklish, i have to make sure these toe binds are working.\" When she said this, you felt a sinking feeling as you realized what she meant by make sure they are working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh you don't ha-nnf!\" your speech is interrupted by a feather circling the ball of your right foot then traveling down the side, circling the heel, the tracing back up the arch. You try to curl your toes, wiggle your feet, or do anything to stop the sensations but your binds do not give almost any slack. Iren notices your effort and taunts \"Does this tickle? Oh man i bet it does, i know that if someone was doing this to my feet, i wouldn't be able to stand it! How is this not bothering you? Haha! Just a joke, i know you're ticklish... I don't know why you're trying to hold it in.\" You were able to hold your laughter in for the most part, but every time the feather slid over your arch you found yourself letting out a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few minutes of the methodical feather strokes, Iren looked over at you, stopping her ticklish assault momentarily. \"Y'know, i haven't even started the tickling yet... I'm required by Trillian law to give you atleast 30 minutes to answer before i begin \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques... Looks like you have about four minutes left, then the REAL fun begins! Although, it is fun to watch your face contort when i feather your foot. I notice that the arch is a bit of a soft spot for you, see, riiiiight there\" Iren accentuated this point by feathering your arch for a couple seconds, making your knees buck upwards and giggles escape your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But i wonder where else on these feet are tic-\" Iren is cut off when she absentmindedly runs the feather under your toes, causing you to let out a laugh and jerk your whole body.

Just as the bristles were about to contact your skin, you heaved a sigh of relief as your captor paused at the sound of the wooden door to the dungeon creaking open. \u201cYou\u2019ve already started without me? For shame, Irene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was about to begin, Griss, when you so rudely interrupted me.\u201d You turned to see another woman approach. Other than having peach coloured skin and flowing brown locks, her attire and look was very much like her fellow Trillian guard. \u201cDid you bring the special items for testing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Griss chuckle as she pulled a similar leather bag from her hip. Placing it down next to Irene\u2019s, her hands dug out two abnormally pale and translucent feathers. \u201cOf course. The harpies were quite the troublesome lot, mind you. After we managed to bring a few of them to the ground, all it took to change their minds was a few minutes under their own flight feathers.\u201d Seeing their ends swaying eerily in the non-existent wind of the cell, the knot in your stomach tightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I told you what they did, did I? Let\u2019s show them what our newest toy can do.\u201d Irene smirked as she made space for Griss to sit next to her. When the brunette swiped the length of your arch with her two ghostly feathers, you let out a shriek at the ice-cold sensations. \"Aiieeee! W-What kind of feathers are those?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun to see prisoners reacting to our new tools. What do you think if added these Wyvern feathers to the mix?\u201d Giggling to each other before giving you giving you sadistic smiles, you fearfully slowly shook your head as deadly \u201cN-No, please, anything bu-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gave you your chance to talk. Now laugh and tell us what you know!\u201d Ignoring your protests, Irene and Griss began to swipe their respective feathers along the arches of each taut foot. As electrifyingly ticklish sensations bombarded your left sole, soft feathery caresses licked your right arches from top to bottom. In just a matter of seconds, your speech was reduced to maddening gibberishness, begging for release. \u201cPleehehheeease! I don\u2019t know A-Aahahhahaaaanything! I was just inveehehehheeehehestigating the disappearances as well! Gaahahahahahahaaaa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop lying. You must be either a Rylestia or Coninze spy, kidnapping our villagers for your dastardly war. We\u2019ll show you what happens to captured spies. Irene, hand me one of your feathers.\u201d With both guards now armed with both a Wyvern and Harpy feather, you doubted the tickling could get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026At least until several minutes later, where hysterical laughter still poured from your mouth like a raging stream. With the toxicating feather increasing the sensitivity of your soles with each passing lick, this left the other feather free to wreck ticklish havoc. Both Trillian guards played your feet like a violin with almost years of practice. Harpy feathers sawed under the bases of your heels and trapped toes, their ice-cold fronds kepping your mind awake and refreshed for another round of feathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightly snickering at your pathetic attempts to break free, Irene asked. \u201cAre you ready to reveal where the villagers have been taken? Or will you need further proof of our techniques?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Until you are lead through some uncomfortably cold and damp section of the castle, where the odor of wood smoke and mold hangs heavily in the air. All around you echo the screams, and laughter, of countless pleading voices, sending a shiver up your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you are brought to a small, stone cell and expertly divested of your clothing and weapons before being hung by your ankles from a pair of manacles dangling from the middle of the low ceiling. Your wrists are freed momentarily only to be quickly re-manacled in hard, iron cuffs, bolted to the stone floor. The hood is yanked from your head and you see the scarred woman eyeing you coldly. You are naked and chained upside down but you meet her gaze with your own determined stare.

You are extremely ticklish, of course, and cold sweat begins to bead on your face. You clamp your eyes shut and your entire body tenses in hopeless preparation for the inevitable torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolently she attacks your armpits and ribs, sending you into waves of flinching spasms. Almost immediately, you explode in embarrassing squeals of helpless laughter! And then you feel even more hands, expertly poking and tickling at your thighs and feet, the two red cloaked figures have joined in the interrogation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the delirium of tickle torture you are now and again asked a question and given mercilessly little time to breathe and answer (often you must choose between one or the other) before the tickling continues.

Soon the room begins to sway nauseatingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it working?\" asks one of the harem women, her voice strange and echoing in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother of the women stares into your eyes and you attempt to ask what is going on, but you are unable to make a sound. \"Oh yes, she says. It's working very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room begins to go dark and the voices of the women start to trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one must be extremely ticklish if they're to be part of His Majesty's amusements.\" Says one of the women, sounding distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undoubtedly, the poor creature. I wonder if they'll survive.\" Answers another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might it not be more merciful if they didn't?\" Says the third woman, eliciting a chorus of sharp laughter as you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to in a large, garishly appointed room. Bright decorations in the colors of the kingdom hang from every rafter and wall. With creeping terror you realize you are exotically bound and gagged: the centerpiece of a heavy wooden table, strewn about with feathers of every variety!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is filled with other such tables and similar centerpieces, other young women and men, some seemingly shaking off a drug-induced torpor, others, already awakened and aware of their plight, struggling desperately in their bondage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, and every other \"centerpiece\" is laying on your back, against a heavy, leather-padded wooden device. Unyielding, golden metallic chains circle your chest and abdomen, holding you tight against the device. Your wrists are manacled behind your neck, and your elbows are bound to a cold metal crossbar running behind your head. Your ankles are bound to your thighs, and intricate manacles above and below your knees, are chained to the same crossbar that holds your elbows. You are essentially spread eagle, but bent at the elbows and knees. You are able to wiggle your fingers and feet, but very little else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou surmise from the other centerpieces, that you are fitted with a delicate metal collar and a hoop of metal around your head, ending in a large, leather ball gag. Both the men and women wear the same leather and cloth loin covering and nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a familiar voice from behind you and your blood runs cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You're awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful but scarred interrogator steps into view and leans menacingly toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I don't know who you are, or what your actual intentions were coming to this kingdom, but I don't really care, \"she explains, running her finger over the sole of your left foot, eliciting a frightened squeal from behind your gag. \"You'll be far better employed as royal entertainment than ever you could have been as a mercenary, of that much I'm certain. I don't think I've ever met someone so ticklish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes up a stiff, iridescent feather from the table and begins tracing it slowly from your waist toward your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look how you shudder and pant at the slightest touch of the feather!\" She says, delighted. \"And your reaction when I do something actually ticklish ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins flicking the feather back and forth, several inches away from your armpit, moving it slowly closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plead unintelligibly, and shift helplessly in your restraints, trying desperately to shield yourself from the impending torture. But she stops short and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you must be kept fresh for the nobles, sadly.\" And at that, a pair of huge, wooden doors swing open on the far side of the chamber and a crowd of baroque looking nobles and courtesans pours in; laughing and chatting and hoisting great, bejeweled goblets of wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith varying degrees of interest, the king's guests arrange themselves around the tables; some absentmindedly tickling the foot of a helpless young blonde woman, others smiling lasciviously as they concertedly attack with feather and fingers, the shuddering body of a desperately laughing young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the room fills with uncontrollable laughter and unintelligible cursing and begging. The heavily made-up and portly pair of noble ladies that have made their way to your table, lick their lips giddily, as they take an agonizingly long time deciding where to tickle you and with what. As the older of the two flips your loin cloth out of the way, leaving you wholly exposed and humiliated, the other slowly brings a large, ebon feather down between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes tightly and prepare for an agonizing, and hopefully short, life as a Rylestian tickle slave.</span></div></div>",

Ever since you were little you've had experience with the bow, often riding out with your father to bring back a meal or two to cook. In the many years since you first started hunting, you have never stopped and continually gotten better. Of course, it's not the same as being trained to be an <i>archer</i>, but you think you'll fare well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much experience do you have with the bow?\" asks the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twelve years of hunting, your majesty. I am not as good as your expert archers - not even close - but I think I will be able to hold my own with the militia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The militia it is then.\" She consults her maps for a second. \"Hmmm, there is a town near the border called Braune, with a militia garrison of a few dozen. It is relatively out of the way, so you should not have to worry. If the enemy <i>does</i> attack, remember that you need only hold them off until the citizens escape. Patriotism does this country no good if you die. Now if you'll excuse me, there are other urgent matters I must attend to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Beg pardon, you majesty.\" Turning, you are escorted back the way you came. You appreciate the Queen's polite concern, but you are a little disappointed that you are placed so far from the action. Ever since your first kill, you feel a thrill whenever you were on the hunt. It was exciting to think that you might have seen a few battles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle guards provide you with a bow and a quiver full of arrows, a mount, provisions to last till Braune, and a map. Thanking them, you ride your new chestnut steed through the capital, under the gate, and out into the forest. Braune is a lumberjack community, with wooden walls and a population numbering only a few hundred. It is a good two day's journey, but you were prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see bright sunlight pierce the canopy of leaves that casts shadows along the trail. The healthy green plants help you feel calm, and you slow your horse to a trot. It is hard to believe that this vibrant country is at war, let alone at war with one of the strongest military powers in the area. You do find solace in the fact that at least the violence hasn't spread too far across the border of either nation. At the thought, you quicken your horse's pace to a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of traffic lessens as you proceed further and further away from the capital, to the point where you are the only one on the path. A brief check of your map confirms that you are making good time - better than expected. Braune is only a day's ride away, and nightfall isn't for a couple hours. It is only logical that you should take a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading the chestnut mount off to one side, you hitch it to the branch of a tree and let it have some nuts. You suspect that the horse's excellent pace and stamina are due the credit of getting you this far so quickly. Seeing no harm in resting, you lay your bow and quiver on the ground, lay your head on the grassy earth , and nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake just as the sun is setting, the beautiful colors setting the sky alight. In no rush to continue, you stretch and slowly sit up. A quick glance shows that the horse is waiting patiently and your weapon is still by your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rustle in undergrowth behind you shocks you out of your reverie. Grabbing you bow and notching an arrow, you spin to face the noise. The rustling continues, until something emerges from behind a tree...</span></div></div>",

There are small little leaf shaped bumps here and there on her body, and her skin was tinted ever so slightly green. \"I...Y-you just s-scared m-me. I...I thought you were one o-of them...\" She said timidly, blushing. Oddly enough, her cheeks actually were small roses- they bloomed whenever she blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly lower your bow, confused by all this. You then ask the question: \"One of whom, Ms...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, Rose, sir/my lady.\" She said, giving a small smile. \"A-and to b-be honest, t-they are very many...a l-lot of soldiers...some are red and black, and others are blue and yellow...l-like...you. That's why I was scared. B-but...you aren't hurting me. T-thank you.\" She said nervously.

B-both of them, slimes and elves...they've been attacking this forest...I'm...I'm one of the few dryads left...I...I...\" She got on her knees and crawled slowly to you, looking at you desperately. \"I lost my mom and father...to those slimes...I...I know it's a longshot, but...p-please, could you help me in some small way? I don't care if I never see the forest again...I'm just scared...whatever you can do to help me, I'll do it! I-I can be a good travel companion! I-I'm very faithful! I c-could be your partner, too!\" She offered, making you blush. While she was cute, and...honestly, you could see yourself courting her, she was going a LITTLE fast, assuming that you were (If female) lesbian (if male) single. Still, she seemed desperate: there probably was some way you could help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo....what will you do? Will you help her or leave her?</span></div></div>",

I can't believe Queen lets him still work with him constantly going there like that... though not like I can complain, since he at least pays for his drinks.\" The woman who seemed in her early thirties replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked for the information and went towards the table you were pointed towards. Easily noticing a middle-aged slightly fat, but not obese, man with a big mustache whom you assumed to be Borin. In front of him was a rather mysterious looking fellow fully clad in a rather fancy looking armor, the face covered by a helmet as well. They seemed to be deep in discussion and didn't notice you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all I could find out Merewin. I'm not a professional spy, and I'd rather not risk losing my position with the queen.\" Borin told the mysterious knight<br>\r\n\"Coward! You claim to support my cause, but constantly keep giving me fucking excuses!\" A much more high pitched voice than you expected sounds from the armor... could it be the wearer is a female? Upon closer inspection you notice some bits of long blonde hair coming from underneath the helmet on the sides...<br>\r\n\"Calm down please... I know what your mother did to you wasn't fair, and you want justice, but if I lose my position, you will lose your only source of information!\"<br>\r\n\"Tch... I suppose you have a point. Don't call that bitch my mother though, a real mother doesn't disown her daughter, and kicks her out because she got bored of lover she had her with.\"The armored female replies<br>\r\n\"Now now, if you just calm down and wait some more, I'm sure there will be a chance for you to... let's say... settle your differences with her down the line. You can't be so hotheaded if you plan to claim the throne you know?\" Captain Borin said the last sentence quietly, but not quietly enough considering how close you were<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly sounds like you just heard something that you shouldn't have... and that you aren't gonna be getting any gear from the captain if you stay there for even a moment longer. However, just as you quickly turn around towards the exit, you accidentally hit an empty mug on one of the tables, causing it to fall on the floor and gain attention of whole tavern...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! This scumbag was listening to us!\" The armored female called Merewin quickly connects the dots after seeing how close you were to them and starts getting up from the table</span></div></div>",

Behind you, a similar slam could be heard as both armored boots gave chase. \"Stop right there, bastard! How long have you been eavesdropping on us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long enough to figure out there's a pretty face underneath that helmet.\" You gave a mocking laugh. Hearing the female knight's swearing becoming even more crude, you jumped over some crates of fruit into an narrow alley. Your purseur merely brought out her ornate sword, cutting the obstacles in her way before making progress. \"You will pay for that, cur!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching a favourable stretch of the backend streets, you turned to face Merewin with your shortsword. While Captain Borin hadn't joined the chase, you assumed he would have left in advance to secure contingency plans. The sound of clanking metal dragged you from your thoughts, your pursuer having finally caught up. Judging from the hunched posture and awkward stance, your choice of tight spaces was right in limiting her longsword. \"Tired already, Miss Knight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accept death, heathen! I will teach you not to pry into royal affairs!\" You unsheathed your smaller blade up against an easily telegraphed overhead slash. Using Merewin's momentum against herself, you easily danced behind her heavy figure. From this position, you easily kept her off balanced with a few gentle pushes as you kept your weapon. \"Having fun? We can keep this up all day, and you wouldn't be able to lay a finger on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard! Stand still so I can cut you down!\" The female knight growled. Dodging another wide swing, the sound of metal striking against stone echoed through the alley. Figuring it was time to get some answers, you felt around the back of Merewin's armor. If your guesses were correct and she was indeed wearing a set of Coninze-crafted armor... a small 'click' sounded your truimph as the emergency catch of the metal released itself, the back of the intricate plate swinging open. With your first sight being the flowing blonde tresses hidden underneath, simple linen clothes covered Merewin's surprisingly slender yet well-proportioned upperbody. From the sides of her chest, you could already see the strain from the front of her shirt. \"I've just released your emergency clasps, Miss Merewin. Would you so kindly engage your armor's stripping mechanism from inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I do that, you bitch!\" Clinging tightly to her back, the female had yet to figure out there was no way to deliver a strike at your current position. Shrugging your shoulders, you gave her sides an experimental squeeze. Hearing the startled squeal from her helmet, you grinned. \"Is this lady knight... a little ticklish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you da-aahahahhaaaaa!\" You slipped your fingers into her clothes, lightly stroking her sides. In an surprising reaction, the armored knight quickly dropped her sword as her gauntlets hugged and clawed at the front of her armor. \"Ceehhehheheease! I demaahahhahaand you to stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ask of you the same question; Why should I do that?\" You cheekily answered. Moving upwards to tickle her ribs, girlish giggles spluttered from Merewin's helmet as the knight was forced onto her knees. She leaned on a nearby wall for support, even as your fingers begun the task of poking each individual rib of upperbody. \"One, two, three... My apologies, I seem to have lost count. May we start over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dahahahhaaam you! To behhehehheee done in like this, by a bit of... teheheheheeeeckling! Haahahahahaaa!\" Merewin could only pound her metal fists against the ground in ticklish agony. Feeling something soft touching your knuckles as you prodded her last rib, you smirked. Giving what you felt a few cheeky scratches, a high pitched shriek could be heard in the alley before the sound of multiple metal pieces fell to the floor. \"Wahahahhahaait! Dohohohoon't go there! I'll releheehheease the mechanism, so just stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquatting down besides the proud knight, you could now see the flowing blonde hair matted over her crooked smile. While multiple parts of her armor had split into detachable sets, a few key pieces remained attached on her body. Giving her another glance over, you took in the sight of her lithe body and flustered cheeks. \"I must say, I wasn't expecting my pursuer to be thinly clothed underneath all that armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh all you want. I'll have you hung by the end of todahahahhaahaa!\" Merewin collapsed into another fit of giggles as you ran your fingers over the backs of her naked thighs. Moving away before her kicks found their target, you snickered. \"Your long legs doth protest, Miss Knight. Now, mind explaining to me the details of that little meeting?\"</span></div></div>",

It made you wonder if she would be even more ticklish in more typical spots, like her feet.<br>\r\n\"D-Don't you fucking dahahare tohohouch myhyhy bohohohots!\" Merewin said mid-giggling as she could see you slowly going down closer to attempt removing those boots, covering her undoubtedly sensitive feet... <br>\r\nBut before you could try your luck at actually removing them, you have been interrupted by sudden sound of footsteps coming from behind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?!... Hey you two! The streets aren't place for your lewd foreplay! Take it to yer bedchamber, or I am going to have to take you both to prison for the night! Guards there will sure give you a ticklin' so hard you're never gonna even think of doing that again, especially in public!\" Said a female voice behind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon turning around you could notice that the person was one of the town guard, judging from her light armor and emblems onto it. She clearly misunderstood what was going on there, but just as you thought about simply telling her that Merewin seems to be some kind of rebel working against the queen, you heard a whisper coming from her...<br>\r\n\"One word about what you heard at the tavern, and you are dead. I'm gonna escape, find you, and hang your sorry ass on nearest tree.\" The prideful blonde said, classy as ever.<br>\r\n\"Oi! Are the two of ya deaf? Take all of yer clothes from the ground, and get yerselves a room!\" The town guard added in annoyed tone, sounding noticeably more peasant-like, hinting at her possible background. She seemed fully convinced that you and Merewin were just a couple who probably had few drinks too much and decided to have some fun in public...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it would probably be morally upstanding thing to do to just tell the truth and snitch on what you heard, perhaps it will be better to keep quiet about it and pretend to be just a couple? Merewin certainly could have some funny reactions to you trying to act like her lover all of a sudden. <br>\r\nBesides, your word might not be enough of a proof to get any long-time arrests, and Merewin seems like the type who could hold a grudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's also the matter of Captain Borin, he might have already reached the barracks, and reported you... and possibly even Merewin to save his own skin, as traitors or rebels. It would probably be a good idea to leave quickly, rather than risk having to testify with you, a random mercenary from nowhere, having to go against a presumably respected Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You think about Queen Catherine\u2019s offer, and decide to join the guard. The Coninze-Rylestian War doesn\u2019t appear to be stopping anytime soon, and you know the Coninzian front-line has been outmatched by the more disciplined Rylestians. Being a soldier with sword and shield would be quite dangerous, even if the Coninzians have need. But a guard is much safer, and might get to enjoy some of the perks of living in the palace. Besides, you justify to yourself, if Coninze doesn\u2019t have good infantry, you might be a welcome addition to a palace at risk from spies and assassins. \u201cIf I may choose, your majesty, I would be honored to serve in the Guard.\u201d You tell the Queen, trying to be as respectful as possible to royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen nods. \u201cVery well. We could use more guards here in the palace these days. Present yourself to the guard tower. The Captain of the Guard will give you your assignment. If she is unavailable, ask for a man named Arturo. Her second can also fulfill the task.\u201d You bow and turn away, while the Queen beckons the next person forward. A servant woman at the door gives you directions to the guard tower, and you through the castle. As you walk, you notice there are guards posted in normal intervals. But half the time the guards are posted in pairs, other times by themselves. Usually it\u2019s better to double up, so both guards can\u2019t be taken by surprise. Are the Coninzians having trouble with manpower? If so, perhaps you\u2019ll be more valuable if you prove yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the guard tower, and at the ground floor is a large open area. Weapons and armor are stacked around the wall, and in the center is an arena or training area of some sort. A woman in plate mail is practicing sword thrusts, and appears to be the only person in the room. She\u2019s about your height, with short blonde hair that comes down to her chin. You approach her, careful to keep your distance from the thrust of her longsword. \u201cUh, excuse me. The Queen has assigned me to the palace guard, and I\u2019m looking for the captain. Can you show me where she is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turns to you, and for a moment just stares at you with her piercing blue eyes, as if sizing you up. \u201cI\u2019m Lydia, Captain of the Guard. So you\u2019re a new recruit, huh?\u201d She points to the wall with weapons and armor. \u201cGrab some mail and a weapon. I want to see what you\u2019re made of. I\u2019m not assigning a clumsy guard to protect the royal family.\u201d You nod, her idea is sensible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the armor and look it over. There\u2019s plenty of heavy plate and long swords\u2026 but in your experience that wouldn\u2019t do you any good against an assassin in a hallway or a bedroom. You\u2019d want to be maneuverable. Besides, your job would be to protect VIPs more than your own hide. You grab a black leather vest and matching bracer, giving your chest and forearms some protection but still keeping you nimble. You take a short sword and a dagger from the weapon rack, putting the dagger in your belt. The short sword feels nice and light in your hand, easy to swing in small spaces. Lydia notices your choices, and gives you a quizzical look. \u201cThat leather won\u2019t keep a sword from stabbing through you, and that short sword doesn\u2019t have much reach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to the center of the room, facing Lydia with your short sword at the ready. \u201cIn my experience it\u2019s better to be quick than armored. I\u2019m ready for the test whenever you are.\u201d Lydia just shrugs at your answer, and you get the sense she doesn\u2019t have much confidence in you. But she raises her sword and moves toward you aggressively. Time to see how good of a guard you can be!</span></div></div>",

But even with that strength, the heavy plate still slows her down a step, and it\u2019s enough for you to dodge away from her initial thrust. Her longsword is practically a two-hander, and much longer than yours. You dodge backwards, looking for an opening. You can tell that Lydia is skilled and strong. Her swings are powerful, and she wasn\u2019t pulling her punches. If you didn\u2019t know what you were doing, you\u2019d be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this isn\u2019t your first rodeo, and you know how to deal with this kind of encounter. You dodge and keep your distance from her first swings, clashing swords only when needed. She pushes you back, but you\u2019re careful not to get backed into a corner, turning and dodging. Eventually your patience is rewarded, she can\u2019t keep up those heavy swings too long without starting to slow. You find an opening and get in close to her, striking. She manages to deflect your strike with her sword, but you\u2019re in too close for her longsword. But it\u2019s not over yet, as she keeps defending and trying to push you back. You twist and turn around each other, and that\u2019s when you get your next opportunity. You swing out your leg, tripping her leg and causing her to stumble. Despite crossed blades, it\u2019s all the time you need to grab the dagger from your sheath and bring it up to her neck. \u201cAh!\u201d you cry out as the two of you freeze in position. \u201cDo you yield?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, a frustrated and angry look crosses Lydia\u2019s face, and you wonder if she\u2019ll try to keep on. But after that moment she realizes the match is over, and that you\u2019ve beaten her. \u201cI\u2026 I yield.\u201d You pull away your dagger and step back. The two of you both catch your breath for a moment. Lydia looks up at you, this time with respect in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re the first recruit to ever beat me.\u201d She tells you. \u201cUsually newcomers aren\u2019t fit to guard a sack of flour until I\u2019ve trained them. We could definitely use someone like you in the guard.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin, beaming with pride. You have confidence in your abilities, but this is the first time you\u2019ve been acknowledged like this. You\u2019re going to be an important member of the Coninzian Royal Guard! That sounds important, respectable. \u201cThank you, Captain!\u201d you tell her, remembering that she\u2019s still going to be your superior officer. \u201cWhat will be my assignment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia looks pensive for a moment, thinking it over. \u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t give a new recruit an important assignment right away, but you\u2019ve definitely proven yourself. Besides, we\u2019ve already sent many of our guards up to the front, leaving the castle under-defended. So I\u2019m going to make you the personal guard to\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was the Queen\u2019s younger sister, a full decade or more younger than her sister, the princess is well known throughout Coninze as a- 'free spirit' some would say. That kind of personality might make her difficult to defend and keep an eye on. But you also realize you\u2019ve been given a very important assignment. With the Queen (and Princess Victoria) unmarried and childless, Victoria is next in line for the throne should anything happen to the Queen.  \u201cThank you, Captain. I\u2019m honored to guard the Princess. I\u2019ll protect her with my life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee that you do.\u201d Lydia told you seriously. \u201cGuarding the Princess is a difficult assignment, but you seem like the capable sort. I don\u2019t doubt your ability to defend her, although the Princess will definitely test you in other ways.\u201d The Captain tells you this with a wry smirk, and you wonder just what exactly she means by that. But you decide that you\u2019ll figure it out on your own sooner or later, and push that thought aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia lets you keep the weapons and armor, and gives you a set of clothes with the emblem of the Guard over the heart. You change into the proper uniform, and Lydia tells you how to find the Princess\u2019s quarters. Eventually you\u2019ll have to figure out the layout of the castle, but you\u2019ll have time for that when you\u2019re off duty. At least, you assume there will be a time when you\u2019re off duty. Unless they expect you to keep close to the Princess night and day? There is a war on\u2026 but you decide to take things one step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way through the castle, and up to the royal quarters. This area is quite lavish, with elaborate tapestries and silks on the wall. As you look up at them, you can\u2019t help but wonder how much food and clothing they would buy for the poor of Coninze. You guess that all royals need to keep up appearances. Queen Catherine seemed to be a good ruler. While Coninze didn\u2019t have the wealth of Rylestia or Forazio, the people were able to live their lives freely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to the door you were instructed to open, and to your surprise you find yourself right inside the Princess\u2019s bedroom.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There are two women on top of the large bed in the princess\u2019s chambers. The most striking thing about them is that one of the women is straddling the other and energetically tickling the living daylights out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women look to be in their early 20\u2019s, the same age as you. Your eyes move to the woman being tickled: She's not wearing much at all, with red silk garments covering her breasts and waist. She has long jet black hair in a braid down to the small of her back. She's obviously beautiful, with toned legs, a flat taut stomach, pert breasts, and dark, hooded eyes. As you take in all of her exposed, tanned skin, you notice four silk scarves tied to her wrists and ankles, which in turn are tied to the head and foot of the bed. She giggles and laughs as the other woman rakes up nails up and down under her arms, teasing the taut and obviously ticklish armpits. The woman laughs easily, and makes no attempt to shake or stop her tickler. In fact, if anything she seems to be enjoying her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickler is a pale skinned brunette with an equally attractive figure. You allow your eyes to slip down her body and like what you see- an untied silk night-robe gives you full view of her underwear taunt stomach and slender figure. She kneels on her toned legs that seem to glisten in the sunlight coming from the window and for a moment you wonder what you'd give to see her in the position of the other girl. Her eyes never leave her victim's face and she seems transfixed on every giggle and involuntary smile the girl makes. As you gaze at her, you realize this is the woman you\u2019ve been assigned to: Princess Victoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment you realize this, she seems to notice your presence as well. She turns her head to you, and gives you a quizzical look. Her hands move away from the dark-haired woman\u2019s underarms, but you notice one finger continues to tickle her, making idle figure-eights over her belly and keeping her victim giggly. \u201cYes?\u201d The princess asks, arching an eyebrow. \u201cIs there something you need? I believe the guards know better than to interrupt my playtime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, not wanting to start off with the princess in a sour mood. \u201cUh... begging your pardon, your highness. I\u2019ve just been assigned as your personal guard, and was instructed by Captain Lydia to report to you at once. I was told to enter the doors and wasn\u2019t told you were, uh\u2026 indisposed.\u201d You say nervously, standing at what you hope is some kind of military attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmhmm\u2026 what happened to your last guard, Victoria?\u201d The other woman asks, her voice giggly. She gives the princess a playful look, and you get the impression that this insubordinate banter isn\u2019t new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, he was no fun at all, Alexandria.\u201d The princess replies dismissively, pulling her fingertip away and pausing her tickle session. \u201cI had him transferred to the Rylestian front. That dour nature of his will do more good there than here.\u201d You definitely take note of that little bit of information. Don\u2019t be dour, she doesn\u2019t like it. The princess then turns to you. \u201cBut I like the look of you much better than him. Come closer. Tell me, are you swearing to protect and serve me?\u201d She asks, that playful glint is still in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 yes ma\u2019am. Your highness. I swear on my life to keep you from harm and obey your commands. I am your shield.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Princess Victoria says with a widening grin. \u201cBut at the moment I don\u2019t need a shield so much as another pair of hands. Help me tickle Alexandria\u2019s feet while I get the rest of her.\u201d You\u2019re surprised by the first command, as your eyes dart down to the dark-haired woman\u2019s - Alexandria\u2019s - restrained feet at the foot of the bed. And just past them, the princess\u2019s own bare feet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr\u2026\u201d Alexandria pipes in. \u201cYou can start tickling her feet and let me out of these scarves. Victoria is due for some payback, and I promise it\u2019ll be worth it\u2026\u201d You eyes widen even more at that suggestion. Would you dare tickle the princess? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush, Alex. Don\u2019t give my new guard any ideas. I\u2019m not done with you yet!\u201d Victoria says, turning back to Alexandria and digging her nails into her sides, wriggling up her ribs quickly. Alexandria lets out a squeal of laughter, arching her back as she undergoes a new tickling assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now what should you do? It doesn\u2019t seem very fitting for a guard to play games with the royals\u2026 but you don\u2019t want to lose this job for something more dangerous. The easiest thing to do would be to obey the princess and tickle this Alexandria. She certainly seems ticklish, and it honestly looks like fun. You have to admit the thought of tickling this beautiful woman is exciting. But even more exciting would be tickling the princess\u2026 she didn\u2019t seem angry at Alexandria\u2019s suggestion. She seemed\u2026 playful. And she did say it would be \u2018worth it.\u2019 It definitely would show you aren\u2019t \u2018dour\u2019 like the last guard. But are you really that bold?</span></div></div>",

You can already hear the order to have you reassigned to the Rylestian front or some other far flung hellhole that's about to come from her lips.

She spins around to clap her hands in front of her face. \"Now, help me untie Alex here so you can take her place.\" You stiffen up when you hear that. You were looking to buy time until you could think up a reason to excuse yourself from the room, not engage in a tickling session.

Your underwear joins the pile of clothes on the floor soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the women look you up and down. When you try to cover your privates with your hands Victoria moves them away.

He looks stiff as ever, but his eyes betray his amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! You don't think I can handle a new recruit? You should know - why, when you came to me you couldn't hold your sword steady! Let alone use it to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be going then.\" The guard turns and hurries away, the other soon following suit. Turning your attention back to the old man, you find a wide grin display across his somewhat rowdy features. The old man was poking fun at what was presumably one of his former pupils. You could tell you were going to like having him as an instructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings there young 'un! My name's Helix Thorne, former company commander of the thirty-first light cavalry regiment, now instructor of all new cavalry recruits. Have you got any belongings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and emphasize it by shaking the knapsack you have hanging over your shoulder. Not much, just a few clothes and sone personal items, just enough to make you feel comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should head over to the barracks and settle in a bit, find a place to put your stuff, and come on back so we can get started. On the other hand, if you want to pet that off for a bit, you can watch these trainees practice for a bit. Have to say, they're right good for recruits, and you look like an observant one. You should be able to pick up a few things by watching.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking around at the bunks for an empty one, you see plenty of personal items around. Holy symbols, card decks, musical instruments, cooking utensils, shields with noble insignias, and large tomes were just some of the things that could be seen at one bunk or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" You thought, \"Coninze really adds all types of people into their ranks.\" Finally finding an empty bunk, you plopped your knapsack down at the foot of the bed and dropped down on to the bed, which was comfier than you would have thought a soldier's bed would have been. Kicking off your boots, you figured you probably should have head over to the armory and got fitted up with the necessary armor and weapon for training, but your traveler's clothes were so comfy. Even if it was admittedly, not much protection against attacks. You were about to get up when you noticed some soldiers in commoner's clothes several rows over. There was a man with thick black hair, tanned skin and dark brown eyes, as well as a blonde woman with bright blue eyes and fair skin. They were whispering quickly to each other and occasionally glancing over at you. You close your eyes and attempt to hear what they're saying but they're too far away. You only manage to hear the girl say: \"-to join the Cult-\" but the man seems to be cutting her off anyway. Like he doesn't want to be overheard. They seem to notice that you're looking at them at that point, and with one last glance at you, they head out the door opposite the way to the armory and training field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a bit conflicted. On one hand, you really should get to the training field to start practicing. You don't want to give off the impression of having a lazy or insubordinate attitude so soon after you got here. On the other hand, this 'Cult' was curious. Coninze might have valued freedom and new ideas, but this cult seemed to be in the shadows of even here. It seemed like they'd taken at least a passing interest in you, and that was enough that you should probably investigate, but if it wasn't right now, they might slip through the cracks and you might not find them again. They were heading out the door, so you had to choose now!</span></div></div>",

You easily sneak past the camp guards, and make your way towards a large tent in middle of the Rylestian camp. As you keep getting closer, you can hear sounds of a heated conversation taking place inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is madness!\" You hear an upset male voice coming from the tent<br>\r\n\"My father provided me with full command over this army General Althor, I'd rather not have to report your insubordination to him later.\" A female voice, with a tone of authority replies to him<br>\r\n\"Ugh... With all due respect your highness, your plan is insane! Our army here doesn't have the numbers to march straight for Coninze capital! We will get surrounded from all sides and slaughtered to a man before we are halfway there! I know you are eager to impress your father, but it's not the right way!\" The man says, seemingly calming a bit after being reprimanded<br>\r\n\"Don't underestimate me, General. My plan is far more than simply marching straight for their capital. I'm going to end this war, and bring my father entire Coninze territory to prove that he was right to assign me task of leading this army.\" The female voice continued, it certainly seemed like you arrived at just the right time...<br>\r\n\"Our army here isn't prepared to besiege a capital! Take over a city or two close to the border sure, but not their capital! I've served in this army for over 15 years, it would do you well to listen to my advice Princess Kaira!\" The male general says, clearly not having trust in abilities of the female, who was actually a Rylestian Princess apparently? Seems like their military traditions extend even to children of the ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are listening, you notice a small hole in the tent, allowing you to glance inside! It's not the best possible view, as you can't see the general, but you get a quite good view of the princess... she has long red hair tied in a ponytail, and wears a rather fancy looking mix of cloth and plate armor in black and red colors of Rylestia, which gives her protection without being too heavy. She also has a sword at her side, which seems to be emitting some kind of glow... which makes you think it's probably better to avoid getting in combat with her, as that thing seems magical, maybe even some kind of family heirloom. You also notice that the princess seems in her early 20s at most, no wonder the clearly older General has his doubts about her ability to lead the army...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do listen to your advice General, I know you served my father well for years, but I have a plan, which I can't risk leaking out there for now. You have to trust me.\"The princess says<br>\r\n\"If you say so, your highness... anyway, I will excuse myself.\" The general says, and you can hear him walking away<br>\r\nFew moments later an armored middle-aged man with an impressive beard leaves the tent, the General himself no doubt.<br>\r\n\"That spoiled brat... just because military academy considered her a tactical and combat genius, doesn't make her judgement infallible!\" He mumbled to himself once the princess presumably was unable to hear him anymore, and left towards other part of the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow's your chance! It would appear the Rylestian Princess, who also commands this army, is alone in her tent. Perhaps you can try to capture her and bring her to Coninze for interrogation? Someone like that would certainly be a very good leverage in the war as well! Of course you can try to interrogate on your way as well... the Queen would definitely appreciate someone as resourceful as you, and reward you handsomely.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Judging by the sensation and length, you guess that a millipede is in the log with you. You realize that it is in fact <i>you</i> who is invading the little bug's home, but there is no time to apologize to a bug as you hear footsteps just outside the log. Your already tight body tenses, the only disturbances in the area being the soldier's walking and the millipede crawling on your left bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you force down an outburst as you feel another millipede crawl on your shin. You think back to the times when you were a young child collecting bugs (you liked getting dirty) and found your first millipede crawling through a hollow log similar to the one you're in now. You remember when you asked your professor about them, and you remember him telling you about them. \"Millipedes like living in damp places, like hollow logs,\" he had said. \"They normally nest in large numbers, sometimes in the hundreds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if waiting for you to come to that realization, you suddenly feel the sensations all over your legs and arms. It becomes very distracting, and you can't help but wiggle slightly in annoyance. Fortunately, the guard slowly begins to wander away into the trees. The coast pretty much clear, you begin to slowly pull yourself forward through the log. The process is extremely slow, and it requires you to brush some millipedes farther down your arms. The distraction is minor though, and you look ahead to see the end of the log only a couple feet away from your outstretched arms. It may take a good few minutes to get there, but you're in no particular rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel something tickling your underarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and giggle, not expecting the light tickle. It appears that one of the millipedes got into your sleeves and is now running in circles, figuring out where to go. You shudder; your 'spy suit' consists only of a loose shirt, pants, and a pair of sock-like articles to cover your feet. Apart from your undergarments, these are the only things you are wearing. Lost in thought, your mind is drawn back to the situation as another millipede finds your other hollow. You are now giggling softly, not wanting to attract a guard should there be one nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if your current predicament weren't embarrassing enough, you now feel more millipedes enter your shirt sleeves and travel farther down your body. Some of the questing bugs find your ribs, having fun crawling in-between each one. Others travel down to your tummy and sides, running in circles where they are. Some just travel between all the places, tapping their little legs over your bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you are laughing rather loudly. The tickling is by no means intense, but it is slightly torturous and distracts you from getting out of your current situation. Surprisingly, you manage to keep your laughter soft.... until one of the centipedes crawls into your navel. Then you really start laughing in earnest, as your belly button is possibly the most ticklish part of your body. You begin thrashing (at least as much as you can within the confines of the log), trying to shake loose the dozens of little critters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part is the fact that the rest of your body now seems more sensitive, as if the sensations in your navel somehow sparked a flow of ticklishness throughout your whole body. The millipedes in the hollows of your underarms, light ticklers very recently, were now causing you to squirm and shake and laugh. Your ribs supplied plenty of stimulation that caused your laughter to rise in pitch whenever a millipede ran through a valley created by your ribs and taught skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in your torrent of laughter, you fail to notice when the guard returns after hearing your ticklish reactions. Before you know what is going on you are pulled out of the log, thrown to the ground, and left unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stir, feeling a dull ache in your left temple. Trying to bring your hand down to rub it, you realize you can't. Your gaze turns upwards and you see your arms shackled high above you, pulling your body taught. You then look down to your feet, seeing them locked in a pair of stocks. After looking around, you have assessed the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in an empty room, supposedly for interrogation. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all bare, save for a door to your right and the contraptions that contain you. You yourself are stretched parallel to the ground, on some oddly designed table. You are laying on it like a bed, your feet stocked at the bottom and your arms shackled to each top corner. With the restraints you are stretched into something that closely resembles a Y. The table is like any other table, except that there is a gap that stretches from the backs of your knees to the small of your back. You blush as you realize this exposes your butt to the air, and suddenly you feel a little bit colder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to your left groans loudly, and you turn your head to see who has come to visit.

Caught off guard, you thrash angrily, but to no avail as you realize your wrists are tied to the root you just tripped over, leaving her hands free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\" she speaks to you in a quiet, husky voice. \"How many of you are out here? If you cooperate, this'll be a lot easier on you.\" As she speaks, she begins unbuttoning your jerkin, leaving you in a small sleeveless undershirt. You are alone out here, and no one will be coming to rescue you. But if you tell her that, you'll be betraying Coninze. There's also no telling what she'll do to you once she has no further use for you. Your only response is to narrow your eyes and glare at her, steeling yourself for whatever she's planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. I was hoping you'd be difficult. It's so much more fun that way. I haven't had a prisoner to interrogate in ages, and none of them have looked as good as you. And I've got you all to myself\u2026\" Her grin widens as you gulp unconsciously. She brings her hands up to your wrists, dragging her fingernails over your bare arms. Her touch is feather light, and you squirm from the gentle touch. What is she doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that a twitch I see? Would my helpless Coninze spy just a little\u2026 ticklish?\" Her fingers curl as she asks the loaded question, and your eyes widen. You try to stay still, but can only twitch again as she rakes her nails along your arms. She's tickling you for information! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nails scratch lower, now just a bit above your smooth underarms. You flinch as she toys with you, a forced grin spreading over your face, causing her to snicker. \"Heh, you'd better not start laughing on me, spy. If you make too much noise, the others will find us and you'll really be in trouble. But you don't want to tell me anything either, do you? I guess you'll just have to do your best to resist me. Not that you can\u2026\" She continues to taunt you, obviously enjoying her task, seemingly taking as long as possible to break you. You don't know whether to be thankful or not as she swirls a fingernail around the perimeter of each stretched underarm, causing you to shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a ticklish spy, can you really keep quiet if I do\u2026 this?\" she teases you, her voice eroding your resistance. She scritches two nails over the center of each underarm, causing suppressed laughter to shake your stomach. You look up to see that pretty face of hers grinning impishly at you, and wonder how much more of this you can take. With each stroke, giving in seems like a more attractive option.</span></div></div>",

She softly yelps as he falls, ending up tumbling down the small hill you raced up before, causing her to smack face first into a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see she's passed out from the concussion, and leap down towards her. You draw your dagger to finish the job, but catch sight of her pretty features again. Muttering that it would be a shame to kill her in cold blood, you sheath your dagger and muse over what to do instead with your captive. While pondering, you notice her head begin to turn, just slightly, causing you to decide that her fate could be thought of later, and restraining her should be now. You notice a long coil of rope on her person, strangely enough, but question fortune no more. You remove her metal gauntlets, just one part of an actually rather light set of armor, apart from her small breastplate, thin mail, and leather boots. It was obviously so light to increase mobility for patrol, you figure, and question it no more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon removal of her gauntlets, you bind her wrists around the tree, effectively making her helpless enough. Adding insult to injury, you cut the straps of her breastplate, removing it, and then wrap the rope around her body under her arms. Just as you finish, the woman stirs again, this time waking from her injury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww! My...HEY!\" she cries, noticing her position, then throws you a dirty glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe. It was you or me. Just be happy you aren't dead,\" you reply with a devious smirk. \"But while we're here, why don't we dance with the devil in the pale moonlight, and share some of your army's secrets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off,\" she states simply, and shuts her lips tight in defience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's how we're going to play, huh?\" you shoot back, smirk still plastered on your face. \"I think you forget who's got the upper hand here.\" The gaurd simply stared knives at you, not opening her mouth. \"Fine\" you mutter, \"Have it your way.\" Reaching over to her stomach, you lift the mail and cloth shirt up, and stroke your fingers lightly down her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the woman stifens a gasp, then sharp giggles, fighting to stay in control. \"Ohohoho, ticklish, it seems,\" you say, grinning at her. \"Last chance to talk...\" you offer, eying her coyly. She still refuses to say anything other than with her sharp eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then, have it your way.\"</span></div></div>",

You wiggle your fingers down on her exposed legs, as her uniform beneath her armor was a simply cloth undershirt and short but thin layer of a cotton skirt. The gaurd stifened her giggles once more, but to your own ears it sounded a bit tougher to control than previously. You teased under her knees, but were unsatisfied with that as well. It was then you decided to move to her lowest point, her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached over to her leather boots, and start undoing the straps, but the gaurd reacts with a sharp kick and an angry grunt. \"Ah,\" you reply, \"Hiding something?\" She just glares at you and tries to kick you again. \"Whoa now, that isn't going to do...\" you announce, and grab a third segment of your pilched coil of ropes, binding her legs together at the knees, causing her to be unable to kick anymore. \"Now, where were we?\" you say, moving back to her boots. You undo each strap on her left foot, and begin to pull it off, unhindered. As you do, you notice how soft and padded the inside of it is, and once you pry it off, you silently gasp in your head. For these padded boots contained a beautiful pair of feet, you realized. Her foot was shapely and contored, not pudgy at all, which was complimented by an elegent set of toes, each painted a light green color. And although the rest of her body was tanned, her feet were easilly her lightest feature, adding up in your mind to being she took special care of her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SOMEONE goes the extra mile here, huh?\" you say to her, to which she replies with spitting at your face. \"Ah ah ah!\" you scold, then run your fingers over her feet. The reaction is instant, and you can tell she has a hard time holding in her laughter then. \"Now onto the next one...\" you say, and remove her second boot. With the pair of feet unprotected, you instantly dive into tickling, scribbling your fingers all over her feet. The gaurd writhes in her bonds and small hushed giggle escape her lips, and an agonized look crosses her face. You had found your spot alright. </span></div></div>",

So you needed a different approache. You reach for the last coil of rope, and bind her feet together at her ankles, to limit the movements of her feet, as you noticed she was keen on moving them out of position. You further enhance her torment by pulling out your own spool of string, which you use to tie her elegent toes together, locking her firmly in place. The gaurd angrilly grunts at you for limiting her so, but says nothing more. You knew you'd have to break her first before interrogating any information, so you lifted your hands back to her slightly wrinkled from walking soles, and attack. Immeadiatly there was a difference, as the gaurd screams in laughter, finally unable to contain herself. She tries to shut back up, but after getting your foot in the door, ironic you muse, it is child's play to keep her laughing as you scribble on her pale soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehahahahoohoaaaschahuum!\" she shouts, unable to control herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but that only earns a longer sentence!\" you cry, scratching her soles faster, causing her to laugh harder.

You notice and credit the young female soldier basking in the breather. She said nothing to you though. You were getting a tad tired of this giving a smirk. She was quiet and stern. Her dark hair and green eyes were looking away at you. She was so into you... ever since the two of you bump into each other, but it was still night... And you take a while extra mile into this. You could imagine the torture she has been enduring after what... a good hour or so tickling her? Although... since she's being... stubborn, you could take this tickling to a whole extra mile and force her to. Her body was squirming lightly as you began to think it over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to do, what to do...?\" you ask out loud purposely trying to act dumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go.\" she said showing a bit of courage in her eyes. That lit of courage made you bask in her determination to endure. But how many hours will that do? You just gave her a wicked vile smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish.\" you reply taking her feet into your grip. She began to curse lightly as her face ready for the upcoming tickling. You began to mention your finger up and down her sole again, watching the desperate attempts to defend herself. The other toes curl lightly as you watch the two big toes struggle in their vain to move around. If only you had a stock and some more toe ties, you can get at her soles more viciously... But this will do. This time you weren't going all out. You were teasing her. Your fingers began to mention up and down the very medium like soles... Around 7, 8, or 9... You're guessing eight. Pffft, whatever. The restrains you place earlier was really holding her down. You could hear the trouble the tan soldier was having closing her eyes wiggling the rest of her body. This method was unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of her silky smooth skin was a sensation you could feel. The very soft feet were at your utter finger tips as they began to slowly move up and down watching them wrinkle themselves with that tie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't move?\" you tease hearing the laughter exploding from her close mouth. She won't break unless you could find her weak spot on her soles... and that would mean some good minutes. You take a leaf from the ground smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEheheahhehaeshotpshheheohaepapapa!\" she announce shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!?\" you mock smiling in a sly manner, \"Aren't you the one who's suppose to stop me... officer?\" you had to change the tactics. Information is crucial. Breaking her would be breaking a defenseless doll... You just need the right methods. You take the rather moist leaf and slide it between her toes. The sudden move made the girl jump and have one of her eyes burst open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whathehehahhehehha isithahhahahahhha ththtthahtthahhahhahtht!?\" she yelled trying to contain her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A leaf... Aw, your poor toes are ever so ticklish?\" you cooed making sure you add such a high pitch to it. The woman was struggling now. The tickling you did earlier was just a taste to this... But let's speed it up. Your fingers raked up and down the girl's feet unable to actually defend themselves nor move around as much. The girl was hollering in laughter stuttering in her pleas. You ignored it just humming merrily to tickle the very feet. You dumped the leaf to stab all your fingers into her toes. She was a banshee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't just wiggle them, you poke at them, stab the very delicate insides... You could tell her area around the toes were driving her into hysterical. The fingers were showing no mercy as they went towards the insteps next, then the arches... Towards the heels. The light and soft tickling became ravaging exploring her tied feet. They were able to move here and there but they weren't that free. You wish they would be still for you to utterly tickle her more hard. You change your tactics after she felt comfortable to it. You began to scratch at her heels showing no good mercy on her. She began to scream and wiggle hr toes in desperation- oh god! That was bad! Her scream could grab some attention... You stop shaking your head. You walked towards her hoping no one heard that. She was panting heavily now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh woman... You're just making my day...\" you comment having your hands on your hips... There's a lot of things you could do with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please...\" she sounded broken, or was she? The sudden woman was sweating madly and her eyes were tired. You could see her desperation for freedom and her slight attempts to get out of the coils. \"S-stop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or?\" you persist grabbing her face, \"You accused me so wrong... That hurts me... And also why should I let a woman like you go away? I haven't actually tortured you that badly... YET!\" Those words send shivers down her face as she just looked down trying to find a reason. It was getting late... Creatures of the night would definitely attack you or some random patrols.

You licked around her toes forcing your aggressive tongue right into the little gaps between each toe. You tease them, mock them, deliberately lick all over them.

The girl began to squirm and struggle. You place yourself firmly on top of her ankles watching her toes curl a bit even though the two big toes were tied up and really grabbing your attention. How cute... She begins to scream into the gag! You glance at her sudden grasp and motions as the one centipede was just wiggling around her heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And such sensitivity will only drag that hard spirit of yours to your doom.\" you comment, mocking her strong will. She was lying against the tree, trying to contain her laughter and harsh movements. You notice some of the other crawlers, but you wouldn't grab their attention... For now. You lower your face to sniff her feet once again. She leans towards you from her restrained position, slamming her body to your back. She begins to beg.

Peaches?\" the female soldier glance away trying to avoid any confirmation. You just gave a sly smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just test what flavor they really are.\" Her face jumps towards your back, but you just lower your face down giving her tender and fair toes a good lick. Your tongue just slide across the very top of them, feeling the toes curl up quickly. Your hands grip the very top of her feet holding them still... You didn't need to hold her toes back. Your tongue slides into her curled toes, jabbing or viciously licking at the very gap or the toes themselves. You could see the resistance fading dramatically. Her screams were wild now and her feet were definitely struggling. You felt the tugs underneath your body as she tries her best to pull her feet away from you. The feeling of her toes breaking in mere shivers were making you want to suck and torture each one of these toes personally. You couldn't help but feel a bit naughty, chewing on her two big toes. The female went into a continuous laughing pitch. Her upper body was moving around an awful lot as her eyes were shooting out tears. Her face was getting red by the second from each bite you took. The feeling of such preachy fruits were taking over your mouth. So very sweet with that tingly sensation that made you want to bite in a bit deeper... Teeth sucking into such soft flesh making sure those bite marks would stay there as your tongue continues to lick around the very fruit- oh wait... The toes, to be more precise, having her feet compared to such tasty fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch them curl up. Disliking their defense, the motion of your tongue slide underneath the insteps jabbing notoriously at the fine gap the toes couldn't actually cover. Her toes wiggle around frantically as you lunge your mouth onto the two big toes. You suck, lick, and chew on them watching the big strong female trooper break even more. Her toes were mocking you, pleading you to get them annoyed and make them squirm. Her toes wiggle around as you had the two big toes in your mouth. When they were out of cover, you lick your sly tongue at them sliding around them. You play with them, holding them in a snake like grip tasting the delicious sweetening flavor. You watch her toes struggle in what to do, taking your time to get at each and everyone one of those toes. You purposely attacked them when they were having no form in what to do. She was at your mercy even if you didn't tie her up that badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" you finally stop hearing her laughing self still. Her toes were awfully wet, dripping in your saliva. You couldn't help but tease those wet toes by clawing your ten fingers into them. You turn towards her wanting to do more though... Wanting her to fall in such a harsh tickling manner... You could care less about the rest of her body, her feet were your only attention. She was broken. You could tell by the sheer desperation and the very tired self you were staring at. You see her tears running down her cheeks and voice cracking here and there into that gag ramming against the tree and trying to undo the bonds around her arms. You laugh at her futile attempt.You didn't say anything... You just turn back towards her feet staring at the bugs roaming around. The centipede at her heel seem to take a bit of liking to the area, wrapping itself around the heel moving it's multiple legs around as it's pincers were lightly stabbing at the fine area that's the actually heel. She was hollering quite loudly. There's more of these centipedes... but also millipedes. They seem awfully harmless... You stare at the bugs nature though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe millipedes were hastily crawling through the ground. Their thousand legs were actually dashing on the soil. You didn't tickle the female yet, observing the bug... What would happen if you place these millipedes all over the female's feet? You just glance at the woman having a hard time noticing your pause. The centipedes, on the other hand, have those pincer like mouths that could send her more into a hysterical motion... Which bug to chose to help you...?</span></div></div>",

You rush through the forest carrying her. Jeez, this is going to be a pain in the ass. It was getting too late and going back with a guard who will certainly toss yourself in jail would be bad! B-A-D. You glance through the darkness and through the obstacles finding sweat drench on you. You panted rushing through the forest hoping to find something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luck is on my side today.\" you comment out loud noticing a cabin. You plan to knock and notice the empty house. You shrug and enter the building. You blink noticing the bed. You place the items and her down there as you notice a panel on the ground. You open it glancing at a secret dungeon... One that involved tickling! You just give a happy cunning smile taking the unconscious guard and placing her on the seat. It was a Renfaire like stocks. Surprisingly it had more metal prongs on the very base of the ankle holder. You couldn't help but clap your hands in a glorified wish. You took no time to chain her hands above her head glancing at the knocked out woman. She was breathing lightly. You glance at her feet curling up lightly and wiggling their toes. She was going to get a long night knocked out of her... And they wouldn't get caught. You notice the equipment around the dungeon smiling. A gag, some rope, threads, feathers.... A lot of this was going to help you this time. And she won't refuse to tell you information now! You began to place the gag around her mouth and took some threads working on tying each toe. You made sure they weren't force apart, leaving some space as they weren't cutting the circulation. You heard her giggle lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be begging when I'm done with you...\" You notice a sudden thing on the side. It was lying on the table saying some sort of drug needle. You awe in the words written across the type of drug it was. It was a dosage for non conciseness meaning they wouldn't faint. You couldn't help but deliver some int the girl's bare neck tossing it aside for later... If needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you wait. You fold your arms waiting for her to wake up. After a good two minutes, she woke up cursing. She struggled in the new bonds glaring around the place. Her face was pale and she notice your spitting image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" you comment waving at her, \"You're awake!\" She yelled at you glad that you place a gag on her. She notice the restrains you place around her upper body and the ones at her feet. She gave a look towards you but you shoved it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" you corrected, \"I will tickle you mercilessly if you didn't tell me what I wanted!\" There was a sudden shudder and movement hearing the attempt. You poke her soft and stretch feet hearing a laughter escape the ball gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, can't move?\" you coo taking your nails up and down the soles. You were moving lightly having your index fingers travel up and down. This was quite helpful. Her toes were quivering as they wish they could move. Her feet were locked in place as the soldier was breaking down quickly by the full restrains. You smile knowing you'll be spending a good time with her feet. You took the nails up and down faster watching her quenched up face shake and laugh easily. Her defenses are broken and you wouldn't want to stop now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to enjoy this...

Low on gold and supplies, you had figured the queen would be in need of some occupation. Having wandered the continent all your young life, you've picked up quite a few tricks along the way, and are able to adapt quickly to new situations. Whatever she suggests is better than begging on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever I most desire? Very well, have you any experience as an entertainer?\" the queen asks, a slight smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, my queen. At one time I served as jester for a duchy far to the west. The castle had never before been so full of laughter.\" you boast. While it was true you were a jester there, and were pretty successful, the job only lasted a month before the fickle nobles decided they'd prefer a troupe of dancing monkeys. It was a bit of a shameful firing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, I could use a good laugh\" the queen tells you, her cryptic grin widening. \"Report to my private chambers, and I shall see how talented you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, m'lady. I shall await your arrival.\" you say, and make your way through the winding castle to the queen's private quarters. You raise your eyebrows, confused. Usually, entertainers perform in the main hall for all to see. You've never done a private show before. But, having agreed to perform for the queen, you can't back out now. You continue your trek up stairs and through halls, finally arriving at her very private chamber. It seems incredibly isolated from the rest of the castle, and you honestly doubt anyone would hear you if you shouted. Quite an odd castle, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you enter the luxurious room. Glancing around, it seems a normal royal quarters with a large bed and fancy furnishings. But on one wall you see an array of feathers of all shapes and sizes. Hmm, the queen must like feathers, you think. As you look around, the door behind you opens, giving you a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, you must be the entertainment.\" you hear a feminine voice say to you. You turn around, and see young woman standing before you. She's not wearing much at all, with red silk garments covering her breasts and waist. She has long jet black hair in a braid down to the small of her back. She's obviously beautiful, with long, toned legs, a flat taut stomach, pert breasts, and dark, hooded eyes. As you take in all of her exposed, tanned skin, you notice four silk scarves tied to her wrists and ankles. You return her gaze with a quizzical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Ah, you must be wondering about the scarves. They are crucial for the entertainment we are to provide the queen tonight.\" the girl explains to you. \"This is your first performance for her, so you must prove your worth. Her majesty will arrive any moment now, and when she does, using these scarves as restraints...\"</span></div></div>",

The scarves that you agreed to put back on stretch you taunt on- a bed of some kind? You can't get a good look to see. What you can see is that this isn't the same room as yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh- and the Queen's servant from yesterday is being tickled by a young woman in her night-clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired beauty laughs and squirms to the command of the other girl's fingers. She wears the same outfit as the day before which leaves her well and truly open to the advances of the girl as she spiders her nails over her ribs. Like you, she wears the scarves at her wrists and ankles- only hers pull her arms up to the ceiling and her feet are tied to the headboard, a few feet from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl tickling her looks the same age as the two of you, early twenties, but her hair looks reminiscent of- you process the information in a heartbeat and realize brunette tickler reaching for a feather duster is non-other the princess. A full decade or more younger than her sister, the princess is well known throughout Coninze as a- 'free spirit' some would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bound girl's laughter intensifies as the feather duster swirls over her belly, dragging soft feathers in its ticklish wake. It visits her thighs before exploring her neck and then plunging into an armpit and making her squirm fruitlessly to the side that isn't being tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while the princess's eyes never leave her victim's face and she seems transfixed on every giggle and involuntary smile the girl makes. You allow your eyes to slip down her body and like what you see- an untied silk night-robe gives you full view of her underwear taunt stomach and slender figure. She kneels on her toned legs that seem to glisten in the low candlelight and for a moment you wonder what you'd give to see her in the position of the other girl. But as she coos at her tickle-toy her eyes do leave the other girl's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lock with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't stop right away- her fingers dancing up and down the girl's sides take a moment or two to come to a complete stop. But she gives you a smile that let's you know you won't be long waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" She says warmly as she turns her body to face yours. A dozen questions are flying through your mind right now- where are you? What's with the tickling theme? Do the curtains really match those drapes? But you settle for simply saying, \"Good morning.\" In response- then add, \"Your Highness.\" to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you do know who I am.\" The princess beams. \"How did you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like a few more hours wouldn't hurt. I feel a little groggy.\" The princess chuckles and lays a manicured on your chest- which you just realize now is naked. Like everything else that isn't covered by the shorts you don't remember putting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry.\" She coos and slowly drags her nails down your chest. \"I can have you awake soon enough.\" Out of the corner of your eye you notice the bound girl mouthing something towards you- \"good luck\"? Whatever it is the princess noticed it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful Alexandria.\" She giggles and wriggles the fingers of her other hand inches from her quivering belly. \"I can just as easily reach you from here as well.\"</span></div></div>",

Still, as long as you behaved, that wouldn't be so bad. You'd wander the world, and if the rumors of the sisterhood are true, you'd never notice your silent companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are too concerned with the risks. Think of the rewards. Is our Queen not beautiful? Were your eyes not lingering over her? Imagine the feel of her firm belly as it ripples with laughter beneath your fingertips. The opportunity to tease royalty to ticklish tears as the finest feathers swirl down her arm and into her most sensitive hollows. Being given the opportunity to touch those silky thighs. And being tickled drives the Queen so such levels of lust\u2026 and she obviously desires you, or she would not have picked you for this role. I'm sure you will come to love your duties, as I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit, she paints an incredibly tempting offer. Why wouldn't you do this?

There's no turning back now.\" The woman says, before laying back down on the bed. \"The Queen will be here soon. Come here now and use my scarves to restrain me.\" Not seeing a way out of this, you wander up to the woman ready to do your duty. Before you do anything yet though, she has a few more words. \"You may use the scarves to restrain me however you see fit. Just thought I should tell you.\" </span></div></div>",

Keeping her fully exposed would give you the best access to her worst spots. You move forward and draw her limbs out towards the bed posts before taking your time to securely tie the scarves to each one. There is almost no slack in her binds when you are finished. She squirms to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she comments. \"I see you know how to tie knots well. Let us hope for your sake that this is not all of your skills.\" She's barely wearing anything, and she's tied to the bed, yet she doesn't seem the least bit scared!You only wish you could be as brave as her in moments like these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean over and place both your hands on her wrist before wiggling your fingers gently along her skin, like a crawling bug. Her hips begin to shift as a smile tugs at the corners of her lips. As your hands journey along her arm towards her body, her squirming grows along with her smile until you can see her brilliant white teeth. Just as you're about to reach her underarm, you halt and pull your hands away. She slumps down with a relieved expression and exhales... and right then you bury your hands into her exposed armpit, fingers scrabbling wildly. Her back arches and a scream of laughter erupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahaaieeeeeheeaahaahahaaa!! Cheeheeateheher!\" she cries out admist laughter, her black hair whipping about while she shakes her head. You can't help but grin at her reaction while you continue to torment her silky smooth underarm. This girl's beauty was only shadowed by her ticklishness and intoxicating laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely any spot will reap a reward, so where should you concentrate your torment?</span></div></div>",

She instinctively pulled at her restraints, but they held tight, leaving her stretched out and helpless to resist the torment. You noted that her laughter gradually increased in pitch as your circling got smaller and smaller, but it was the  squeal of laughter escaped her lips when you touched upon the very bottom of her underarm, where the hollow met the top of her ribs, that let you know where her true weak point was. Grinning, you placed two fingers on either side and wiggled your fingers on that exact spot with wild abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahahahahahahaha! Nohohohohoho, nohohohohot thehehere, nohohohohohohot thehehehehehehere!\" she cried out as she laughed, shaking her head and squirming for all she was worth as your fingers exploited the discovery of the weakest point in her underarms. You quickly switched tactics, tickling that spot one one side while your other hand busied itself by drawing tiny circles in the very center of her other hollow. The effect was instantaneous, as she now found two weak points being assaulted at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept it up for a few minutes, alternating your techniques on each underarm every so often to keep her guessing, but you quickly decided that you'd best explore another target, and, looking down, you found the perfect target. Without any warning at all, you slowly crawl your fingers down her underarms and ribs, teasing each and every inch of sensitive skin the whole way. Each touch from your fingers elicits ticklish laughter from her, the pitch increasing greatly as your fingers traveled over her ribs, giving you a hint that you would keep in mind for the near future. They continued their torturous journey until you reach her sides, between her ribs and hips, where you began teasing and stroking the soft skin. Not expecting you to have gone past her ribs down to her sides, she let out a loud, ticklish squeal before she resumed laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehey! Thahahahahat wahahahahahasn't fahahahahahahahair!!!\" she yelped out through her girlish laughter, her body trying to twist from side to side in a vain attempt to evade your fingers. Grinning at that, you poked her on one side, being rewarded with a ticklish yelp as she attempted to shift away, only for her other side to run into the clutches of your other hand, which began teasing up and down the soft skin beneath her rib cage. She quickly pulls away from that hand, only to once again be met on the other side by the first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nowhere left to go, she simply slumped in her bonds and laughed. However, each time your fingers touched upon the skin just beneath her rib cage, she squealed in laughter as she arched her back, revealing her ribs for you in exquisite detail. You grin and decide to take advantage of that, moving your fingers to her bottom set of ribs. You lightly squeeze her bottom pair of ribs, making her arch her back and squeal, before you begin wriggling your fingers on just those two ribs, making her twist and laugh. You repeat the process on the next pair, and then the next. As you reach the midway point, you suddenly go back down and start from the bottom, surprising her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you continued to randomly squeeze, stroke, and tease her ribs, your gaze was focused on her flat stomach. You were also wondering if it could be just as good a target... maybe even better than her ribs, which were already plenty sensitive enough for your enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your left hand continues to run rampant over her right side and ribs, you reach out and place all five fingers of your other hand on the soft, smooth skin of her firm stomach, spread them out, and wriggled your way from the top of her stomach down until you reached her lower stomach, below her belly button. Much to your delight, she bucked as much as her limited freedom would allow her as a loud squeal escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeeeeeeheeahahahahahahaha! Aaaahahahahaha!\" she laughed and squealed as she shook her head frantically. She tugged and pulled at the scarves, but they once again held tight, leaving her helpless to endure the torment your fingers were delivering upon her stomach. You crawled your hand back up again, making her buck even harder, before you switched hands, now tormenting her left side and ribs with your right hand while your left hand began crawling up and down her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaahahahahahahahahaha! Stohohohohohohohop thahahahahahahahat, yohohohohohohohohou cheaaheheheheheteheheher! Nohohohohohohoho fahahahahahahair!!!\" she cried out through her laughter. Her more desperate squirming and pulling let you know that, indeed, her belly was a very ripe target for you, just like her ribs and sides... now you were sure that they were both great targets. The only question was... do you stay with her ribs... or do you focus on her belly...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Internally however all sorts of rude gestures and taunts are being flung at a troupe of dancing monkeys and the nobles that replaced you with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine my dear,\"'the queen replies looking to you then Alexandria, \"Now please do demonstrate you way with knots and untie the poor girl.\" You nod and have her out of her binds quickly. Still giggling she rubs feeling back into her hands. \"Alexandria my dear, please escort the newest member of the court down to her chambers as soon as you have recovered enough to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once Your Majesty,\" she nods. To her credit, Alexandria immediately swings her legs off the edge of the bed and to the doorway. You follow, performing a half bow, half curtsy to the queen before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria leads you on down a torchlit corridor that ends in a spiral staircase that you descend. And descend. And descend. If your new accommodation is all the way down here, so far five floors underground, then worrying about your stamina shall soon be a thing of the past. All the while Alexandria says nothing and you have the feeling she may be giving you the cold shoulder for what you did. You don't want her as your enemy, you think. She most likely has the Queen's ear and for all you know could already be leading you down to the dungeons for a permanent membership. You decide to begin avoidance of that fate early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about what I did to you,\" you begin. Before you can go on, the girl turns to you with a reassuring warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" she says gently, \"It's my job and I do it. The Queen tickles me, potential suitors tickle me and I my room and wages are more than I could ever have dreamed of when I was growing up. And for what it's worth,\" she adds sheepishly, \"I actually enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tickling?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. All I have to do is lie there and laugh and my family and I never go hungry again.\" Well when she puts it that way, suddenly your new job seems difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven floors down, Alexandria leads you down a dimly lit passage, illuminated by torches on the walls. Third door on the left, she stops and opens up the door to reveal a stone room bathed in the orange glow of torches. A bed of silky sheets and cushions  takes the back right corner. To the front left a pool, around twelve by twelve feet, of clear water shimmering in the torchlight, clearly for the purpose of bathing. A fireplace, desk and wardrobe also reside in the room as well as a round wooden table and two chairs. The floor, rather than being bare, is covered in expensive looking rugs and carpets. And speaking of expensive, the paintings on the walls look like they could keep a few families in bread for months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To your liking?\" Alexandria asks with a wry smile and raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than that I think,\" you nod, still taking it all in. It occurs to you that, rather than stale air, the room seems fresh to the nose and healthy to the lungs. You ask Alexandria about this who points to the shutters on the far left wall besides the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may be a long way under the castle,\" she says as she goes to open them, \"But we're still some way above the ground.\" The open shutters reveal the cliff face this side of the castle is built into and the rolling landscape below. A village here, forests there and the straight blue horizon of the sea in the distance. Well look a that a room with a view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your beautician will be along soon,\" Alexandria says, \"then I believe the Queen desires your presence in her court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautician?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"No offense intended, but you smell and look like a peasant. The beautician will... Remedy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking if she can provide you with anything she takes her leave and you explore your room in more detail. The water's warm and appears to be bubbling gently. A hot spring perhaps. The wardrobe, though it is nicely scented with spices and essences, is empty save for what you presume to be towels and a silk robe that, even on you, would end above the knees. In the bottom drawer are four scarves like those on Alexandria's limbs, most likely to be used in conjunction with the poster bed. Fresh fruit, many of which you have never seen, reside in a colorfully painted fruit bowl on the table. The apples you recognize at least. The yellow curved things and reddy-yellow ball things escape your knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder them and decide that oranges would be a fitting temporary name for the latter, the door opens and a man, either a short man or a tall dwarf enters the room. A mustache almost twice the size of him sits upon his lip and a monocle peeks out from under his bushy eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day my dear. My name is Fizwald the Thirty third and I shall be your beautician today. And tomorrow. And presumably for the rest of your time or my time here.\" Well he seems a happy soul if nothing else. You exchange pleasantries and he takes his fez off and lays a bevy carpet bag down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my dear. I hope you don't mind, but I must ask you to take off your clothes. Not required of course, but it does make my job easier. And doable.\" You oblige and strip down to your skin and you hold your arms out whilst he circles you and works on his evaluation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Well I can see this shall be easy enough. Just a wardrobe change for the most part. Body hair removal too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Body hair? All of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye my dear. Queen's regulations.\" You groan. Because this? This is going to suck. You always wondered how the nobles could bear to tear it out with sticky strips of wax in the name of beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any chance we can get it over with quickly?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that as if cosmetic magic were anything but,\" Fizwald exclaims with a chuckle as he goes for his carpet bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Why go through all that pain when you can just say a few words and poof. Hair's gone.\" he pulls out a spell book that definitely looks of Dwarfish origin and flicks in a few pages. Aha. Now then, might I ask you to stand perfectly still. If not I shall be explaining to the queen why you've been turned inside out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" He look a t you stone faced and deadly serious. Inside out?! If there's even a small cha- Oh. Oh very funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never be a poker player,\" he chuckles, \"It's not without perils of course, no magic is. But I assure you, not of life threatening, or indeed minor injury value. Now then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clears his throat, uttering an incantation. Upon completion...</span></div></div>",

Your new clothes will be down the dumb-waiter soon. In the time being farewell and good day.\" With that the hairy dwarf packs up and leaves. Clothes. Dumb-waiter. Right then. Whilst waiting for your new delivery you decide to bathe and clean the grime on your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waters touch against your skin is instantly soothing and refreshing and you sit with your head above the water, enjoying the enveloping warmth. The mud and dirt comes off easily enough dissolving into the gently bubbling water like it was never there. You've just finished washing your hair when you hear a click behind you. Turning, you see your new clothes have arrived. You dry yourself quickly and tie your hair back In a ponytail before examining your new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... At least you don't have to worry about sweating too much on those stairs. Your new outfit comes in two pieces, plus footwear. A metal string bikini consisting of a patterned copper brassiere with a curved, plunging neckline that fastened behind the neck and back with string. The bottom consists of a metal plate, front and back with red flowing loincloths of silk at the front and back down to your ankles. And to complete the expy of Carrie Fisher, whom of course you have no idea about, high-heeled high boots of leather. The intricate details carved in the metal are nice, but somehow you doubt that anyone will be looking at you for that. Two golden bracelets and an armband add to the decor of your body. It could be worse. It could be four silk scarves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill if the Queen wills it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt fits at least and quite comfortably too all things considered. You consider throwing the robe on over the top but decide against it. You'll probably be asked to take it off up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave your room and step out into the corridor.

Your hands wander over her sides, stroking at the tanned skin, softly wriggling between each rib. The touch is never enough to make her scream or loudly laugh, only gasp and quietly giggle, never too much volume to interrupt the nobles at their tables. But her soft ticklish sounds and squirming do get their attention, and you notice many sly glances your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what must seem like forever for Alexandria, the elaborate dinner ends. Maids bustle to and fro collecting the plates, as the nobles stand and mill about the room, quietly discussing politics or court intrigue. It's all over your head, anyway. A maid approaches the two of you to let you know that you've been given a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may stop tickling Alexandria for now, newcomer. The Queen wishes to convey her satisfaction at your first performance.\" The maid tells you, as you bring your hands down from Alexandria's alluring body. She slumps against you, relaxing in her bonds, her arms still high above her head, her bare back pressing against your chest. The maid glances at Alexandria and grins, an expression that seems partially of impish enjoyment at her predicament, and partial empathy at what it must feel like to be in such a position. You take a moment to examine the maid: a brunette, on the short side with a petite figure, were she a peasant girl she'd definitely catch the eyes of the villagers at a dance. The maid's uniform consists of long, loose black pants tied with a band of cloth at the waist. The top garment is a sleeveless black shirt that fully covers her chest, however stops at her lowest ribs, leaving the entirety of her midriff bare. You find yourself eyeing her smooth, pale stomach and the long indentation of her navel, and wonder if the maids also get tickled here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid notices your glance and you see her flinch nervously. With your performance today, you might be getting a reputation as an expert tickler. She might imagine that you're thinking of targeting and tickling her\u2026 which actually wouldn't be wrong, you realize. The maid bows and scurries off to another task, leaving you alone with Alexandria in the room full of debutantes and various nobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious about Rosa?\" Alexandria asks you, a grin on her face. You can't tell if its stuck there from all the gentle tickling earlier, or from her question. \"I could arrange to have her meet you in your quarters later, if you like. A privilege of being in the Queen's personal service. But you can't be too rough on the maids. Unlike us, tickling isn't their primary job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a ticklish maid visit you tonight in your bedroom? Maybe even bringing along a feather duster to \"clean\" your room? It is a terribly attractive thought...</span></div></div>",

You decide to change the subject. \"What's going on here? Does the Queen usually entertain nobles like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria shakes her head. \"No. This is a royal welcome for influential nobility. It is important for the Queen to keep good relations with the neighboring minor nations, else we might be surrounded  by enemies like the Rylestians.\" She gestures with her head, pointing out a young woman standing across the room. She's a tall woman of around 25, which would make very young for a ruler. She has naturally tanned skin the color of milk chocolate, and long black hair up in an elaborate style revealing the nape of her neck. Her dark almond eyes glance carefully around the party. She's wearing a tight white dress revealing a very attractive figure- the curve of her hips, her tight tummy, and firm breasts that would be evident even without the plunging neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the Duchess Adelle of Uzien.\" Alexandria continues. \"She's made quite a reputation for herself despite her young age. Our kingdoms are allied, but the relationship is somewhat tenuous. She's probably the most important visitor here tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If all of this diplomatic stuff is so important, aren't we being distracting?\" You ask her, confused. You can't imagine its easy to focus with you tickling Alexandria like you have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very. That's the whole point.\" Alexandria continues quietly, outside the hearing of the guests. \"A distracted duchess or ambassador is easier to get concessions out of. And Lady Adelle has been <i>very </i>distracted tonight. Especially\u2026\" Alexandria whispers in your ear, and you nod in agreement. Obeying the suggestion, you put your index fingers just inside each of Alexandria's hips, and begin to stroke up and down that spot very softly. The touch makes her arch her back and gasp loudly, followed by stifled giggles, Alexandria's smooth belly quivering with held in ticklish laughter. As you continue to stroke that sensitive spot, you notice Adelle's eyes watching your tickling like a hawk, glued to the spot. You notice one of her hands moving as if to cover her own hips protectively, and if you didn't know better you would say you can almost see her belly flinching in a sympathetic ticklish feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe\u2026 oh, ok stop. St-ahahap!\" Alexandria tells you, quietly but firmly. You oblige, reluctantly ending the gentle but very effective teasing strokes. \"Rumor has it that's an excellent way to get Adelle's attention. But I've never had the pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how do you know where she's ticklish? That she's ticklish at all?\" You ask, wondering if some kind of ticklish bacchanal happens after all the negotiations are concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spies. Court intrigue. Coninze is a very deceptive place, and eventually everyone knows everything about everyone. Besides, the Uzien royal family has been terribly ticklish for generations. It's a poorly kept secret.\" Alexandria tells you, divulging secrets to you as if they were common knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" you say, dumbfounded. You find yourself glancing at Adelle again, wondering what it would be like to tickle her. To find out if Alexandria was right\u2026 but you look away to avoid meeting the duchess's gaze as she keeps glancing back at you, seemingly quite distracted now. \"So, our job is to distract the guests, while the Queen can focus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's the rub.\" Alexandria tells you, sighing. \"It's distracting to everyone, including the Queen. She's just betting on being less distracted than the others. Although\u2026\" A mischievous look comes over Alexandria's face as she whispers another suggestion to you. This time, you find yourself slowly dragging your fingers down her stretched out arms, starting at her elbow. As your fingertips graze along her inner arms, Alexandria squirms from the increasingly ticklish touches. Down the quivering arm you go, and then teasingly circling the outside of her underarms, carefully avoiding the sensitive spot so close by\u2026 you look up, and notice that you now have the Queen's full attention, as Alexandria gasps and snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph! Ok stop-stop-don't go in!\" She tells you hurriedly, and again you reluctantly obey. \"Whew\u2026 that's a spot that'll get the Queen's attention, but we only gave a taste. Although that might actually tease her even more\u2026 oh well. She can always 'punish' us later, right?\" Your eyes widen at the easy suggestion. You weren't trying to get yourself 'punished!' You were eventually going to tickle the Queen, but maybe your first encounter might be the other way around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't think about that too long, as someone walks up to you:</span></div></div>",

Apparently the Queen really was paying attention to those specific little tickles Alexandria was teaching you earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty, that was entirely my fault!\" Alexandria tells her. \"I got carried away in the excitement today, and encouraged the Tickler to do something she shouldn't. She did not know you had forbidden that specific tickling technique to be publically shown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe the Royal Tickler can make her own decisions.\" The Queen tells Alexandria, as well as you. \"But I'll keep those words in mind. Alexandria, you're to report to my chambers tonight. I'll have to instruct you exactly on which techniques to display during these little soirees.\" Alexandria twitches against you again, realizing that she's in for a fairly ticklish night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you command, my Queen.

You knock and you hear a muffled voice say \"Enter,\" in reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon opening the door, you observe the room. Whilst the Queen had only one wall dedicated to feathers in her room, this room had feathers of all shapes and sizes adorning every wall. It was then that you spotted the Princess. She was eerily similar to the Queen, probably looking how the Queen did a decade ago. With her brunette hair, she also wore a silk nightgown, which as she stood up from her desk chair and turned towards you, you realised was untied. This gave a full glimpse of her pale, slender figure, covered only by tight underwear that covered her breasts and loins. Apart from that, you took in her petite feet and flat belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the new Royal Tickler,\" the Princess said as she eyed you up and down. \"Yes, Princess,\" you say, bowing your head as you do so. \"Oh we'll have none of that boring formality here. Away from the Royal Court, you shall always call me Victoria.\" \"Yes Pr-Victoria.\" She giggles and beckon you to come towards her. She bites her lip as you do. \"My sister told me she had hired a beautiful young girl to serve as Royal Tickler. I am happy to see that she wasn't exaggerating.\" She took your hand and led you to the bed, which clearly looked as if someone had just been tickled atop it, judging by the state of it. <br>\r\nShe turned to you and said with a cute, glowing smile \"I'm very much looking forward to... </span></div></div>",

But for now, you retired to your room for a few moments of rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned to your chambers, you found a beautiful, light pink silk robe laying across the bed. It seemed a lot more comfortable then the lingerie you were wearing now. You quickly slipped it on and undid your hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick rest, you went directly to the Queen's room. You came to the ornate double doors and knocked. From there, you heard a muffled 'come in' from the other side. You slowly stepped inside, finding the Queen sitting comfortably in a red velvet chair, while Alexandra was bound by her wrists and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, my dear,\" the Queen said, \"And shed your robe,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as she asked, inhaling sharply at the cold air that met your body. You noticed how Alexandria couldn't take her eyes off you, nor you her. She's beautiful, so fair, so sexy, so very ticklish. You suddenly hear a rattle, and to your surprise, the Queen has pulled out a set of iron cuffs, lined comfortably in red velvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn to have your backside face me,\" she ordered. You did as you were told. She took her hands and clipped them into the cuffs, then he waved you to the bound Alexandria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have quite a way of entertaining, so entertain me,\" she said, \"Tickle her,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at the bound girl on the bed, then shifted in your cuffs, \"But, your majesty, my hands are bound,\" you said. She shrugged back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get creative,\" she replied. With a sigh, you turn to Alexandria and crawl onto the bed. She's sitting before you, legs stretched out before you with her wrists sitting idly in her lap. She gives you a reassuring smile and nods. You took a minute to think, planning out your attack. The Queen wanted you to be creative, so you got creative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned forward and started planting kisses on her neck. They weren't tickly, and Alexandria started to sigh with content. That was until you started nuzzling her soft, smooth skin, and she started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha!\" music to your ears. You continued to nuzzle and tickle her, while the Queen sat back in her seat, watching with great amusement. Your lips traveled down Alexandria's neck and towards her breasts. Your hair, loose and hanging, dragged across her titflesh. Alexandria giggles happily, starting to lean back to give you more access. You growl hungrily and push her down onto the bed, nibbling the sides of her breasts and kissing her perky nips. By now, the raven-haired beauty was giggling with mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha! HA!\" she shrieks suddenly when you start to nibble her ribs. She falls flat on her back, and you straddle her thighs, giving you immense space to tickle.</span></div></div>",

To your surprise, it\u2019s the Duchess Adelle, pulling herself away from the circle of nobles she had been conversing with. You try to make yourself more presentable to a noblewoman, although you realize there isn't much to be done. Your clothing is completely revealing, and its not like you can change. And you're station is to sit here behind a similarly clad girl to slowly tickle her for the entertainment of others. At the least, you sit up a little straighter and bring your hands down from Alexandria's arms, putting them at your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the Queen's newest addition.\" Adelle exclaims as she stands in front of the two of you. \"The Queen has been making such bold claims about your\u2026 abilities.\" Standing this close, you get a chance to examine her more closely. The duchess is quite beautiful, her tanned skin looks smooth and soft, likely cared for with expensive oils and perfumes. Indeed, you can smell a faint floral scent in the air, subtle but distractingly pleasant. Her white dress is almost scandalously tight, made up of some kind of thin silk. You can perfectly make out the curves and outlines of her body, even noticing the indentation of her navel, a thin and almost imperceptible valley in the garment hugging her toned abdomen. You reluctantly tear your eyes away from her figure back to her face, to find a knowing look in her eyes. Did she notice your glances?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt the Queen's words do her justice.\" Alexandria replies to Adelle, seeming much more comfortable conversing with nobility. \"I've never been tickled <i>so</i> skillfully by someone in such a short time. She has a natural command of the human body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Adelle replies, looking at you appraisingly. \"While Alexandria is an expert in such matters, I find myself skeptical such a prodigy can live up these claims.\" While the Duchess speaks, you notice Alexandria back into you slightly, unnoticed by Adelle. Her butt wiggles into you suggestively, as if she were trying to get you to do something. In response, you bring your hands up to grasp Alexandria's sides, not tickling, but holding her there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has an expert touch.\" Alexandria continues to boast. \"Able to overwhelm any woman. If you are so doubtful, perhaps you could discover this for yourself?\" Alexandria's suggestion takes you by surprise, although you're glad she's doing most of the talking. Would you actually be asked to tickle the Duchess? You have to admit, the possibility of touching and tickling that body of hers would be almost impossible to refuse. Alexandria wiggles her behind against you again, in a non-verbal command. You get an idea of what she wants, but you don't want to prevent Alexandria from talking by tickling her into fits of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to massage her midriff, softly rubbing your palms over the smooth skin of her stomach and sides. As you do, you hear Alexandria sigh contentedly, and you continue to rub her skin, easing the ticklish tension out of her body that you had been building up all day. You notice Adelle's gaze drifting down to your hands, watching your movements carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 see.\" Adelle says slowly, her eyes still lowered. \"Perhaps a <i>private</i> demonstration could be intriguing.\" You can't help but grin as you realize what the two of them are suggesting for you. Getting a little bolder, your massaging hands move down to Alexandria's waist and hips, rubbing there in a manner careful not to be ticklish. A stifled moan emits from the girl's throat, and you can't tell if she's acting in order to influence the Duchess, or is actually enjoying it that much. Either way, you continue, to the delight of both other women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdelle, clearly wanting to pay more attention to what you're doing to Alexandria than converse, reluctantly pulls her eyes up to yours. \"Ah\u2026 yes. Come to my quarters tonight, newcomer. The largest in the guest wing, I'm sure you'll find the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breath catches as you stare into those dark, commanding eyes. It's an irresistible opportunity. At least, if it's what you think it is. It seems like you can never really tell what anyone's saying around here until it happens. Then again, you were hired on as the Queen's personal tickler. Would it be alright to go to the Duchess's quarters? Even before the Queen got to be tickled by you even once? You don't really get all this court intrigue, but that might be a scandal. But maybe a worthwhile one. You open your mouth to give your reply to the awaiting Duchess.</span></div></div>",

She won't want to get rid of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose that makes you feel better. Not the part about a few days in the dungeon- but at least you won't find yourself back on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria leans back against you, her back against your chest and you cross your hands over her hips. \"So this might sound a little personal but since you've spent all day tickling me- are you ticklish at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a question that makes you freeze. Alexandria grins a little like she knows you're hiding something. \"Sensitive subject?\" She asks- pun fully intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" You reply with a tone of mock offense. \"I'm the royal tickler remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She grins slyly. \"So if I did this?\" Alexandria shifts her head to look the other way- and brings her long hair draping across your front with it. An unexpected shriek escapes your lips and you hope the nobles that turned their heads thought it was Alexandria or that you were sharing a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all?\" She asks coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Break time's over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worth ihihihihihit!\" She squeals as you dig into her ribs. You spend a few minutes to convince her she doesn't want to do it again before easing back again. You still tease one side of her body at a time with the end of her long ponytail dusting from her hips to her armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you that idea.\" She snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm giving you full credit for it.\" You tell her as you look into the crowd of nobles. You pick out Adelle again, conversing with a nobleman in foreign grabs from the east but with her eyes frequently coming back to you. You really must have had an effect on her.</span></div></div>",

You once again marvel at the luxurious quarters you've been given as Royal Tickler. The large bed covered in fine silks and soft pillows, the bath that was big enough to be a small pond with warm water pleasantly gurgling from a fountain, the expensive rugs on the floor. You seem to have hit the jackpot. Although now that you think about it, you haven't had a chance to get dinner tonight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you stomach groans at the thought, you hear a knock at the door. You turn to see Rosa, the petite pretty maid from earlier, bringing in a tray of food. \"I was told you would be hungry after the evening of performance for Her Majesty.\" Rosa tells you softly as she sets the tray down on the table. The meal looks delicious: roasted duck glazed in a red wine sauce, along with some kind of foreign vegetable you don't recognize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Rosa looks tempting as well. You turn to ogle her slim body, the flat and exposed stomach that shivers under your gaze. Any maid could have been sent to give you your dinner, you suspect Alexandria had a hand in sending over the one that had caught your eye earlier. Rosa stands patiently, awaiting a potential command nervously. While it would be tempting to tickle her for a while, you ARE hungry, and you were going to see Adelle. You bow to Rosa and give her permission to leave, which she does with a smile of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being sated by the tasty meal, you head through the castle towards the guest wing. You move as silently and nonchalantly as you can, trying not to attract notice from guards or guests. You'd rather this little rendezvous not get back to the Queen. Going unnoticed proves impossible, as passers by gaze over your exposed, hairless skin, the way your skimpy garments accentuate your feminine attributes. Still, none of them seem to pay attention to where you're going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you arrive in from of large double doors to the biggest room in the guest wing, given only to people of importance. Clearly, these negotiations Duchess Adelle is here for are important to the queen. The doors are guarded by Adelle's Uzien guards: two women who could pass for identical twins. Each has long, silky black hair and dark eyes, Uzien features that remind you of Adelle. They both wear tight leather armor, which hugs their athletic bodies, and as you look at them you wonder if they're also ticklish underneath that protective clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get the chance to ask, as they wordlessly open the double doors, and beckon you to enter. They follow behind you into the guest quarters, which looks to consist of multiple rooms. They lead you to the bedroom, where you find the Duchess Adelle sitting at the foot of the bed. She isn't wearing her expensive and revealing dress anymore. Now all you can see on her is a soft looking bathrobe, which covers almost all of her body. Her dark, milk chocolate skin has a slight flush to it, and it looks as though she had just gotten out of the bath. You can only imagine if she used some kind of oil or balm while there to make her skin more sensitive, or find another's touch more enjoyable. You had heard of such things coming from the southern lands, but such things were always luxuries far out of your reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duchess Adelle smiles warmly at you, looking you up and down with her dark, almond eyes.</span></div></div>",

You feel a pit of excitement building within you, but you try to keep your cool in front of the Duchess.  \"Do you wish anything of me before we begin?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take control. And my safe word is Champagne. If your friend earlier was telling the truth, I expect to be using it a lot,\" she says, a little loudly so that you could hear her while facing away, looking at the contents of the chest. You smile.

These tentacles, which appear to replace her lower body, are probably the reason she's in this dark dungeon in the first place. When you make no move towards her, she begins advancing on you, somehow gliding on her tentacles while leaving her clothing perfectly smooth. As you turn to run, you notice she leaves a trail of slimy liquid behind her as she moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\", you trip on a loose stone on the dungeon floor in your haste to escape, losing your leather boots in the process. A gash begins to bleed on your knee from where it has just hit the ground, and you clutch the wound helplessly as the tentacled woman slithers up to you. Before you can crawl away one thick purple tentacle reaches from the folds of her dress and wraps around your leg where the cut is. Instead of suction cups there are hundreds of soft, hair-like tendrils lining the whole underside of the tentacle. A sticky slime is secreted from behind them, and you watch as when the stuff touches your wound it heal completely, leaving only a faint mark where the scratch was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This slime is verrrry useful. I can keep prey alive and kicking for a long, long time while tickling out their energies.\" she says to you in that annoying high-class accent. Your leg healed, you pull hard on the tentacle, and cause it to slip off your knee. You quickly get to your feet and begin to run, but before you get more than a few steps two wrap around your waist and pull you towards her, the tiny hairlike tenticklers in their undersides tickling your belly and preventing you from wriggling very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pull you tight against her body, nestling your head in between her sizeable breasts, which due to her corset are almost popping out. She grabs your wrists with her hands and then wraps a tentacle around both of them high above your head. Once restrained two tentacles remove the metal bikini and clothing, leaving you immobile, naked, and pressed up against another woman's body. A furious blush creeps up your cheeks when she asks, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now. How shooould I tickle you? Perhaps on the privates? Or maybe we could play a fun game together.

Any other jewelry might not have been a problem but they were of a hinged design and someone needed to release the catches. And neither of these two would be willing you're sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears that you are in quite the predicament,\" the dragon rumbles in a deep, but surprisingly quiet voice. It's head comes just level with your shoulders and has to look up to make eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. I'm not meant to be in here. The Queen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I do not doubt it,\" the dragon nods, \"There is just the minor issue that visitors are rare. Neither I nor Kareena have the capability to leave. And so you are, for the time being, stuck with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But people do come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true.

How lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then however my dear, you are quite stuck with us.\" Behind Fenrir, a relieved looking Kareena flashes you an evil grin, obviously delighted to not be on the receiving end. Before you can shoot her a dirty look a wet forked tongue slides over your ribs and you lose completely all sense of composure. You squirm and wriggle, but the tongue continues unimpeded- soft, gentle, unceasing. Up and down, agonizingly slowly working up toward your breasts, and then down again,  to the plate and silken loincloth over your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" you beg as the two ends of the tongue split further and run frictionlessly up and down your sides. \"Nohohohohohooo!\" is all you can coherently manage. Your armpits, thighs and neck all get it equally good.

Her right hand snakes around the back of your waist and rests on your side whilst a single index finger of her left traces up and down your chest, making you squirm slightly at itself light touch. \"And you were a bit merciless earlier on. Fair's fair, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nails stroke a ticklish path across your back and you arc your body forward to evade the touch. \"You look so cute and adorable held up like this,\" Alexandria giggles, \"And so pretty.\" She extended her arm and danced her fingers playfully around your belly bringing more snickering and wriggling. \"Ticklish tummy?\" she asks you sweetly as you feel her place her nails on her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you plead. She smiles but before you can say anything else, you burst into hysterical laughter as all ten nails suddenly rippled across your belly button to her sides, then back again. Screaming, you thrash and arch your back to escape, but there was no avoiding her ticklish advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have convince Queen Catherine to let me tickle you instead,\" she titters as nails migrate to your underarms, \"I swear I'm not this ticklish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eases off and gently trails her fingers along the contours of your ribs. In the corner Fenrir lifts his head and yawns, his jaws opening wide to reveal rows of sharp teeth and forked tongue. \"Good evening fair maiden,\" he rumbles in greetings to Alexandria, \"How does this night find you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a break from the usual role,\" she grins and she skitters over your midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see,\" he chuckles, \"As I understand it, this one was meant to tickle you. What an interesting turn of events.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so. Enjoying life Kareena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl narrows her eyes at Alexandria's sly comment. \"I've got one more week in here,\" she says, \"And as soon as I'm out of here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll tickle the life out of me, right. But not if the Royal Tickler gets you first!\" She runs her nails up one side, causing your body to flinch to the other. Then the other, then back again. \"Our new tickler who lives in a glass house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're starting to wonder if your role was entirely on dishing out the dirt. Because so far there's plenty of evidence to the contrary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenrir is up on his feet now and lumbering over to the two of you. Alexandria looks nervously over her shoulder at him before an idea flashes through her head. \"I don't suppose you'd be willing to switch up the usual schedule would you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon pauses and looks at you with a mischievous glint for a moment.</span></div></div>",

And in penance for the delay, I will be particularly <i>thorough</i> when I sensitive you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you notice Alexandria shiver at the thought, but she quickly regains her composure. \"It's worth the opportunity. I accept, thank you.\" Alexandria bows towards the dragon, before asking \"But what will you be doing instead tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon turns back towards Kareena, the blonde woman wearing little more than rags on the floor. \"I will continue to entertain myself with this one. I will leave you to your companion, maiden.\" With that the dragon turns his attention on Kareena, swinging his tail around to brush its feathery tip over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Wait no I don't-ohohoahahahaha!\" Kareena tries to protest, but after a few moments breaks into girlish laughter. The dragon takes on an intense expression as he brushes the large tail over her, dusting her with it and playing with her as if he were a cat with a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alexandria has turned her attention back to you, her lithe and nude form walking towards you, her hips swaying sultrily with an impish smile on her face. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in here?\" you ask her, trying to distract her from the thought of tickling you, even if for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Queen managed to obtain a tickle dragon.\" Alexandria tells you, bringing her nails up to the bracelets at your wrists and dragging them down once again over your arms, more slowly and bearably this time. \"He feeds on ticklish laughter, and his tongue has the wonderful property of making any skin it licks becomes more sensitive. If done repeatedly, eventually the skin enjoys and craves the tickling, but without regular sessions, it wears off over time.\" Alexandria tells you, the whole time her nails are zigzagging a ticklish path down your arms, now drawing circles just outside your underarms. The sensation is teasy but just bearable enough not to laugh, provided you focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, did he already get to you before I got here?\" Alexandria asks mischievously. Your eyes widen and you shake your head, but Alexandria just grins. \"He did, didn't he? No wonder you're so ticklish.\" Her hands are so close to your underarms, but then she doesn't dig in like you expect. Instead, her fingers worm their way underneath your copper brassiere and softly stroke against the sides of your breasts. A wide silly grin spreads across your face, as your stomach quivers with held in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it doesn't help that Kareena is on the other side of the room, laughing hysterically. Now the dragon was slowly brushing his tail across her feet, while his tongue was lapping at her midriff. All the while, Kareena laid there in paroxysms of laughter. It would be a lot of fun to watch, but with Alexandria tickling you, Kareena's sounds are feeling more and more contagious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel Alexandria's fingertips dragging themselves over your sensitized tummy, which shakes from the touch. It tickles so much! And Alexandria's playful expression isn't helping you keep your composure. \"C'mon, I know it tickles. And I know you're ticklish\u2026 right\u2026 here~\" She teases you, as a nail twirls around the rim of your bellybutton, tickling more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're going to burst at any moment, although you have to admit Alexandria's playful tickling isn't actually that bad. Should you just sit back and let her do her worst until you can get out of here, or try to learn more about this place, like who Kareena is and what she's doing in here?</span></div></div>",

Internally however all sorts of rude gestures and taunts are being flung at a troupe of dancing monkeys and the nobles that replaced you with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine my dear,\"'the queen replies looking to you then Alexandria, \"Now please do demonstrate you way with knots and untie the poor girl.\" You nod and have her out of her binds quickly. Still giggling she rubs feeling back into her hands. \"Alexandria my dear, please escort the newest member of the court down to her chambers as soon as you have recovered enough to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once Your Majesty,\" she nods. To her credit, Alexandria immediately swings her legs off the edge of the bed and to the doorway. You follow, performing a half bow, half curtsy to the queen before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria leads you on down a torchlit corridor that ends in a spiral staircase that you descend. And descend. And descend. If your new accommodation is all the way down here, so far five floors underground, then worrying about your stamina shall soon be a thing of the past. All the while Alexandria says nothing and you have the feeling she may be giving you the cold shoulder for what you did. You don't want her as your enemy, you think. She most likely has the Queen's ear and for all you know could already be leading you down to the dungeons for a permanent membership. You decide to begin avoidance of that fate early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about what I did to you,\" you begin. Before you can go on, the girl turns to you with a reassuring warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" she says gently, \"It's my job and I do it. The Queen tickles me, potential suitors tickle me and I my room and wages are more than I could ever have dreamed of when I was growing up. And for what it's worth,\" she adds sheepishly, \"I actually enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tickling?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. All I have to do is lie there and laugh and my family and I never go hungry again.\" Well when she puts it that way, suddenly your new job seems difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven floors down, Alexandria leads you down a dimly lit passage, illuminated by torches on the walls. Third door on the left, she stops and opens up the door to reveal a stone room bathed in the orange glow of torches. A bed of silky sheets and cushions takes the back right corner. To the front left a pool, around twelve by twelve feet, of clear water shimmering in the torchlight, clearly for the purpose of bathing. A fireplace, desk and wardrobe also reside in the room as well as a round wooden table and two chairs. The floor, rather than being bare, is covered in expensive looking rugs and carpets. And speaking of expensive, the paintings on the walls look like they could keep a few families in bread for months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To your liking?\" Alexandria asks with a wry smile and raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than that I think,\" you nod, still taking it all in. It occurs to you that, rather than stale air, the room seems fresh to the nose and healthy to the lungs. You ask Alexandria about this who points to the shutters on the far left wall besides the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may be a long way under the castle,\" she says as she goes to open them, \"But we're still some way above the ground.\" The open shutters reveal the cliff face this side of the castle is built into and the rolling landscape below. A village here, forests there and the straight blue horizon of the sea in the distance. Well look a that a room with a view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your beautician will be along soon,\" Alexandria says, \"then I believe the Queen desires your presence in her court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautician?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"No offense intended, but you smell and look like a peasant. The beautician will... Remedy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking if she can provide you with anything she takes her leave and you explore your room in more detail. The water's warm and appears to be bubbling gently. A hot spring perhaps. The wardrobe, though it is nicely scented with spices and essences, is empty save for what you presume to be towels and a silk robe that, even on you, would end above the knees. In the bottom drawer are four scarves like those on Alexandria's limbs, most likely to be used in conjunction with the poster bed. Fresh fruit, many of which you have never seen, reside in a colorfully painted fruit bowl on the table. The apples you recognize at least. The yellow curved things and reddy-yellow ball things escape your knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder them and decide that oranges would be a fitting temporary name for the latter, the door opens and a man, either a short man or a tall dwarf enters the room. A mustache almost twice the size of him sits upon his lip and a monocle peeks out from under his bushy eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, sir. My name is Fizwald the Thirty third and I shall be your beautician today. And tomorrow. And presumably for the rest of your time or my time here.\" Well he seems a happy soul if nothing else. You exchange pleasantries and he takes his fez off and lays a bevy carpet bag down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, sir. I hope you don't mind, but I must ask you to take off your clothes. Not required of course, but it does make my job easier. And doable.\" You oblige and strip down to your skin and you hold your arms out whilst he circles you and works on his evaluation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Well I can see this shall be easy enough. Just a wardrobe change for the most part. Body hair removal too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Body hair? All of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, sir. Just all this, uh, mess,\" he motions to your long hair and beard, \"Queen's regulations.\" You groan. Because this? This is going to suck. You always wondered how the nobles could bear to tear it out with sticky strips of wax in the name of beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any chance we can get it over with quickly?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that as if cosmetic magic were anything but,\" Fizwald exclaims with a chuckle as he goes for his carpet bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Why go through all that pain when you can just say a few words and poof. Hair's gone.\" he pulls out a spell book that definitely looks of Dwarfish origin and flicks in a few pages. \"Aha. Now then, might I ask you to stand perfectly still. If not I shall be explaining to the queen why you've been turned inside out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" He look a t you stone faced and deadly serious. Inside out?! If there's even a small cha- Oh. Oh very funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never be a poker player,\" he chuckles, \"It's not without perils of course, no magic is. But I assure you, not of life threatening, or indeed minor injury value. Now then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clears his throat, uttering an incantation. Upon completion...</span></div></div>",

Your new clothes will be down the dumb-waiter soon. In the time being farewell and good day.\" With that the hairy dwarf packs up and leaves. Clothes. Dumb-waiter. Right then. Whilst waiting for your new delivery you decide to bathe and clean the grime on your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waters touch against your skin is instantly soothing and refreshing and you sit with your head above the water, enjoying the enveloping warmth. The mud and dirt comes off easily enough dissolving into the gently bubbling water like it was never there. You've just finished washing your hair when you hear a click behind you. Turning, you see your new clothes have arrived. You dry yourself quickly and tie your hair back In a ponytail before examining your new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... At least you don't have to worry about sweating too much on those stairs. Your new outfit comes in two pieces, plus footwear. Dark trousers with draw strings, and a black puffy shirt with embroidery on it. On top of that are these slippers with pointed tips, almost like dwarf shoes. It could be worse. It could be four silk scarves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill if the Queen wills it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt fits at least and quite comfortably too all things considered.

In fact once you arrive most of the officials are gone. You pass a maid carrying a drinks tray who barely bats an eyelid and make your way to Queen Cartherine's throne. Apparently it's lunchtime because tables have been set up and food laid out for the Queen's entourage. Relaxing music is played by a few flutists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good,\" she says as you bow, feeling a curtsy in this outfit would be hard to pull off, \"I see Fizwald did his job well.

Now please do show us what you can do. Take a seat behind Alexandria.\" The other girl sits on a velvet love seat, wearing very little to cover themselves. Her arms are bound above her and she smirks at you as you sit down behind her. Right behind her, your legs either side of her body. \"Be gentle with her dear.

This must be the equivalent of jesters around here, you think as the queen nods in approval. It's certainly much more amusing for you. Okay, people are staring but Alexandria's half-naked body is in front of your half-naked body.

Your hands wander over her sides, stroking at the tanned skin, softly wriggling between each rib. The touch is never enough to make her scream or loudly laugh, only gasp and quietly giggle, never too much volume to interrupt the nobles at their tables. But her soft ticklish sounds and squirming do get their attention, and you notice many sly glances your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what must seem like forever for Alexandria, the elaborate dinner ends. Maids bustle to and fro collecting the plates, as the nobles stand and mill about the room, quietly discussing politics or court intrigue. It's all over your head, anyway. A maid approaches the two of you to let you know that you've been given a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may stop tickling Alexandria for now, newcomer. The Queen wishes to convey her satisfaction at your first performance.\" The maid tells you, as you bring your hands down from Alexandria's alluring body. She slumps against you, relaxing in her bonds, her arms still high above her head, her bare back pressing against your chest. The maid glances at Alexandria and grins, an expression that seems partially of impish enjoyment at her predicament, and partial empathy at what it must feel like to be in such a position. You take a moment to examine the maid: a brunette, on the short side with a petite figure, were she a peasant girl she'd definitely catch the eyes of the villagers at a dance. The maid's uniform consists of long, loose black pants tied with a band of cloth at the waist. The top garment is a sleeveless black shirt that fully covers her chest, however stops at her lowest ribs, leaving the entirety of her midriff bare. You find yourself eyeing her smooth, pale stomach and the long indentation of her navel, and wonder if the maids also get tickled here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid notices your glance and you see her flinch nervously. With your performance today, you might be getting a reputation as an expert tickler. She might imagine that you're thinking of targeting and tickling her\u2026 which actually wouldn't be wrong, you realize. The maid bows and scurries off to another task, leaving you alone with Alexandria in the room full of debutantes and various nobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious about Rosa?\" Alexandria asks you, a grin on her face. You can't tell if its stuck there from all the gentle tickling earlier, or from her question. \"I could arrange to have her meet you in your quarters later, if you like. A privilege of being in the Queen's personal service. But you can't be too rough on the maids. Unlike us, tickling isn't their primary job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a ticklish maid visit you tonight in your bedroom? Maybe even bringing along a feather duster to \"clean\" your room?

You decide to change the subject. \"What's going on here? Does the Queen usually entertain nobles like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria shakes her head. \"No. This is a royal welcome for influential nobility. It is important for the Queen to keep good relations with the neighboring minor nations, else we might be surrounded by enemies like the Rylestians.\" She gestures with her head, pointing out a young woman standing across the room. She's a tall woman of around 25, which would make very young for a ruler. She has naturally tanned skin the color of milk chocolate, and long black hair up in an elaborate style revealing the nape of her neck. Her dark almond eyes glance carefully around the party. She's wearing a tight white dress revealing a very attractive figure- the curve of her hips, her tight tummy, and firm breasts that would be evident even without the plunging neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the Duchess Adelle of Uzien.\" Alexandria continues. \"She's made quite a reputation for herself despite her young age. Our kingdoms are allied, but the relationship is somewhat tenuous. She's probably the most important visitor here tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If all of this diplomatic stuff is so important, aren't we being distracting?\" You ask her, confused. You can't imagine its easy to focus with you tickling Alexandria like you have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very. That's the whole point.\" Alexandria continues quietly, outside the hearing of the guests. \"A distracted duchess or ambassador is easier to get concessions out of. And Lady Adelle has been very distracted tonight. Especially\u2026\" Alexandria whispers in your ear, and you nod in agreement. Obeying the suggestion, you put your index fingers just inside each of Alexandria's hips, and begin to stroke up and down that spot very softly. The touch makes her arch her back and gasp loudly, followed by stifled giggles, Alexandria's smooth belly quivering with held in ticklish laughter. As you continue to stroke that sensitive spot, you notice Adelle's eyes watching your tickling like a hawk, glued to the spot. You notice one of her hands moving as if to cover her own hips protectively, and if you didn't know better you would say you can almost see her belly flinching in a sympathetic ticklish feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe\u2026 oh, ok stop. St-ahahap!\" Alexandria tells you, quietly but firmly. You oblige, reluctantly ending the gentle but very effective teasing strokes. \"Rumor has it that's an excellent way to get Adelle's attention. But I've never had the pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how do you know where she's ticklish? That she's ticklish at all?\" You ask, wondering if some kind of ticklish bacchanal happens after all the negotiations are concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spies. Court intrigue. Coninze is a very deceptive place, and eventually everyone knows everything about everyone. Besides, the Uzien royal family has been terribly ticklish for generations. It's a poorly kept secret.\" Alexandria tells you, divulging secrets to you as if they were common knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" you say, dumbfounded. You find yourself glancing at Adelle again, wondering what it would be like to tickle her. To find out if Alexandria was right\u2026 but you look away to avoid meeting the duchess's gaze as she keeps glancing back at you, seemingly quite distracted now. \"So, our job is to distract the guests, while the Queen can focus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's the rub.\" Alexandria tells you, sighing. \"It's distracting to everyone, including the Queen. She's just betting on being less distracted than the others. Although\u2026\" A mischievous look comes over Alexandria's face as she whispers another suggestion to you. This time, you find yourself slowly dragging your fingers down her stretched out arms, starting at her elbow. As your fingertips graze along her inner arms, Alexandria squirms from the increasingly ticklish touches. Down the quivering arm you go, and then teasingly circling the outside of her underarms, carefully avoiding the sensitive spot so close by\u2026 you look up, and notice that you now have the Queen's full attention, as Alexandria gasps and snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph! Ok stop-stop-don't go in!\" She tells you hurriedly, and again you reluctantly obey. \"Whew\u2026 that's a spot that'll get the Queen's attention, but we only gave a taste. Although that might actually tease her even more\u2026 oh well. She can always 'punish' us later, right?\" Your eyes widen at the easy suggestion. You weren't trying to get yourself 'punished!' You were eventually going to tickle the Queen, but maybe your first encounter might be the other way around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't think about that too long, as someone walks up to you:</span></div></div>",

Whilst the Queen had only one wall dedicated to feathers in her room, this room had feathers of all shapes and sizes adorning every wall. It was then that you spotted the Princess. She was eerily similar to the Queen, probably looking how the Queen did a decade ago. With her brunette hair, she also wore a silk nightgown, which as she stood up from her desk chair and turned towards you, you realised was untied. This gave a full glimpse of her pale, slender figure, covered only by tight underwear that covered her breasts and loins. Apart from that, you took in her petite feet and flat belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the new Royal Tickler,\" the Princess said as she eyed you up and down. \"Yes, Princess,\" you say, bowing your head as you do so. \"Oh we'll have none of that boring formality here.

She bites her lip as you do. \"My sister told me she had hired a handsome young man to serve as Royal Tickler. I am happy to see that she wasn't exaggerating.\" She took your hand and led you to the bed, which clearly looked as if someone had just been tickled atop it, judging by the state of it. <br>\r\nShe turned to you and said with a cute, glowing smile \"I'm very much looking forward to...</span></div></div>",

But for now, you retired to your room for a few moments of rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned to your chambers, you found a dark wash robe laying across the bed. It seemed a lot more comfortable then the constricting clothes you were wearing now. You quickly slipped it on and flopped down onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick rest, you went directly to the Queen's room. You came to the ornate double doors and knocked. From there, you heard a muffled 'come in' from the other side. You slowly stepped inside, finding the Queen sitting comfortably in a red velvet chair, while Alexandra was bound by her wrists and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, my dear,\" the Queen said, \"And shed your robe,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as she asked, inhaling sharply at the cold air that met your body. You noticed how Alexandria couldn't take her eyes off you, nor you her. She's beautiful, so fair, so sexy, so very ticklish. You suddenly hear a rattle, and to your surprise, the Queen has pulled out a set of iron cuffs, lined comfortably in red velvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn to have your backside face me,\" she ordered. You did as you were told. She took her hands and clipped them into the cuffs, then he waved you to the bound Alexandria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have quite a way of entertaining, so entertain me,\" she said, \"Tickle her,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at the bound girl on the bed, then shifted in your cuffs, \"But, your majesty, my hands are bound,\" you said. She shrugged back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get creative,\" she replied. With a sigh, you turn to Alexandria and crawl onto the bed. She's sitting before you, legs stretched out before you with her wrists sitting idly in her lap. She gives you a reassuring smile and nods. You took a minute to think, planning out your attack. The Queen wanted you to be creative, so you got creative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned forward and started planting kisses on her neck. With what little stubble you had left, the kisses quickly went from pleasurable to tickly in a matter of seconds. You continued to give her ticklish kisses and nuzzle her neck, making her squeal and giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha!\" music to your ears. You continued to nuzzle and tickle her, while the Queen sat back in her seat, watching with great amusement. Your lips traveled down Alexandria's neck and towards her breasts. You stubble rubs across her titflesh. Alexandria giggles happily, starting to lean back to give you more access. You growl hungrily and push her down onto the bed, nibbling the sides of her breasts and kissing her perky nips. By now, the raven-haired beauty was giggling with mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha! HA!\" she shrieks suddenly when you start to nibble her ribs. She falls flat on her back, and you straddle her thighs, giving you immense space to tickle.</span></div></div>",

Hahahaha! Pl-ehehehease! Stahap!\" she cackled. You couldn't stop even if you wanted to. Her skin, her laughter, all a drug you were quickly becoming hooked on.

By now, Alexandria was cackling like a witch, gasping desperately for air as you continued to tickle and tickle her with your tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never let her get comfortable.

You whimper and chuckle, but try to keep yourself composed for as long as you can. She suddenly gives you a squeeze and you jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody liked that,\" she teased. She then leaned down and started placing kisses along your exposed chest. All the while, her nails continued to tease you. You writhe and wriggle under her, and in doing so, you're building her up again. You suddenly remember that people tend to be extra sensitive after an orgasm. While she tortures you, you reach out and wiggle your fingers into her hips similarly as you'd done tonight. She yelps and giggles, but she never takes her hands off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before you get the strength to roll over so you're on top, squeezing and kneading her hips and breaking her concentration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-hey!

You reluctantly agreed and rolled over again. She laid down over you and started grinding down on your member. You hummed happily and let yourself relax in her bed.

She leaned over you and started leaving playful kisses on your neck, never taking her eyes off you as you reached your high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria watched with a smile on her face as you came, squirting yourself across her stomach. You took a minute to relax and gave a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much,\" you replied. She got off you and went to the corner of her room and grabbed a fresh towel. You sat up against the head board as she started cleaning you off, and you couldn't bare to take your eyes off her. She was one of the most intriguing tickle victims you ever had. You moved her hand away and pulled her up against your chest. You were starting to like this girl, but maybe in the way you shouldn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking about, Mr?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how lucky I am to have swindled this job,\" you replied.

Alexandria flinches, expecting you to tickle her again, but she closes her eyes and relaxes into the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've never had a tickle victim like you, before,\" you run your hand higher to her pussy.

She was especially sensitive after the orgasm you had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, you decided to give her a break. She let out a sigh of relief and laid back in the sheets, staring up at you with wide eyes. You hover over her, using your elbows to prop yourself up as you gaze so affectionately at the sensitive beauty. It seems as though she's something out of a dream, a fantasy that will be pulled away from his grasp at the last second. Never had you met someone so giddy and ticklish who was also willing to commit to your tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying?\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to say that you'll be trying to break the toughest of spies from our enemy kingdom. And, if you do progressively well, your tactics will be bought by nobles for a night of entertainment,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... more of this?\" you started tickling under her breasts. Alexandria gave a groan but continued to giggle and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Come on -- hehehe! Thihis is-isn't fahahahair!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're not trying to stop me,\" you pointed out once you pulled your hands away. Alexandria blushed bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it when you tickle me. You're considerate of me,\" she said, \"The last Royal Tickler we had was determined to make me piss myself and the other girls all the time,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly an amateur,\" you slide down her body until you reach her hips, \"You don't want your victims to suffer so much, you want them to enjoy it so that they'd be willing to do anything to meet their end,\" to make your point, you begin licking her hips. Alexandria giggles happily, but the sensations aren't as intense as to what she's used to. Your tongue is soft, wet, but rough enough to keep the giggles flowing from her perfect lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe. Ahahahahehehe,\" she let her head fall to the side and relax into the sheets. You love her laugh, you could listen to it 24/7. Out of all the bad things you had witnessed in your life, Alexandria's cute giggle was enough to erase it all and give you happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Stop! Stahap! Plehease!\" she begged. You licked one more stripe up her side and then crawled up to meet her lips. You enraptured her in a sweet kiss, which she returned gleefully. But as you pulled away, what she asked took you off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ticklish?\"</span></div></div>",

You continue moving your fingers over her helpless feet for several minutes before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do now?\" you ask her. \"Should I continue with your toes? they do look like they can be very tasty,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in front of the helpless tickle victim, and bring her lovely feet up to your face. \"Now my dear, prepare for the tickling of a lifetime.\" With that you begin to slowly run your tongue along her naked soles sending her into a laughing frenzy. You leave no spot untouched. her arches, in between her toes, after 20 minutes every square inch of her feet are covered in saliva. She looks on the verge of passing out. You then grab a brush and start scrubbing up and down her sole. She shrieks even louder. Grabbing her other foot to do the same, despite the girl's loud protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to leave her feet alone for a while and move on to her body. It's not like Alexandria's, she's too skinny. But your eyes immediately fall on her skimpy bra and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come let me see you without all of that underwear,\" you said inching closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please,\" whimpered the helpless spy.<br>\r\nYou tear of her bra to reveal the spy's poor jiggling breast and hard pink nipples. You then tear of her underwear while she lets out a satisfying shriek. You stare at her treasured place while she starts turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to speak?\" she shakes her head, but her resolve is breaking. It shouldn't be long now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where should I tickle you?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Give me a shout if she clamps up again,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards take your place, at the ready with a pen and paper as they question the spy. You meanwhile head back upstairs, and you're immediately taken by the distant sounds of giggling from the hall. Those were Alexandria's giggles. You followed them like an auditory trail of bread crumbs, right up to a grand embroidered door. You kneel down and peek through the key hole, and your eyes nearly bug out when you catch the sight before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired beauty laughs and squirms to the command of the other girl's fingers. She wears the same outfit as the day before which leaves her well and truly open to the advances of the girl as she spiders her nails over her ribs. Like yesterday, she wears the scarves at her wrists and ankles, bound to the bed, only a few feet from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl tickling her looks the same age as the two of you, early twenties, but her hair looks reminiscent of- you process the information in a heartbeat and realize brunette tickler reaching for a feather duster is non-other the princess. A full decade or more younger than her sister, the princess is well known throughout Coninze as a- 'free spirit' some would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe! Oh! Hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria's laughter intensifies as the feather duster swirls over her belly, dragging soft feathers in its ticklish wake. It visits her thighs before exploring her neck and then plunging into an armpit and making her squirm fruitlessly to the side that isn't being tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while the princess's eyes never leave her victim's face and she seems transfixed on every giggle and involuntary smile Alexandria makes. You allow your eyes to slip down her body and like what you see- an untied silk night-robe gives you full view of her underwear taunt stomach and slender figure. She kneels on her toned legs that seem to glisten in the low candlelight and for a moment you wonder what you'd give to see her in the position of Alexandria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crack the door open and slip inside, clearing your throat to get their attention. The princess immediately stops tickling Alexandria and turns to you with surprise, while Alexandria blushes a deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess gets off her tickle toy and approaches you with an elegant stride, \"So, you're the Royal Tickler my sister hired. Alexandria has told me all about you,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All good, I hope,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best we've ever had,\" Alexandria chimes in. The princess crosses her arms at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I saw the way you toyed with her last night, and it made me super jealous!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I missed making my little tickle-toy scream with laughter,\" she turns to Alexandria and gives her a teasing smile. Alexandria blushes and squirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to see you at work,\" the princess says. She goes back to the bed and sits next to Alexandria's bound body, lightly dragging her fingers up and down her side. Alexandria can only bite back her giggles and writhe in the sheets, \"Care to join us, Royal Tickler?\" </span></div></div>",

Your wiggling fingers move higher to the crevice of her nether, trailing down to the curve of her butt cheeks.

She's amazed at your technique; the soft sensual tickles seem to get Alexandria off as you keep tickling her butt and nether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha! Please! PLEASE! Stahahap!\" Alexandria pleads. You're both having too much fun to stop. Your fingers wiggle into the cracks of her butt and down the backs of her thighs, and she screams and squeals out in giggles. The princess meanwhile skitters her sides and under her arms, copying your movements and keeping Alexandria on the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's switch,\" she suddenly says. You have no problem with that. You stop torturing her poor butt and crawl up her body while the princess moves down to her knees and feet. Now sitting on the small of her back, you use Alexandria's favourite tickle tool: your mouth. Your tongue slides up the length of her spine, leaving soft kisses on her bare shoulder, then you travel down again. Alexandria wants to enjoy your technique, but she can hardly concentrate as the princess nibbles her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe! Ohohoho! Hahahaha!\" you continue to assault her back with kisses, licks and nibbles, and you decide to make her jump by skittering your fingers alongside her breasts. While the princess plays with her feet, you move up and lie down next to the writhing servant. You give her some affectionate kisses to her neck and shoulder, and rub soothing circles along her back. She jumps when you touch her, half-expecting you to tickle her some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You -- hahaha! You sahahaid y-you were going to be nice to mehehehe!\" she continued to giggle and laugh as the princess licked at her dainty soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am being nice to you. Your friend isn't,\" you walked two of your fingers down her back, \"I can be super nice to you... and super mean, too,\" you then nuzzled your face into her neck and began to give her ticklish kitten licks. Alexandria erupted into giggles again, but she ceased her protests as the two of your continued to lick her from head to toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the princess spent the next hour licking down Alexandria like an ice-cream cone. By the end, she was exhausted, laying in the twisted sheets in a sweaty, giggly, sexy mess. She was wriggled onto her stomach, still chuckling and tittering as the princess continued to draw patterns on her torso. You undid her wrists from the scarves and wrapped an arm around her, then gave her sweet kisses along her shoulder and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough, Alex?\" the princess asks. Alexandria moans as she nods back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're both terrible one your own. Together, you're going to kill me,\" she sighs. You brush some loose hair out of her face and kiss her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd never be so cruel to you,\" you tell her, \"Then we'd have no one to play with,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not true,\" she then turns to the princess, \"Victoria, did you know our Royal Tickler is a little sensitive himself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess -- Victoria -- raises her eyebrows with intrigue and looks over at you. You swallow nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is he now?\" she purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria nods and traces her fingers along the curves of your chest, leading you to inhale sharply, \"Very,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat, \"Girls, let's not be hasty, now,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not being hasty, ___,\" Victoria says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never,\" Alexandria suddenly pounces on you and straddles your waist, \"I'm returning the favour,\"  her fingers find your hips and drill in. You throw your head back and howl with laughter. She's not even that strong, but your limbs feel like they weigh a ton already. The princess giggles and joins in, prodding at your sides with her long nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her through squinted eyes, seeing her smiling with glee at your torment. You fear that if you don't escape soon, you'll be truly defeated.</span></div></div>",

Just for future reference, Victoria's especially sensitive in her underarms,\" you suddenly couldn't wait for an opportunity to dig into the princess' soft flesh, use feathers on her tummy and wiggle your fingers into her underarms. But for now, your attention is focused on your sexy raven-haired tickle toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. Meanwhile...\" you start to stroke her hips again, and Alexandria starts to giggle, \"I'd rather focus on your sensitive spots,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Stop!\" she pushes your hand away. You growl and pin her beneath you, then she squeals as you start covering her face in kisses. The two of you begin to make out passionately, until...</span></div></div>",

You sit up and look around with puzzlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Town Crier with the afternoon news. He's a spy for us, and he keeps us updated on all of Rylestia's on-abouts,\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't know he's a spy?\" you ask again. Alexandria glares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's not strapped down in their dungeon somewhere while a pretty young thing like me tickles him to tears, so...\" she shrugs back. You roll your eyes and you both stand up, immediately trying to find your clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart ass,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria replaces the nice white floral dress she had on this morning, and she goes for the door, you suddenly grab her wrist and pin her to the door, \"Just so we're clear, I  expect to see you in my room tonight after dinner. I want that revenge you promised,\" you say. She smirks back and pats your now covered chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, sir,\" she replies. You both exit the entertainment room and go towards the throne room, where the queen is patiently waiting as the town crier gets his updates ready. Victoria is sitting beside her sister, now dressed in a regal red gown and looking scarce of any signs of inflicting tickle torture. You hope to God that you look just as clean as she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What news do you bring, Crier?\" the queen asks. The stout little man bows before her and unsheathes a scroll from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You majesty, King Magnus of Rylestia as increased the number of guards surrounding his kingdom borders,\" he reads off the parchment. The queen just rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Men are always over-compensate for everything,\" she groans, \"What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've heard the news of this new <i>Royal Tickler</i> you've come to hire, your majesty,\" your ears perk up at that. Queen Catharine seems bored with such news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And why should this concern my entertainment? They won't have him, if that's what Magnus thinks,\" she says. As subtly as possible, Alexandria reaches over and squeezes your hand in hers in comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, your majesty. But, other Royal Ticklers have been taken captive by their forces before. Word has it he's already broken one of their most endured spies,\" that was only this morning? Did news travel that fast around here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you fear history may repeat itself?\" the queen asks as she eyes you from the corner. You swallow nervously at that. Could someone from Rylestia be on their way to kidnap you? The very thought of being taken away from this place -- away from Alexandria -- made the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I do, your majesty,\" the crier says, \"If I were you, I'd have this <i>Royal Tickler</i> kept under close eyes to ensure his safety,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen nodded in agreement, \"I couldn't agree more,\" she then turns to the rest of her court, \"Leave us! All of you! Except for you, ___,\" she says. Everyone flocks out of the throne room, leaving you alone with Queen Catharine and Princess Victoria. You swallow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are happy here, aren't you, ___?\" the queen asks. You nod rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, your majesty. I'm indebted to you,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, you are. I will warn you, the kingdom of Rylestia is sneaky, vile, and crude -- much like their king, come to think of it. I've had several ticklers fall captive to their antics and be swept away into the depths of their dungeons. I do not wish the same fate for you,\" she says. You hold back your sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your majesty,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, there are duties still required of you. You will be granted protection by a troupe of my best soldiers, and you will be safe in the castle walls,\" she says, \"Rylestia will not win this battle, nor this war,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your majesty,\" you reply again. Victoria gives you a warm, reassuring smile. The queen claps her hands, and two guards suddenly walk into the court, \"Guards, escort the Royal Tickler to the dining hall for lunch. You will ensure that he is kept under safe guard at all times,\" the guards nod back and stand on either side of you, menacing-like with sharp muskets resting on their shoulders. You couldn't have felt safer -- or more paranoid, for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now that that's settled, I suggest you get a good rest in, ____. Someone has bought your talents for the afternoon,\" the queen says, \"Duchess Adelle of Uzien\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You bow deeply before your Queen and turn towards the dining hall, a guard on either side of you. The castle had seemed like an idyllic place up to now, but the presence of armed guards protecting you from spies and kidnappers suggests that there was more to the Coninzian Palace than fun and games. You turn to the guard on your right and ask, \u201cAm I really in that much danger? Everything seems so safe in the castle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be safe as long as you stay inside the castle walls.\u201d The guard tells you. \u201cBut there\u2019s more risk when you venture out into the kingdom, or even outside it.\u201d You arch an eyebrow questioningly at the guard. You had thought that the job of Royal Tickler would always keep you in the Palace. \u201cIt is the Queen\u2019s duty to travel her lands and see them prosper, or even outside of them for diplomacy. There is also Princess Victoria, who is much more adventurous. She has sometimes taken the Royal Tickler with her... \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the frustration of the Queen.\u201d The other guard finishes. \u201cShe was in quite a mood the last time the Princess took the Royal Tickler off into the Wilds for a week. But we can\u2019t contradict Royal commands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and judging by your earlier encounter with Victoria, it seems accurate. But then another thought strikes you. \u201cAside from Rylestia, are there any other dangers? Like\u2026 Uzien, for example?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard to your right thinks for a moment. \u201cHmm, Uzien? They have been ambitious lately, and gaining territory. But not ours, mostly annexing islands in the Southern Sea. Uzien can be tricky, but we\u2019re usually more friend than foe. Besides, Coninze is still a lot bigger than Uzien, their might is mostly naval.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have to worry about Uzien.\u201d The other guard tells you. \u201cDuchess Adelle wouldn\u2019t be here if she were a threat. And the Queen allowing her to buy your\u2026 services\u2026 is a sign of trust. If you ask me, I would guess that the Queen hopes you\u2019ll put the young Duchess in an agreeable mood to finalize the alliance. But don\u2019t ask me, I\u2019m just a guard.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, the guards\u2019 comments making sense. At least to your mind. Alexandria would probably know more about all these politics. You\u2019ll have to ask her tonight, if the two of you can behave long enough to talk about it. The thought makes you grin as you enter the dining hall, where the smell of food instantly makes you ravenously hungry. A delicious stew is being handed out to everyone, and you eagerly take a bowl and wolf it down. The food here is delicious, and for a few minutes all thoughts of tickles and plots are pushed out of your head as you eat wordlessly. A second bowl soon follows the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you\u2019ve eaten your fill, you decide to take a nap before meeting Duchess Adelle. The Queen did tell you to rest easy beforehand. You head back to your room to enjoy a quick catnap at mid-day, the guards holding their position outside your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick knock wakes you, as the door opens. Standing in your doorway, with an eager expression on her face, is...</span></div></div>",

Her hair is tied up and to your surprise, she has a knife strapped to her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine, sleeping beauty,\" she grins, \"It's time for your first meet with Adelle,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you planning to use force?\" you ask, nodding to the knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Queen insists all her subjects have some form of self-defence. You will be given one, yourself,\" she replies. You let her inside your room and begin to redress for the occasion. She sits down on the bed, watching you with no words, but that sly smile on her face that you'd grown to love. But there was something wrong, she could feel it. You were suddenly feeling very exposed, not just being half-naked in front of her, but just that sinking feeling that you were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nervous,\" she comments. You shrug back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you be if your life was being threatened?\" you reply.

You stop short of buttoning your shirt and turn to her with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were kidnapped?\" you ask. She nods slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Within my first six months of working here. I was only a maid, then. I was meters away from my room when an undercover guard from Otraedia grabbed me and drugged me,\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They hurt you?\" you ask, then grimace at yourself for doing such. You had heard about the Kingdom of Otraedia, known as being a close twin to Rylestia, but with a much darker side. Many had likened it to a barren land, with a ruthless, greedy king and poverty running rapid through the streets. They certainly weren't the type to play with feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hurt</i> is putting it lightly,\" she says, \"They locked me in a room, tried to get me reveal our defence secrets. There was this one guy, he was a mercenary for the king, and he was the worst. He starved me, beat me, humiliated me. He made me believe everyday that I was going to die,\" a tear slides down her cheek. You kneel before her and place your hand over her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you made it out,\" you tell her, \"You're here,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she chuckles and wipes her tears away, \"After I was rescued, I spent months in recovery. I decided then that I only wanted to have a gentle touch that would drive me mad instead of something that could potentially kill me. So, I got into tickling,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate the thought of someone inflicting pain onto her; just the idea boils you with anger. You take her delicate hand in yours and press a kiss to her knuckle, \"Did they at least hang for it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back when we were on better terms, we truced with Rylestia and Uzien to overthrow the king. The land is bare now, but the man I told you about -- the big one -- he's in the wind,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sent a chill down your spine. Alexandria traces the length of your jaw with her fingers, \"Nobody is going to hurt you. With Queen Catherine in power, she'll see to it that you never go through what I went through those many years ago,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just keep an eye out for suspicious characters in the halls,\" you try to joke. Alexandria rolls her eyes at you and stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish dressing. We'll be leaving in a few minutes,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, may lady,\" you give her a playful bow. Alexandria leaves you to finish dressing yourself. You put on one of your best shirts the Queen had given you and a fresh pair of trousers. You quickly brush back your hair and go out into the hallway, immediately being greeted by your body guards. They escort you downstairs where a carriage awaits you; with Alexandria finishing up with the halters on the horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not we. You,\" she says, \"I have some... duties I must attend to,\" you have a pretty good idea of what 'duties' she had in mind, \"You're going to The York, one of the best inns in the kingdom. Adelle is a regular there,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any advice?\" you ask as you approach the carriage. Alexandria looks around before approaching you and whispering in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her hips are almost as bad as mine,\" she bumps her hips into yours just to make her point. You smirk down at her and climb into the carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I see you tonight?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to it,\" she replies with a coy smile. You wish her well and settle inside; your body guards sitting opposite of you. The castle becomes but a spec in the horizon as you're carted off into the city; passing the old streets of which you found yourself trying to survive off of for the longest time. You feel a sense of nostalgia as you pass the markets, the old shoe shiner, and the tavern where you spent many wasted nights trying to accumulate work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the carriage stops in front of the inn; a grandiose building of bricks and clay, casting an imposing shadow over the streets of Coninze. You're escorted inside; both your guards thoroughly check out the lobby before taking you past the check-in desk. Clearly, they are expecting you. At the top floor, you come to a set of grand double doors, the promise of a young, ticklish duchess just behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The duchess is inside. We will be posted out here. If anything goes wrong, make as much of a ruccuss as you can,\" one of them explains. He's a burly type of fellow, with a fuzzy beard and beady stare. He would scare the hell out of anyone who even looked at him the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you nod to them and head inside. There, you find the duchess...</span></div></div>",

Or do we just get down to business?\" you ask. Adelle slips off the bed and kneels before the dust ruffle, giving you a perfect view of her perky, round bottom. She then pulls out a burlap bag and a wooden chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred pounds for your services,\" she says as she hands you the bag, \"And in here, an array of tools for your disposal,\" she nods to the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a pit of excitement jump within you.

The lanky man in the ruffled suit nods and takes the parchment back, disappearing into the halls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen then turns to you, \"Our alliance is mostly in part with your work for the duchess, ____\" she says. You feel a sense of pride come over you as you fill your plate. Alexandria and Victoria look at each other, both with giddy smiles on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a pleasure, your majesty,\" you reply. While the queen continues to list off the accomplishments of the day by her serfs, you notice the girls whispering to each other, every now and again sneaking a glance at you. You're curious to know what they're up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for tomorrow, you, Royal Tickler, have the day off. The day after, however, we have the Quarter Punishment in the city square,\" the queen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quarter Punishment?\" you ask with intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every three months, the queen gathers her prisoners in the town square to be humiliated in front of the villagers. It's a type of deterrent,\" Alexandria explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Results have shown that our crime rate has dropped by 37%,\" the queen says with pride. As you start to eat, you suddenly feel something brush past your leg. You pause at first, thinking it was either a cat, or just your imagination. But it suddenly happens again. It's a bare foot, brushing your trouser leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look across the table, thinking Alexandria to be the culprit, But she's busy eating, making no movement to suggest she's teasing you. But a few centimetres over is Victoria, poking at her roast chicken and potatoes and giving you a seductive gaze. You push the tablecloth back a little and look down, finding her perfect little foot brushing your shin. She's looking at you as though she's daring you to act, but she brings her finger to her lips, telling you to keep quiet about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to ignore her at first, seeing how far you can push her. And for a moment, you think she'll give up, until she places her dainty foot in your lap. You decide to...</span></div></div>",

Her toes curl and her feet begin to wrinkle, but Victoria doesn't make any sound, nor indicate you're teasing her. But you want to see her squirm and whimper at your touch. After what she'd put you through earlier, fair seemed fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw two fingers and stroke up and down her sole, soft enough to tickle and drive her mad, but not hard enough to get her to guffaw in laughter. You collapse your fingers around the contours of her heel, and without hesitation, you let your fingers crawl along the sides of her foot. Victoria squirms in her seat and coughs into her hand; your fingers on her foot feel like a centipede crawling along her skin, trying to get her to break. But like Alexandria, Victoria would be a tough lee to break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scribble your fingers over the ball of her foot, wiggle inside and between her toes, and even go as far to use the napkin on your lap to tease her. You take the clean white satin between two fingers and slide it across her sole. Victoria jumps, squirms, and titters under her breath, but she doesn't burst... yet. Alexandria eyes you playfully, trying to act naturally around her ticklish friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to try and up your game. As subtly as possible, you take your smaller, unused fork, and begin to gently rake it down her foot. That time, Victoria squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" you withdraw your hand as soon as she does, trying to make yourself inconspicuous. The queen eyes her sister suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything all right, Victoria?\" she asks. The princess takes a breath and nods, still never taking her foot off your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Catherine. Just bit into an olive pit,\" she replies. The queen doesn't seem to buy it, but she doesn't push on. Victoria looks at you again, bringing her finger to her lips once more before nodding for you to keep going. So, you keep eating, and keep raking and poking Victoria's soles with your fork. She shifts, wiggles, smiles, titters, and begins to go red in the face, but never once does she break. You're impressed, but you can't wait to have her feet all to yourself, just to see how loud you can make her laugh with this fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner is over, and the plates have been cleared, you quickly stuff the fork into your pocket, eager to use it for later tickle tactics. Victoria is about to retire to her bed chamber, but you quickly catch up to her before she disappears down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a dirty little trick you played,\" you tell her. Victoria smiles up at you with that same seductive grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't entirely me, you're tickle toy wanted to see what you would do,\" she leaned closer to you, \"But I look forward to have you play with my feet for real,\" she whispers, before giving you a saucy wink and skipping down the hallway. You watch her with a silly grin on your face and go to find Alexandria, ready to make good on what she promised you.</span></div></div>",

You don't panic, though, because lo and behold, it's Alexandria.

You could hear her soft, breathless moans every time you licked her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, please! Don't stop!\" she begs. Who are you to deny your lady pleasure? You continue to lick out her belly button. You shift down her body, still holding down her wrists in one hand, and reaching down the other to feel her underwear. Already, her nether is dripping wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the pace, lapping her like a thirsty animal. Her thighs clench together and she shakes her head from side to side. She's close, so close! But as she's almost there, you stop licking her.</span></div></div>",

And to find out what that little fork of yours can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat when you see light seeping out from beneath the majestic door. You peak inside, and there she is, lying back on the bed in her dress with her hair untied, splayed out across the pillow. You slip inside the room and lock the door behind you, bellowing in the seductive smile she's giving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria turns onto her side. She's undone part of her blouse so a part of her breast slips out, just barely giving you a view of her perfect little nipple. You kick off your boots and sit down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was dinner?\" she asked innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a minute to think before responding, \"... Entertaining, I'll give you that,\" you rest your hand on her hip, \"You trying to get me in trouble, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't tell you to do anything,\" she claims with a growing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" your hand slides up her side, \"But you set up the bait,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you fell for it like a kitten does for sardines,\" she giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her. She's absolutely adorable, giving you a childish grin that makes you want to smother her in kisses and tickles. But she was also very naughty, and she needs to be punished first. You pull out the fork from your pocket and watch with glee as Alexandria's eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet I could've made Victoria scream from this,\" you claim as you inspect it, then you glint down at Alexandria's clothed stomach, \"But for now, I'd rather hear you squeal for it,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria giggles again and turns onto her back, putting her arms up. You shake your head and stand up, \"First, I want you to strip for me,\" you command, \"Keep your panties on,\" The look in her eye twinkles and she sits up on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" she replies submissively. She decides to give you a show; slowly undoing the rest of her blouse and pulling it off, revealing her beautiful, perky breasts. Then she slides off her slacks and socks, giving you a perfect show in the dim candle light. Alexandria then crawls over to you and starts undoing the ties to your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to make this somewhat fair, right?\" she says. You don't fight her, but let her pull your shirt off. She slides the material down your arms and lets it fall next to her own clothes. You twist the fork in your hand, ready to make her scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently push her down on the bed and straddle her thighs. Alexandria begins to squirm and giggle without even being touched, her body giddy in anticipation. Without another word and a smirk, you take the fork and gently run it down her right underarm. The reaction is visceral. Alexandria arches up off the bed and moans, her eyes screw shut and her lips grow into a bigger smile. You continue to rake the fork up and down that underarm, watching with glee as she writhes and squeals beneath you, trying not to laugh.

Of course the matriarchal Coninze wouldn't send a man to do their dirty work, unlike the Rylestians. You take out a small eyepiece to try and get a closer look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is easy to identify, no longer blending into the crowd, but clothed for stealthy movements through the dark night. A black garment covered her head but for a narrow eyeslit, and tightly covering her neck and chest. The short, sleeveless garment left her arms and midriff exposed to the cool night air, a blessing in the hot, humid no man's land between Coninze and Rylestia. Black pants and muddy moccasins complete her attire. Her caramel skin glistens in the moonlight, sweating slightly as she exerts herself. You notice what appears to be two heavy coin purses on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower the eyepiece as she makes her way toward your tree. That settles it, you think, that uniform means she's from the Silent Sisterhood. While you've never seen one in person, you've heard all the rumors. A cadre of Coninze's finest warrior women, extensively trained in unarmed combat, poison making, spying and seduction. Some say the Sisterhood's unorthodox methods have kept the powerful Rylestian Kingdom from advancing into Coninze. Men and women alike have unwittingly fallen to their tactics. They are supremely self-confident in everything they do. They are said to have unrivaled mastery over the human body, and once they don their stealth gear, no one hears so much as a whisper from them. At least, no one who has survived an encounter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's risky prey, especially if those rumors are true. But the rewards... those coin purses she carries must have valuable medicines, poisons, or currency. At least one of them must be important, by the way she's hurrying. The other could be used as a bribe, to get out of sticky situations. Besides, those rumors could have been made by the Sisterhood themselves, to inspire fear. There's no way they're that skilled, right? You contemplate this, trying to gin up your bravery. The spy pauses under your tree, catching her breath for a moment.

Whoever, or whatever, it is, it grabs both of your wrists and forcefully bends them behind you and upwards towards your shoulderblades before pressing them firmly against yourself. You gasp for air as you look over your shoulder and catch sight of the black-clothed attacker:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA <i>second </i>member of the Silent Sisterhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't recall ever hearing about them travelling in pairs, but perhaps that was how they always overcame every obstacle. People would plan for one foe and end up falling prey to two instead. Her form is kneeling upon your wrist, her legs straddling you, and with your arms doubled-up into your own back you're effectively pinned down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be more alert, sister,\" she says, her voice rolling over your ears like velvet. She doesn't sound old nor young. At first you're wondering whether she's referring to you, but you quickly realize that she is speaking to her companion who was watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A thousand apologies, sister. I needed a rest,\" she responds, still a bit breathless. Her voice sounds much younger than the one that had caught you.

You grimace and open your mouth to shout, but she twists harder, letting only a yelp of pain to slip past your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Rylestian dog, there will be no help for you this time,\" she threatens, her eyes glaring through the narrow eyeslit of her outfit. They're an ice blue and seem to pierce your very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Sister takes a step closer, her coin pouches tinkling lightly with the sound of metal or glass hitting similar objects. You're still unsure as to what the contents were inside. \"He doesn't look like one of the Rylestians. That attire isn't standard, and you know how firm they are on uniformity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting back the pain, you finally grunt out a response. \"That's because.. erg..

Just let me through already before I decide cut through you with my sword.\" The female said impatiently, revealing a rather fancy looking sword attached at her side under the cloak, you could also see parts of an armor... and not just any armor, but of Rylestian elite guard, they fight in most important battles, and protect the king himself... just who the hell is she?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What business would a Rylestian elite guard have informing Coninze about her own kingdom's plans?\" You ask<br>\r\n\"My... king, he had some weird mage build him a magical device, I'm not sure how it works, but it is able to incapacitate people in a large radius by making them laugh, as if they were all being tickled or something.

This may not bode well for your treasure hunt, if everything is so easily acceptable. You walk down the hallway, peering from room to room. Aside from the occasional skeleton or broken table, there doesn't appear to be anything of value in here at all. You turn a corner, quickly scanning another set of store rooms, muttering to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Figures this place'd be picked clean. This is a waste of time...\" you tell yourself quietly. But despite your misgivings, you push onward. After all, you've already committed yourself, might as well make a thorough search. As you pass by yet another room you stop: was something different about that last room? You look back, and notice the floor made of a different material than the others. After looking through hundreds of rooms, any differences quickly stand out to you. Its very subtle, but looking closely you can tell the floor is not made of the usual stone. In fact, its wooden! You marvel at the craftsmanship required to make this gray, smooth wood resemble stone so completely. A wonderful piece of deception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this means there must be something special about this room! You look around, trying to figure out the puzzle. The room looks just as empty as the others. A small slit of a window lets daylight through the room. The walls appear worn and bare. You pause, confused, tapping the floor impatiently. <i>Something</i> is hidden here, but what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a creaking sound below you, and look down. A long crack is quickly forming beneath your tapping feet, the old wood finally giving way to the inevitable. Your eyes widen in surprise as you begin to move, but not fast enough. A hole in the floor opens up underneath you, plunging you through. By luck and fast reflexes, you spread your arms wide and catch the floor. The hole doesn't seem big enough to swallow you, but you've sunk up to your arms, just a shoulder and head poking comically out of the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, your tunic caught on the wood, piling under your arms. You feel a cool breath of air over your bare chest and belly, causing goosebumps. Thankfully no one can see this embarrassing predicament, as your cheeks redden slightly at the notion.

You are thankful you wore a thick shirt to protect against the cold in the caverns, but still wish it was a bit thicker as you squirm and let out a few giggles when the phantom fingers find a weak spot. Your reflection appears frustrated by your reaction as it uses one hand to lift up its shirt, while the other hand slowly tickles its own belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cover your belly with both arms and ask \"Why are you hehehe doing this? hehehe\" just as a steady stream of giggles pours out of you. Your reflections only response is to increase the pace of its tickle attack on your sensitive belly, causing you to burst out laughing as you fall to the floor, still clutching your belly. Through tears of laughter you see your reflection stops tickling itself and sits down, cross legged on the floor.

The last thing you remember was falling through a hole in the floor of the storeroom\u2026 your tunic getting caught on a jagged edge, exposing your belly and chest. Then a tongue, followed by hands and\u2026 tentacles? Ran all over your body, sending you into fits of laughter. What felt like delicate fingers gliding over your quivering bare belly, a tentacle wriggling under your arms, another hand pinching at your thighs\u2026 it was all too much. You realize you must have passed out. And now here you are, tied to a pole. Your hands are high above your head, and your tunic is now in rags, covering little more than your shoulders. At least your pants and boots are still on and intact, you think ruefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance up at your\u2026 attackers? They must be, to still be here with you captive. How could you be so stupid, to be captured so easily? But\u2026 captured by what? You squint in the darkness, trying to make out the forms in the flickering firelight of their camp. Despite being in some sort of underground chamber beneath the storeroom (unless you have traveled quite far), the fire does not seem to smoke up the room. Indeed, there seems to be no smoke at all. What trickery is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize the answer may be due to your non-human captors. There are four of them, all having pale blue skin covering their bodies. They are all female, covered in barbarically primitive furs, one wrapped around each chest, another hanging low over their hips. However, they all look quite different for being of the same species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them has four, no six arms! You see her fiddling with something over the fire, each arm seemingly going about its own task in an impressive display of multi-tasking. Another has no arms, instead a panoply of tentacles appear where arms should be. Writhing in perhaps a nervous manner, you can't tell how many tentacles there are in the dim light. The last two seem normal aside from the blue skin. At least, until you see them pick up a bone, licking it clean of meat. Long, dexterous tongues fall out of their mouths, wrapping the bone and scouring it of nutrition. The two strange women seem oblivious to the outside world, their eyes closed, as they lick up their dinner. You shudder and hope those aren't human bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the six armed woman notices you, standing up from her fire and approaching you. Shirking back, you realize all these women are a head taller than you, and each likely more than a match in a fight. The blue woman stops in front of you, stretching her top arms behind her head, her middle arms leisurely scratching her belly, her lower hands on her hips in a strangely fascinating display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human\" She growls at you, revealing her teeth. \"You have been captured by we Blue Ogres. You will admit to being our property, and we will take you to our Master. She will know what to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue Ogres! Now you understand the situation. These women were human once, until some black magic removed their inhibitions and their will, transforming them into the thrall of their Master. Clearly, this master must be some kind of sorceress or witch. Now, these half-demons must want to take you to her, maybe even to change you into one of them! You certainly can't allow that, but what can you do? She asked you to admit to being a slave\u2026 of course! The thrall must submit before becoming a Blue Ogre. Thankfully you still remember the legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to think quickly as you notice the ogress starting to glare at you. It might be best to be taken to their Master and try to talk with her. Then again, if you do that, you might put yourself in too much risk. Would it be better to meet such a powerful Wizardess, or take your chances with these four intimidating creatures? Before the Ogress gets any angrier, you open your mouth to speak.</span></div></div>",

She threatens you with her spear once more, but perhaps you can plead a more convincing case if you simply tell the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t found anything yet, my Lady. You can threaten me all you like, but you clocked me before I could even begin to look.\u201d You try to sound as forceful as you can, but being shirtless and bound to dungeon shackles doesn\u2019t exactly lend a lot of strength to your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nameless captor sighs, and takes her spear away from your chest. The feathered trophies dangling from the tip brush against your toes, and you try your best to stifle a laugh. It would not be prudent to let slip a weakness of yours in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? I believe you,\u201d she states sadly. She looks to your stolen garments, tossed haphazardly onto the dungeon floor. \u201cFrom your shoddy clothing, I didn\u2019t think you were very talented at finding treasure. And a shapeshifter would never pick a face so... cute.\u201d She looked to you with what you could only describe as hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Lady?\u201d you ask, not liking her tone very much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know the history of these walls?\u201d she continued, glancing about the dungeon and the horrible contraptions strewn all around. \u201cThey say that the Dormduo people were hedonists and gluttons. They constantly sought pleasure - fashioning their very society to fulfill their basest needs. When these were satisfied, they sought even more extreme measures to gratify themselves. No songs are sung of the Dormduo; and for good reason. They were ravenous beasts, feasting on all that was good and pure in the world.  In the end, it is said, they became so slothful that even their slaves were fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, not sure where this woman was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her plated gauntlets, revealing long slender fingers. \u201cThey infuriated the gods with their actions \u2013 it is said that no mere mortal should experience the joys meant for the divine.\u201d Your captor placed her gauntlets on the dungeon floor, and carefully picked one of the feathers out of her spearhead. \u201cSo they cast down a mighty fireball, and incinerated all who dwelled within these halls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour captor stood silently for a moment, her blue eyes sparkling with the flames of the torch nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was fortunate that day, my little prisoner.\u201d Your captor smiled broadly at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d You sputter, your stomach churning with a new fear. \u201c<i>That </i>day? But that was hundreds of years ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour captor nods, and crouches down in front of your feet. You tense them, trying to pull away, but the stocks are secure. You can feel her breath on your trapped soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky for you, I was away when the gods slew my people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that the woman was so close, you could sense something unearthly about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think a hedonist seeks most of all?\u201d she asked, her fingers teasing your bare soles. You felt the soft touch of her fingernail, which sent a spasm up your leg. You bit your lip, desperate to remain calm and in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure? Gratification?\u201d her voice was almost hypnotic, and her eyes peered deep into your soul. With the feather, she applied a quick stroke on your other foot, sending yet another burst of sensation up your body. Just the mere threat of her tools sent a shudder through your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Pleasure is fleeting \u2013 momentary. This world, and all of its denizens - from lowly man to mighty beast - exist for a brief flicker. What pleasure can be found when death hangs over all of our heads? Oblivion stalks us, and there is no escape from the curse of mortal flesh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice had turned melodic, and you felt yourself weaken against her words.

You knew you had to resist, or your mind would be lost forever to this woman \u2013 this creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we, the Dormduo, hedonism incarnate, sought pleasure eternal. Our magics were strong, and we broke through the barriers of this mortal world and breached the heavens. We stole the very life essence of the gods. Not to destroy them, nor even to rule over them,\u201d her eyes flashed a pale blue in the dim torchlight. \u201cBut to rule over death itself, and prevent our pleasure from ever ending.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashed a wicked smile, and you felt the last of your resistance melt away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, I\u2019m going to give you a taste of what I\u2019ve spent centuries perfecting \u2013 pleasure absolute.

It gives me pleasure to inflict such sensations upon others, while it gives your pleasure to have these sensations inflicted.

You start giggling immediately, unable to hold down the sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, issss the human a little ticklish?\" the Lamia asks tauntingly. The scratches begin to pick up speed, and your giggles gradually give way to laughter. Your right armpit is suddenly victim to the maddening touch as her hand ventures higher. A nail pokes into your navel and is rewarded with a shriek from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling as much as able, you find it near impossible to shake your pitiless tormentor. Wherever you move the claws seem to follow quickly behind. Nevertheless you did manage to lose them a few times, earning you fractions of a second before they found you again and continued their unrelenting tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eternity seems to pass before the hands cease. In reality your anguish only lasted about ten minutes, but you can't accept that. Once you manage to bring your giggles under control, you look up to see the Lamia's scowling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, thisss won't do,\" she said, disappointed. Slithering closer to the top of the rack, she begins to turn a wooden handle attached to the roller to which your hands are chained. Your arms are pulled even higher than before, to the point that movement is nigh impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lamia's head re-enters your line of sight. \"That'sss better.

Laugh for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour torment resumes, howls of laughter forced by the skillful traces in the hollows of your arms. Nearly completely unable to move, you are forced to experience the truly unrelenting torment of the vengeful Lamia, who seems to enjoy your hysteria a great deal. Hidden deep within the sounds of your forced mirth, you hear her humming a happy tune to your torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circles in your armpits become scratches on your ribs, with the occasional hand wandering down to your belly. Multiple times a fingernail dips into your navel, always causing your laughter to increase. Minutes pass, and your unwavering tormentor doesn't pause for a second. Your sides begin to ache from laughing for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the sensations stop. Even though it takes another minute to register, you finally find some respite.

You bit on your lip holding it again. The very essence of the tickling was bearable until it was being tickled for a long time. Your feet were aching to move. The bonds were teasing your movement as you twitch around the retrains. You began to beg, once again, hoping to appeal towards the lamia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d she said bluntly, \u201cYou enter my turf. Your feet are good as mine\u2026 Better yet\u2026\u201d she smiled taking a pen or showing some lipstick, dark red one, \u201cHow should I make your feet mine?\u201d Your face turn pale, \u201cIf you don\u2019t choose\u2026 I\u2019ll just make it both.\u201d Your eyes grew wide.

This was enough to get a stream of giggles flowing out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is going to be a treat,\" she said, narrowing her eyes at you as she eyed her new playthings with abandon. \"These adorable, perfect, delicious feet are all mine, and there's not a thing you can do about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled once again before using the pen to draw various silly images and phrases such as \"Tickle me here\", \"I'm a tickle slave\", and \"Property of my mistress\" in any piece of open skin she could find on your poor, defenseless feet.

Her womanhood protected by a loincloth kept up by a thin golden string around her waist, practically unnoticeable. A thick golden collar adorns her neck, inlaid with jewels and engravings in an alphabet unfamiliar to you. Two cloth straps, seemingly held in place by magic, fall one over each breast, covering her nipples but on the whole leaving quite little to the imagination. She wears nothing else, her tanned, chocolate skin a feast for the eyes. Her long, smooth legs; hourglass figure; taut midriff; and firm, full breast compose a beauty unrivaled for hundreds of miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing your gaze from her body, the second thing you notice about her is that she is not quite human. Golden goat horns approximately a foot long spring from her forehead. Yellow cat eyes casually stare back at you, as she grins at you, barely exposing a pair of fangs. Its as though a demoness adorned styled herself an Egyptian goddess. She runs her long fingers through her ebony hair and takes a step toward you, pulling you out of your reverie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like what you see, mortal?\" she asks you playfully, continuing to stretch provocatively. Whether by magic or her feminine wiles, you find yourself unable to look away, captivated by her form. \"You should, I'm quite beautiful, even by demon standards. ...Ah, so fun making the succubi squirm in jealousy. Hehehe.\" She giggles girlishly, a coquettish laugh that draw you in... as you begin to realize your vulnerability. Here you are with what appears to be a powerful demon, in a room filled with restraints and instruments of torture, and here you are sitting on the floor. You scoot back unconsciously as she takes another step towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with you? Shall I reward you for freeing me from an eternity of boredom? Shall I feast upon you after being starved of my magics? Shall I make you my plaything, and amuse myself? Or maybe find a way to do all three?

Surely I deserve to take whatever I want now, no?\" she asks rhetorically, grinning down at you. You chew on your lower lip nervously and can only nod.

Your howls are renewed, your left side still tingles from the feel of phantom fingers, now roaming towards equally ticklish flesh. You twitch and buck, but if anything, it only seems to urge her onward, as she rides you like a bucking bronco. Your face red, you feel yourself lost to the sensations, as those nails wriggle between your lower ribs, claw at your side, and tortuously tease your quivering flesh. After what seems like an eternity, but could only have been a few minutes, the demoness stops her torments, as you lay beneath her, gasping and giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...ha....ha....hehehe...I'll do anything....*gasp*\" you beg, shamelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?

But there are so many rules governing how demons deal with mortals. It's so tiring. So we'll play a game, and we'll gamble. If I win, you will be my pet, for the rest of your life. Maybe longer, if I don't get tired of you. If I own you, I could do so many things to you...\" She licks her lips, and her eyes unfocus slightly. It sends a chill down your spine to think of what fantasy is entering her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I win? What would I get? Why should I agree to this?\" you ask her, mustering your courage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhmhm, on the off chance you win, then I shall serve you. For the rest of your short existence, I would do <i>anything</i> you desire. Even the possibility has its appeal, no?\" As she talks, she undulates once, seductively, over your body, almost but not quite touching. Despite yourself, you have to admit she has a point. The possibility of her serving you is almost irresistible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its not like you have a choice.\" the demoness tells you. \"I hold all the cards here, child. And I haven't even told you the game yet...\" Her hands move as she changes her hold on your wrists. Now, her right hand holds your right wrist above your head, leaving your left hand free. \"Now, your right underarm is all stretched out and vulnerable. You can guess what I'm going to do, right? I'm going to tickle and tease it until you can't stand it. But, this is a game, is it not? Your left hand is free, and just above it, in order to restrain your right arm, I must <i>stretch</i> out my own right arm, exposing my own right underarm. You are free to do what you will with it. If you protect yourself, or if I fall, the game ends. Simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this...\" you say, skeptically. Could you really defeat a demon in a contest of her own choosing? And with the stakes so high?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, its not your choice. You're free to sit there while I break you. But, in the spirit of fairness, don't you want to? Look at me, stretched taut and defenseless. All this tan, smooth skin at your fingertips. Don't you want revenge? Don't you want to tease me into a quivering mess? You have yet to touch this body...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, let us begin!\"</span></div></div>",

Even if you could resist her, the fact remains that she has you partially pinned down and has the advantage in both speed and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point in thinking it over any more. Reaching up with your right hand, you gently wiggle two fingers across her underarm. Instantly, she squeals and strains to lift her arm up, but she cannot move it far while also keeping your own wrist pinned. You run your fingertips back across her underarm, making her giggle sweetly. You find yourself captivated at such a sound. Her ticklish squeals are music to your ears, and you find yourself continuing to tease her underarm with a delicate touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeheeheeheeheeee! Yoohohu will lohohose, mortahahaaal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, ticklish feelings shoot up to your brain and you throw your head to the right, laughing. You quickly take note that her claws have started to dance around your own helpless underarm, and while you started off teasing she instead went full force. Those golden claws were not only effective at tearing your clothing like thin parchment, but also tormenting your skin with a skilled touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you stop your own attack on her, which proves to be a big mistake. With no distraction she savagely scratches and swirls her claws around your underarm. She starts around the edges, then spirals in towards the center, your laughter increasing as she goes. You once considered yourself blessed with having naturally hairless underarms, but now you're wishing you had some to potentially obstruct her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooohaaaahahahahahaaa! Staaahahahahaaap! Nnnggeeeheheheehahahaa!\" you plead through your laughter instinctively. She smiles cruelly down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shout 'mercy' and it'll all be over... and you'll be <i>mine</i>,\" she responds with a mischevious giggle. Although you're desperate for her to stop, your body is betraying your words. A bulge has formed in you pants, and though she is straddling your waist, all it would take is for her to sit back an inch to notice your arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the haze of hysteria you find the willpower to scribble your own fingers in her outstretched underarm. She shakes her head as peals of laughter pour out from her wide-open mouth, revealing her long fangs once more. Your tickling causes her wiggling claws to become more sloppy, giving you a tiny bit of respite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter from both of you mix in the air, fingers and claws feverishly attacking each other's underarms, desperate to gain the upperhand and win. It was starting to look like a stalemate, unless someone had an ace up their sleeve.</span></div></div>",

You lean in with your head, and before the demoness can react, plant a long, deliberate lick across her smooth, hairless underarm. Surprisingly, there's no awkward taste, no sense of sweat of odor. If anything, her body smells faintly of rich perfumes and oils. Images of rose petals float through your mind as your face presses against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the demoness shudder above you. As you look up at her face, you see her go wide eyed, her body freezing in surprise. Feeling a little hopeful, and thinking maybe you've stumbled onto something, you keep it up, placing a few more long, wide licks across her taut underarm. The demoness bursts into wild laughter, and you feel her hands quivering over her wrists.

You look over and blush slightly, noticing her barely covered breasts hanging pendulously over your face. Almost on instinct, you lean in and give a slow lick along the side her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction is instantaneous. The demoness's laughter ratchets up, her eyes shutting as she scrunches her beautiful face. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Nohahahohohohoho NOT TH-HEHEHEEHEHERE! Aaaahehahahahahahhehehehehehe!\" You feel her hands quiver again, as her body lowers a few inches. Unfortunately for her, this only pushes her breasts closer to you, as you continue to lick up and down their side. Her breasts are mesmerizing: soft yet firm, tanned and unbelievably smooth. Unable to help yourself, you start interspersing your licks with quick, ticklish kisses along her breasts. You're surprised when this suddenly drives her even wilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEehhehehehehehe NO KISSES-hehehehehehehehehehehe! I ca- I ca....\" the demoness sputters, babbling incoherantly through girlish giggles. Encouraged, you plant more and more quick, tickly kisses across those seductive orbs. She sinks a little bit lower now, hanging no more than an inch above you. You can almost feel her skins against yours, and you feel an adrenaline rush from the very idea of her body pressed against yours, captive to the sensations you administer. Victory seems to be in your grasp...</span></div></div>",

Her face is scrunched up, her eyes are closed and she\u2019s deep in silent laughter. The slips of cloth covering her breasts slip a few centimeters. Seeing an opportunity, you pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes open in shock as you clamp your lips around her nipples and start laughing into them. \u201cNOO-AHAHAHAHA!\u201d Her shaking intensifies, but it doesn\u2019t affect you as you already have your lips firmly around her nipple. Her arm drops away from your hips so suddenly you almost release her nipple by surprise. You see that she\u2019s using her arm to hold her body off the floor, trying desperately not to fall. Elated, you decide to end this game once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring your hand up to her other breast, using your thumb and forefinger to capture and tease her nipple while your other fingers circle under her orb and tease the smooth skin where it meets her ribs.

You give her a smile, then you stick out your tongue and blow a raspberry directly over her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final tortured wail, she collapses onto you. For a second, all you can feel is her breast crushed against your face before she releases you and rolls onto the ground, her body curled into a ball and her arms wrapped protectively around her breasts.

Seeing an opportunity, you pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes open in shock as you clamp your lips around her nipples and start laughing into them. \u201cNOO-AHAHAHAHA!\u201d Her shaking intensifies, but it doesn\u2019t affect you as you already have your lips firmly around her nipple. Her arm drops away from your hips so suddenly you almost release her nipple by surprise. You see that she\u2019s using her arm to hold her body off the floor, trying desperately not to fall. Elated, you decide to end this game once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring your hand up to her other breast, using your thumb and forefinger to capture and tease her nipple while your other fingers circle under her orb and tease the smooth skin where it meets her ribs. You feel her legs around your hips and her grip on your wrist tighten as she looks down at you in shock, her wild eyes meeting your triumphant ones. You give her a smile, then you stick out your tongue and blow a raspberry directly over her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final tortured wail, she collapses onto you. For a second, all you can feel is her breast crushed against your face before she releases you and rolls onto the ground, her body curled into a ball and her arms wrapped protectively around her breasts. You both lay there for a minute before she gets up and slowly look at you, an angry glint in her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Each wriggle and pinch sends electric currents of ticklishness of your sides, filling your mind. You don't even try to contain the laughter that pours out of you.

Your limbs are tied to the corners of the bed by silky scarves, and looking down, you see you're barely wearing anything at all. Your breasts are covered by a skimpy, furry garment, the fuzziness of it threatening to tickle your breasts and underarms when you move. Your womanhood is protected by a loincloth held to your waist by a string of some sort. The lack of clothing leaves plenty of ticklish skin vulnerable for the demoness, including your terribly sensitive hips. But before you can even contemplate trying to get yourself free, the demoness enters the room, still wearing next to nothing. Apparently demons don't think much of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're finally awake, pet.\" The demoness says to you, sauntering up to the bed in a rather sensual manner. \"I've been looking forward to playing with you. Do you like your new clothes? The fur seems to be putting a smile on your face already...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to reply, but she's right. Every time you move, the fur rubs against your breasts and makes you want to giggle. The only remedy is to remain as still as possible, and you're sure she won't let you do that much longer. The demoness sits on your thighs, and looks down on you like a cat that's caught a mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These hips of yours were quite sensitive earlier, I'd love to get the chance to see just how much they effect you. I just love exploiting a weakness, you know.\" The demoness lowers one fingernail to your left hip and begins to drag it in slow circles over the skin. You do everything in your power to remain still, but it's obvious the effect its having on you. You gasp and suck in your belly to try to get your body away from her fingernail, but to no avail. She simply keeps twirling softly, the slow and teasing tickles just as bad as the torture she inflicted earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm going to draaag these nails all over your hips and your belly pet. I'm going to tease every last spot on that sensitive little body of yours. Kitchy kitchy coo, pet. I know this tickles, and I know you can't bear it any longer. Let me hear what I want... you have no choice, ticklish thing...\" the demoness taunts, knowing the effect her words had on you last time. This time is no different, as the last of your resistance melts away, a stream of giggles pouring from your lips. You can't help but squirm and twich under her, causing the furry garment over your breasts to tickle and stimulate you even more. The effect feels overwhelming, and you can barely focus on the demoness's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let go and cooperate, pet. I can see how much you like my touch. If you're good, I may even let you tickle me when it's all done. Wouldn't you like that? Don't you want to just give in?\" The demoness asks you, and you have to admit part of you wants to agree with her. To submit and be tickled like that... not even struggling, it may be easier. And the thought of being able to tickle the demoness later, even a little bit... Can you do it?</span></div></div>",

This isn't different from before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe teasingly stroked your poor right armpit with just two fingers, tantalizing each nerve.

If not, you better either learn very quickly or give up, this torment is only going to get worse...\" she was now stroking you with three fingers, and a stray hair would occasionally fall across and stroke your left underarm, and it happened a bit too often to be coincidence.

What she did next was tortuous beyond any tickling you'd felt before, you'd rather be flogged than see her lean in and feel her wet, warm tongue slither up and down your armpit, tickling each and every nerve along the way. Your arm was completely locked in place, her hand restraining your wrist and the two horns on her forehead holding your triceps, completely immobilized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet your body did not agree with your mind.

Do you?\" She said in a baby-ish voice, only adding to your humiliation at your ticklish suffering. You try to splutter out an answer but her fingers focus on the spot just below your navel, scratching at an ever faster rate, her nails forcing you into hard laughter from the constant touch and leaving you unable to form a coherent response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it seems as if it can't get much worse, the Demoness suddenly takes her little finger and starts wiggling it around in your navel, her finger almost blurring at the speed it moves at, scraping against all sides of your bellybutton without pause or mercy. Instantly, the sensations send you overboard, cackling and thrashing under the weight of the Demoness as she torments your sensitive navel \"OOOHOHOHHOAAGAGAAADDDSSSPPLELEHEEASSEEHESSTTHAHAAOOPPPPP!!!\" You cry out, tears running down your face from the assault, the tickling on your navel feeling like pure lightning going through your body \"II'LLLLLDOOHOHOOOAANNEEEHEHHEEYYTHINGAAHAHAAAAA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Demoness seems to stop, pulling her finger out of your navel as she smiles at you \"Anything? Well if you're serious I might just have one itty bitty favour to ask of you. Might be a little bit dangerous for a Human like you.\" She leaned over you, her breasts pressing against your chest as her beautiful face lit up in a predatory smile \"So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's consideration, you decide on...</span></div></div>",

Also, you found it hard to say no to much of anything as the demoness presses her bosom against your chest. You can't help but glance downward, until you notice the demoness leering at you. You blush and avert your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good human. You see, there was another demoness that put me in that thing. I'm hoping you'll take a little trip to the demon world and return the favor.\" As she talks, the demoness raises one hand from your chest. Flexing her fingers, a black leather collar suddenly materializes out of thin air. You seem to have freed a very powerful demon to be able to create objects without any incantation. It seems you have little choice to do what she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will send you to the demon world, and you will seek out a cat demon named Kala. You will know her by her snow white fur and sky blue eyes. You are to get close enough to her to place this collar around her neck. I need not remind you to be careful. Kala is very... playful. Make sure you do not become her toy, human.\" The demoness tells you, giving you a seemingly impossible mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... the demon world? They'll realize I'm human in a second! I won't stand a chance!\" you tell her, hoping she won't send you on a fool's mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness shakes her head at you. \"Do you think I had not thought of that? I will cast a spell that makes you look like a demon. Few will be able to see through the disguise. Kala will not notice until you are close enough to collar her. Once you do, she will become docile, and obey your commands. You will then return to me with your prize. She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... still, I'm not match for a demon! And I know nothing of the demon world! Isn't there anything you can tell me to help?\" You ask, realizing that if you are to go on this quest, you'll need to know as much as you can about where you are going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness sighs at you, but doesn't appear to be angry or displeased with you. \"Very well, human. I do want you to succeed. Now, Kala is athletic and energetic. It may be hard to get her to stand still. But, she does have a weak point. Her belly is quite sensitive, and you may be able to subdue her with... unconventional methods.\" As the demoness tells you this, one fingernail softly trails in a wide circle over your belly, making you quiver with barely suppressed laughter, leaving little doubt as to what those tactics were. Was the demon world so focused on tickling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should also be warned. Aside form other cat-demons, Kala has a pixie guard named Miza. She is little bigger than your hand, with black moth wings. An invisible layer of pixie dust coats her body, falling on her victims and making them more sensitive and giggly. Clever and mischievous, she prefers to probe their bodies for weak points and dust them before attacking her weakened opponents. She is too tiny to be attacked with fingers, but feathers are extremely effective. I know her well, she used to work for me... a long time ago. She is also powerful enough to see through your disguise. You must use caution. But there is a chance she may cooperate with you against Kala.\" The demoness tells you, giving you enough information, you hope, to survive in the demon world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness stands up and begins chanting an incantation. Suddenly, a portal opens in the room, and you feel your appearance changing. The demoness eyes you carefully. \"Now... will you take on this task, or must I continue where I left off?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And then of course are the silken scarves tied to your wrists and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're for this,\" the demoness explains.

Although you can't feel your skin burning the oppressive heat is taking its toll. There's no trace of moisture in your mouth. No water any- No-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happens in a dreamlike manner- one moment everything starts to blur and the next you're lying on the hard roasting rock.

You're certain it didn't exist a second ago but you're grateful for it anyway. Almost immediately you feel refreshed and revitalized, like submerging yourself in cool water. \"Better?\" You nod. \"Good.\" She look out onto the gods-forsaken landscape that she calls home. Then down at your half-naked body stretched over her legs. She smiles and you both know what's coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The worst heat of the day will be over shortly.\" She says with a click of her fingers. \"In the meantime...\" She trails off as your wrists bind themselves behind you head. You can only squirm in futile anticipation as she wriggles her long fingers in the air above your belly. Slowly she lowers one nail to your skin tracing a ticklish path over your midriff, making you squirm and giggle. She smiles smugly as you feel a teasing touch in your armpit from the hand supporting your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I'm glad you tried to run now pet.\" She coos. \"If you'd survived your ideal with Kala I'd be under obligation to let you go.\" The teasing of your belly stops and she conjures a fluffy black feather into existence. \"But now I can have my revenge and a new toy.\" The feather makes contact, the insanely soft touch upon your stomach causing you to burst into laughter. She glides the plume over your belly up and down your sides and into your underarms and there's nothing you can do but writhe and laugh at the ticklish sensations as she smiles down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coochie, coochie, coo my little tickle pet.\"</span></div></div>",

The demoness, your mistress now, must have enchanted it somehow to make it extra ticklish. That, or that refreshing drink she gave you made you much more sensitive. Either way, the effect was the same. The beautiful otherworldly demoness cradled you in her arm as she used the other to tease and tickle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ticklish here\u2026\" the demoness coos in a teasing voice, her eyes devouring your wriggling body. \"So wonderful. You will make an excellent pet. I can keep you young and beautiful for years beyond counting.

The smooth silky skin of her thighs beneath you is so luxurious, and being held in her arm like this is somehow very comforting. If your arms weren't tied above your head by those magic scarves, you'd be tempted to embrace her in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you feel her nail once again teasing your underarm from behind, causing you to buck and wriggle in her grasp. The demoness continues to softly whisper little teases into your ear. You can't even pay attention to the words anymore, but somehow they seem to still make you even more ticklish. With what remaining mental clarity you have, you wonder if her words are somehow magical as well, her teasing more than just play? Maybe you're feeling so ticklish right now because she's telling you exactly how ticklish you are, making it happen? In any case, the results are the same, the fluffy feather teasing your sensitized belly, an underarm gently scritched with an expert nail\u2026 it isn't long before you're overwhelmed from all the tickling and pass out from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep forgetting how fragile you are, mortal.\" The demoness chides you, the last thing you hear before the demon world fades away.

Nevertheless, with both your weapons drawn, you have no choice but to duel her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both charge forth, and in a clash of steel make several swings at each other. Miranda blocks one of your blows and sends a kick into your gut, knocking you backwards, but just as she swings to put out your eyes you duck and swing for her chest. She barely notices it in time, and leaps back, a bit put off by your strike. You both seam equally matched. You think to yourself something's got to happen, and as you do, it does. </span></div></div>",

You put your ear to her chest and hear a heartbeat, and feel glad you didn't have to kill her. Just when you're about to walk away though, you get an idea. She apparently knows a lot about the treasure here, compared to you knowing diddly. You could be marching forth into traps aplently, traps you could have known about if you had her info. But how to get it? You figured waiting until she woke up and asking her poiltly wouldn't work, you knew you wouldn't share information with someone who had done the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" You look around the room and see the shackles hanging on the wall. You almost shivered, torturing people was positively revolting in your book, which is when an old memory surfaced in your mind. You remembered the story of an Heiress to an old fortune, who was tickle tortured into reveiling the secret information on the fortune's location. The woman was left unscathed, and the thieves had they're treasure in the end, which sounded A-okay to you as long as you didn't have to really HURT anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that this could work, you drag Miranda to the shackles on the wall. You have to lift her up to get her wrists, as the shackles are fairly high off the ground, but once you do you snap the shackles shut, locking her wrists in place. You grin, and look around for anything else you could use. As you glance around the room you see the stocks, and think that if her hands are immoble, it would be foolish to leave her legs unbound. You wheel the wooden contraption over and open it up, lining it up with Miranda's body. You lift each of her legs up and place their ankles in the holes, and just before you close and lock the stocks, you figure it would be a good idea to remove her boots, as you've heard feet are particurally sensitive spots. You tug and pull, and eventually get one boot off, to find that this theif has very preaty feet, nicely shaped and you find her toenails have been colored black by some ink. After you admire her foot for a moment, you put it in place and remove her other boot, then put her other foot into place. Finally, you close the stocks and lock them tight, the only thing left to do is wait until she wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, you hear Miranda begin to stir and moan, starting to wake up. A smile overtakes you as you think that this could be a lot of fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaa...What the heck?!\" She shouts, fully come to and realizing her situation. She tugs at her bonds to no avail, before throwing a glare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised you're still alive?\" You ask with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you fool, I'm surprised I'm bound to a wall!\" she spits nastilly. You tut, shaking a finger at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such rudeness. You should know, I'm in control here.\" And without further ado, you take a finger and drag it along her the preaty sole of her foot. She jerks and giggles as you do so, trying to hold in her laughter. \"Now...\" You say, \"We can do this two ways. You can tell me everything you know about the treasure here, OR, I could force you to tell me where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll...Never get anything out of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong answer.\" </span></div></div>",

Now that you aren't focused on her weapon you have a chance to get a good look at her. Her black hair is straight and chin-length, with thick bangs that are cut evenly just above her eyes. You recall hearing that look called a \"cleopatra style.\" Her eyes are dark and almond-shaped, with skin that is quite tan. She has a dark-gray short-sleeved tunic underneath a black leather jerkin, and black trousers which are tucked into her calf-high high-heeled boots. A thick belt around her waist holds several large, empty burlap sacks; undoubtedly for holding whatever she finds in the ruins. Her sword is sheathed in a scabbard which rests on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see that you're as smart as you are good-looking,\" she says with a smirk. You feel your face growing hot with a blush, which causes her to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. a-anyway...\" you stammer to regain control of the situation. \"Where should we be checking first? The store rooms are undoubedly empty, so there's probably some goods stashed in the cells. Perhaps in the bedding or behind loose stones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's brows raise, obviously impressed. \"Rightfully so. We should go deeper to where the more dangerous inhabitants were kept. That's where thieves who stole more important items were kept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and shake your head. \"We should be checking the larger cells where they put people in temporarily. More prisoners mean more chances that someone left something behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda places her hands on her hips and says...</span></div></div>",

You begin to notice the air becoming still, and the temperature rising with each step. While this is little more than a casual observation for you, you notice Miranda starting to breathe heavier, her shoulders slumping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Miranda, are you alright?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its nothing! I'm just not used to this damned heat!\" She tells you as she takes of her leather jerkin and tosses it in a passing cell. \"Feh, my clothes aren't expensive.

That would explain her exotic appearance, and aversion to the heat.

Oh well, you think, it must not have been important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting pretty dark now, I wish we had a torch.\" you say, concerned at the pitch black on the path ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, once torch coming up.\" Miranda says, as she picks up a wooden pole in a nearby cell, breaking it in half. With a deft motion, she rips the lower third of her shirt and wraps it around the torch. Reaching into a sack on her belt, she pulls out a small canister and some flint. With a little dousing and a spark, she's created a very workable torch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very impressive...\" you tell her, grinning. Not only were you complimenting her handiness, but her ripped shirt now reveals her midriff, showing off a flat, athletic stomach in the flickering torchlight.

The dark-skinned beauty bursts into laughter immediately, not even trying to hold it in as she curses at you foully. Amused, you dig in deeper, not leaving the smallest part of her sensitive stomach unmolested. The chains rattle and ropes nearly thrum under her exertions, taut body working to the max to escape you. It's all for naught, and you grin down at her evilly as you skate your fingers all over her sculpted body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeeze to the hips here, to the sides here, and the ribs <i>here</i> -it all makes for one half-crazed burglar. You squeeze her ribs in rapid succession, hands working in tandem to move up the line, playing the tender pectorals like piano keys. To your amusement, the tone of her laughter rises in pitch with each rib so stimulated.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging tac, you burrow a finger into her stretched and inviting navel, worming deep, as the thief throws her pretty head back and screams in silent laughter. You patiently wriggle your finger back forth, eventually withdrawing your other hand from her ribs, using it to stretch the silken skin around her belly-button tight as you play. She stares down at her own belly with a look of frozen merriment and horror, than up at you, then whips her head from side to side in a frenzy as you carry on tormenting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carry on and on, savoring every little chortle and giggle from your helpless accomplice, but eventually switch to a new spot. Her underarms -to your fascination, paler than most of the rest of her dark body- have been crying out for attention the whole time, and now you introduce them to your fingers at long last. You press in hard, scratching away happily in the creamy hollows, perfectly stretched and exposed to your merciless ministrations by the rack's ingenious design.  She bucks and writhes, just as usual, but over time, you begin to notice something curious. At every down-stroke, as your fingers gently graze against the sides of her firm and inviting breasts, Miranda lets out a small moan, different entirely from her previous angry huffs and invective sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith interests, you gradually shift your fingers downwards, until all of your digits tease and feel over her impressive bared bust. Miranda's moans grow ever louder- a far cry from her earlier curses and unpleasant promises. You play with  her breasts, hearing her giggle even through her odd mewling moans of pleasure, tweaking her nipples just so to produce a squeak of renewed laughter. Her eyes roll back in her skull with every touch now, hair plastered damply to her head from her continued exertions. Without warning, you break off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pants for a few moments, then...<br>\r\n\"Hah-hah.. Wait.. Ha ha.. Please... Don't... Stop.. hah-hah...\" </span></div></div>",

While you were tickling her in order to 'teach her a lesson' about her haughty attitude, now it's gone in an entirely different direction. Her nude body, pulled taut by the trap's restraints, glows in the faint torchlight from a light sheen of sweat. Her firm, muscular midriff heaves with heavy breathing broken by lingering giggles from the earlier tickling, as if phantom fingers still stroked her in tender places. Her stomach is smooth when she relaxes, but when she flinches and tenses, you can make out the subtle outlines of her abs. Farther up, your eyes again glance over the unusual paleness of her underarms, the smooth hairless surface standing out in contrast to her otherwise dark complexion. You also can't notice her firm breasts heaving with each breath, arches forward as if begging for your touch. Her eyes also look at you with a pleading look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop?\" you ask, a bit teasingly. \"Just a few minutes ago you were practically ordering me to stop. Why the change of heart?\" As you talk, you bring one finger from each hand up to those pale underarms, and begin gently stroking up and down. Miranda immediately snickers, but you can also see a pouting look, as if this was good, but not quite what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe- no! D-don't make me -ehehehe- make me say ihihihit!\" she pleads rather meekly. While you are tempted to drag out her frustration, you have to admit that her arousal is rather intoxicating in its own right. Miranda is an incredibly beautiful woman: exotic, fit, and writhing in her bonds like a succubus in heat. Wanting to see and hear more, your fingers trace around the perimeter of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour actions are rewarded with an eager moan from Miranda. \"P-please!\" she mewls breathily. \"More!\"  At this point, you can't refuse her. The way she reacts to each caress and tickle are beyond alluring. Getting caught up in her lustful haze, you lean down to kiss and lick at one of those tempting nipples. At the wet contact, Miranda sighs and moans, thrusting her chest into your lips. Your other hand wanders across her other breast in light strokes, making her giggle amidst her more lustful noises. Then that hand makes its way to that pale underarm, stroking lightly but teasingly. Miranda's face shows her at war with herself, giggling and gasping as sensuality and ticklishness mix in an overwhelming sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miranda's bare hips buck from what you're doing above, you can't help but notice them, and her own arousal. Not wanting to deny her when she's become so obviously needy, you bring your other hand down to tease at her womanhood. Miranda shrieks and breaks out into a fit of laughter as you tickle her damp mound, thrusting her body needily. Still tickling an underarm with one hand and suckling at her breasts, you stroke and stimulate her womanhood, quickly bringing her to a height of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, she gasps, her entire body tensing, as the ticklish orgasm finally erupts from her body. Her squeals, moans, and giggles now grow silent as all sound catches in her throat. You can't help but be envious at the sensations you've apparently brought out of her. And her undulating, enraptured form is sensual in the extreme. It's enough to take your breath away as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Miranda begins to regain her wits as you finally pull away. Looking disheveled but extremely satisfied, her earlier haughty countenance appears to have been replaced by a meek and sensual attachment. While this situation spiraled far beyond your original intent,  the two of you seem to have bonded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda finally speaks. \"Y-you should probably untie me.\" she says softly, no longer using any commanding tones. \"We should search those deeper cells, and we'll need to start looking for a safe place to rest for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a point, you did come down here for a reason. You look about the dimly lit room and see some of Miranda's clothing. Her trousers and boots are in one piece, but the rest of it is in rags. What's left of her shirt will barely cover her breasts, and is now completely sleeveless. But it will have to do. You begin to release Miranda from her bonds, contemplating your next move.</span></div></div>",

You shake your head to clear your mind, its not something you should dwell on at the moment, you needed to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Miranda, let's look at those cells.\" you say, and she nods in the torchlight, following right behind you. Her change in demeanor surprises you, as if you flipped a switch of some kind inside her. But she other than fatigue and a bit of shakiness, she still seems able. Her dark eyes dart to and fro in the corridor the two of you enter, on the lookout for any more traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cells should be just one floor down\" Miranda tells you quietly. \"I'll search the ones on the left, and you can take the right. Ah\u2026 if it pleases you.\" You notice the vestiges of her alpha personality there, muted by the delayed polite deferral, her eyes cast downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that sounds like a plan\" you agree, seeing no reason not to. You notice her grin sheepily at your assent, and she nods. The two of you descend another staircase, and emerge into a wide hall with barred doors on either side. These were where the most dangerous criminals of Dormduo were kept. Or at least, that's what they say. You honestly have no idea what criteria were used to determine who were the deserving of such punishment in Dormduo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make eye contact with Miranda, and with a shared look you each take a side to search the cells. To your disappointment, most of the cells, at least on your side, seem to still be locked. But then you hear a grunt from Miranda and the sound of metal on metal. Turning around, you see Miranda pulling the barred gate to a cell right off its hinges. \"Gods Miranda, how strong are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda turns and a wide grin spreads across her face. \"Heh. Pretty strong, I'd say.\" Her face turns more serious. \"But the hinges have rusted. We can't pick the locks, but a bit of force should pull the doors right off.\" You nod and try it on the first locked door on your side. It takes more than a few tugs, and you really need to exert yourself, but you finally manage to yank the rusty door off. The force of your pull sends you to the floor, falling on your rear as the door clangs next to you. Before you realize it, Miranda is at your side, grabbing your elbow to help you up and looking at you with a concerned look. \"Are you hurt? Do you want me to do the doors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour surprised by the tender display from the thief, and try to ease her concerns. \"No, no. Just pulled too hard, I'm fine. Really!\" Miranda nods, but you see her keep glancing at you out of the corner of her eye as you go back to it. You've learned that Miranda is a lot stronger than you are, but thankfully seems to be concerned for your well being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the first cell, and find little. The second and third are the same. Despite the doors being locked, you don't find the remains of any prisoners. No skeletons, nothing. While you're relieved to not have to deal with human remains, and be reminded of the worst parts of scavenging, it strikes you as very odd. The stories say Dormduo was capriciously governed, with the wanton oligarchy sentencing people for arbitrary offenses, and using the threat of punishment for personal gain. They also say Dormduo was destroyed suddenly in something disastrously magical. So where did the prisoners go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backtrack through your cells to try to find some clues and assuage your thoughts. Each cell contains some old straw bedding and a small wooden table. At the back of each are chains and shackles to put prisoners on the wall. You sift through the bedding in the first room. Underneath the straw you find clothing. Women's garments, and still brightly colored. They're fine silk of a bright scarlet color and gold trim, and look quite expensive. The only mitigating factor to the expensive clothing is that there isn't much to it. The top barely is a small sleeveless thing with a plunging neckline that barely covers the chest, and stops just below it to cover nothing else. The bottom is a short skirt that similarly leaves little to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, you stick both of them in your pouch. To your surprise, a similar search in the next few cells reveals the same thing: underneath the bedding are skimpy silk garments. In the second, black silk with silver trim; the third a deep blue\u2026 its very odd. You take them all, the silk takes up little space and looks like it'll fetch a nice price. But it makes you even more curious about what went on here. Did a nobleman imprison his entire harem? It certainly would be odd prison attire.</span></div></div>",

You find her at the end of her row of cells, each door pulled off its hinges and placed in a pile on the floor. While you had been introspective and doubled back, she had been singularly dedicated to the task. But as you come up to her, something does surprise you: Miranda is wearing the same kind of silk clothes you'd been finding in your cells and pocketing. This variant was jet black, with golden trim on its edges. She turns to you and catches your curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clothing is worthless now.\" Miranda responds to the obvious question. \"This is much more valuable, I might as well wear one of them out and have less to store. Besides, its actually quite comfortable.\" Well, it certainly makes her easy on the eyes. The top clings to her chest tightly, with a gold-rimmed 'V' helpfully guiding your eye to her distracting cleavage. The skirt exposes her smooth, tanned thighs, and between the two pieces you can see the entirety of her firm, and now you know quite sensitive, midriff. The black silk compliments her black hair and dark eyes, and the gold trim offsets her tanned skin quite nicely. It actually fits her very well, and you find yourself staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy it pleases you.\" She says, now looking a bit sheepish again. The comment pulls you out of your reverie, and she also pulls herself up to continue. \"I've finished my search. There's nothing in these cells but expensive silks. I expected them to either be empty or full of mummified corpses with jewels in their pockets. But these don't make much sense. Still, easy to carry and seems to be worth a pretty penny.\" You nod, and tell her your search turned up the same, and how you also found it odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place should have thieves and political prisoners.\" Miranda says pensively. \"It makes me wonder if we're even in the right place.\" Her thinking aloud is stopped short by a yawn she fails to stifle, and you notice her arms quiver slightly. After your earlier\u2026 fun, and opening all these doors, you don't blame Miranda for being exhausted. You've been in Dormduo for hours, and the air here is rather stale. You realize that since coming down to these cells you've started to get rather sleepy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should rest for the night.\" You say decisively. \"We can figure it out tomorrow morning. Considering no one else has found these silks, we're probably the only ones to have made it down here. I doubt we have to worry about being stumbled upon.\" Miranda nods, although you think you still see a look of concern. \"And if we're not moving around, we won't trigger any more booby traps.\" That seems to relax her a bit, and she nods. The two of you gather straw from the rooms to make a pile of it in the center of the room. While it might be easier just to sleep on it in a cell, you don't want to spent any more time inside a cell than you have to, ancient or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you make a large pile of straw. The amount and thickness will make it more comfortable than what any of the prisoners had. It's old and musty, but you unfurl a small blanket from your supplies and lay it on your section of the straw. Miranda, apparently traveling lighter than, doesn't seem to have the luxury. She looks down at your blanket longingly, and you realize that the straw would be rather itchy on all that exposed skin she has now. Sighing, you tell her \"Alright, Miranda, we can share the blanket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, and you roll over to make room on the small blanket for her. However, you're surprised when she cozies up to you, pressing her body against your back and spooning you from behind. An arm wraps around yours and over your chest in an embrace. But before you can say anything in protest, you notice Miranda's breathing become slow and regular. Either she had been far more tired than she was letting on, or she had the uncanny knack to fall asleep instantly. Either way, you decide not to wake her and resign yourself to the warm hug. Besides, it was actually quite pleasant. Miranda was beautiful, her bare skin there against the garments on your back, the soft silks cupping her chest alluringly\u2026 you shake your head to stop thinking about such things, and try to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep comes to you quicker than you suspect. Either from the poor air or the exertion from earlier, you feel yourself falling into a deep slumber. However, it is not a dreamless one. You find yourself standing in the center of a room. Not a dungeon, but what looks like a luxurious bedroom of some kind. You feel soft carpet under your bare feet, although the dream prevents you from wondering about why you aren't wearing your boots. Or if any other clothing is missing. From the other side of the room, you see a feminine figure walk towards you, clad in the silk harem garments. Even before you can make her out, something makes you realize that she is...</span></div></div>",

You realized with growing arousal, that if somebody were tied to the bed, they would be completely at your mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see something move out of the corner of your eye, and with a huge smile, you turn your head to face Miranda. Dressed up in the revealing black and gold harem outfit she was wearing, only without shoes on, she approached you with a seductive grin on her face. When she reached you, she pulled you in for a kiss that should have been illegal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled away, showing off your silly grin at the kiss you just received, she walked over to the wall to grab some silk rope, practically stalked back to you, and then grabbed your hand and started pulling you toward the bed. Not being a complete idiot, you quickly followed. As soon as you reached the bed, you kissed again, and then grinning impishly, you quickly tied her down so she couldn't stop you in the slightest.

Your easy entrance was doubtless provided by the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you follow down narrowing stairs and tightening passageways, you reach a point where the ashlars are lost beneath daubed plaster and the venerative shorthand of the pious.

Three passages are arranged before you in a semicircle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your left, the way forward is so heavily choked with cobwebs that you nearly dismiss that path as folly. Thinking twice, you realize it confirms that none have passed that way in some time, which may mean there are valuable items farther along, waiting to be claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe central passage seems even less promising, the masonry chipped and fractured from floor to ceiling.

Soon your legs are completely immobilized in a cocoon of silk, you reach down and give the silk a good tug.  It's unyielding as steel cables and you nod impressed by Phoebe's handiwork.  \"Like it?\" Phoebe asks as she removes your boots exposing your smooth tender soles to the cold flagstones of the catacomb floor.  \"Actually yes i do enjoy being tied up.\"  You confess sheepishly with blush creeping into your cheeks.  \"Then i bet you'll love this!\"  Phoebe said as she finished tying your hands behind your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now fully at the mercy of a tickle crazy spider girl, but strangely you were excited at the prospect of being tickled by Phoebe.  She then stood before you, \"are you ready now?\" She asked licking her lips hungrily.  You nod and she grabs you by your legs and flips you upside down, she then loops the excess silk strand through an iron ring set in the wall so your incredibly sensitive bare feet were chest level with her.  She slowly traced one finger down your right sole eliciting an excited gasp from you, this seems to excite her as well because she then repeats the process on your left sole eliciting yet another of your excited gasps.  All of a sudden she throws caution to the wind and wildly dances all ten of her fingers up and down your soles sending you into fits of hysterical laughter.  Next she digs her nails in between your toes which sends your laughter up even higher than before.  You wriggle and struggle at your bonds but strangely you don't want the tickling to stop, she then slowly creepy crawls her fingers from the balls of your feet down the arches and right to your heels.  now everyone has their Achilles heel your's just happens to be your actual heel.  Now you thrash and flail and scream your head off as she works your heels over good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all this thrashing, laughing, and being tied upside down you're starting to feel really light headed, it doesn't help when Phoebe licks your foot from heel to big toe.  she drags her tongue over your arch coating your already sensitive feet in her saliva which makes the sensation even more insane.  This continues for another hour untill you finally pass out.  when you awaken you find that...   <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

She's standing directly over you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYards and yards of webbing pour out from a small hole behind her, and her legs quickly grab it and begin to weave it around you. You try to sit up, but in one pass it's already wrapped around your chest, forcing your arms ot your sides. With each revolution of her lightning-fast legs, the webbing is wrapped around more and more of you, covering you in a layer of white that extends from your shoulders down to your ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what feels like mere seconds, you're stuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly adventurers. You always look ahead, but never up or down,\" Phoebe says with a chuckle. She steps back and peers down at you.

Her blue eyes slowly gaze down your body while she licks her lips with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reaches the bottom of you, she suddenly reaches down and grabs your boots with her hands. With a firm tug she yanks both of them off and tosses them aside. Your bare toes wiggle in the cool air. \"You won't be needing these anymore,\" she comments before dragging one finger up your sole. A startled giggle bubbles forth before you manage to clamp your lips shut and regain your composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs and clasps her hands together. \"Oh my! You're going to be so much fun!

A long strand of thick webbing is produced, and she wraps end around your ankles before reaching up to slide it through a ring of stone that extends from the ceiling. Her powerful arms tug, and it acts as a pulley, lifting you up into the air. It isn't until your head is a foot off the ground that she pauses to wrap the end of the excess webbing around your ankles, leaving you dangling upside down and facing her. Your head is about the same level as the bottom of her spider-bdoy, but when you peer up, you realize your feet are at her chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my,\" she says, peering down at your vulnerable soles. \"I can't say I've met a human who takes care of their feet as much as you. And these toes... so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe leans in, and her painted-blue lips plant a delicate kiss upon one of your big toes. You take a short breath in, caught offguard at how such a simple action sent a tinge of pleasure through your body. She gently kisses your other big toe, and it instinctively gives a little twitch as your eyes close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that proves to be a mistake. With your guard down, you're caught completely unprepared by the feeling of ten sharp nails scratching over your left arch. Your eyes snap wide open, along with your mouth, and you burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't think I was going to be nice for long, did you? I still have to punish you for coming here! Now... tickle tickle tickle...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a worm on a hook, you thrash around as you howl with laughter. Your only means of defense are to wiggle your feet. You try to cross your soles, shielding one with the other, but Phoebe merely lets her fingers spider-tickle (no pun intended) along the sides of your fully-exposed foot. You cannot hold still for more than a few seconds, and your feet flail around, exposing both once again to the onslaught of her nails.</span></div></div>",

You were practically asking for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a pair of beautiful human feet like these! Since you were foolish enough to come here, I\u2019m keeping yours!\u201d Phoebe managed to remark with a casual giggle.

A sudden breathe roll down your soles as your eyes pop open. You squeal and let a case of laughter explode from you lips. She nibbled on the left heel! Cheater! You wiggle your toes madly losing the little defense you have. Sticky threads were wrapped around all ten toes. Phoebe began to tightened them expertly. She took more thread holding the already stuck toes. Every touch on your toes made you laugh and shake in your bonds. Your toes were at her mercy as she purposely scratch and tie them in the thread. They were stuck onto the surrounding walls of cave as she clapped her hands in her works. Your two big toes couldn't budge along with the other eight toes struggling to quench, wiggle, or even curl. The thread was strong and dried. You moan in the toe ties she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute toes can't stop me now...

It's not long before you realize you're still a captive; you are sitting up, legs extended out, and wrists bound together and held up by string, exposing your armpits. Armpits? Oh yes; you seem to be without any clothes now. You try to squirm away, but your legs are just as helpless. Your bare feet are both locked in what seems to be a set of stocks, and tied at the ankle with Pheobe's silk string. Your toes are just as helpless as before, strung up and tied tightly, spread out so her nails could tickle any spot she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...my newest treasure awakens!\" You hear Pheobe's cheery voice as she climbs down from the ceiling, where she likely has a web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Treasure? Wait...\" you begin, but Pheobe eagerly jumps in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right darling; you humans are so very greedy and little old me so very lonely,\" she begins, her face looking just a little bit sad. But as she starts the next part, her grin returns. \"So, naturally I wanted company to pass the time, but no one ever comes to visit! So, one day I managed to get a rumor of a Dormduo Treasure and like magic you curious humans with your beautiful feet showed up! I'll never understand why your kind think so ill of them sometimes. Nevertheless, humans started to come over to play, and now my treasure is real! And you're the newest gem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the realization hits you. You manage to turn your head around a bit and see behind you several other men and women, all also completely bare and bound tight by Pheobe's string. Most of them look unconcious, but others are awake, trying in vain to break their bindings. The treasure...a harem of bound playthings for a spider-woman?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to feel tricked,\" Pheobe says, coming close to your face. \"We're still going to have lots of fun together. And I'll eventually let you go,\" she adds with a creepy smile. \" I'll even give you a choice. You can have your fun with me alone and get some of your time down quicker now, or you can have that pretty girl over there who's trying to escape join you in our ticklish fun!\" At that, Pheobe dashes over to said woman, who had been furiously trying to scrape the silky strands off of her wrists. She'd have better luck grinding down steel manacles. Pheobe picks her up and you get a good look at her. Auburn hair with pale skin. She started mumbling angrilly as opposed to shouting, because she had been gagged, and Pheobe hungrilly looks over her catch. \"She's a pretty one too, huh? And her feet are perhaps even more ticklish than yours!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weigh the option in your mind for a moment. If you go alone, she might tire of you faster. But if you have the girl in question join you, Pheobe might spend more time tickling this other girl and less time tickling YOU. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Especially one that seems to be some kind of minor deity and may or may not have been what caused the destruction of Dormduo castle. But having come this far, you don't seem to have a lot of options. Dominy, the ninth something of something is only seconds away from you, her four arms slayed wide to block any chance to get past her and widen her area of potential attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing your torch, the only weapon available to you. With the torches magically lit along the walls, your own is now little better to you than a fiery club. If you had time, the short sword in your pack would have been much better, but it was no use now. You swing your torch, vainly hoping her weak to fire and heat, but it's futile. A lower hand bats your torch away and sends it clattering to the stone floor. Her upper hands reach out to you, meeting your own hands as the two of you grapple. It takes all your strength to keep your ground, but you manage to hold your own. Both your hands are intertwined in hers, equally locked. However, you suspect she is merely playing with you. Her lower hands hang in the air, not attacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at each other in the torchlight. The flickering light glows against her golden body as you look up at her, she down at you. It's easy to see why you thought her one a gold statue earlier, her body looks as if it were flawlessly carved. Your eyes dart over long, smooth legs, the curves of her hips, taut stomach, and full bare breasts right at your eye level. You force yourself not to become distracted by then, even for more than an instant, despite their allure. You concentrate on her face, golden with golden hair. The stalemate makes you increasingly unnerved, and you can no longer maintain the expectant silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't care if I took some of the treasure!\" you cry, feeling duped and ashamed for trusting the word of such a strange being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" Dominy tells you simply, \"but there is something that I want from you, human.\" Her eyes appear eager for some reason, as if she's holding back some juicy secret. Her lower arms continue to hang in the air as unused weapons that could easily end this stalemate. Baffled, you have little choice but to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, want do you want from me, creature?\" you say, trying to come across as braver than you actually feel. Quite the opposite, it seems as if you're at the mercy of this Dominy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been so long since a human has come here, and I find them fascinating creatures...\" As she speaks, your sense of worry only worsens. Her lower hands finally reach up to your waist and begin loosening your belt. Your trousers sink over your hips, but thankfully she doesn't loosen them enough to make them fall. However, you can't understand why this is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My favorite thing about humans is that they have a very curious condition\u2026\" With a quick motion, one of her lower hands grabs your shirt and tears, ripping the fabric clean off below your ribs, your midriff now exposed to the warm air of the fire-lit cavern. \"I believe it is called\u2026 ticklish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you realize what she is planning. Her lower hands begin to slowly wander up and down your sides. You stifle a gasp, willing away a grin and a twitch. Dominy grins at you, \"I am going to enjoy sharing this ticklish thing with you.\"</span></div></div>",

But they got this reputation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs best you could piece together, the Magis' (you'd thought \"magi\" was the accepted plural, but had suffered furious correction on the point) typical behavior involved kidnapping young people each new moon from the weedy villages surrounding the former Dormduo and sacrificing them to some unspeakable Moloch deep under the blasted earth. Excepting, of course, that the young people always returned none the worse for wear and admitted no memory of their abduction.

You try to clap your hands to the sides of your head, but the levitating girls grasp your wrists and keep whispering directly into your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start giggling, unable to help yourself. It tickles like mad. Occasionally, their whispering lips brush against your ears, which is even worse. You'd like to snap your head about and skull-smack these two, but some magical effect holds you steady. You're also losing contact with the floor, beginning to float with your whispering captors.

Uninhibited by your clothing, the soft but unrelenting feeling tickles like mad, driving you to incessant giggles. Desperately trying to get a word in edgewise, the giggling prevents you from saying a thing, as a pair of lips flutters in each ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't make out a word their saying. You can't even tell if its a language, or just some kind of magic muttering. But as they continue to float along the passage, the whispering seems to form concepts in your mind. \"You're very sensitive,\" the thoughts echo in your brain, \"and very ticklish. Even the softest of touches on your belly drives you wild. A feather over your hips is more than you can bear. Even your back shudders from the ticklish sensation. Yet you do not resist, can not resist. Relax, and let yourself succumb to our whispers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to fight it, to shake your head, but find you can do neither. Your body relaxes in their grip, passively accepting the ticklish feeling rolling over your body in waves. While this light, feathery tickling normally wouldn't affect you so, something in their trickery is making you more sensitive than you've ever felt before. Were the floating girls to use their fingers or the mouths, you'd don't know if you could handle it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wonder, you feel each girl momentarily stop their chanting to place a light kiss over your ears, before resuming their spell. Could they have been reading your mind? How could you hope to best such magic? Then again, all you can do at the moment is giggle and stare ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passage begins to open, as you are brought out into a wide cavern.

Her face smiling beautifully as the wings run over her sides, from underarms to hips and thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what kind of cult would have a ticklish goddess. And why are you being placed in front of it? This doesn't bode well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two women release you. Their chant changes, and suddenly you feel yourself rising, your arms reaching upward and back arching, imitating the ticklish goddess. No, definitely not good! The phantom tickles subside, but not completely. You manage to stop giggling, but just barely. Your mouth clamps shut for fear of bursting into irrepressible laughter. Its all you can do to watch their plan unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA figure in a bright red cloak steps forward, stopping a short distance in front of you. In a quick gesture, she throws the cloak off, revealing a pale yet beautiful woman, covered in strange tattoos and nothing more. She stares at you, like a cat watching its prey/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she speaks to you: \"There is something in every woman which demands complete dominance...\"</span></div></div>",

The breathless captive wears only a strange ceremonial shawl over his shoulders and mystical runes have been painted over his entire naked body with dizzying complexity. His bare feet seem to glow as they clench and fidget wildly. He is followed by a train of the cerulean garbed cultists carrying a long, deep, intricately carved stone container. The air is thick with the susurrous chanting of the magis and you flinch and shiver reflexively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best to look like you're floating and the passing cultists seem to ignore you.

A single <i>brick </i>of that ornate wall could ransom a king or queen. You could scarcely imagine the treasures locked within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after talking to some friendly locals, you learned that a sect of reclusive wizards called the tower their home. Wizards, as was your experience, were often anti-social hermits, usually more concerned with reagents and alchemy than amassing treasure. Clearly, these were no ordinary magic-users.

Although you could try and slip past their guards through their exterior garden, you wondered about another approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA charismatic outsider like yourself could leverage a deal with the secluded sect \u2013 perhaps as their ambassador to faraway lands.

You were certain that the wizards already knew you were coming - their divining magics were likely watching every move you made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suspicions were confirmed as the ornate gate began to open inwards, even before you had reached it! The darkness behind the doors contrasted with the bright sunlight streaming in. But even as you slowed your pace, you could sense a tingle of magic in the air. Doubts about this whole scheme were growing large in your mind... if these magic users were truly as powerful as the locals said, maybe you should back off while you still could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, wanderer,\" said a strangely harmonic voice from within the darkness. You thought it was feminine, yet an odd resonance to the words gave you pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, greetings, Mighty Wizard...\" you replied to the unseen speaker. \"I would like to propose-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An alliance?\" replied the voice, a hint of a giggle behind it. \"A deal? A pact?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to squint into the darkness, but you could still see nothing. \"Yes... something like that, anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was silent, as if deep in thought. Moments passed, and yet you remained still, fearing the worst. Perhaps their divining magics had already revealed your true intentions? Perhaps these wizards were discussing how best to dispose of you? These and other fears pervaded your thoughts as you stood in front of the ornate structure. A tiny voice in your mind was screaming at you to run, but the promise of riches was too powerful to ignore now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter, wanderer,\" the voice finally said, as if sensing your growing apprehension. \"We shall discuss the matter within our protected walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled happily at the darkness, relieved that you hadn't yet been roasted by a fireball. You took one last look at the sunlight before you entered the Enchanted Tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin it you find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last bits of light from outside vanished, as the mighty gateway slammed shut and sealed you inside the wizard's domain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we could reach this agreement!\" you shouted to the blackness. Despite the high walls around you, your voice did not echo. The dark swallowed up your words, as if feeding on your very voice. The tingle of magic in the air was unmistakable. It was far stronger than any power you had felt before; whatever magic these wizards had, it was unparalleled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I,\" whispered a voice from somewhere in the gloom. It held a decidedly sinister tone, and instantly regret began pooling in your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, let's begin discussing the terms,\" you said, trying to mask your immense fear. At this point, your terms would simply involve getting out of this tower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice - or was it the darkness? - merely laughed at you. \"Terms? Pray tell, wanderer, what could you offer a goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to emphasize its point, the floor began to rumble.

You realized how utterly pathetic your voice sounded, even as your words were swallowed by the inky black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was quaking now, and you struggled to keep your balance. With nothing to hold on to, you lurched and stumbled in wild directions, hoping that there would be something to grab onto. But all was darkness: and you were at its mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to reveal what no mortal dare gaze upon,\" spoke the 'goddess', her words pounding into your skull.

It advanced forward, and you readied yourself for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over the top?\" giggled the figure. The voice was definitely a young female's, and was no longer ominous. It sounded almost... playful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted at the 'goddess', trying to make some sense of what you were seeing.

In your vulnerable state, however, you suspected they were not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the figure giggled. \"Sorry, I just love theatrics! Pretty scary, huh?\" There was a certain adolescent tone beneath the words. \"I love to see the faces of you peasants when you start trembling.\" She seemed to be starting intently at you, but you could only see a vague outline of a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no peasant, Miss,\" you angrily replied, sensing that this woman was playing you for a fool. \"I'm here on serious business. If you want to form an alliance, then let's talk business. If not, then I'll be leaving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure chuckled at your ultimatum.

The figure looked at you for a moment, and then stepped forward. She was, in a word, beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was as long as it was silky, white gold and shimmering even in the dark. Her skin was white as the moon, and she wore a heavenly white robe the likes of which a priestess would wear, with billowing sleeves. She was barefoot, her nails somehow painted a gentle green on both her toes and her fingers, which contrasted well with her unearthly yet exquisite eyes. If she wasn't smirking, you honestly would not have been surprised had she told you she was divine. It was clear to you now, however, she was in fact very powerful. She made no sound when her feet touched the floor- a small thing that took much power to actually do. The area around you, and the darkness itself, were now clearly linked to her- she could control the senses, and create blankets of darkness that blinded and deafened. She giggled at you sweetly, kneeling down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you did come to worship me! Cute! I don't mind. You don't have to pass a test to become a follower of Bianca.\" She said. You looked at her in confusion, until you realized with a start you WERE bowing down to her. You must have done it without thinking while looking her over. \"In case you're wondering, though, I do not say what the trials are until one attempts them.\" Bianca explained, referring to your earlier question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't really think of anymore questions, so you...</span></div></div>",

The long and short of it is that the Temple of Silence was once the Temple of Mirth, built on the site of an ancient evil temple destroyed in a great battle in the days of Old Forazio.

Come, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks with you down a stone corridor lighted by torches, to the left, forward, then down a thin stairway. You both reach a heavy wooden door with no windows or bars, but several locks. The monk fumbles in his robes and withdraws an iron key ring, with several brass keys. Swiftly, he opens each lock and pulls the door ajar. Inside is very black, and impossible to see. You stand in the doorway and peer in, but your eyes have not adjusted to the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you will find some of the other adventurers. Some came last week.\" says the monk.

Etched on to it are two twisting feathers which form a yin-yang sort of look, but what interests you more are the dozens of tiny diamonds that sparkle on the amulet like stars at midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know whether to fence this or wear it,\" you quietly say to yourself, grinning. It'd surely fetch a great price, but there was also this urge to try it on.</span></div></div>",

Rather, <u>it</u> has taken <i>you</i>!  You can\u2019t sell one of these in New Forazio, and you can never be free of it until the Festival of the Fountains, which is held at the Palace of Janux the High Pasha a mere two nights from now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But why ME?\u201d, you sputter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a great honor indeed!  You\u2019ll play an important role in the feasts and pageants commemorating the coming of Springtime!  Why, should you survive\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExasperated, you interrupt, \u201c<i>Should I survive</i>?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh! Hush!\u201d, and Grovtin listens intently, an ear towards the door to his shop, \u201cQuickly! Behind the counter!  They are already searching for you!\u201d, and it\u2019s then that you too hear the commotion in the alley outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swiftly dash behind the counter and down a trapdoor in the floor that Grovtin holds open for you, wondering all the while what exactly you\u2019re getting pulled into, and whether you\u2019ve made a single good move since arriving in the city, as you are plunged into total darkness, clinging only to the iron ladder at the top of a circular shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you hear the shop-door open above, and the muffled greeting of the old fencer Grovtin.  The muffled voice of the visitor is too low and sinister for you to hear, but it is obvious from long into their conversation that Grovtin is nervously backpedalling as he tells the guest loudly, \u201cOh, them!  Yes, of course!  I sent them on their way a good ten minutes ago.  I purchased this amusing trinket from them, for the orphans -- of course.  Ahem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear the visitor to the shop quite clearly, as if they are leaning over the counter, sniffing you out, \u201cYou had better not be lying to me about the Chosen of Murgoth, old swindler, or it will be my pleasure to devise any one of a number of hideous, unthinkable ends for you!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the door to the little shop slam shut, as the visibly shaken  Grovtin helps you out of your temporary hidey hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must leave here immediately, friend.  You are indeed one of the Chosen of Murgoth, and your fate is already aligned with the Festival!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m cursed to be at a palace full of feasting and fun?  Why again is it I am running <i>away</i> from this?\u201d, you inquire, a tad sarcastically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFew of the Chosen have ever survived the Ordeal of the Feathers, as the Amulet unerring points to those who are of a particularly sensitive nature, matched only by their excellent physical conditioning.  I must say, I would not have taken you for the later, as you look far too slender to endure the entire lengthy Ordeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of this nonsense.  How might I be rid of this cursed amulet, then?\u201d You question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can either try to leave the city and make a run for it, hoping not to be caught by the select Seekers such as Rondor, my last visitor, before the Festival commences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, you might try the Oracle of the Tombs, who it is said can provide an answer to every question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, You can try to stay moving for the next two days, hiding in the sprawling city, hoping the Seekers don\u2019t catch you.  Heaven help you should they catch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, be gone from here and all fortune to you, young thief.  You\u2019ll need it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlike the first, she is garbed in an extravagent emerald gown with wide hips, and a black corset on top. Her red hair is woven tightly into a bun. Both of her arms are still outstretched from the tickling she gave you. The only common trait between her and the other woman is their wide-eyed, neutral expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, the first woman begins walking towards you, and the second woman follows in suit.

As far as is seen, it appears to be a family owned business probably aimed at visitors and the needy.

It's night, and you can see the street lamps lit around the corner on a main boulevard. You pull yourself back into the shadows behind some sacks, trying to make sense of what happened to you hours before. You rub yourself defensively, the intense tickling still vivid in your mind, your skin still practically tingling from the memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" you say to yourself. \"Has the town gone mad?\" You think about what happened a step at a time. You put on the amulet, then suddenly some beggar woman began tickling you, then a rich woman, then finally five women in a shop. Was it the amulets fault? What is it's power? Somehow, putting the amulet on made everyone around you mad, wanting only to tickle you. Or maybe the effect is limited to women? And somehow the effect ends once you lose consciousness, the amulet falls off you somehow. You realize you need more information. You pocket the amulet carefully, wrapping it up in cloth and careful not to let it touch you as you walk out onto the street and consider your options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know someone in town you could talk to, a Forazian woman named Chella. She knows a little about enchanted things, and might be able to help explain what just happened to you. Knowing Chella, she'd be at the <i>Curious Crow</i>, a large decommissioned naval ship at the docks that now serves ale and lodgings instead of cannons and sails.

You're not sure you want to deal with her teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you could just try putting on the amulet again. There are fewer people out now, and you'd likely be able to handle them better. You could also take off the amulet at the first sign of trouble. If you can, that is.

You head to the docks, and the <i>Curious Crow</i>. The deck of the Crow is filled with outdoor tables, with a long bar running across the center. On a nice night like this, it's quite the location, and a number of tables are filled with patrons drinking and talking. Below decks are a number of rooms for simple lodgings, passed out drunks, and those seeking a more pleasurable endeavors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk around the deck, finally spotting Chella alone at a table along starboard. She's sipping a drink and reading over some manuscript, inattentive to the world around her. Her complexion is common for Forazians: dark raven hair and sky blue eyes along with a tanned skin fitting for this southern city. Her hair is cut short at the neck, and falls around her face as she pours over her writings. A small pair adorn the bridge of her nose, and it seems a wonder that they stay on at all, but you're pretty sure she couldn't see a thing without them. A loose cloak is wrapped around her, entirely unnecessary for a warm night like this, but you're fairly certain it's to hide her attractive figure from lustful men at the bar. Also because you know she doesn't like wearing much underneath, and has never cared for the fashion conventions of the city. You can only imagine what she is or <i>isn't</i> wearing underneath that cloak tonight. Some ridiculous fashion from a long dead exotic kingdom, you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chella\" you say to her, getting her to look up with a start. \"What's the fascinating papyrus tonight?\" you ask her as you sit down, getting a mug of the local brew to sip on. Chella looks up at you, grinning at you familiarly but with a bit of a smirk. She knows you only come to her when you want something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conjured silks of the Isle of Ja-o. I'm thinking of having some replicas made, although the silk wouldn't be magicked like it should. Not that I can figure out what they did it for, either. Not much is known about them, the island is completely deserted now. It actually sounds right up your alley, oh skilled adventurer. You should take me treasure hunting down there. All you need is a ship that can cross the southern sea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to reply, to change the topic to the amulet, but she does have a point.

Take a look at this...\" you tell her, getting the amulet out of your pocket, gesturing for her to be careful not to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, and just how did you get this?\" Chella asks you knowingly, pushing up her glasses to get a closer look. \"Hmm, I've never seen a gem like this before. The facets aren't cut in Forazian fashion, and it's not like in Coninze either... I have no idea where it's from!

Chella, as you suspected, finds your story extremely amusing, and by the time your finished, she's grinning ear to ear at you, much to your chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, so, my thief friend here can be foiled by a little tickling? Well, now I know how to persuade you to go along with my next scheme...\" she tells you, wiggling her fingers in a mock tickle. \"But I've never read about an amulet like this. There are some that control the mind of the wearer, like some kind of slave collar, but none that control everyone else's mind! This could be an incredible find!\" Chella forgets about her teasing for a moment, lost in the possibility of understanding the strange thing you've stolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have an idea about that. I want to try an experiment. We could go get a room below deck, and see what happens under more... controlled conditions.\" you tell her, and Chella nods enthusiastically, excited for the chance to see the magic in action. The two of you buy a room for the night and head below deck. You make sure to pick a fairly isolated room, so no one else might overhear hysterical laughter. The two of you enter the room, a fairly basic wooden chamber with a queen sized bed and little else. Still, it'll be more than sufficient for your purposes, as you lock the door to keep anyone else from entering and potentially falling under the amulet's spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, locking the door? I didn't know you fancied me that way!\" Chella jokes as she takes off her robe, hanging it on a hook on the wall. You look over at her and stare at her strange garb she was wearing underneath. Her top is a long sleeved, tight fitting black garment, sleeves down to her wrist. But unlike a shirt, it stops just below her bosom, clinging tightly to the underside of her breasts, and doing a marvelous job of accentuating them, despite being completely covered by the form fitting cloth. Her middle is completely bare, showing off a tanned stomach and alluring curves. Her bottom piece is little more than underwear, another tight fitting black cloth that hugs her hips and rear but does nothing to cover her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She says defensively, noticing your stare. \"This was what the Archons of the Hawan Empire wore five hundred years ago!\" She tells you, not that the information means anything to you. \"Anyway, let's get that amulet on you!\" She says, moving towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait! I was planning to have you put on the amulet, so I can see the effects on someone else!\" you tell her. \"I've already experienced the amulet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Me? I'd... rather not. I think you'd be much better for it. It already likes you!\" Chella says, nervously pushing her glasses up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only makes you grin at her. \"Oh, I thought you said a little tickling was silly? Seems like you're just as ticklish as I am, huh?\" You grin, glad to be able to tease her back for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I'm not even ticklish!\" She says, although the way she says it makes it hard to believe. \"That's why it need to be you!\" Chella wraps her arms around herself, and you notice her clothing would offer little protection against a determined tickler, if the amulet effects you. Still, maybe you should be nice and let her go. With her intellect and knowledge, she might be able to notice things you wouldn't. But do you really want to you through that again?

Besides, with as smart as you are, you'll probably have an idea of where it comes from by observing how I act when you put it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChella ponders this for a moment before sighing reluctantly. \"Okay, I'm trusting you on this. I'll put on the amulet. With any luck, something about your behavior will give it away.\" She then holds out her hand, and you put the amulet in her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember this.

You quickly grab it and toss it on the nightstand before untying her and getting her into a better position. You curse your luck. You had hoped that while under the amulet's power, you'd be able to notice stuff. Maybe hear a voice or see an illusion telling you to tickle her, or being able to notice what's happening even if you can't control what's happening. Even just being a little fuzzy would have been nice. But a complete blackout? Dammit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope that Chella noticed SOMETHING. Looking back at her and note that she seems to be deep asleep. She is also quite beautiful you observe with a big yawn. Guess you were more tired than you thought. Doing your best not to wake her, you remove her glasses and put them on the table with the amulet before climbing into bed and putting your arms around her, and smile as she snuggles in closer.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were about to pull out the amulet but it's suddenly old news- this is far more interesting. \"Just a ship, huh?\" You ask with a raised eyebrow and a wry grin. \"Is it really that simple Chella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you don't trust her but- it's just that Chella has a habit of telling half-truths and not being completely accurate with her research. Remember that time in the mountains stealing abandoned snow-dragon eggs? Tickle dragons. And two angry parents. Or the time you were in Dormduo after a long lost treasure, \"just behind these cobwebs?\" An Arachne called Phoebe with a less than healthy obsession with tickling. For both her mental state and your ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I mean there's actually crossing the Southern Sea- and I don't know what exactly it is we'll find when we get there- not for certain but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's not that simple?\" Chella opens her mouth to say something then thinks better of it. Sheepishly she shakes her head. The first obstacle is getting a ship. Hiring a crew is way out of your price range- Chella's too most likely. But stealing a boat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's crossing the sea. You stole a book on the world's oceans once. The South Sea got a mention. And it convinced you not to go anywhere near the water again. Pirates, sirens, sea witches, harpies, sea monsters- the list goes on. The tropical corals and reefs might be worth the risk for some people but you- not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe island itself is a worry. Chella's knowledge comes from scrolls that look years old which means years out of date. For all you know it could be home to fleet Coninzine marines now- which reminds you that your bounty there is still ten thousand crowns. Queen Catherine obviously hasn't seen the funny side to that little heist yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you know about this Jayo place anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja-o. For two hundred years a small cult of spell casters lived there. Amongst other things they used the silk of dragon moth larvae to weave these enchanted silks and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enchanted how?\" You interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They granted some sort of power to the wearer. Invisibility, magical protection, the power to see in the dark, just stereotypical things.\" You lean forward slightly more interested than before. \"Then twenty years ago they all disappeared and only a few have been back to the island since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" You nod expecting the worst. \"And what happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some reported strange visions, some remembered nothing and others nothing out of the ordinary. They came back if that's what you're worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these wizards are just- gone? 'So long world feel free to take are stuff' gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChella nodded. \"So far as all the scholars believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's there now that has been looted?\" You ask dropping the million septim question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the looms were too big to move and couldn't be disassembled because of a spell the cult members cast. I can make them work though I can 't replicate their properties- I am convinced the way to do so is still on the island though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sounded just as certain in Dormduo.\" You say. Chella smirks then quickly covers her mouth. \"Yes. I was probably right. We never got to the end of the ruins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should have asked the spider woman.\" You say sarcastically. \"Please Miss Arachne- could you check to see if there aren't just a few ancient mythical times back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If nothing else it was a fascinating insight into the psychology of the arachne as a species.\" Funny because you didn't. And you might have been a bit lightheaded but Chella didn't seem to get a chance to have an insight into anything beyond the effects of arachne nails on the naked human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo a trip to Ja-o island? Everything screams no but something inside you- call it the spirit of adventure or whatever- says yes. Then there's the part of you that says, \"What do I get out of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A free item of Ja-o crafted silk wear and whatever else I have that I can give in gratitude.\" Funny- she'd said those exact words before and you were just as broke then as you are now. But hey. Maybe some time away might make the traders and merchants drop their guard for your return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" You say finally.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately the few who did are known pickpockets and thieves anyway- not that that stops one from snickering at you. You shoot a rude gesture at him before turning back to Chella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So step 1- ship, crew, supplies. Are you making them all a silk scarf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn true Chella fashion she simply hand waves your suggestion. \"We don't need anything but a ship.\" She declares so certainly of herself you have to wonder if she heard you properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supplies, food, fresh water? We don't need any of the above. I mean I'm just a mere mortal but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean the ship I want is no ordinary ship.\" Chella points out over the harbor and directs your gaze to a green-sailed ship with a dragon roaring on the bow. \"That ship there, the Greenscale, just arrived yesterday. It belongs to a northern merchant. And it's enchanted- it will sail itself to wherever you desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. That so? You take a second to ponder how convenient that is and how easy something like that makes life- especially for lazy writers. \"We still need food and fresh water.\" You begin to say before Chella stops you with a raised hand. \"Magical parlor?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. Don't be silly.\" Of course. However could you be so silly? \"He's been stocking up on provisions- he sets sail tomorrow at dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know all that?\" You ask suspiciously. Chella just shakes her head and taps her nose mischievously. \"I have my sources.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurs to you that Chella must have been expecting you to drop by and have precisely this conversation and precisely this answer. She was certainly leaving a lot to chance- and screwing up the pacing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hardest part'll be getting past the guards. There's two on the dock and one on the boat. Sounds like light security but they're all his hand picked troops. \"Fighting them won't end well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look across the harbor to see the two armored men on the dock. No sign of the third- must be below. They both wear heavy plate armor and even from here you can see their red faces sweltering in the heavy. You don't know whether to feel sorry for them or laugh at their stupidity. But still- they look mean enough. Chella's right on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it.\" You grin. \"I just have to...</span></div></div>",

No one can resist my feminine wiles.\" Chella just grins and rolls her eyes at you as you head towards the deck. You don't try to be sneaky at all, in fact quite the opposite. You head straight for the guards on deck, waving at both of the heavily plated patrolmen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" You call out loudly. \"Could you men help me?\" Both guards slowly walk their way towards you, and you get a better look at them. They're from some northern country, their skin is fairer than yours, making them stand out even more than you in swarthy New Forazio. They're sweating quite a bit in the still night air, clearly not used to the southern heat. Aside from being excessively armored, they don't seem too threatening. \"I'm new here, and these Forazian docks go on for hundreds of paces! Could you fellows give me some directions?\" You say, trying to make your voice sound as sweet and innocent as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, miss.\" Says one of the guards, now standing shoulder to shoulder on the gang plank, passively but clearly barring entry to the deck. \"We've sailed here from farther north than you've ever been, so how in the six skies do you think w-!\" The guard abruptly cuts off as you deftly take a small pouch from your belt and toss it at the guards, smacking one in the shoulder. Instantly, a cloud of dust rises from the point of contact as the pouch loses some of its contents. You're careful to hold your breath and not breathe in a whiff of it, but the panting foreigners aren't able to react in time. They only have a moment to take on a stern expression before their muscles soften, and they both slump heavily to the deck, beginning to snore loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work.\" Chella applauds with a soft clapping. \"What is that stuff?\" You carefully pick up the pouch and tie it shut in just the right way before looping it back on your belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sidhe powder.\" You reply. \"Hard to come by, but it'll put a human to sleep in seconds. Too bad it doesn't work on supernatural creatures. Learned that the hard way when I ran into that mimic\u2026\" A shiver ran up your spine as you recalled how an exact replica of you tied you up, tickled you for an hour, then made off with all your cash. Somehow being you made it know exactly where to tickle you too\u2026 \"Anyway, help me drag these guys onto a lifeboat, and then we can gang up on the one below deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, how about you do all the heavy lifting, and I'll take care of the last guard?\" Chella replies coolly. You arch your eyebrow curiously, Chella always said she was a lover, not a fighter. At the very least, she's infinitely better with a nigh unreadable tome than a simple short sword. But you shrug and let her go as you slowly drag the heavy bodies to the nearest life boat, thankful for the concealing darkness of night. By the time dawn comes and these guards wake up, you'll both be miles at sea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you've placed the guards in the lifeboat, you notice Chella at the stairs with the last guard, dragging the unconscious man up the stairs. \"Hey, we agreed you'd do the heavy lifting!\" She says in a strained voice, and you hurry to help her carry the last guard to the boat. You give her an extra inquisitive look, wondering how she took care of him so easily, but Chella merely bats her blue eyes at you mysteriously. \"A girl's gotta have a few secrets, right?\" The two of you lower the lifeboat into the harbor, freeing you of the three sleeping guards. Step one; get boat? Done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know Chella, it's a bit late to be saying this, but are you sure about this? Once those guards wake up, our faces will be on wanted posters all over the city. We won't be coming back to Forazian territory anytime soon. Another bounty isn't a big deal to me, but you grew up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChella shrugs, \"I've actually been thinking about leaving here for a while, and this is the perfect opportunity to do it in style. Besides, you don't think I have a plan? After we plunder Ja-o of its secrets, we'll head back across the southern sea. But this time, we'll make port in Uzien, not New Forazio. Since the Forazians trade heavily with Rylestia, and Uzien has an alliance with Coninze, I don't think the Uzien guards will care if we're pirating a rival's trade ships.\" Chella notices the look on your face when she mentions Coninze. \"And don't worry, Uzien's treaty with Coninze doesn't apply to bounties. I remember the story about your little heist from the royal palace. I'm sure Queen Catherine would love to get her hands on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides.\" Chella continues. \"Uzien is perfect for our needs: with its geography in the river delta, housing is ungodly expensive, but we have a whole merchant ship to live on now! And there's a high market for soft things in Uzien: silks, exotic down feathers\u2026 we might even sell our stuff to the Duchess herself! I hear she's even more beautiful than Queen Catherine, which you'll have to be the judge I suppose\u2026\" Chella nudges you in the ribs playfully, earning a yelp of protest as you bat her hand away. \"And it's a major port where a certain thieving companion of mine doesn't have a bounty. So if you can keep your nose clean we can set up base there. I might even be able to get a position at the Great Library of Uzien, which'd give me enough tomes to give us adventures for the rest of our lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up your hands to stop Chella before she keeps going. The politics is making your head spin, and you don't need any more of a lesson on how great Uzien is. \"Alright, alright! I'll leave the planning to you, Chella. But first things first, how are we getting to Ja-o? The southern seas are supposed to be full of monsters and who knows what. You're not just going to point the ship straight at the island are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026\" Chella says slowly, making you think that's exactly her plan. \"That would be the fastest route. The only obstacle on the way there is a Siren's den. But I figured since this ship pilots itself, it doesn't matter if we hear the siren song, the ship will just keep going until we're out of ear shot!\" You give Chella a dubious look. No one can resist a siren's call, and their hypnotic voice has gotten sailors to do all manner of unwise behavior. Although if the whole sea is dangerous, maybe the straight shot has its merits. Its true the ship does steer itself magically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you really want alternatives, we could detour west. That avoids the Siren Den, and isn't too much longer, but does put us in the territory of the Great Southern Harpy. It's apparently a larger and more intelligent species than its northern sisters. But harpies aren't so bad, remember when we ran into the Coninzian red harpy?\" You do remember, and it reminds you just how ticklish harpy feathers are, and how damnably curious the bird-women can be when they find a human in their territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you really want to play it safe, we could steer east. That'd be a much longer trip, but we'd avoid sirens and harpies. We would be passing through the mermaid waters, but everything I've heard about the mermaids of the southern sea is that they don't harm humans. They seem to delay travelers, but there are no reports of anyone being harmed. It's the longest but easiest route. So, partner in crime, where do we steer the boat?\" </span></div></div>",

On the other hand though, minimizing the time at sea sounds like a good idea given the nature of the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"West it is.\" You decide. As soon as you say it the ship seems to jolt underneath your feet and you and Chella grab each other before either of you can fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"West it is.\" Chella repeats with a short laugh as the ship begins it's voyage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooo- harpies. Thinking back to last time, you can't help but feel a phantom tingling on your skin. Regardless of where they touched or how heavy or light the contact was, or even if it was accidental, harpy feathers could reduce anyone to a giggling wreck. As you had found out at the hands of the Coninzian harpies. The flip-side to this was that your current outfit afforded slightly more protection than the skimpy garments Chella had called a disguise last time. Consisting mainly of dark leather, pants and boots keep your lower body safe, whilst a jacket conceals most of your torso. Granted, your jacket and pants waistband don't quite meet and expose some skin around your center- well everything from the top of your hips to your lowest rib. That and underneath the jacket, your only line of defense is a bandeau top which means your front is slightly more exposed than you'd like in the circumstances. But still- better than last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd better than- whatever Chella's wearing. \"Archonwear of the Hawan Empire. The height of fashion five hundred years ago.\" She announces when you shoot her a questioning look as the two of you make your way to the bow and the wind blows at her cloak, giving you a view of her alluring and scantily clad form underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiiiight.\" You say with folded arms and a skeptical expression. \"And given your oh so vast knowledge of harpies are you sure that's wise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles and looks out over the dark waves as the ship clears the harbor and ventures out into the open ocean. \"An odd question from my little thief who possesses first hand knowledge of harpy interaction- yet forgets how much her tummy shows.\" Chella counters. Her fingers dart out to wriggle over your midriff as she does so and you jump back with a shriek and giggles. \"Perhaps some endurance training is in order?\" She suggests with a sly grin. \"Never mind the harpies imagine if Queen Catherine's new tickler gets her hands on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd need to catch me in the first place.\" You reply smugly-but keeping your distance from Chella's fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Chella leans forward on the bow of the ship as it ploughs on through the waves. Two cat-like leaps later and you too are posed dramatically, hanging from the rigging and looking out over the horizon as your jacket and hair flap in the sea breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the west. To Ja-o. To adventure.</span></div></div>",

You and Chella stand at the bow, the cool night breeze off the ocean wafting through your hair. As you head west out of port, you look behind you at the receding features of New Forazio. At the rate your new plundered ship is moving, the two of you should be able to outrun the Forazian ships, which tend towards the slow and well armored variety. By the looks of things, this magical boat could get you away from just about anything short of a Coninzian Corsair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you take turns on deck, watching the waves for pursuing ships or anything else dangerous. Despite how amazing the magical vessel appears, both of you decide to keep an eye on it just in case. Whoever isn\u2019t on deck wandered back to the captain\u2019s quarters, which happened to have a very nice king size bed, much nicer than the simple cots reserved for the sailors down below deck. You had gotten the last rest of the night, and noticed the sunlight coming in through the windows as Chella started shaking you awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wake up sleepyhead.\u201d Chella says to you softly as she shakes your shoulder. \u201cThe suns up, and it looks like smooth sailing. We should head below deck and check out what provisions we have.\u201d It\u2019s a very sensible idea, and one you\u2019d tend to agree with. But you\u2019d been up half the night stealing this ship and then making sure no one came after you, and the bed was really comfortable\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, five more minutes, Chella.\u201d You mutter sleepily, trying to roll over.  As you\u2019re on your back, you feel Chella stop you as you\u2019re on your back, grabbing your shoulder as she hops onto the bed next to you. It takes you a long, sleepy moment to realize what she\u2019s doing, and remember that you threw your jacket on a nearby chair. \u201cWait, Chella\u2026\u201d you protest, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like a certain little thief needs a wake-up call!\u201d Chella tells you in a cheery voice, as her fingers descend to your bare belly. It\u2019s certainly an effective wakeup call, as you open your eyes and let out a surprised giggle. You try to brings your hands up to protect yourself, but your sleepy reactions can\u2019t match Chella\u2019s wide awake ones. As you raise your arms, Chella skitters her nails up under them, teasing the exposed hollows with a playful scratching as she grins down at you. \u201cIf you want to stay in bed I suppose we could stay like this for a while\u2026\u201d Chella teases as she keeps curling her fingernails under your arms, wriggling a little faster in her encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe ok! OK! I\u2019m \u2013hehehe- up!\u201d you tell her, sitting up and shooing away her hands. Chella lets you up with a grin and lets you put on your jacket. Feeling better with at least some more protection from Chella\u2019s fingers, the two of you head below deck to take stock of your supplies. Finding a good supply of dried fruit and nuts, you munch on them for breakfast as you wander past the supplies. The <i>Greenscale</i> was definitely fully stocked, you have salted meat, dried provisions, and potable water for months. At least for the two of you. You also notice more than one barrel of Forazian wine, and another filled with Rylestian firewater. \u201cWell, this\u2019ll be a good way to celebrate our new boat!\u201d You muse, realizing drinks are on the house for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Chella tells you with a wry grin. \u201cRemember the last time we both had too much to drink?\u201d You grunt in acknowledgement. You had successfully fenced some kind of jewel, and had wanted to celebrate. Next thing you remember you and Chella woke up in your underwear in a dryad\u2019s glen, with the dryad none too happy with you. On the plus side, you learned that dryad sap is great for curing hangovers. On the other, it has the disastrous side effect of sensitizing skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there are no dryads out on the open ocean. Anyway, let\u2019s get back above deck. Shouldn\u2019t it be about time for us to swing south?\u201d You ask, thinking that the ship has probably sailed clear of the siren\u2019s den by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already turned us before coming to wake you.\u201d Chella responds. \u201cSo we\u2019re heading due south now, and at the rate this ship moves we should almost be in harpy territory by now.\u201d The two of you get above deck, wanting to know about any harpies noticing your ship as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab an eyepiece and scan the sky, looking carefully for any harpies. For a moment, you start to think the two of you might get by un-noticed. But then you see them: two figures slowly flying northward, heading straight for you. You can see the long white wings and tanned skin of the southern harpies through the magnification, but they don\u2019t seem to have noticed you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got two harpies.\u201d You tell Chella, waiting anxiously next to you. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll see us any minute.\u201d You try to think about what to do. It might make sense to have Chella hide below deck, and deal with the harpies yourself. At the very least, then only one of you would end up a ticklish mess. You\u2019re pretty sure you could convince them this magic ship only needs you to pilot it, as that is true. Then again, misery does love company, and keeping Chella up here with you might come in handy. You\u2019d only have to deal with one harpy each, at least. Or you could try to weasel your way out of this and make Chella deal with them, but you\u2019re not sure that\u2019ll go over well at all.</span></div></div>",

Partly because of her stubbornness and partly because- why are you trying to play the hero here? \"Just get down below deck before I tie you to a mast and sacrifice you to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWisely, Chella nods and makes a dash below deck. Crap- part of you hoped she'd remember at least one favors she still owed you. But it's too late for that now. The harpies have spotted the ship and they adjust their course to meet you. And as Chella closes the hatch you're on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis can only go well, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs little reassurance as they are you make sure the two daggers at your belt are present and easy to grasp if you need them. You make a point of taking the helm and looking the part of a sole captain without a crew. It's lacking a hat and anything that would make your attire anywhere near sailor like but it's the best you've got- besides improv is your thing. That's how you got the amulet in the fir-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday's brief frenzy seems a decade ago but you recall it in detail and suddenly remember the amulet inside your jacket pocket. You feel the bulge within your clothing and the clink of the chain. An idea forms in your mind as you consider your options. Nothing solid- just a vague idea that tugs one side of your mouth into a wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlapping wings over the flapping sails reach your ears and you look up to see the two, scarily large harpies soar overhead. Their wings are massive and their bodies tower well over you- easily twice as tall even. They watch you as they circle scanning the rest of the ship for signs of any other life. When they find none they descend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" You smile as the two land on the quarterdeck behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair winds to you human.\" The taller of the two greets you. Both could be described as pretty and both look youngish- it's always hard to tell with spell-casters and non-humans. Neither wears particularly much either in fitting with harpy culture and the temperature round here- even the morning sun is quickly warming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us pretty little human.\" The shorter one says. \"Are you alone on this ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep- just me. I prefer the solitude.\" You lie without hesitation. \"Especially on a beautiful day like today.\" The harpies exchange a look that you can't quite gage the intent behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yess. A beautiful day indeed...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"But on a beautiful day like today\u2026\" the shorter harpy says, as both of them slowly saunter towards you. \"Aren't you just a bit lonely for company?\" As they move closer you examine their features more closely. You weren't expecting these Great Southern Harpies to be so\u2026 tall. Chella really should have mentioned that fact to you, something you'll have to remind her about sooner or later. The 'shorter one' is about twice your height, and the taller one is about a head above her! But it's all the same you didn't know, as there's no way Chella could've taken on one of these big birds had she stayed. Nor you, for that matter\u2026 as you realize your daggers are completely useless against an enemy of this size. You'll have to use cunning, not force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bird features begin just above the knee, transitioning from the smooth skin of a human thigh to feather and scale of bird feet, which you note are webbed, befitting a seabird. Their skins are tanned a pale milk chocolate color that contrasts with the white feathers. You note that they'd be attractive women were they human: their forms are thin and graceful, with gentle swelling of curves at the hip and breast. While their breasts aren't large considering their size, for a normal human like you their bosoms are impressive nonetheless. The harpies wear little, similar to their northern kin. A loincloth covers their nether-regions, and their tops are covered by a thin wrap that does little but cover the essential parts. As with their legs, their arms fade to bird wing at the bicep, transitioning into immensely long wings able to propel them across oceans. Their 'hair' seems like shoulder length wispy feathers that almost resemble the real thing, white like the rest. Their faces make them appear as young, pretty women with deep red eyes that look at you curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop examining them when you realize they're standing right before you, waiting for an answer to their question. \"Lonely?\" you ask. \"Oh no, I'd rather be alone. Gives me time to think and appreciate the view!\" You say, although as you expect it does little to discourage them from getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the taller one asks you. \"Wouldn't it be better to have company to appreciate the view?\" As she asks this question, her wing reaches out as if innocently stretching. But the tips of the long wing manage to lightly graze your side. It all looks perfectly accidental, but you're positive she knows what she's doing. But you can't help but flinch as you feel those tickly harpy feathers run against the bare skin of your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, Axa.\" The shorter one replies, as her wing also reaches out in the same casual manner to stroke along your other side. It's even harder to control yourself from this second contact, and as the feathers barely make contact with your other side you twitch noticeably and take a step back. \"More fun to spend the time together, chat\u2026 have a few laughs?\" The harpy gives you a questioning look, and while you all know where this is going, the harpies seem to be enjoying this prolonged game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" You stutter, trying not to let any sign of laughter pass your lips. \"No, sorry. I much prefer to spend my time in seriousness and solitude!\" You say, trying feebly to dissuade the harpies from what you know is coming, or at least delay it as long as possible. You're sure Chella can hear every word of what's happening, maybe even watching through a peephole. You can only imagine the teasing she'll give you once this is all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear that, Nafi?\" The taller one, Axa, tells her companion. \"To be so serious and alone? That won't do at all, pretty little human. You need to relax, enjoy yourself! Smile and laugh!\" Axa tells you, her eyes glittering with a sense of play, as her wingtips brush against your side, much more deliberately this time. As the feathers drag along your skin, your belly sucks in and you let out a surprised yelp and try to move away\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026which only brings you closer to Nafi, who wiggles her wings against you more firmly as well, dragging the feathers down from your ribs down to your hip. You can't help but snicker and squirm in obvious ticklishness, which causes both harpies to smile broadly. \"Yes, yes! Smile and laugh, pretty thing! Let us help you relax all that tension you seem to have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to protest, but Axa's feathers start to stroke along your belly, midway between your side and navel, running right along the line between inner and outer abs. Instead of making a coherent reply, you splutter as snickering laughter overtakes you despite your best efforts to contain it. Even the gentlest touch of a harpy's feather is irresistibly ticklish, and if anything these southern harpy feathers are even worse then the ones you've felt before. The touch along your tummy makes it flutter and your breath catch, all the more impressive for how light the contact is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm, let us keep you company and entertain you for today, human!\" Axa tells you in a playful voice that brooks no dissent. You curse internally at the thought of spending all day or more with these harpies. You're not sure you could take it! Axa and Nafi press closer to you, now caught between these two voluptuous forms. Axa continues to brush her feathers over your belly and side, causing you to recoil into Nafi, who grins as you press against her bare taut belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Axa, I think this pretty little human is ticklish! Look how much she giggles from our feathers!\" Nafi says, reaching around you to drag her wings against your exposed lower back. It makes you arch and squeal girlishly before starting to giggle, the soft feather strokes over your back teasing you into a ticklish haze. But as you do so you only stretch out your stomach more invitingly for Axa, who grazes her feathers across your belly in a wide sweep that sends you into even louder laughter. They make you wiggle back and forth like this, slowly overwhelming you as they playfully tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, a very ticklish human!\" Axa agrees, as the two continue to play with your laughing form. \"I think we'll all have a lot of fun today! But it's too bad she's so covered up\u2026 maybe we could convince her to remove some of those nasty clothes!\" All you can do is groan through your laughter, as you feel feathers stroke all across your midsection. You can't even tell whether they belong to Axa or Nafi at this point, you're enveloped in their wings. Feathers stroking against your hip make you jump and laugh uproariously, only to bounce into more of them skittering against the small of your back, then still more dragging their tips along your waist line suggestively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize if you don't do something soon, the harpies will be able to coerce you into just about anything, including stripping down for more tickling, just for a moment of reprieve. At the very least, there is something pleasant about the harpy feathers\u2026 the soft touch sending an electric tingle down your spine and making you ridiculously giddy. In a way, the harpies are right, there's almost something relaxing and fun about letting go and giggling yourself silly\u2026 but then you shake your mind clear of the thoughts. Perhaps its some magic in the harpy feathers that makes one start to crave it over time. You really do need to do something fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the amulet in your pocket, and despite your ticklish haze get an idea. If you could just get that amulet to slip onto the floor, perhaps it would get the attention of the harpies! If you could get one of them to wear the thing, the spell might take hold. One harpy would turn against the other in a ticklish frenzy. It'd probably effect you too, but you'd enjoy the chance at payback, even if it was magically compelled of you. You're not positive the charm would work on harpies, but at this rate you have little to lose.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'I think you're right, Axa.' Nafi replies, her feathers stroking lower down your back. They swirl and dance circles right at the base of your spine, forcing you onto your tiptoes. You fall forwards, your balance failing as you giggle helplessly. Axa catches you, her feathered arms pushing themselves under your arms inside your jacket. The second they connect with your armpits you positively explode with laughter. Axa laughs with you, wiggling and pulsing her wings in place, the sensation unbearable. You automatically slam your arms down to your side, but it's absolutely useless. Her feathers remain in there, fluttering against your skin, torturing the hollows there. Your flight reflex tries to kick in, and you plant your heels, forcing yourself backwards. Of course, you make almost no headway as you smash back against Nafi's body. She doesn't even falter, and as you flatten yourself against her, she wraps her arms around your middle, her wings connecting with your sides as they stoke and tease the skin there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have absolutely no leverage now, and you're getting desperate. You need this to end. Axa's assault of your underarms is forcing deep laughter out of you, interspersed with giggles from Nafi's softer assault of your sides. You're just barely able to wiggle in defiance against Nafi's strong form, You're getting breathless, but it just won't stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OKhahaha OK!' you scream, barely able to catch enough breathe to speak. The harpies make eye contact over your head, smiling as they slow down their assault. It doesn't stop completely, Nafi still wrapped around your middle, fluttering slowly along your sides, but Axa does one last wiggle before withdrawing her arms. Giggles won't stop tumbling out your mouth, but at least now you can breathe a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Little lonely girl, you are turning out to be most amusing, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. We can still have more fun. All we have to do, is get rid of these boots. Doesn't that sound like a good idea? Don't you want to have more fun?' her face is so close to yours, you can see her smiling eyes just above yours. You want to shake your head no, but you know that won't do any good. Maybe if you just go along with it, the whole thing will be over sooner. Yes, they will have their amusement, and then they will leave. Yes, that's an excellent plan. You nod your head, and Nafi loosens her grip infinitesimally around your waist. You've just enough leverage to bend over and start unlacing your boots. It\u2019s fiddly, and they seem to think you\u2019re taking too long. You feel gliding across your stretched back, tingling and tickling in it's wake. You squeal and bolt back upright. \u2018Hurry, tickly girl. We don\u2019t like to be made wait.\u2019 You feel a shiver race down your spine and bend over again, attacking your laces with renewed energy. When you feel them loosen, you start to kick them off, but before you can, you feel a tingling on your back again. You rocket back up again, giggling from the residual feeling on your back. \u2018You\u2019ve just been too slow. Penalty. You\u2019d better take those off too.\u2019 Axa gestures to your trousers, and before you can refuse, Nafi\u2019s feather\u2019s flutter threateningly against your sides. Without any further prompting, you reach for the button and zip and push the lot down, kicking off your boots and letting the trousers fall to the floor. \u2018Very good.\u2019</span></div></div>",

You suppose she needs't have too, with Nafi still clutching you from behind, feathers still for the moment but their contact still sends shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know Nafi, there's something I haven't done for such a long time.' Axa says conversationally, stepping slightly closer so her feathers make contact with your leg, not enough to tickle but enough to raise goosebumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's that, Axa?' asked Nafi, leaning down so her breath ghosted across your neck. You try to lean forwards, but a rustle to your middle and sides send you slamming back with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hunted down my prey. Wouldn't that be fun?' She asked, looking you in the eye as a shiver runs down your spine that had nothing to do with the sensitive touches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yes, let's play. Wouldn't you like to play with us?' This didn't sound good for you, but maybe it was the chance you'd been looking for to escape. But then where would you go in the middle of the ocean? No, you had to use this opportunity to come up with a plan. And implement it before their caught you. No pressure there then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What are the rules?' you asked, only to be answered with full blown laughter. Both harpies released their grip on you, walking round so both were stood in front of you. Leaning forward, Axa whispered 'run' in your ear, and you didn't have to be told twice. Your feet took off before your mind had even caught up enough to plan where you were supposed to be running to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding didn't seem like the best idea, so your legs took you across to the rigging and you immediately started to climb. The rope ladder was difficult, but clambering higher a sense of calm fell around you as no sounds of rustling wings started behind you. Until you'd reached the top, that is. Almost as if they knew what you'd been planning, two figures descended from the sky and you ducked quickly. Not fast enough, as two claws captured the jacket you wore and pulled you from your roost. Your arms wrenched up with the sleeves of the jacket and wings immediately latched on, vibrating in the hollows. Screaming laughter was pulled out of you as you squirmed in mid air. You didn't know who held you and who was tickling, but it didn't matter. They were merciless in their assault of your underarms, taking full advantage of your lack of ability to cover yourself. Looking down, you quickly realise you aren't too far from the ship and if you could just wriggle free, you could drop from your jacket, and that was the plan all along. You would have to give up your jacket, that extra layer of protection. Harpies were experts at this game, you didn't stand a chance, but you had to keep trying. You throw your weight down and out of the jacket, rolling when you hit the deck and taking off as fast as you could. </span></div></div>",

It's a precious family heirloom that needed to be re-enchanted for m'lady Anastasia.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew of the Lady Anastasia. She was about your age, and was incredibly sweet. She was the de facto ruler of this area, and a distant relative of the King of Rylestia. Many wished she were the Queen instead. While she was very cheery, she never seemed to ever laugh, which some found odd. \"This amulet, I should tell you, is something she wears in private. I know it sounds silly, but it seems it's the only way to make her laugh. Her father owned it before he passed. Good sir/ fair lady, wherever did you find it?\" He asked, grinning at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was talking about Anastasia, it told you he was King Jerris, her most faithful servant. He was almost as kind as Anastasia, but was sadly also rather naive, which explained why he so easily assumed you were a good Samaritan. You quickly told him you found it on the ground and was about to ask around if anyone had lost it. Knowing he wasn't THAT naive, you also admitted sheepishly that you did want some small reward upon returning it. He nodded his head and quickly dumped a small sack of gold in your palm. \"Here, here! You deserve it! And more! Two hundred gold pieces simply isn't enough!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly did a double take. Sure, that wasn't a lot for a rich person, but for a thief, they could live off this for two years! However, King continued. \"I insist, good sir/ fair lady, that you come with me an accompany Anastasia and myself to tea.\" Anastasia was known for often letting the common people dine with her, no matter how poor, should they do a good deed. \"And, even further, you may see it in action!\" He said, indicating the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your luck. Before you knew it, you were suddenly within Anastasia's lush, comfy housing. She tried to be as modest as possible; while the building was the largest in the city, it was only three floors and looked only slightly better than most buildings on the outside. The inside was a little less modest, with chandeliers and paintings, but by royalty standards, it was bare. You were quickly led into a sitting room by King. \"Now then, feel free to walk around and see the sights, but please be here by tea time. If not, we'll have to look for you, you must understand.\" He said, leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide...</span></div></div>",

You look towards the Silver District, named because of the large amounts of silver and precious metals contained in the houses there. You make a plan to sneak in that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night you lie on the rooftop of a Royal house, and look for openings or other ways to get in. Suddenly seeing your luky break, you shimmy across a clothesline before silently dropping in through an open window and crouching. You seem to be in the dressing room of some rich woman, and you gape at the jewelry and gold surrounding you. Not wasting any time, you shove some rings and necklaces into you pockets. But then,hidden, you peek around a corner and see a woman sitting at an ornate dressing table. She is using a boar-bristle hairbrush to comb her hair and a powder puff to whiten her face, perhaps for a decadent late night party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to leave her when you see it! A massive, diamond-studded brooch hangs from her back pocket. You must have it. Taking slow, careful steps you make your way over to right behind you.

Your target can see that under your 'work clothes'  of plain, sleeveless leather jerkin, black trousers and simple boots there is a swan. Under most circumstances, you'd appreciate that a woman of such refined taste had paid you a compliment. Unfortunately, you don't really have time to take it in when she has pinned you to the ground under her weight. If you don't act quickly, the only compliments that you'll be receiving will be from your guards.. or from the public when they put you in the pillory. You get the feeling that they will be a lot less kind and decide to act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for your dagger, rope and other tools is out of the question. Reacting on pure instinct, you buck wildly and attempt to throw her off but your would-be target seems to have anticipated your maneuver, catching your flailing wrists and pins them to the ground. You seem to have messed with the wrong noblewoman. You thrash around wildly, trying to free your hands, but she merely shifts her weight a little and keeps you trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me! Don't make me hurt y-\" Your empty threat is cut-off by your least favorite sound in the world: the shrill sound of a noblewoman screaming for the guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards, Guards! Thief! Help me!\" She sounds dainty and helpless, as if she's not just easily subdued you. The noblewoman leans closer to you, as you caught her while she was changing, her long hair slips loose and brushes against your face. She fixes you with an possessive, sadistic expression. The expression seems to go with her whitened face, creating a very chilling effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is such a shame that someone so pretty can act so brutish and rude. You will never get ahead that way, little thief.\" Her tone is sweet and condescending, with a strong hint of menace behind it. \"You will not have to worry, though. Once you are all snug in the dungeons, I will be sure to personally educate you in manners..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the smart sort of rogue, you determine that her terrifying stare and sinister tone indicate that these aren't the sort of lessons you should be enthusiastic about taking. You can hear the guards storming towards the room and you know that if they get there, you're in for one hell of a schooling. You muster one final, heroic burst of strength and make a desperate attempt to throw her off...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You'd never have thought you'd be grateful for a scrum of guards but you can deal with being roughly apprehended more than the noblewoman's frightening gaze. She releases your wrists, only for one of a dozen guards to take over. You're almost dragged out from under her and roughly pulled up to your feet. Your would-be victim takes a few paces back, regarding the whole spectacle with a smirk as you are almost lifted off your feet by the armored men-at-arms holding your upper arms. You swear and thrash, but there are at least four of them holding you tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Reanna ! Are you hurt?!\" One of them asks urgently, while his comrades fan out across the room, hands on their swords as if assassins might leap out from one of drawers any at any second. You are roughly frisked, your blade, rope and jewelry haul are quickly seized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. thank you.. you got here just in time.. this terrible woman would have robbed me..\" She has affected a fragile tone, as if the experience of subduing you with comical ease was particularly traumatic. \"Make sure she is bound tight! If she gets loose she could throttle me in an instant.. she has the eyes of a madwoman!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Reanna seems particularly theatrical. The guards handling you seem to be skeptical, casting glances at one another but all seem to be too afraid to say anything. You realize that she's been staring at you, perhaps the entire time, with a predatory expression. The guards comply, tightly binding your wrists with your own rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elbows, thighs, knees and ankles. She's not to be able to move.\" She seems to break character to bark an order, her voice snaps like a whip. Their is a brief and terrible pause, before you are forced to the floor. They comply with her order, tightly binding together all the areas she named. In order. As the guards begin to tie your ankles, you hear her icy voice once again \"Boots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noblewoman is only young, in her mid-twenties you'd guess, and rather small. However, she is able to radiate a particularly terrifying presence. The guards quickly remove your boots, and you feel the air against your bare feet as your ankles are tied together, then connected to your wrists in a firm hogtie. The guards quickly back off, leaving you helpless, able to do nothing but squirm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Reanna affects that damsel-in-distress wounded tone of voice once again as your struggle futility  on the ground. \"I..think I want to interrogate her personally.. please post sentries in the hallway and on the perimeter. You will have to tell the guests that I shall be late.. I know it is dangerous but.. I have to know why this woman would want to hurt me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt becomes clear to you that you have messed with the wrong noblewoman. Even her own guards seem to be afraid of her, immediately following her orders, going along with her little game and too scared to challenge. Her guards file out and your heart sinks as you are left alone with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're too frightened to speak as she sits down beside you and begins running her fingers through your hair. She idly traces her manicured fingernail along your neck and you flinch with the ticklish sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we begin our first lesson in manners.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mind raced with thoughts of why exactly she would keep you like this, rather than throwing you in the dungeon. You strained your head slightly, hoping to watch her without being noticed, holding yourself deathly still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Take your feet for example.\" Her eyes turn toward you briefly to acknowledge yours. Her stare is hard. \"They're awfully pink. You've clearly been on them.\"Reanna continued by dragging two nails down your heel causing you to bite your lip. \"That will not do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her eyes turn back toward your feet. Her mouth turns a wide grin in turn with her eyes as if she's fully taking in the situation. \" A beautiful girl like you...must be taught responsibility\" Reanna spoke with disturbing conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your blood ran cold. It became clear she had your boots removed for more than just preventing you from getting away. You DEFINITELY crossed the wrong noblewoman,  one who had far more than a passing interest in your bare feet. You hadn't been really been tickled before, but Reanna' s touches made it clear you were sensitive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut your eyes as her hand began to dance across your soles, only to have her other come back to your neck. \"You shall address me only as my lady, is that clear?\" She commanded, in the tone she had addressed her guards.You were too focused on her tickling to answer. Reanna responded by lowering her fingers more into your feet. \" Is that clear?\" She repeated. \"Yes My Lady!\" You blurted out with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped tickling and proceeded to caress your hair. She brushed it out of your face and rubbed your cheek with the back of her hand, with an unsettling feeling of intimacy. She massaged your left foot with her thumb, her manicured nail making it torturous. Your face contorted in and out of forced smiles as she spoke. \"Given your intrusion, your first lesson in manners shall be to learn what happens to naughty girls who don't behave.\" She scolded, almost tantrum like. \"And for that you must be punished.\" Lady Reanna then sat up and...<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

Now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to trace circles on your heels, you decided to protest. You were tired of being tickled. A few swears and demands to stop were let out among some giggles caught in your throat. \"Uh uh\" Reanna tutted, adding fingers to your heels.\"A proper lady must mind her language.\"she said with a bit too much enjoyment as she dug into your soles. You flexed your toes and twisted your ankles but the hogtie prevented any escape from the Lady's nails which were doing a number on you. She taunted your escape attempts by dragging her nails down the top of your feet, making you flex toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then immediately went for your toes, an area previously untouched. Before you could react, she put her fingers between them and began fondling with her nails. A few seconds of giggling turned into full blown laughter. It was clear your toes were your weakspot, something Reanna did not miss. She proceeded to scrape the soft spaces between your toes in a downward motion. You banged your chest against the floor, snorting with laughter. The tickling of your toes overrode all aching of your bondage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All at once she stopped. You gulped down air and exhaled with relief. \"You have a pretty laugh. Very ladylike.\" Reanna said with ponder, as if your torture were a fine wine she was tasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You curled your toes at once preventing further invasion from her cruel fingers. Clearly this did not please her. \"This will not do\" she pouted. \"You cannot resist. This is your punishment thief. I shall spare you from the life of a commoner and you shall indulge me, for I have a very weary evening ahead of me.\" She scolded with arms crossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You would rather be taken by the guards then be tortured by this woman any longer. You keep your toes curled., hoping she'll have you taken away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately that is not the case. She stands up off of you and heads toward her dresser, returning a few moments later. She sits down next to you again, placing something beside her. She then runs her fingers through your hair again. \" I will be gentle. But you shall learn that it is rude not to indulge me. However...\" She pauses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean to give you appreciation. Thus I shall give you something in return.\" Despite your rebellion against her demands her smile hasn't left her face. Her fingers stop stroking your hair and reach over to unbuckle her shoes, removing them. She then proceeded to get on top of you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petit forazion, with strength you still don't understand once again overpowered you pulling your big toes up and tied them with a hair braid. \"As I said I will be gentle, I am generous after all. As a proper lady must be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Your eyes shot open immediately and your mouth gave to laughter. What you could only imagine was the horse hairbrush from earlier was now gliding across your bare feet. Immediate pleas came from your mouth as the bristles sawed between your toes as the balls were scrubbed. \"A proper lady accepts fault for their misdeeds, Yet all I hear is begging for pardon. Have you no manners thief?\" You were being tickled far too much to protest. You allowed apologies to burst out in your laughter, swearing on everything to never steal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your amazement, Reanna stops.

At once!\" She let her voice echo out. The impatience in her voice was apparent, as if her guards should already know of her needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The jingling of chainmail under light plate was quickly followed by the opening of the door. A thin guard of unsure stature swung the door open, too hard clearly as he had to fumble to catch it. To attempt to redeem for his misstep, he quickly put his hand to his hilt, drew it slightly and held it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief. You didn't care why but you were getting out of here! With your feet still tingling from Reanna's brush, the timing felt perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, My Lady?\" He put on as stern a face as he could muster, which wasn't much. His eyes tried as best they could to avoid you. \"I require... more time with this matter. Please move this woman to... Erm my bed. I do not wish to leave her on the floor. That would be uncouth.\" Her damsel mannerisms were back in full swing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your heart sank but only partially. Any change in your position would give you a better escape plan than the floor. \"As you wish my lady.\" The guard stammered. He walked over to you slowly. As his back passed Reanna she shot you a taunting smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached you it was clear he was unsure how to move you. Reanna spoke again. \"Cut the rope. Have her laid down.\" He drew his blade and sawed the rope holding your wrists to ankles. Given he had his sword drawn, the urge to attempt hopping out was quickly dismissed. You were relieved at the release on your muscles though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He flipped you over, again not looking at you. You hair was a bit disheveled from struggle and mussing so it seemed he averted his eyes to avoid thinking about your situation. Given    Reanna's need to keep up appearances with her guards, it seemed highly unlikely the men that attended her knew of her true nature much more than to fear her. She clearly ran a tight ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carried you in his arms as one would a body and lowered you onto the bed, an extravagant mixture of blue and gold. \"Tie her wrists and ankles to the top and bottom\" Reanna spoke quickly and coldly. Her every word sounded like a death threat. The guard took more of your rope which Reanna supplied and drew your wrists up above you. Seeing his nervous fumbling, Reanna grew impatient. \"Thank you. You may go now.\" She gave gratitude in the tone of a scold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly scampered to the door. As he went to leave, he turned around both hands on the door. \"Um my lady. The guests are speaking of your absence. Lord Austren is particularly vocal. What shall I-\" He was quickly cut off. \" I am dealing with an attempt on my life. What if this woman was sent by one of our dear guests downstairs? I shall hardly forsake my safety at the whims of one who may intend to do me harm. Leave me.\" Reanna spoke evenly and with admonishment. The guard quickly shut the door and marched down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven you had to admit Reanna sounded convincing. But the noble Lady dropped her guise and faced you with chilling enjoyment. She grabbed the left behind rope next to you stroking your cheek and returned to the foot of the bed and tied your ankles to it with ease.You watched her with your head on the pillows, it was a bed for her after all. She kneeled down at the end, the bed low enough to still see her smiling at you. She then stared intently at your bare feet, which were just below face level. She then removed the braid holding your big toes, much to your surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then felt a nail traveling up the middle of your left sole, and you turned your head in response, giggling despite yourself. \"How exquisite. I've never had a girl with feet as soft as yours.\" Reanna said with excitement. She lightly ran eight fingers over your soles which forced you into full on giggling. She pulls squeals from you by poking and prodding, in awe of the affect her nails have on your feet and loving it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You are quite the prize, yes.\" She muses in reaffirmation. \"Yes I am doing you quite the favor\" she says in earnest. \"H-How is that-at? you bubble out through giggles. \" You attempted to fleece someone who had their eyes in a mirror. I can't imagine you're a prolific thief.\" Reanna rakes her nails lightly down your soles, as if to punish you for your folly, to which you flail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You would either continue in this foolishness and end up entertaining some posted men in a stone cell, or you would give this up and take a peasent's trade, settling down and be wasted warming the bed of some farmhand.\" She picks up the pace of her fingers as she continues, almost in frustration, much to your dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slows again, tapping and dragging the sensitve skin, keeping you twisting and giggling. \"But you clearly have exceptional blood for a commoner, to have such perfect features, and I shall not let it go to waste.\" She spoke with conviction.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer indexes ran laps on your soles, rippling over the wrinkles created by your clenched toes. \"The things I could do to this body, to these feet.\" Reanna emphasized by digging into the bases of your toes, releasing an \"eep!\" from you. \"I could make you experience things you never thought possible, more than anyone would ever give you.\" Her hands leave your toes, giving your lungs a needed break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Reanna stares directly into your eyes examining your exhaustion. \"And give I shall. For I am generous after all.\" She gives you that chilling shooting smile again. Maybe it's because you're worn out, but her smile isn't having the same effect on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to begin?\" She asks in a teasing manner. You shake your head no. Her head lowers down and out of sight. All of a sudden, your brain jumps into overdrive and you lurch. A warm, wet sensation that jolts your nerves travels up both your feet. Reanna's face appears again. With a wide grin, she licks the middle of your soles up to your toes so you can see. You scream with reverberated laughter. It tickles SO much worse than the fingers.Having been worked over by the brush amplified the effect of Reanna's tongue. It was clear she had an obsession with feet. You just never imagined she'd do this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReanna showed no mercy. She yanked your toes up and stuck both your big toes in her mouth, running her tongue around them and into the spaces. Holding them like that allowed her to probe the rest of your wiggling digits with her nails. Your laughter became filled with snorts as tears ran down your face. You thought you would pass out but Reanna stopped. She looked at you with ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your feet are an absolute treasure.\" She cooed, leaning over and giving one long lick along your left sole producing another scream from you. \"I simply adore you. Thus I have long decided to keep you. I simply must have these feet.\" Her attraction to you took the edge off her proclamation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest her claim on you, Reanna began lapping at your soles sending you back into squirming laughter. Reanna began nibbling gently along the edges of your feet, producing squeal pitches in your laughter. Whenever you'd close your toes she would bite your heel and add her fingers, punishing you when they surrendered by licking across the pads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReanna then simply gave tiny licks and nibbles all across your bare soles, your constant giggling a music to her ears. After what seemed an eternity she pulled away from your lavished feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it's time we begin our next lesson\" She teases with an all too innocent sounding giggle. \"Please no\" You let out weakly. \"A proper girl knows whether or not her say is asked for\" She slowly traces a finger down each of your feet. \"It is for her own benefit\" She then plants a kiss on each of your big toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was becoming increasingly clear the power Reanna held over you with your feet so receptive to her idea of fun. Without warning, Reanna ducked down out of sight again.

You gulp knowing that means you\u2019re than likely in for a harsher treatment. \u201cA proper girl must take proper care of herself, but fear not thief, I shall teach you the follies of self neglect\u201d Reanna scolds as she picks something up from out of view. \u201cSuch labor is far beneath me, but... hehe you belong to me now, and I am quite nurturing to my possessions\u201d Reanna accompanies her words with a cloth she begins using to wipe your feet. The piece of blue fabric is soft, but Reanna switches to a rougher side you assume is used for wiping makeup. The material is coarse enough to tickle terribly when Reanna applies a bit more pressure, and you see her bite her lip as you begin laughing. \u201cNooHohohooo!\u201d You let out in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how you scrunch or arch, the cloth finds it\u2019s way into every wrinkle, along every line of your feet, and you start bucking again when it enter the space underneath your toes. Snorts enter your belly laughs when Reanna proceeds to floss the cloth between each one of your toes, transfixed on their wiggling with small gasps of nothing less than arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently unable to contain herself, she then sucks each of your toes one by one, wrapping her tongue around each and lapping at the spaces in between before wiping them with the cloth again. After minutes of silent laughter her ladyship finally relents. Your sweat drenched hair is now sticking to your tear stained face, and your exhausted mind drifts to how no one has come to investigate despite your \u201cscreams\u201d of suffering. How could you have possibly known that trying to rob a spacious manor during a party could ever backfire on you this hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t out on me now thief, truth be told, I haven\u2019t actually started\u201d Reanna chuckles. Your stomach dropped at the realization that this was merely a warmup. You tense what strength in your muscles you can as Reanna...</span></div></div>",

And then I'll come back to play with those feet. And explore the rest of you.\" She planted a big tickly kiss on both of your feet and then left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay in your bondage for an unknown amount of time, wondering how you would get out of this, and almost laughing at your luck that the first house you tried to rob would have an insane noblewoman with huge things for tickling and feet. You then heard the door swing open. You turned to see who you presumed was Anya. <br>\r\nAnya was a maid from your best guess. You say your best guest, because if that was a maid outfit, it was severly lacking in much outfit. She wore only a lacy black bra and panties and a tiny white apron to add to the maid dynamic.

The guard in his fear of Reanna, had not tied your wrists perfectly, allowing them to finally become loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freed your wrists, nursing the rope burns with your palms for a moment before setting to work on your ankles. You relished the feeling of slapping your bare feet on the floor, free from Reanna's clutches. You then realized that escaping across a roof without shoes probably wasn't a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy sheer coincidence, whilst sliding your legs back and forth, you felt something fuzzy touch your heel under the bed. You looked down to see a pair of luxurious slippers which had to be Reanna's, under the side of the comforter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooking them with your big toes and slipping them on, you feel they are a bit small, but you don't have another option. You slid over to the window and crept out, making sure not to trip in your shoes.

But you then looked at the slippers you wore on your shuffling feet and realized the symbolic victory was much more soothing for your sense of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realized given your review of funds that you were in an awkward situation.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The markets were abuzz as you slipped through the crowd. Your last few days in New Forazio had been relatively uneventful, if that was possible in such a city. You traipsed along scanning your eyes over buyer and seller alike, window shopping in multiple ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Forazio was a place infamous for exotic goods hence your initial interest in traveling. Various teas and accompanying spices owned certain spaces of air, whilst various linens and tapestries hung over market stalls like banners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering yourself more adventurous, your eyes were mostly drawn to the intricate Blades displayed on the wall by a forge, flowery inlays representing various cultures. Your hands were reminded of the recently purchased daggers sheathed at your sides and you prided yourself on the blade's ornamental qualities, testaments to your success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armor stall nearby which was mostly out of view due to passing livestock still radiated the smell of tanned leather, and your footfalls became heavier in your fitted boots, which you had paired with socks despite New Forazio's southern climate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you wanted to kick yourself for still being here, but the coin was good and you had been feeling a lingering mood of inadequacy as of late.Your inward thought led to frustration as you became aware of your lack of focus on potential marks.But as you were about to hit yourself for missed opportunities, opportunity hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A rotund man with a hat too small for his head dressed in robe-like regalia stormed past you barking at his assistant in a language you didn't understand. The assistant was a wiry man carrying a stack of furs much too large for him. You glided up to the portly man and reached into his sagging robe taking a clasped coin purse. Before the feeble laborer could protest the robbery he just witnessed you opened the pouch and deftly threw a handful of gold down his shirt, his change in expression a confirmation of the purchase of his silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As you reveled in the retribution you just created you felt the weight of the remaining coins in the pouch and knew you had enough to purchase a mare and travel. You pondered momentarily as you headed to the inn to grab your things, just what had kept you here. You had slipped up BAD. A feeling of dread welled in you as you sat down on your bed. You weren't counting your blessings as much as you should have and you couldn't put together why. You proceeded to load your things into your knapsack as your mind attempted to ignore the recollections of your harrowing experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut without thinking your hand touched an object inside the knapsack and, it feeling unfamiliar, pulled it out to see it. Your eyes met with one of the slippers you had taken from  HER the night of your escape. You didn't even remember when you had thrown it in there, but images of the inn being searched flashed through your mind in your paranoid state and thus back into the bag it went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was the early afternoon, you slapped coin onto the bar counter and made a hurried exit. Your fear of being found had caught up with you and once outside, you proceeded to head towards the city gates. You found a southwest exit that connected directly south towards the stables and headed towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyed the two guards standing stoically on either side of the arch leading to dirt road. These guards were of the royal family, and thus were equipped for wall defense with black plate mail boasting a dark green trim. They were certainly imposing to say the least, and a very good deterrent to keep crime IN the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you went to cross onto the dirt from stone, your mind snapped back to the world as the two guards drew their swords and crossed them to stop you. Before you could bark out any expletives, the guards bowed their heads and you heard the sound of jingling mail and turned to face it. Approaching through the crowd was a sight that made you nearly vomit from shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Reanna's face lacked the expression you associated with her in your mind. She was calm, collected, and gave the perfect air of class. She walked ahead of her guard in short gaits, hands crossed over her sternum as a daughter being appraised for suitors would.\"Guards, seize the necessary evidence\" she said evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n One of the men behind you grabbed the knapsack due to your focus on Reanna. Within moments, the bystanders watching were given full view of the contents within the bag, including Reanna's slippers. \"You may not have taken your intended quarry thief, but you would be hard pressed to find a pair of shoes such as those, given they were made for me.\" The Lady gave a stern look. You knew you were caught there. It was clear you were a criminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any normal thief having been threatened with my dungeon would have run. No, your presence here means you are part of something larger, a cowardly plot by one who would call themselves a part of this city's court and my ally. My watching of you has only further proved my suspicions. The people of New Forazio demand justice. As do I.\" It was clear she presented herself to the people well. But YOU knew she was lying, and you had to get away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall be done with her my lady?\"asked one of the City guards. \"Have her brought with me to the spring estate. It has become clear that my life is now in danger here. I cannot stress the prudence of going somewhere remote. We shall deal with her there.\" You realized you had to make a split second decision as the guards reached to grab you. You could either run for it in the city which would be very hard to escape, given the surrounding guards and then attempt to hide out. But then you would have a bounty on your head. You also could use Reanna's movement of you out of New Forazio to your advantage and escape then, complete with all the obvious dangers that would bring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...</span></div></div>",

Taking \"free\" passage out of the city seemed like the best option. Besides, the fact that Reanna was taking the law into her own hands again meant she had plans for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as that notion made your stomach twist, it meant that no force of the royal family was sticking a blade in you. Not only did Lady Reanna's coin have a lot of sway with the court, it wasn't like anyone was going to bat an eye in a city of ALL trades in the right places, including slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus you decided it was in your best interest to let the guards from Reanna's retinue get behind you and slap on the irons. Your pride burned in frustration as you could only imagine the satisfaction the elegant deceiver was getting from this and so you turned your head to avoid looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the shackles were fastened the guards hoisted you roughly against the unmoving metal, which hurt. Before they could turn to take you out the city, their grip loosened and allowed you to walk. Unbeknownst to you, your captor had shot them a most disapproving look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were marched out of the city ahead of Reanna and her men. They kept you and her at a distance, ironically trying to protect their sweet looking noblewoman from you. The sandy colored dirty road quickly came to be flanked on both sides by a verdant green plains, eventually swallowed by dense forest. It wasn't long outside the gates of New Forazio until you were brought before a carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit it had the picturesque look of something you dreamed of robbing, in highwayman fashion. Fanciful trim hugged the curves of it's large frame matching the plush dyed interior of colors that glowed through it's windows. It was akin to a palace room on wheels, held at the front by a breed of horses you knew couldn't be locally bred based on their coats. Their slim frames contrasted by their muscular gaits implied they were stallions of a racing nature, made for attendant knights of a duke or duchess for long journeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this surprised you given Reanna's fixation on luxury, and you eases slightly at the fact that you weren't being hauled in a cart like a true prisoner. Upon reaching the carriage Reanna turned towards her escorts. \"Wait a while before following. An armed escort shall not be needed.\" Reanna stated, her face a look of command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady, with all due respect you cannot suggest this. You are a nobl-\" \"If this thief has accomplices in waiting, an armed escort will be exactly what they shall expect. It would truly sadden me if your tongue conveys ineptitude. Your rank allows me to assume you can have your men follow out of sight and keep me from harm, Captain.\" Her words surprisingly bit with logic instead of malice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does indeed My Lady\" the Captain's face sunk, defeated as he turned his men around. You looked at the expression Reanna held with surprise from darting glances. Her command came not from fear but regality. She truly looked as if to be a young girl wearing the responsibilities of a crown far too large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if you were seeing a completely different side of her. But as she opened the carriage door she shot you a smile that reminded you of your fear of her. \"Don't keep me waiting, thief\" she said with a glow that anyone else would have seen as nothing but innocent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked forward and attempted to enter on your own and but found it too high without the use of your hands. Without a second thought, Reanna shoved you inside flat on your stomach and entered with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could attempt to stand against the plush, absorbing floor, Reanna swung your legs and sat down on the back bench. Crossing her legs over yours, you were now held to the floor with your legs up in her grasp, your ankles through her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my pretty little thief\" she stroked the sole of your boot. \"We have much to discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hearing the carriage driver snap at the horses Reanna quickly ended her game with your legs. You threw your legs to the side to pull your face out of the carpet. To your surprise Reanna is blushing slightly, her makeup for travel not as thickly applied. Of all things a look of distress has command of her face. Her doe-like eyes jump to the window and to the ceiling, whilst her fingers stomp her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you. She was lost in the moment and forgot how close her men were. She didn't just want to avoid getting caught. She was embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to feel this was your chance. Maybe the shame about her actions would make you let her go. You, to your own amazement, felt you could open your mouth without losing your head seeing her like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady?\" You ask, almost with legitimate concern. You decide to address her formally. You weren't crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReanna shoots straight in her seat, as if unaware anyone else was in the carriage with her. \"I apologize, but you said we were to discuss something.\" You put on your calmest face and speak politely as you can, the vibrations massaging the side of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, quite right please sit\" Reanna zips out then remembers your predicament, her face flushes again at her mistake. The carriage was moving slow enough that Reanna was able to stand and lift you onto the seat. Not that weren't still surprised at her ability to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wondered as you pulled yourself upright why Reanna would put you in a position to dive headfirst out the window if you were foolish enough. Then her red face reminded you she wasn't thinking about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I deeply regret breaking into your home. It was most disrespectful of me. If you let me go, I shall never return to New Forazio for the rest of my days\" You did your best to bow which wasn't easy with your hands as they were. You hoped your civility would appeal to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" Reanna said slowly. She had stared at you intently as you spoke, as if she was seeing you as a person for the first time. She shifted her hands in her lap, now avoiding eye contact. Her expression turned uncomfortable, almost sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you despise me?\" she asked still looking out the window. You were taken back by the question. How human it was. \"No my lady I-\" \"I hold no hatred if you do\" You now had to factor in that what you thought was relevant to her, which previously was unthinkable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to pick your words very carefully. \"No my lady I don't\" You finished this time. There was a long pause. \"I did not lie you know.\" She took a sharp breath. \"When I said I'd offer you a life\" She turned to face you. Her expression continued to be melancholy. \"I have no ladies in waiting and I...\" Her voice trailed off and she shot her gaze into her lap, then turned back to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you were in disbelief. It was almost if she was a normal girl with a oh! It made more sense now. She had a legitimate crush on you! She was more normal than you thought. Although you couldn't discern still whether she was just used to getting her way or simply warped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flush in your cheeks to mirror hers at your realization was noticed out of the corner of her eye, and it became clear she knew the reason. \"I've had company in my bedchamber before but rarely so well endowed.\" You tried turning slightly to ignore her glance at your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I understand you have no reason to trust me, but I simply couldn\u2019t let such a chance slip away.\" The concern on her face looked as real as one could get, though you still worried this was some kind of trap. \"I shall host a celebration at my chateau to honor the quelling of the conspiracy against me, and you shall be free to go. I only ask that you join me for the revelry.\" She kept a warm demeanor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear by \"conspiracy\" she meant you, which meant if she did so you really would be free. As far as you could tell, taking her offer had the least risk to your life regardless of the sincerity of her intentions. \"Thank you my lady\" You answer shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few moments the carriage stopped, to your surprise. Reanna opened the door to the carriage and gestured. \"Come then\" She said with a smile. You were helped out by Reanna and treated to a wondrous sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all Forazion architecture, Reanna's chateau was white adorned with gold, it's shining pronouncement of wealth drawing the eye to the sun drenched courtyard populated by marble fountains. The crystal clear water spewing monoliths depicted various figures you were unfamiliar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do hope partaking of all this provides some anodyne for my actions.\" Reanna responded to your look of marvel. You were pulled literally and figuratively from your temporary trance by Reanna's men dragging you away from her. \"Halt!\" She called out. \"This woman has proven most useful. She has given the names I require to begin dealing with those who have betrayed me. She is an honored guest. Uncuff her.\" Reanna's men had clearly gotten tired of being on the receiving end of her lashings, for they gave you up without a fight. You rubbed your wrists in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were however, concerned. You weren't sure if you had thrown her off, but Reanna's lie seemed less airtight than her previous ones, the irony not lost on you. \"My lady\" You bowed and approached slowly. \" I am truly grateful, but I gave you no names. What shall you tell your men?\" You asked as respectfully as you could. \"You mean since you are connected to no one who has betrayed me?\" She smiled knowingly.\"Er yes \" You didn't know how to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer is simple\" She smiled innocently. \"Invite them to my celebration\" Your eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It takes you a moment to process the full ramifications of her words. \"You mean you're actually in danger?\" You ask, legitimate worry leaking into your voice. Reanna looks at you as you traipse, her demeanor somehow still warm as befitting the scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dissent is not something I'm unfamiliar with. That would be... unwise for someone of my influence.\" She seemed completely unfazed. \"Common enough that you coming through my window, on the same evening that a movement planned against me was by no means impossible.\" Her tone bounced with pride. \"In fact\" she raised a pointer finger to the air.\"Your arrival confirmed it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne look at your face confirmed to Reanna she had lost you. \"The guard I called to assist me. How long it took him to reach my room. How nervous he was when I had him tie you to the bed. Not because of you. Because of me.\" The bemused look didn't leave you. Reanna turned towards you and waggled her extended finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't hire novices from the city guard. Peddler's sons their first day in a suit of armor. You've seen more than enough of the men I hire. But that...\" She paused. \"Wasn't his fatal error. It was the name he gave. Informing me of Lord Austren's complaint. Why would one of my guests say anything of my absence to my guard rather than my servants? It was a threat, but of a far different nature.\" You had to admit her deduction was sound if not unnerving, although Reanna only seemed to accept the compliment she saw in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my Lady, if this Lord Austren plots against you, why reveal himself? Not to mention in such a bold manner?\" You had to know where she was going with this. \"That\" she gestures to keep walking. \"Is an excellent question\" she gives you an approving glance. \"One to which I have the answer. Lord Austren does not conspire alone.\" You had figured that, but it didn't feel any better hearing it. \"But he still put himself at risk\" you say as you reach the stairs, the gleaming white stone reaching far upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Austren is a man whose name is all he holds of his family's legacy. A man I would refuse from this gathering, circumstances or otherwise. Meaning he was coerced into such a move by one with far greater status than him. Someone who made him promises they most likely have no intention of keeping. We are talking of someone...who rivals my status.\" She looked at you with a sense of accomplishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gravity of the situation stops you short for a moment as you reach the landing. \"Are there even people in the Forazio court who hold as much power as you my lady?\" You ask, making sure to word the question correctly. Her amused expression implied her awareness of you walking on eggshells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I'd like to say otherwise I cannot. I take pride informing you there are less than ten. However, they number far too many for me to simply have someone thrown in irons.\" You reached the entrance to the manor itself. \"Thus I shall invite them all here under the pretense that I have caught whoever is responsible. A most advantageous position to hold don't you agree?\" She beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your diplomatic prowess is quite impressive my lady\" You reply, your legitimate respect of her bravery in the face of danger clear in your voice. \"Now you know why I called you an amateur\" Reanna quips with a smirk. You were in way too far over your head for that to bruise your ego. \"Well then, I shall need to make preparations for such a momentous occasion. Shall we?\" She states as before pushing the large ornate doors open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A  very valuable painting at that, the cutpurse in you mused as Reanna ushered you into a foyer draped in blue curtains and tapestries. As your eyes took a slow pan of each room you caught a glimpse of Reanna watching you with a childish smile, which you attributed to her narcissistic pride. But even you couldn't deny that touching anything in this place felt illegal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the loud footsteps of you and Reanna's retinue was all that could be heard echoing against marble, but upon entering the main hall, you could barely hear yourself think among the chattering of men and women dressed in bright white and leathers. As a group of them came towards you and began bombarding Reanna with questions it became clear they were her wait staff. As Reanna informed them of the details of her intended gala, you took the time to think of a way to slip out. As much as the idea of all the richest people in New Forazio being gathered in one place gave you fantasies of being set for life, you had already made the mistake of sticking around once and were NOT going to make it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get further into your plan than \"Wait for the party to start\" you were interupted by the sound of Reanna clearing her throat dramatically near your face. \"I will not miss my own party a second time and you will not again be the cause of it. Come now\" She grabbed your shoulder and ushered you upstairs, as you attempted to decide which bit more, her tongue or her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought down a hallway of endless bedrooms traced together by a blue carpet until you reached the largest one which took up the whole end of the hall, obviously belonging to Reanna herself. The inside of the chamber was adorned with many sun filled windows and an area that appeared to be it's own dressing room. Reanna let go of your arm, and the slight pain that shot through upon release made you realize just how tight she was holding. \"Any reason you're only chatting for the sake of wit?\" You quip as you rub the affected area. Your kneejerk reaction is to bring your hand to your mouth, panic hitting you. But to your relief, Reanna's response is calm. \"I have a part to play\" She says plain faced. \"As do you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs relieved as you are at her demeanor, you find your legs unable to move, trembling. Reanna looks down, noticing the stark movement and you see her bite her lip. She walks over and leans her back against the railing of her comically large bed. \"You're allowed to be human around me you know. I do not deny that I haven't conveyed that very well. A terrifying mien is quite necessary I'm afraid.\" She looks over to see you still frozen stiff. \"As I've very rudely mentioned I have... partners within my staff willing to... Do as I ask.\" Her expression is pained. \"Forazio is open to slaves, suffice it to say that is not what I'm looking for.\" Her grip upon the railing is much like that on your arm. You see words come to her lips, but Reanna stifles them with what appears to be legitimate anguish. Her face, now filled with color, looks at you and then away. \"I have an outfit I feel will... compliment you, if you're willing to humor me. I shall fetch servants for the preparation at once.\" Reanna makes a hurried exit of the room, and you can't decide whether her head is spinning more, or yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> You run your hand against your forehead and find that your face is warm. You settle your nerves and begin to realize how awkward you feel in Reanna's room without her. As much as your instincts tell you to bolt, the thought pangs in your head that the girl isn't a threat right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You move to the nearest windowsill and lean against it, exhaling at the cool breeze against the back of your neck. You take a moment to give Reanna's abode a closer look. Like the rest of the palace quality structure, the furnishings are adorned in gold with a blue motif, the bed against the wall to your left next to what you could only describe as a dressing chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The walls are adorned with large and small paintings depicting various grasslands and armies upon them. One of a Calvary unit catches your eye because you see what appears to be New Forazio in the background. The white wall surrounding the city, famous for fending off various barbaric vagabonds, is hard to miss. All in all, the room is quite similar to Reanna's in her estate, and you bite your lip at the irony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n However something odd strikes you. Examining it through the lens of comparison with Reanna's estate room you notice a detail. In your relatively short career of thieving whenever you broke into a residence you always checked who it belonged to, paperwork and store records. Which reminded you that when you entered Reanna's room that fateful night, whilst hiding from her you had scanned the room for a family crest, upon seeing the grandeur of the girl before you. And during your unwilling stay you had never seen one. Yet here above the painting, in the shape of a shield was two horses beside a blade in white and blue. Odder still was that there was only one. As distracted as you were during your tour, your eyeing of Reanna's valuables surely would have caught wind of this. Reanna was certainly proud of her things, so if this was her family's why hide it? You couldn't imagine a reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You turn your head to see Reanna coming with three women, carrying various sewing utensils. \"You're going to have a fitting of course\" She says to the point, but with a smile. \"Right this way please\" gestures a young girl with bright red hair. You feel uncomfortable at this whole affair but see no way out of it. The other two women begin pulling out various cloths.You walk with the red haired girl to the dressing chamber. Noticing your sheepishness, she looks towards you with a smile warm as the sun.\"I'm Sara by the way M'lady\" Her formality catches you off guard, but you then realize that to anyone who didn't see the scene outside, you're an honored guest. You're brought past enough expensive dresses, bodices and corsets to dress an army's worth of women, then finally to a panel surrounded mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If it's not too much trouble, I'll need you to undress a bit M'lady\" Sara says with apprehension, but a tone that tells you she's said it many times before. You take a deep breath, and slip your vest off, then the leather tunic underneath. You cross your arms over your bra, still trying to adjust. \"I know I'm not your usual dresser, but I'm gonna need you to work with me M'lady\" She gestures for your arms out to the sides, and after a moment you comply, as you begin to realize Sara really is as kind and genuine as she seems. She takes various measurements of your arms and shoulders. The process however becomes torturous as her fingers end up sliding along your skin. Your muscles jerk slightly each time, but you keep from saying anything. Upon measuring your stomach Sara pokes you in the side after a good 30 seconds of reprieve, and you let out an \"eep!\" without thinking. Sara looks up at your contorted face, and immediately brings a hand to her mouth. \"I'm so sorry M'lady I didn't know you were so sensitive\" She seems legitimately concerned, but also wants to giggle. \"I usually only dress Lady Reanna, so I've never had this problem before.\" The fact that Reanna wasn't as unbearably ticklish as you kind of seemed like a kick in the head, but you silenced your irritation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sara finishes her measures of your upper body with a more careful demeanor. She gives you a concerned look then gestures for you to remove the rest of your clothes. \"The rest stays, including the boots\" you say firmly \"I kind of just bought them\". Sara looks briefly puzzled, then reaffirms herself. \"Very well then M'lady, it shall be an overhead dress.\" She collects a few things in the room. \"The boots are nice, and recommended. Much of the festivities will be the garden so they won't out of place\" She says with bubbly enthusiasm. She exits the room and you spend a few minutes cupping your hands around your skin. You're amazed that Reanna has people that actually enjoy working for her. The only logical conclusion you can come to is that those moments of vulnerability Reanna's been showing are actually some warm side of her. Perhaps Sara has seen it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You're snapped from your thoughts by Sara's voice. \"Is this to your liking M'lady?\" You turn and can't believe your eyes. In front of you Sara is holding the most expensive looking garment you have EVER seen. A two tone blue dress with dizzying floral patterns down the middle, with a golden trimmed outline inside and along the torso. The ornate qualities of the material make you question wearing it. It's clear that Reanna intends to dress you as well as herself. \"It is in fact, one of Lady Reanna's garments, but I had to make some adjustments.\" Sara corrects your thoughts. \"Forgive me if I am indelicate M'lady but you have quite an... ample form\" She blushes slightly. You reaffirm your grip on your chest at the mention of your features. \"I mean it only in the highest of regards M'lady, I daresay there will be few men who do not ask for your hand tonight.\" She smiles again warmly. She slips the dress over you, and to your amazement, it feels perfect. As perfect as you can imagine a garment of of this nature feels considering you've never owned one. What magic Sara used to make one of Reanna's dresses fit you, you do not know, but you're thankful you won't be stuck in discomfort. You eye yourself up in the mirror while Sara checks the dress and the experience to you feels surreal. Sara gestures you out of the chamber and you step slowly, full of trepidation, careful not to ruin the hem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You exit the dressing chamber to find Reanna waiting in a garment equally as extravagant. \"Ahh just as perfect as I'd imagined.\" Reanna claps her hands with delight. She notices your eyes look behind her at the windows and she follows your gaze. The light from the windows has grown significantly dim, to the point of almost sunset. By your estimation you've been getting dressed for a few hours! \"It's already getting dark?\" You question out loud. Reanna chuckles and smirks and at you. \"My expertise got you ready right in time for the ball.The guests are JUST now arriving. Quite weary living my life isn't it?\" She muses. Reanna extends a hand to you. \"Come now. We have much to do, you and I\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, you anticipated her attack and roll to one side, scrambling to your feet while she flounders on the floor. In the adventure tales that inspired you to be a thief, this would be the point where you spouted a triumphant one liner and perhaps sliced your initials into her frock. You decide to forgo that for now, though, as you've got more important things on your mind. More important things like total, abject terror of the sociopath woman who seems to want to keep you prisoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA host of six or seven armoured guards burst into the small room to compound your issues. They immediately turn their attention to you and begin to draw their weapons, before the noblewoman's voice snaps out an order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her alive! No weapons!

He staggers back, pawing at his eyes and cursing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it's an impressive display, you're not out of the woods yet. There's a clear run at the window now, but it's going to be a real test of your dexterity. You begin a desperate dash for freedom, slipping by a fourth guard as you do.

Help me! There's a thief in my room! A thief! Help!\" This just makes you struggle even harder, forcing her to get off of you. She takes your shirt with over your head and over your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seize your chance to escape, but you suddenly feel some material being forced into your mouth. Apparently, she had balled up your shirt and was now using it as a gag. The doors burst open and three guards burst in, rapiers drawn. \"Are you alright, my lady?\" asks one with a helmet that made it look like he had a bowl on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks to you, Mohor,\" she snaps, \"this thief could've made it away with my brooch and who else knows what by the time you got here!

As they begin to tie you up, Mohor removes your boots and then Yanks your pants down, revealing several stolen goods (you don't care for that, you're too busy thanking that you remembered to put on clean underwear.) \"Hey, look at this haul!\" exclaims the frizzy haired guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that must be quite a pair of pants to hold all that dough,\" adds the pig faced guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lharys! Kurleket!\" their mistress barks. \"Once you've secured his upper limbs, do the same to his lower ones.\" The two oblige while your weapon is also confiscated.

The minute they're gone, the noblewoman looks up at you and shuffles seductively to you. \"Such a fine blade,\" she muses with what you think is a sociopathic smile. \"You know, I think it's sad that a handsome stud such as yourself has to resort to thievery.\" She's close enough so that you could see down her cleavage. \"Live with me and you won't have to. Or,\" she brings your dirk to your throat. You gulp as best as you can while also trying keep away from the pointy tip, \"the consequences will be grave.

The large building was three storeys high with two large wings coming out from the centre. It dominated the southern side of the Market Place, the darkened bricks giving an almost ominous feel to the place as it loomed over the smaller stalls. Entrance was forbidden to all but the Aristocracy, the young King apparently spending a great deal of his evenings while away from prying eyes. Rumours abounded as to what took place inside, the majority of the staff being female adding fuel to the fires of gossip as many wondered if the King had been ensared by the various decadent aspects that were thought to take place in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside, the building looked daunting, the only entrance on the ground floor being a large double set of doors that were guarded constantly. The door was but one entrance in and to a skilled thief such as yourself, the windows presented ample opportunities. Selecting one that was obscured from view from the Market Place, you throw a hooked rope into the air, the sound of glass breaking as it finds its target. You wait a moment to see if there's any outcries but nothing happens, the darkness of the night giving you ample cover to move up, climbing up the rope until you reach the window, clambering through and hitting the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, you scan round the room and see its largely empty, only a few dusty boxes littering it as it seemed that it had long been in disuse. Taking the rope from the window and storing it for later, you exit the room via a door that leads to a corridor. You take a breath before heading onwards, hoping to reach the fabled treasures of the Museum. Jewels were said to line the bedrooms, gold used for mere candlesticks, the very height of decadence and expensive tastes. All up for grabs for someone who was wily enough to get them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour journey up the corridor eventually comes to a fork, one leading directly ahead further along the same floor while to the left, a staircase leading directly down to the bottom floor. From it, you hear the echoes of faint screams, unable to discern much than they seem to be a mixture of male and female voices. That could lead to a party with people that might lead to treasures but at great risk. Maybe it would be safer to continue along the corridor?</span></div></div>",

The several girls are tickling the men in the room with hands, feathers, and the edges of their frilly dresses, and you realize that what you perceived as screaming is actually rather pleased laughter.

The king, old but healthy, had three children: two sons, born only an hour apart, and a daughter born a year later. It's clear that the eldest son will inherit the throne when the king passes, but there are whispers of dark plans afoot in the castle. Events will unfold during your visit, and the question is... how will you get mixed up in it, and will you be able to make it out alive in the end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom traveling so much, you have found that the law can be too slow and that sometimes it must be taken into your own hands. While exploring the world, you also serve as a vigilante of sorts, taking down criminals before they can escape. In a small oriental-styled settlement made by people from across the seas, troubles started when one of their own stole a ship and decided to become a pirate. She goes by the name of \"Ruby\" due to the color of her hair and obsession with the color of red, and she was last spotted heading west along the coast. Can you take her down, or will you become her latest prize?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour adventures led you to a secret tower in the hills where people were trained in the art of magic. Rather than killing you, or turning you into a frog, they sensed an innate ability in magic within you and decided to accept you as a trainee. Now, several years later, it is nearing the time of \"The Test\" which all students must pass before being allowed to learn more advanced spells. Let us hope you are ready for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar far far to the south, where one can boil water by merely placing it in the sun, lies a vast desert. There are rumors of an oasis somewhere within it where both your dreams and nightmares can come true. Just the smallest chance that it is true has fueled hundreds to seek it. All have found nothing. Some have never returned. Will you be the one to finally uncover the secret, or will this be your last journey?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, the paths continue...</span></div></div>",

You try to find the source, but you can barely see a foot in front of you. But now, you can't dismiss the sound: it belongs to a monstrous creature emerging from the blizzard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelp as two enormous talons seem to materialize from the snow. They grasp your outstretched arms tightly, closing down with vice-like strength. Though you can't see their owner, you can sense a massive form, just out of sight in the blinding weather. For a brief moment it feels like you're falling - your frost-bitten hands useless as you're yanked from the stone surface. You begin to scream, expecting a long fall into a snowy oblivion. But suddenly, you're floating; your entire body held aloft by the talons. Their owner must be fantastically strong; you soar through the blizzard, seeing nothing in any direction, but feeling the immense pressure from the talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my,\" croaks a feminine voice from above. \"Lost in the storm, pretty thing?\" Whoever was holding on to you was talking! The wind is whipping past you, but you try to shout a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks! I was really stuck back there,\" you yell upwards, most of your voice lost in the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature, whatever it was, merely cackled. You really did not like the sound of that laughter. It was hard to make conversation in this position, but you tried anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you taking me, ah, miss?!\" Although you see absolutely nothing, you suspected the road was not this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut again, all you heard was a cackle; especially creepy as it echoed into the raging storm.

You can't help but shiver and chatter your teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, pretty little human.\" The creature holding you tells you. \"We're almost there. I have you now, I won't let you freeze on me.\" The comment is reassuring, although you wonder a little at the 'I have you' bit. Her voice sounds like a normal woman's, although from the talons holding you she's clearly something else. And clearly larger and more powerful than you. All you can do is hope that your rescuer is benevolent, considering your held and half-frozen state, you doubt you could fend off much of anything hostile right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't have to contemplate that for long. The sky parts, and you can finally see where you're being taken. A large sheer cliff covers one side of a particularly tall mountain. And across the cliff face appear to be caves or holes of some kind leading deeper into the mountain. In some of them you can make out fires lit, and the prospect of a warm fire makes you forget everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you reach one of the cave mouths, and you feel yourself being gently dropped to the stone floor amidst the beating of mighty wings. With what little energy you have left, you crawl towards the fire, feeling the life-giving warmth on your skin and clothing. You lay there in the warmth, feeling as if you've spent the last of your strength. Now you have a moment to relax somewhere warm, you find yourself getting terribly sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting sleep, you look up to finally get a glimpse at your rescuer. She stands at almost twice your height, probably almost ten feet tall. Her skin is the pale blue, the color of the icy lakes here. Her face is actually quite pretty: snow white 'hair' of some kind of feathery material, and eyes of a steely grey. She wears very little clothing: her top is a fur lined leather garment that only serves to cover her chest; her \"pants,\" if they could be called that, are a similar fur lined item that covers her intimate parts, but completely exposes her thighs. You wonder how such a creature stays warm. But the obvious parts are the ones which are not human. Below the knees the skin becomes hard and bird-like, ending in a pair of large, sharp talons. And her arms quickly lose their human characteristics to become a very large pair of white wings. A snow harpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know much about snow harpies. And the fatigue doesn't help, as you can barely keep open your half lidded eyes. You remember hearing about their impressive size, as well as their long lifespans. There was something else, but now you can't remember it at all. Glancing up at her again, you notice that her figure is actually quite impressive. Her body looks toned but lightweight, and your eyes linger on her smooth thighs, firm stomach, and not-insignificant chest. The snow harpy sees you looking at her, and smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep now, tired little one.\" She tells you softly. \"You will have much to do tomorrow, with those hands of yours. And I am sure you will find the company of my flock to give you much smiles and laughter.\" Before you can figure out what any of that means for you, sleep finally takes you, and you fall unconscious next to the comforting warmth of the fire.</span></div></div>",

Cracking open your eyes, you find yourself in a dimly lit room. Sunlight is coming in from farther away, but just enough to see. You can't tell what time it is other than daytime. The next thing you realize is that almost all of your clothing has been removed. Clad only in your undergarments, you feel some kind of fine wool blanket underneath you. You would expect to be cold like this, with no blanket to cover you, just one below. But something large and warm is pressed against you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snow harpy. Now you remember. Opening your eyes fully, you see white wings in front of you, wrapping you in a gentle embrace. That warm feeling is a harpy cuddling against you, spooning your sleeping form. Obviously, the larger creature would be the big spoon. Her skin is quite warm, enough to keep you comfortable despite the arctic conditions. You can feel her form pressed against yours, her bare chest pressed against your back\u2026 ah, now that's a sensation you can't easily ignore. The harpy's soft, warm breasts, which given her Amazonian stature feel quite large to you, rub against your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to wriggle your way out of her grip without waking her. However, that's easier said than done. Even asleep, those large, feathery arms are still stronger than your own. Slowly inching your way out, the harpy stirs in her sleep, and with a sleepy mutter her grip on you shifts. In doing so, the feathery wings brush along your front. The feel of those feathers against your bare stomach causes you to flinch and catch your breath. It tickles! You try to remain motionless for a minute to maintain your composure. You knew you were ticklish, but you were sure it wasn't that bad! That absent minded little stroke almost made you laugh out loud. You try not to think about what the harpy could do if she tried to tickle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Finally awake, little  one?\" The harpy hugging you says sleepily. Apparently your efforts to get out of her grasp undetected were a failure. \"You were asleep for some time, through the day and the night. I am the second to share a bed with you.\" She says, and gently let's you out of her grip. Sitting up, you turn around to look at the harpy as she stretches lazily. She's not the one who rescued you, you can tell that much. This one is shorter, although still around eight feet tall. Her 'hair' and feathers aren't just white, but also speckled with little black spots. Her skin is also a deeper shade of blue than the harpy from before, and you notice a bit of freckles on her face and chest. Which also reminds you of the fact that her only clothing right now is a pair of fur lined shorts. Her firm breasts hand tantalizingly in the air as she stretches, and impossible not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head to clear your thoughts. \"Where are my clothes? And what am I doing here?\" you ask her, getting straight to the point. The harpy grins at you, and you note that she seems younger than the first one. If she were a normal human woman, you'd say she'd be in her early 20's. But you can't say how old she actually is. For all you know, she could be 100.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your tattered coverings? Those won't do you much good anymore. I'm surprised you made it as high up the mountains as you did with them.\" She tells you. You begin to wonder what you're going to do about clothing, but she continues. \"And Zriya saved your life. Which means you belong to our flock now! You'll help us do things only hands can do, and we'll take care of you!\" The harpy continues happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan, your world swimming. You're property of this harpy clan? This trip hasn't gone at all like you expected. The shock of it makes you feel light-headed, and reminds you that you can't even remember the last time you've eaten. You feel yourself falling over-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-And quickly coming to, now in the concerned embrace of the harpy girl. She looks down at you with a worried expression on her face and hugs you close to her. Her warm skin feels so nice against your own, and you notice your face is pressed against her large and irresistible bosom. Perhaps your predicament isn't as bad as you originally thought. This harpy seems to be genuinely interested in your well being, and there are some definite perks here. Another distraction also presents itself, as you notice her feathers brushing against your bare back. Each little movement brings with it a new ticklish feeling, each stronger than the last. You can't help but start to grin. If you stay in this embrace too long, it might tickle beyond your ability to keep your composure. </span></div></div>",

The talons hurt, and you were woozy from the high height and lack of clear vision. You didn't know what was going on, but you remember, before blacking out, the word...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hydro...\" The voice that said it was feminine, but you couldn't catch the rest. When you heard the word, you felt a great splash of water send you and the harpy careening into the snow drifts. You then saw a fuzzy figure...with blonde hair sticking out of a hood...and green eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly lift yourself up. You see all your things near you in a neat pile, with your chest (And, if female, breasts) covered in medical tape. your shoulders bear the same. You bring a hand to your face and rub your head. Despite the fact you can tell you are still on the mountain, you only feel a slight chill despite your lack of clothing. You then realize with a start there is a fire near you. It is warm and bright, as is the figure next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then you notice the girl. She has a fuzzy black cap on, with green eyes and pale skin. She has delicate hands that spew fire (Indicating her magical talent) and is wearing a fuzzy undershirt. Next to her is the same cloak you saw earlier. Her feet are bare and look incredibly soft and smooth, and her face bears a great smile when she sees you. \"Is good! You're awake! Now I just find Mario, we finish the mining, and we go outpost.\" She said plainly, as if it made sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, knowing this place a little, soon does. This must be Edea, the leader of the Eisbrecher Outpost. Her Staltean accent is a dead give away- she and her brother Mario who only made the outpost five years ago. Five years ago was also the time the two semi known individuals found each other again- Edea had lived most her life in Stalt. She was a powerful and kind mage, known to practically hand out jobs only to do most of the work for her employees, giving them money even if they did nothing useful so long as they showed effort in helping them mine for ores or help rid the mountain of beasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You caught by snow harpy. That no good.\" She said, shaking her head. \"I save you with hydrotorrent. It very good water spell! Knock harpy down flat! I let harpy off with stern warning, know that it go to flock and tell about me and how it unwise to hurt humans and elves and other bipedial wanderers, da!\" She said happily. \"I then heal you. I outside, enjoying snow at time, Mario in cave mining. I bring you deep in then when I heal you.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Thank you.\" You say honestly. You feel lucky such a thing happened. \"So...we are just waiting for your brother then?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da. He carry you to outpost. He strong like me!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you prepare to tickle even more, a thought comes to you. \"You said I could ask whatever I wanted, right?\" You asked the woman, curious about something. She looked at you, a seductive smirk on her face.<br>\r\n\"So long as you work it out of me. I'm very tight lipped and it's hard to get information out of me. But I'll give you an answer for free, this time.\" She explained.<br>\r\nShrugging, you decide to ask the obvious question. \"I've annoyed your yeti. I've made my capture incredibly difficult for you. We've been one upping each other for at least an hour or two. So...why do you want me to do this to you? Isn't this the equivalent of giving in?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n\"I remind you who has ice around their neck. No, I'm in control here. I just...I like your ingenuity. You're not an idiot. At this point, most people either escaped, only for me to have my yeti quiet them, or they were already eaten. You weren't. You kept pulling new tricks. And honestly, that's rather impressive. I think little of many people, but I know when there's someone who deserves slight respect. In all honesty, if you were to bind me enough, I'd still be able to stop you if I didn't want you to escape. There are few in this region with magic as great as mine. The Castle proper has SOME magicians who could stand up to me, and there's the outpost with that Edea woman...But not many mages match my skill. So I don't feel threatened at all. That being said, if you were to give me a good time, I might give you a choice on whether you can leave or stay.\" She said. <br>\r\n\"It might please you to know I don't believe you to be working with the princes anymore. No, they'd be less subtle about wanting me dead. I know secrets about them that no one else does. I should: I'm not exactly human, and have lived...longer than most, though by your scale of time, I'd be in my....mid-twenties, I'd think. As a matter of fact, I do believe I could be of much aid to you if you make it worth my while. Arcane magic to teach, frozen friends, help going through the mountain...\" She offered, waving her hand. \"That being said, though, I believe I've answered your question.\"<br>\r\n\"You've told me you like me and that I'm no threat to you. You never told me why you let me do this.\" You said, smiling.<br>\r\n\"....\" The Ice Queen blushed. \"When I said I'd ruin you, that was more...spur of the moment, filth.\" You sigh, having hoped she'd eventually not call you that. \"You see...I love my darling Cedric. He's a sweet Yeti...but he isn't what I always want, you know? You are a son/daughter of man, much like myself. I can relate to you. As powerful as I am, the country hates me because of horrid rumors spread about me. I could kill many of my opponents, but there's a reason I only send Cedric to eat more...recent villages. I...I know these people. Well, I knew their grandparents. I can't bring myself to kill old citizens, but people such as yourself, new to the territory...well, you almost got eaten. But you prevailed, and now...I'd like human interaction of the more...physical kind.\" She blushes further. \"I mean not sex! That's rather extreme, but...I've always wanted to submit a bit. Being an ancient Duchess does that to you.\"<br>\r\nYou look at her, processing all she just said. \"...Wait, you're a-\"<br>\r\n\"Of course there are legends. The sickly King's Grandmother, the last Queen...she had a sister who was not born normal but one day disappeared as a child. Her name was Hilda, and she was said to grow slowly due to her magic. It was the indication she'd be a mage of awesome power in adulthood, but still, she'd grow at only a fourth of how normal humans would. Hilda didn't disappear. The Queen's mother didn't want to kill Hilda, but she feared that Hilda would grow too powerful and would start doing...unpopular things for the kingdom. So, she left her on a cold mountain, hoping she'd die, or would get away but forget her life...She never thought a Yeti would find the duchess, take her as a child, bear a son that would be like a brother to Hilda, and would then die, leaving Cedric and Hilda to live life in a cave here. Of course, legends say something quite different, but the Princes know the truth. Can you make a guess as to why they want me dead?\"<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment. Considering all this was true...<br>\r\n\"If you are alive, and you decided they didn't rule well enough, they fear you would take the throne, which you could then do with magic and proof of your identity. If you are of Eisbrecher royalty, you could summon a sigil on your left foot, correct?\" As if on cue, she lifted her left foot...and you saw the sigil. It was a well-known mark for the royalty. <br>\r\n\"Do not mistake me: Vals and Caljer are getting hunters to kill beasts of the mountain to legitimately help the people. I've heard talk they even wish to help other kingdoms with their problems to establish a friendship of sorts. There are rumors they wish to help the Coninze and Rylestia kingdoms stop their fighting and come to a peaceful consensus, and they wish to help catch the Pirate Queen...Sapphire...? Emerald...?\"<br>\r\n\"Ruby.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, her. But they also want me dead in case I want to take the throne. SO, to make this long story short...I want you to bind and have fun with me because you're the only human in the region that will, and further, because you deserve it after your perseverance, filth.\" Hilda said.<br>\r\n\"...Could you please stop calling me filth, Hilda...?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"I'll think on it. MeanwhilehehehehehahAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA! Good, y-youhohohoho take initiative raahahhahahahther wehehehehehelll!\" She said, laughing as you continued to tickle her.</span></div></div>",

After you have finished sucking on her toes you turn around and lean in close to her. \"That is ok, I just wanna hear you laugh anyway\", you say with a grin before tickling her armpits against, causing her flushed face to erupt with laughter.

In her hand was a fireball, and she was covered in tons of fur despite her obvious magical power making it easy for her to heat herself up. She was clearly a mage. You couldn't see much, though she was taller than you, had on warm, fuzzy boots that tickles you slightly, and bright green eyes. She was smiling warmly, contrasting well with that fact she essentially just called your mother a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edea, this man/woman was found in the snow.\" Another man said. He was gruff and tall, but was also smiling warmly. He was dressed similarly to Edea. He had green eyes as well, and, judging by his height, you guessed that Edea and this man were siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario, this person...make good helper, ya?\" She asked, eyeing the the man. Then you started to remember. There was an outpost on the mountain controlled by a well known mage by the name of Edea, her brother Mario being her second in command. They owned the outpost to help travelers, though they were also famous for hunting dangerous creatures and mining for precious gems to donate to their country. Edea herself had spent most of her life to the far north in Stalt, and had quickly picked up the accent, while her brother Mario lived down south in Qur. They had only about five years ago built the outpost, though already they ran a brisk business. They were also well known for their teamwork; Edea considered the brains and Mario the brawn, though both were quite powerful and wise. In fact, they alone were able to stop a Rylestian advance from invading the Kingdom of Eisbrecher, Edea using her magic to conjure an extreme snowstorm and Mario using his brute strength and the cover of the snow to down dozens of troops. While they were by no means unstoppable, they were great warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir skills in battle were surpassed only by their love for adventure and their kindness. They often offered jobs to those who needed it at the outpost, letting them help 'carry the gems' they mined (Despite both of them being easily able to do it themselves) or battle monsters with them (with them doing most of the work.) As long as you showed a good work ethic, they were willing to pay you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Mario spoke up. \"The lucky thin skin survived a yeti's punch. I think he/she could be great help. If they want, that is.\" He said, smiling at you. \"Letting him/her help us mine is the least we could do after the rough trip up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush. Though the outpost is on the way to Eisbrecher, it's only the quickest way up coming from Rylestia...the OPPOSITE side you came from. \"Um, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is good idea Mario! Is good idea!\" Edea said cheerily patting your back. \"Oh, rock in boot...\" She said, shaking off her boot and quickly tugging off her stockings. Her feet looked smooth and well kept- perfect for tickling. \"So, traveler, you help us, or you go on to Eisbrecher, da? We already check your belongings- you not enemy. You go if you wish.\" She said.</span></div></div>",

That reminds me, we're gonna be heading out first thing in the morning. Not sure if your head is going to be healed up by then though.\" You all frown a little at that. \"Well, I'm sure you'll be fine. It's not like we have much of a choice. No one is allowed here if Edea or I aren't here.\" He sighs. \"Sorry you're getting such a rough entry to the job. You still want it?\" You hesitantly nod your head yes. \"Alright. Well I've gotta go check on the other workers. You should stay here and get as much rest as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then abruptly sits up and walks out with a small wave. You sigh worriedly about your predicament as Edea sits down. \"You very sure da? Bad wound. Two days till wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod weakly. \"Yeah, I'll be okay. I'm sure other workers got worse injuries and kept working. No use in slacking off as soon as I get the job right?\" She regards you concernedly before she spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crazy. Is good though. Fit in here.\" She said with a wide smile. You smiled right back. About an hour later, you were talking and laughing at each other's crazy stories. \"You really be to Dormduo? Lucky offspring of bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was really there looking for treasure! Didn't get any though. Anything left was well guarded.\" You leave out the part about how when you tried to fight past the guardians, you were tickled out of your wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun! I like go on adventure too.\" She then looked up at the ceiling and put her feet up on the bed. Bare you might add, as at some point during the hour she had removed her other boot and stockings. You couldn't help but admire the smooth, ticklish looking feet that were almost in your lap. Edea seemed to be lost in her daydreaming and didn't notice your stares. You might as well get a quick tickle in you thought. You doubt she'd be mad about one or two strokes and you might not get another chance. You then reach down with your hand and rake your fingernails across her sole. The reaction was immediate. She gave a very loud squeal and her feet darted back to her as she looked at you with a surprised look that quickly turned amused and playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ticklish are we?\" You said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked right back. \"Da. Feet and armpits worst. Everywhere bad however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? So if I were to do this?\" Your hands darted out quickly and tickled her armpits, to which she responded by squealing and begging you to stop. Never once did she cast a spell though. You give her a moment to breathe in which she smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I right back.\" She says before she leaves the room.

You recognized a pattern in her attacks before; everytime she attacks a town, she then docks somewhere to reward her crew and find more members if any were killed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the middle of the night when you finally arrive at the port town and find out that you were entirely correct. Rocking gently in the docks is her ship, the \"Red Devil.\" Even at the edges of town you can hear the raucus coming from the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering your eyes to appear as though you are just an innocent traveler, you quietly make your way to the three-story-tall tavern and duck into an alley beside it. You peek into one of the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the tavern is filled with an assortment of ruffians, hooligans, and just plain not-very-nice people.The rum was flowing more quickly than a river, and even though barmaids were being pinched and grabbed left-and-right, the bartender didn't seem to mind as the coins piled up on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement towards the stairs inside catches your eye. You position yourself to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescending down the stairs are four beautiful women, each wearing identical red blouses, black trousers, and black corsets, with their jolly roger emblazoned on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are Ruby's elite. The ones she taught all her tricks to so that they would always be able to keep up with her should trouble arise. If they are coming from upstairs, then most likely Ruby is up on the second or third floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf luck is on your side, she may even be alone. If your luck was good, perhaps you can even capture her and escape without anyone downstairs noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see there is a downspout leading all the way up to the raingutter on the rooftop. Perhaps it can support your weight. You rest a hand on the sword at your hip as you ponder your choices.</span></div></div>",

Looking around quickly, you take in your surroundings. You're in a large, open room with three doors: one appearing to lead back outside, one with a note pinned to the door, and the last seeming to be locked, with a large and menacing keyhole. Against the other wall is a window, and a hammock gently swinging beneath it. But inside the hammock is another pirate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach for your sword, but as you do you notice she seems to be fast asleep. A near empty bottle of rum is on the floor below her; she appears to have passed out from a night of heavy drinking. Some guard... you take a closer look, confident she won't wake up. Her corset lies on the floor next to her bottle, wearing just the red blouse and black trousers of Ruby's elite guard. You can see why she decided to, after all that rum, the hot summer night must have gotten unbearable. A light sheen of sweat coats her olive skin; strands of her short, black hair clinging to her face. Her blouse is crumpled and bunched from fitful sleep, revealing her fit, smooth midriff. Her boots also rest on the floor in a heap, her bare soles airing themselves in by the window. She's quite vulnerable, and likely not a threat to you tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiptoeing to the door with the note, you see its a command from Ruby to her lackeys: \"No one is the enter Mesmera's room but Ruby. Anyone entering will have to deal with the consequences!\" You wonder what this means... who is this Mesmera? And why can't anyone enter her room? She might have valuables in the room, or maybe she's someone valuable to Ruby... maybe you could make her turn her self in exchange for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to the other door. You could peek through the keyhole and see what's inside, it might be big enough. While looking through the keyhole, you'll be exposing yourself to attack. The sleeping pirate doesn't seem like a threat, but you're not completely sure. She also might have the key to the lock. At a glance, you can't see it anywhere on her, but that doesn't mean she isn't hiding it somehow. What to do?</span></div></div>",

Either way, someone's room whom only Ruby is allowed to enter must be very important, and that alone is worth investigating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the handle slowly, you open the door just enough to peek your head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the door is a much smaller, windowless room. It looks more like a storage room than anything, judging by the stacks of crates and small boxes. A single lit candle rests on one of the crates, casting a soft orange glow and long, flickering shadows. You almost shut the door to investigate the keyhole when a flash of color catches your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the corner of the room, with her legs curled to one side, is a woman in a torn sky-blue gown, with her hands clasped together in her lap. Her eyes are closed, undoubtedly she is asleep. It hangs off of one shoulder, and there is a long slash going down the side starting from the hip, allowing you quite a good view of her long legs and the sandals on her feet. Long, curly blonde hair tumbles down her head and frames her pale face. Her skin is usually light for the area; she must not be native to these parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to look over her form, you realize that her hands are clasped against her will. A thin leather cord is wrapped around her wrists. Mesmera's a captive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the door open and slip inside before shutting it behind you, then quickly move over to her side and place a hand on her bare shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst... wake up... c'mon, let's get you out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmera stirs and slowly opens her eyes. They're a striking sea green color, and as she takes notice of you, she gasps and quickly brings her hands up towards your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alej'ha kon dru'bara!\" she says. Suddenly, her hands light up in a bright white flash. You recoil and shield your eyes with one arm, momentarilly blinded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH! What the hell, woman?!\" you exclaim. After a few seconds, you slowly bring your arm down, and this time it's your turn to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're no longer in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you don't even seem to be on the same plane of existance anymore. All around you, even under your own two feet, is white mist. What is going on?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain makes the connection before you realize it. Mesmera. Some kind of magic. She was a Mesmer, an enchantress of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calm down immensely and straighten up now that you have a sense of your situation. What you're experiening is an illusion. Everything is in your mind. The spell will pass when the enchantment is finished, or if she releases you from it herself. Why Ruby wants her, you aren't sure exactly, but her abilities would greatly benefit anyone. In the mean time, you have to make do in this strange world that your mind thinks you are in.</span></div></div>",

She knew you liked the tickling, both in and out of reality, and she was making sure she could always capitalize on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with a clear head, Mesmera stood before you, smiling sweetly. \"Dear, you're fine again! Great. The gag is out, so when you wish to speak, do so. As for your reward for saving me...well, life being the recipient of endless pleasure...and tickling. You should be honored! For a Mesmer to offer this means that we truly owe you everything. Slavery isn't bad when the slave likes it, yes?...Of course...if you don't like this, you can just ask for me to let you go. At that point, I'll break your mind a bit so you forget where I live. So, dear...freedom or pleasure?\" She asked, getting straight to the point.</span></div></div>",

Then you slowly tie her wrists and pull them, extremely carefully, up over her head, attaching that rope to the other end of the hammock. Once that's taken care of, you grab a worn knee sock near one of the discarded boots and work it slowly and gently between her teeth, drawing the ends up behind her head, and, eager to surprise the luckless woman, knot it roughly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pirate's eyes fly open, clear and murderous, without any hint of inebriation. Thank the gods you didn't accidentally wake her <i>before </i>she was restrained! Quickly realizing her situation, the bound pirate starts bucking and thrashing wildly, shouting likely unkind things into her gag, but the noise is easily swallowed up by the clamor of raucous partying downstairs. Soon the frenzied woman is covered in sweat and spittle and quite totally exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouch in a shadowy corner near the door to the hall and wait. You don't have to wait long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy, unsteady footsteps approach and the door is flung clumsily open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ztrella!\" A female voice shouts, \"you musht cm dnstairs! <i>Hic </i>The celembration's jsht got started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huzzah! huzzah!\" a second voice intones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women, stumble arm-in-arm, into the room, one of them waving a sloshing bottle of grog, both wearing the unmistakable garb of Ruby's finest toughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZtrella, the pirate bound and gagged in the hammock, renews her struggling and indecipherable shouting at the sight of her approaching comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, don't whine about it! Back into your boots and come with us!\" slurs one of the pirates, wavering over her trussed up friend on unsteady legs. \"How on Zenith did you get all caught up in yer hammock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And gagged with your sock?\" Asks the other pirate, staring sideways at her struggling friend, as her drunken mind labors almost audibly to piece together the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before that happens you're looming behind the two soused sailors and a quick expert hand chop to the nape of their necks sends them both sprawling to the floor unconscious. Ztrella groans and rolls her eyes as you beam her a dashing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon both women are tightly hogtied with the laces from their corsets, and their mouths well stuffed and gagged with their own socks. That leaves just one more guard to take care of before you can face Ruby on more or less equal footing. You slink back to the shadows near the door and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly nod off a time or two waiting long into the early morning before you hear another set of footsteps, dragging and unsteady, approach the room. The door whines weakly open and the fourth of Ruby's elite squad stumbles sleepily in, tugging off her corset and kicking her boots away as she walks. She grunts and spins, nearly toppling as she pries her tunic over her head and tosses it to the floor. One hand working at her belt she trips over one of her hogtied companions, who barely stirs in her drunken bondage, and spills head first into hammock, falling immediately, soundly to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stifle a giggle at the sight of the passed out buccaneer, barefoot and topless, with her pants hanging loosely around her waist, kneeling face down in the netting of her hammock. And while it's unlikely she'll wake up any time soon, you don't hesitate to gag her and maneuver her into a hogtie next to her similarly disposed friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with the few remaining hours before daybreak, you can apprehend Ruby with much less difficulty! Of course, you could also take a quick peek at the locked door or Mesmera's room first ...</span></div></div>",

And of these only one room stinks of grog and sea water, although the audible snoring from within is very coarse indeed; perhaps the pirate has a bed companion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unlocked door creaks quietly open and you tiptoe into the suite, closing the door behind you. The incongruity of the situation coaxes a snort of laughter from your throat:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprawled out on a large, pillow-laden bed near the window, outlined in the soft, early morning light, is one of the most fetching women you've ever seen, completely nude and snoring like a woodsman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a good long look at her, as you quietly approach; a well-shaped athletic body, smaller than you would have expected for a pirate queen, her limbs deeply tanned in high contrast to her chest and loins which are glaringly pale. Her pert breasts rise and shudder with each powerful snore and a huge tangle of crimson hair frames her surprisingly soft face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't appear to have any weapons on her, and only a lone scimitar sits sheathed against the headboard. You grab the scimitar and unsheathe it with a keen-sounding ring. You place the blade softly across the sleeping pirate's neck and the snoring immediately ceases. Ruby's eyes fly open and focus threateningly on you, but her body remains statue-still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Sea Terror,\" you whisper, \"please don't make a sound. The pay is the same one way or the other, but I'd hate to make a mess of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith agility that worries you slightly, Ruby turns her left hand over, revealing a small crystal, trimmed in brass; she clicks it with her thumb several times, and each click causes the crystal to flash dimly. Ruby says nothing, but smiles smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an awkward and confusing moment, you realize the crystal is some kind of signaling device; no doubt for her elite guard, safely bound and gagged below you. You stifle a laugh, carefully taking a rolled-up knee sock from the foot of the bed as the smile fades slowly from the pirate's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just you and me, I'm afraid,\" you say, lifting the blade a few comforting inches from Ruby's throat. \"Let's make this easy. Drop that silly crystal and put this sock in your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss the crumpled, striped stocking onto the bed near Ruby's right hand, and steady the scimitar at her; close enough to worry her, but far enough away to allow some breathing room.

Your eyes land on a fortuitous coil of coarse rope, piled on the table, amid sea charts and maritime bric-a-brac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch wide toward the table, not wanting the blade of the scimitar to stray too far from your bounty, managing to just reach a rope end and pull the coil from the table with a light thump. Ruby meanwhile complying, with her face down in a mess of pillows and crimson locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClumsily, you work the rope-end into a cinch, looping it around Ruby's wrists and pulling it tight before setting the scimitar down and quickly straddling the pirate's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled grunts and groans punctuate your ropework, as you bind her wrists in several knots, before coiling the rope around her waist and up between her legs, inducing an angry squeal from the pirate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her hands are safely tied to her waist, you use the rest of the rope to bind her ankles, taking special note of her oddly virgin-soft soles, and painstakingly manicured toes. Lasciviously distracted, you somehow manage to tie her dainty legs, leaving her just enough room to hobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand her up, admiring your work and her figure; she fidgets a bit, tugging uncomfortably at the rope between her legs. Once you're satisfied that none of the knots will give, you start to work on a plan to get the fugitive to the local garrison and collect your reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the pirate out of the inn is going to be the toughest part, you think; the innkeeper probably won't be too thrilled to find one of their patron's being led around bound and gagged and naked. And there are probably several ruffians staying here loyal to the Crimson Scourge. Of course, no pirate loyalty is without a price, and you've got four elite guards and potentially a ship as bargaining chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it might be ideal to avoid the front door altogether.

Especially not while carrying Ruby, and all the rope was being used to restrain her. Whatever you were going to do, you had to do it fast. Time wasn't on your side. Eventually one of Ruby's grunts would notice the absence of her and her elite guard and come looking. After tying up Ruby and her elite guard, there was no way that would end well. You looked around the room for something to use like a rope. Maps, the bed, navigation utensils, her journal...wait...the bed, and all those blankets and pillowcases! That was it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to the bed, and begun pulling the blankets, sheets and pillow cases off. You made Ruby lay down as you tie a blanket to her, ignoring her look of confusion, as you began the things from the bed to each other to form a makeshift rope. You even tear down the curtains from the window. When you were done, you tie the end not tied to Ruby to the bed post, and look down. It's a bit of a stretch, but you think it'll do. You attach the sheathed scimitar to your belt and pick Ruby up, bridal style. She gives out several muffled protests and squirms around a lot when you try to get her out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't squirm around too much Red. That's a painful fall.\" Her eyes widened in terror and she stopped squirming immediately. You grabbed the blanket rope and slowly lowered her down to the ground. When it was as far stretched as it was going to get, you climbed out the window and down rope. You had a few moments when you thought it was break, but you got down to ground level, unsheathed the scimitar and cut the blanket. Wincing as you heard Ruby's grunt, you resheathed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I know I'm kind of abducting you so I can turn you in for bounty money, but I AM sorry about that. I'm just short on time.\" You then pick her up bridal style again and start running. But where are you going to turn her in at? Your original plan was to turn her in at the local garrison, but the fact that you have a beautiful, naked woman bouncing up and down in your arms makes you regret not having some time alone to play with your prize. If you were to run back to your camp in the nearby forest, you doubt any of her goons would be able to track you. You could have a night of fun and then return her in the morning right? Of course by then, her crew might be all over town, ready to intercept the two of you. And that will be unpleasant. What will you do?</span></div></div>",

With a  few times almost swearing you felt the touch of bare skin swiping past your fingertips, you soon felt your knees giving way as legs buckled, sending you kneelin.  Chuckling with ticklish mirth as your former captive confiscated your blade with a soft twist of your wrist, you felt yourself groan as your back hit the ground, the raucous pirate straddling your hips with a sultry smile, already fiddling with your top buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, your hands made a move to push her off, only to stop short of her sharp gaze. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to look closely at you before, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For all we know, that woman could have been your unfortunate victim, barely escaping your clutches while you clumsily fumbled in your own trap?\u201d As you hesitated with your answer at recognizing there was some truth in her words, you tried to think of a way to convince the princess of Ruby\u2019s wanted status, cursing that you had left your supplies back at the camp in your haste. \u201cI have the Pirate Queen Ruby\u2019s wanted poster in my bag, a short distance away.

Finally noticing the carrier of the lantern had disappeared, you yelped as the maid pulled your wrists to the ground from behind your hanging form, pulling your upper body taut. \u201cWhile I would love to help apprehend a potential criminal\u2026 I must make sure that I too, am not being tricked.\u201d Finally revealing what she had hidden behind her back, you see the blonde bring out a fluffy black feather duster from hehind, a glint of mischievousness in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait\u2026 You aren\u2019t seriously going to-Nnngghhh!\u201d Biting your lips as the fronds made contact with the small amount of exposed skin on your hips; the princess gave your shirt a small tug, leaving gravity to do its job.

However, the female royal merely giggled at your efforts, finding new sport of your attempts to shy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusting lightly over your taut belly, it wasn\u2019t long until the dam collapsed as a few fronds slipped into your navel. Giggling along with you, Elenor toyed in the new-found spot before dipping down into your shirt, fluffing the downy instrument across your bare chest.

You seize up and let out a surprised yell when you feel the handmaid's unpainted but sharp fingernails wrap around your sides from behind and dig into the soft flesh at your waist. She's clearly taking an opportunity to enjoy herself as well, having affixed your hands to the ground so your body is taut and she doesn't need to hold you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour laughter jumps another octave when you feel your pants getting yanked down (or rather, up, since you're upside-down) and the feather duster begins to peruse your butt daintily but determinedly.

Unfortunately, you recognized that voice, along with the fiery hair illuminated by the light of the lantern in your upside-down vision. \u201cRuby! H-How long were you there?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPipe down, you <i>ticklish bandit</i>.\u201d Unwinding two coils of rope from her shoulders; you guessed that Ruby had doubled back to your camp while you were distracted by the princess and her maid, seeing as that rope had belonged in your pack in the first place. Propping the unconscious maid against the trunk of the tree you were hanging on, the pirate got to work, wrapping one of the coils around the width of the trunk and around Hilda\u2019s arms and waist. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t expect fortune to favor me. To think I would find someone as gullible as her just wondering in the woods!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the person in question, you could only watch as Ruby bound both of Elenor\u2019s wrists together while leaving a long stretch of it unused. Using the branch you were hanging by as leverage, your captor tossed said end of the rope over it, hoisting the blonde\u2019s unconscious form up with her arms pulled above her head before tying the loose end to the handle of her scimitar, previously forgotten and stuck fast in the ground where you lost grip of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. Now, let\u2019s have some answers. Starting with\u2026 you.\u201d Giving the discarded feather duster a quick fluff, Ruby dragged its length along your exposed stomach to your giggling chagrin before moving to where the maid was tied up. Gently swishing the feathery tool along Hilda\u2019s exposed collarbone, a small smile appeared on her sleeping lips as the woman giggled softly in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile I would like to play with all to my heart\u2019s content, unfortunately I need to be back of my ship before she sails.\u201d Abandoning the soft-spoken approach for now, Ruby gently laid the feather on the ground before digging one finger each into Hilda\u2019s clamped arms, drilling into her hollows. As the poor girl woke up with a shriek, you could only feel pity as she quickly dissolved into bubbly giggles. \u201cWaahahahaaa?! Waahhahaaat\u2019s going on! Quit it! It teehheheeeheeckles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but I\u2019m not going to stop until you answer my questions. Who is that other girl you\u2019re accompanying?\u201d Biting her lip as she valiantly fought to keep her employer a secret, all was useless before Ruby\u2019s masterful tickling techniques. In just a few minutes, the pirate had discovered to Hilda\u2019s despair that two feet held in an arm lock made for much ticklish laughter. \u201cI geheheheeeeve! She\u2019s Eeeheheheeelenor! Princess of the neighboring Coninze kingdom! Now pleehheeeheeese! No more, no more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of her prize as Hilda gratefully swallowed huge breathes of fresh air, Ruby placed a finger on her chin, her thoughts racing to connect the dots. \u201cAnd pray tell, what is a royal like her doing all the way out here? Shouldn\u2019t she be playing tea with all the others of her kind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from Ruby\u2019s sharp gaze, Hilda mumbled underneath her breath. \u201cI can\u2019t exactly say\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, what\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wait no-eeheheheheeee! She just wanted to see the county side, so Princess Eleeeheheeheenor snuck out of the cahahahahaaastle! Gaahahahaaaa!\u201d As the twin fingers stopped their assault of her ticklish hollows once more,  Hilda could only sink her giggling head low at feeling betrayal of her vassal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA runaway Princess eh\u2026 I wonder how much the Rylestions would pay if I sold her\u2026 Or would it be more wiser to return her as random to the Coninzens?

Did you have a good sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning as her pretty eyelids fluttered open, the blonde was surprisingly quick on the uptake as her look of surprise was quickly replaced by one of anger at seeing Hilda\u2019s flushed face and her own predicament. \u201cYou! Let me out of this right now! I\u2019ll have you know that I am the-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoyal Princess of Coninze? Your sensitive retainer told me after I had a go of those cute feet. But I digress, your majesty. Let this humble knave turn that frown <i>upside down</i>.\u201d Grinning maliciously before lightly dusting the exposed top of the blonde\u2019s chest, you slowly saw Elenor\u2019s frown softening as her breathing started to turn ragged, the small grit of her teeth eventually curling into a soft smile. As Ruby continued to dust along the sides of the royal princess\u2019 slightly jiggling chest while humming to herself, even Elenor\u2019s defiance slowly begun to break down as a forced grin became plastered on her cherry lips, the slightest of snickers and chuckles now began to slip free at Ruby\u2019s dogged persistence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch lovely clothes\u2026 I wonder how much they\u2019ll fetch if I sold them on the black market?\u201d Trailing the duster along her arms before attacking the taut hollows, Elenor spluttered out into squeals and giggles as her feet swung wildly in the air, unamused at having her own tool used against her even as she grinned wider. \u201cLeheheheeeeet me gooo! I\u2019ll lock you in my stocks dahahahahhaays when I get out-eehehahahahaaa!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a bark of laughter to join Elenor\u2019s own, Ruby merely ramped up her efforts as the latter\u2019s laughter grew an octave higher. \u201cI suppose that all I have to do is to not get caught, isn\u2019t it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling aloud as the crimson pirate brought the duster back to the front of her pink dress\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wait\u2026 This could work\u2026 Oh yes, this could definitely work\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot liking the sound of where this was going, you could only watch as Ruby quickly stripped the male down to his boxers, to both Hilda\u2019s and Elenor\u2019s turned away, blushing faces. Slipping into the worn-out leather pants with ease, the pirate grumbled as she barely managed to button up the white undershirt before putting on the cloth vest. Judging by the strain on the front of her shirt, it could be clearly seen that it was most definitely meant to be worn on a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will have to do. Now, here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Both of you, the Princess and the Bounty Hunter.\u201d Perking up at being addressed by your captor, Ruby gave you both a devious grin. \u201cI\u2019m sure that your royal highness\u2019 carriage is nearby, so I\u2019m going to bring you both with me. When we get back to city, your highness is going to tell the guards to let us through. From there, I\u2019ll scuttle you onto my ship.

Surely you can\u2019t be leaving them here!\u201d Rolling her eyes as she cut the princess down, the latter letting out a cry of pain as she was unceremoniously dropped to the dirt floor, Ruby deftly tugged on the rope to drag the royal to her feet. \u201cOf course I\u2019m leaving them here. Do you see any point for me to bring them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elenor tried to stammer an answer, you felt a swish of air at your feet before your head hit the ground, groaning as the blood now rushed away from your head. \u201cAnd you, Bounty Hunter. I\u2019ll be sure to let my crew have their fun breaking you down. I\u2019m sure they would love a new toy to ease their boredom on the high seas.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s only if I let you capture me!\u201d Digging your feet into the ground as you head-butted the pirate, Ruby let out a surprised grunt as the both of you fell to the ground once more. Cursing your tied up hands as you straddled her stomach, facing her feet as your fingers clumsily tried to grab at them, you only managed to get a few snickers from Ruby\u2019s lips before your captor retaliated in full force, pulling what was left of your pants down before spider-tickling all ten of her digits on your bare bottoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwittingly  serving the crimson devil the perfect opportunity for a counter-attack on a silver platter, your giggles quickly shot past Ruby\u2019s own in volume with each passing second. Soon, your futile attempt at resistance was shot down as you were reduced to a hysterical wreck as you vainly wriggled your butt in front of Ruby\u2019s face like an idiot, your tickler haughtily laughing all the while as she dug into the sensitive areas of your crack. \u201cIf you wanted me to tickle these loafs, all you had to do was ask! When we get on my ship, I\u2019ll surely give these bottoms the feathering they deserve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing you off from her as you could only laugh weakly from the side, you felt your body get hoisted onto her shoulder in a surprising feat of strength from her lithe body as her other hand gripped the rope binding Elenor\u2019s wrists. Tucking her wild crimson hair underneath the coachman\u2019s cap to keep it hidden from sight, Ruby let out a bark of laughter as she slipped into the last article of clothing, a pair of the coach driver\u2019s leather shoes. \u201cI reckon that we\u2019ll be long gone by the time help arrives for you, miss maid. Your coach driver should be waking up soon, so maybe the both of you can run to a nearby town for help. Not that it\u2019ll do you any good, since the nearest town is five days away. Good fortune in trying to catch us, Haahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling underneath the driver\u2019s compartment as the carriage hit another bump in the road; you inwardly muttered a few choice words for the pirate. While Elenor was allowed to sit in the cabin as long as she behaved, your early attempt at escape had earned you a seat (or lying space) underneath Ruby\u2019s seated figure at the reigns of the horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound of voices however, hope renewed in your mind. \u201cHalt, this is the western border guard. Are you transporting a royal delegate or ambassador for official business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready hearing Ruby\u2019s charismatic laugher from your crawl-space, you could already imagine the flirty wink the beauty was giving the males, along with their swooning reactions. However, you ignored the sounds coming from above, for there was another reason you had chosen to remain alert. While Ruby had ensured that you couldn\u2019t openly escape the compartment by using the weight of her body to press down on the seat, your captor had failed to check for another other openings in the dark of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor shining with the light of the morning sun\u2026 You could barely see an open slot in the bottom of your prison with barely enough space for your hands to poke through. And through this space\u2026 A pair of freely hanging leather-clad shoes was well within your reach.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could have sworn there were clouds from where we came\u2026\u201d Distracting the guards with her flirtaceous tone, you got to work yourself. While Ruby was busy, a few quick tugs ensured you slipped out of the ropes holding your wrists, their looseness a testament in your captor\u2019s confidence in not expecting you to get much farther than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful to not alert anyone of your new freedom, you made a loop of the ropes, tying the other end to a small metal hook inside the compartment. Making sure it was securely bond with a few hard tugs, you gingerly slipped your hands through the slot at the base, raising the loop of rope around the pair of dangling boots before pulling the knot hard. \u201cYou know, recently there has been a string of dissa-aah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something wrong, coachwoman? Although it is a pleasure sharing gossip with someone easy on the eyes, if you\u2019re in a hurry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh it\u2019s nothing!

Reminded of the rough yet sensitive soles you had barely gotten a chance to play with the night prior, you already knew what you had to do. If you could just get Ruby to break character\u2026 The guards to help to apprehend the criminal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly testing the waters once more, the disguised pirate quickly broke into giggles to the surprise of the listening guards. \u201cWas there something wrong? Did I say something in jest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-empphffff! It was just-eehheeeehee, that joke last night was that funny! Teehehheheee!\u201d Clamping one hand over her grin in an attempt to stop the case of giggles from your stroking digits, some of the guards blushed quietly underneath their helmets at seeing the beautiful coachwoman\u2019s smile. \u201cPray tell, would you share with us the joke?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, it went something like this\u2026\u201d As her mind raced to piece together a worthwhile story, you ramped up your efforts, determined to escape. Scratching the ball of her heel with fervor, you were rewarded with a stream of girlish squeals coming from the person atop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026A-And thahahahhahaat\u2019s why she was there, because the chicken wanted to aahaAAAHAAHAA!!\u201d Throwing her head back in full-blown laughter, the pirate inwardly cursed as you dug your fingers into her wiggling toes. Naked feet wiggling unseen in an attempt to escape, Ruby quickly grabbed her sides, unable to hold her hysterics. As more guards\u2019 line of sight darted to her heaving chest,  crimson lips and fiery red hair that threatened to spill out of her cap, many of the male\u2019s shifted on the spot, Ruby\u2019s shirt not the only place feeling constricted by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another howl of uncharacteristic laughter as she attempted to hide the falling crimson strands of hair, you heard the movement of metal boots dispersing before a single pair strode up to the carriage. \u201cI am the Head Guard, of this gate, Liandra. While I thank you for relieving my subordinates\u2019 boredom, I\u2019m afraid we must cut our talk short lest they be <b>further</b> distracted.

Then your heart sinks as Liandra sighs and says, \"Alright, alright. Let her through. Sorry for troubling you, ma'am, we understand the princess has somewhere to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one fell swoop, Ruby cracks the reigns of the horse and pulls her feet away from your fingers, letting her ticklish smile shift into a vindictive grin as she rides away from the border outpost and towards the port city. \"I'll show you what I do to people who tickle me like that. You're in for a world of laughter once we get to my ship!\" she cackles.You can only groan at what's in story for you and Princess Elenor. At least the princess has the chance of being ransomed; while you're a nobody who's now earned Ruby's full ire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually the farmland you've been passing through becomes more and more busy, you notice through the cracks of wood allowing you to see out from the compartment under the driver's bench. You can't see straight forward, but on either side there are more buildings, passers-by and wagons, including carts stacked high with salted meat and bags of flour. Ship's provisions, most likely headed to a port market. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour carriage enters the port town, and you're greeted by the smell of fish and beer as your ride clops by fishmonger stalls, warehouses and taverns. They're two and three stories tall now, so you must be at the heart of the port. The horse takes a left on the cobblestone road and now you're in full view of the water, that vast sparkling sea that covers well over half of Zenith. Ships ranging from wooden rowboats to double and even a few triple-masted vessels packed with cargo line the several docks. The port city was nothing compared to the Rylestian or Coninze cities, but it had surely cemented itself as an important site for trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw it: Ruby's ship! It was unmistakably one of hers (she was said to own several), now that you knew what to look for. The medium sized vessel was painted with gold dust and expensive red lacquer to suggest opulent wealth and of course rubies, and looked to be in very good condition. The hatches and portholes on the sides of the ship were closed, which you knew meant they were concealing a variety of ship attacking and boarding weaponry, probably including illegal magical and technologically sophisticated armaments. While nothing outwardly suggested it to be a pirate ship, surely a patrol of guards should have at least given it a cursory examination. Bribes were definitely paid out in full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the carriage stops on the cobblestones next to the dock and you hear the door thrown open. Princess Elenor's dainty footsteps ring out on the ground as she exits the carriage hastily, probably pulled by Ruby. She's being more deliberate now that there aren't any border guards on the lookout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lucie, Senette, stop loafing and get over here!\" Ruby yells over to some people at the dock. \"Help me get this scum out of the storage compartment. Watch out though, I've captured a real fighter!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral pairs of hands reach in and pull you out of the place Ruby stuffed you into. Your limbs are cramped and you're and covered in sweat from being stuffed into such a small space, so it's a relief to finally be in clean air. You're probably quite the sight, with your clothes ripped and dirty from wrestling Ruby in the forest. You see your other captors, obviously crew-members of Ruby's. Both are light-skinned, and one of them is petite, with golden blonde hair in a braid and ice blue eyes. The other is about your height, pleasantly fleshy and very buxom, with chest length brown hair and a naughty smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby has Elenor by the arm, and the two of you are forced up the gangplank and onto her ship. Once on the top deck, where numerous others are hauling rigging and raising the sails, Ruby tells her two pirate minions about her exploits. From what you can tell, Lucie is the <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your noble pirate queen has managed to capture a princess! We're gonna be rich, lasses, from the fortune we're sure to make off her ransom. And I also snagged this pathetic wormsack while securing our lovely princess Elenor. I wouldn't say this \"bounty hunter\" is even worth half a copper coin, but they've done an excellent job of inconveniencing me. I want you two to take our very ticklish bounty hunting friend below decks and show them what it really means to laugh. Meanwhile, I'll be loosening the tongue of our little princess here in my cabin, to see if she has any extra wealthy family members we could extract a double ransom from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucie and Senette each grab you by a shoulder and haul you below deck, wickedly poking and prodding you all the way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Giving you another poke to edge you down the deck, Ruby\u2019s First Mate gave a short giggle. \u201cOh, don\u2019t act all surprised. Every one of the prisoners we\u2019ve brought back had the same thoughts at one point or another. If you even try anything remotely fishy, you\u2019ll be in the kind hands of all our crew members for the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho knows, maybe if you even play your cards right, our captain will have the mercy to maroon you on a deserted island.\u201d Your captors shared another laugh together as the three of you finally arrived at what seemed to be the holding areas of the ship. With each cell separated only by thin metal bars, each individual area contained a set of hanging chains attached to the hull of the ship, along with thatches of dry hay haphazardly strewn about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a rough shove pushing you into the nearest one. \u201cGo on, git.\u201d Ignoring your protests, both pirates grabbed each of your hands before locking them in manacles with a rusty click. You protest, unable to even pull your arms down to block the cold draft seeping in through whatever cloth was left covering your body. \u201cIf you let me go, I swear to forget all that\u2019s happened with your Captain and I!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain Ruby was right\u2026 She IS a feisty one!\u201d Digging her fingers into your sides, the blonde of the two watched you shriek while your hips tried to shy away. Giggling with ticklish mischief, Lucie dialed down her antics to the occasional pokes. \u201cYou see, when Captain Ruby brings back a prisoner to the Crimson Voyage\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026we find it rude to not show them the hospitality of her crew!\u201d Senette exclaimed as she joined her friend. With two hands now poking at you from either side, you quickly shook your head as chuckling was intermixed with the pleas of mercy you babbled. \u201cJust let me go! I don\u2019t have anything on me unlike that princess, so you won\u2019t get any worth from having me around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile softly scratched at your underarm through the tattered holes of your top. You snickered like a madman, the damnably featherlight touches keeping you on the brink of giggles, yet not inducing mirthful laughter. \u201cWho said anything about money? You\u2019re already proving your worth, with these cute giggles of yours.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small knot of fear formed in your belly at her spoken words. Were they going to keep you on the ship just for the purposes of being their plaything? Judging by what their captain had decreed, that might very well be the case. From the upper decks, you could hear the sound of another person\u2019s ticklish laughter being forced through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like our Captain\u2019s starting to have her way with the princess.\u201d Lucie gave another smirk as she brushed away stray lock of blonde hair, her fingers slowly spidering your taut hollows with annoying persistence. \u201cShe\u2019ll be giving us quite the haul in no time. No one\u2019s ever survived under Captain Ruby\u2019s expert fingers, be it flamboyant royals or uncouth bandits. Now, as for you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blonde turned and walked out of the cell towards the dim rays of light that penetrated weakly into the brig of the vessel from the upper levels above. Senette waited a moment longer, licking her lips as she looked over the torn remainder of cloth and leather armor that barely covered your body, then quickly drilled her strong fingers into your armpits. Her quick but effective tickle wracked a shrill, eager cry of laughter from your body, higher in pitch and more pathetic than you would have liked, then she too had walked out of her cell after her comrade with a promise to \"see you soon\". The curvy pirate henchwoman made sure to close the barred iron door, giving you one lascivious jiggle of her assets as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you quickly caught your breath you examined your surroundings. The manacles holding you prisoner were firm but not uncomfortably tight, something which was a relief given the considerable amount of rust built up on them. Had they been tighter, you might have risked an infected cut from them digging into your skin. Perhaps if you had something to slick up your wrists, preferably grease though simple water might do in a pinch, you could slip out of the cuffs. Not that it would much matter given that you'd still be locked inside the cell itself, with Ruby's guards having the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You look around to the other cells: the ones to your left and right are unoccupied, but you can see a couple figures sprawled out or sitting in the thin layer of straw in cells on the other side of the brig. Prisoners from raids on treasure-laden ships, hailing from Coninze or Rylestia or other, wealthier kingdoms far away whose very existence is only rumored. They're probably to be ransomed off, or perhaps they're just enemies of Ruby and her crew they've seen fit to hold prisoner for their amusement. It seems that most of the other prisoners have been freed at least from their manacles, which makes you think you've been locked in yours specifically for interrogation, or perhaps fun. As if on cue, you hear a shrill cry which could only be Princess Elenor's emanate somewhere from the one of the upper decks of the ship. Ruby was no doubt putting her to the question in her favorite way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider your options. They made sure to take your weapons and tools, though perhaps when Lucie and Senette come back they'll bring something which might inadvertently aid in your escape, even if you have to suffer to get it. Getting out of your manacles would be a good start. Then again, Ruby might move you elsewhere, which could provide more or fewer options for escape. You ponder what might happen if escape is impossible, if her crew moves the ship out of port and there's nowhere for you to go until they dock again, which could take weeks. They might decide to sell you to some unscrupulous buyer, or even just get bored of you and make you walk the plank. Considering how you humiliated Ruby and gave her such a tough time, you're sure they won't just let you go, even if you did inadvertently assist in bringing them the wealthy Elenor. </span></div></div>",

The door has a few slits in it around eye level, allowing you to see into the room. No less then a few seconds after closing the door do a group of people come in the room. You spot one women who stands out over the rest, given her attire and hair color. While the rest of the people in the room have black hair, she has red, further accented by pale skin, a red top, tied off to reveal her midriff, and sleeveless, it being as red as her hair. Beyond that covering her legs look nothing more then worn down leather pants, frayed up to a good portion of the thigh. She has no boots on, barefoot with red nail polish, not very surprising. You deduce that this must be Ruby herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman, the one who came in first stands out because of her poise, dressed in tight black leather, with thigh high boots, she turns and signals one of the people in the room to close the door. Most everyone else in the room look like the average ruffian, but for some reason they don't seem to be taking orders from Ruby. The woman then crosses her arms and smiles at Ruby <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ruby, now that we are here, and the entire floor is just my people, tell me why you don't have the money I am owed\" she says the slight venom in her tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were too late, the map was correct, but when we got to the cave the entire place was cleaned out, all that remained was empty bottles and barrels of rum, and clear signs of celebration\" Ruby said, her fists clenched to her sides the entire time of answering to this mysterious woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The woman just shakes her head and turns around, walking toward the very window you came in from to look out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby Ruby Ruby, what will we do with you, you have made a name for yourself and you seem to love that title. However I think you forget it was myself that gave you the ship, and your original crew. Now you have all your own members, but the ship still is not paid for.

With that nod the silent observers in the room grab ruby, while others takes the sheets off the bed, showing an assortment of leather straps on it. \"You will learn to understand why no one in this part of the world crosses me, and why my group is the most feared band of Pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?! Get your hands off me! Asuka damn you I said I would get your money!\" Ruby yells out. being no match for the hands pulling her down onto the bed. In no time flat they have her on it, strapped in an X shape, a strap holding her down by each wrist, the elbows, the waist, her thighs, her calves, and finally her ankles.

She walks up to Ruby once the job is finished and takes a seat on the bed near her torso, looking down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This floor is and the one below us is occupied by my crew, yours get the rest...so none of yours will hear us. Now, before I begin, I heard, as much as you tried to hide this, you were captured once yes? Whole crew killed, you kept alive\" she looks down with a smile, seeing a little twitch of worry come from Ruby \"Need I go through the details of your capture, or should I skip to the part where I tell you it is one of the methods of torture that my crew, and I myself excel at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words Ruby seems to look very worried now, and makes a visual effort to push away from Asuka, only to have that straps holds her very still \"where did you hear that....c'mon give me a brrrmmmmmmmmehheee!\" she is forced to snap her mouth shut and hold  her breath. A single long nail from Asuka's index finger was brought down suddenly and was tracing up and down the side nearest to where she is sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ruby, this is punishment for failing to pay me so many times, and if you fail me one more time, you will be part of my crew, spending your days in the brig, chained as you are now, serving as the entertainment for my crew during long times at sea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch, staying as still as you can while you watch the scene unfold. This Asuka woman seems to be very cruel in  her work, and just sits there, now running all ten of her nails, five on each bared side, driving Ruby into fits of laughter. Curses fly from the pirates mouth, but no matter what, Asuka has the redheaded pirate in her control, tickling that spot till you see Ruby start to go a little mad from that single spot being probed for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I learned one place that you just drives you up the wall....\" Ruby barely has time to get a word out before Asuka reaches down, and with those long devlish nails, she goes for the pirates long legs, dragging them down to the knees, where she spends a few minutes just tickling all around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWWBWHEEHAAHAHEHEEDAHAHAAAMAMANNSTTAHWHWHWHWHAAAP\" Ruby screams out between cackles, the knees making her go nuts, and the straps holding them in place make you shiver thinking of your own knees going through such an ordeal, for such a long period of time. Of all things, you would not have guessed the legendary pirate to be the ticklish sort, and if you catch her, you are sure to not let that knowledge slide to the authority's. For now though you have no choice but to watch the show and hope no one comes into the closet anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed to have gone on for ages, although you know it can't have been more than some minutes. Ruby was brought to the brink of tears, only to have Asuka lighten up, changing to a gentler touch as Ruby caught her breath before tormenting her once more. At the moment, a solitary fingernail gently traces wide circles over Ruby's belly. The pirate queen is sucking in her stomach and gasping for air at the same time, and doing a poor job of either. Light girlish giggles poor from her, her earlier resistance long since broken. Asuka doesn't seem to show any signs of ending, or becoming bored or tired. She seems content to tickle Ruby until doomsday. Her companions stoically stand by the door, unmoving as golems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the leather restraints, you notice either by design or Ruby's trickery they are becoming looser. You lean against the door frame, straining for a better look. However, in the process you inhale a nose full of dust from the door. Despite your best efforts, a sneeze builds, until finally a muffled but still very noticeable \"achoo!\" echoes in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the stops dead, except for Ruby, still giggling from the lingering tickling sensations. With a nod from Asuka, her two guards open the closet door, finding you standing there. \"Woops.\" you say comically. \"This isn't my room, it's a closet! Well, I'll just be going\u2026\" You try to slip past the pair, but they clearly aren't buying your rouse. The two women grab your shoulders and throw you onto the bed next to Ruby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026\" Asuka says, studying you carefully. \"It looks like Ruby had a friend in here after all. Did you want to join in on the fun too? My guards have been waiting patiently, maybe they should get a chance to play now\u2026\" You gulp at the suggestion and turn to the guards. Getting a closer look, you realize they are more than just run of the mill ruffians. The two women have long black hair resting on their shoulders. Black shirts look tattered or deliberately torn halfway down, revealing a darkly tanned midriff. Loose fitting pantaloons are tied loosely at their hip at a jaunty angle, revealing the other hip. At each woman's exposed hip is a tattoo of a black feather curling around the hipbone. If Asuka thinks they can join in the fun, you can only guess how good at Asuka's\u2026 craft they are. But with all that exposed skin, you wonder if they aren't vulnerable to it themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour musings are cut short as Ruby suddenly frees herself from the bonds at her wrists and dives at you. Tussling on the bed, you quickly try to defend yourself as Ruby grabs you and pulls you in close. Before the guards can pull you apart, she whispers in your ear...</span></div></div>",

Asuka thinks about it for a minute \"okay Ruby but dont think your getting out of your punishment, once your done with him your getting tickled some more\" then Ruby comes over to you and ties you down then whispers in your ear \"okay now for this plan to work im going to have to tickle you a little but dont worry I will make sure you dont get tortured very long\" then Ruby asks you loud so everyone can hear \"now tell me what you were doing spying on us\" you look at Ruby and say \"I wont tell you\" Ruby smiles and says \"fine then I will have to tickle the answer out of you then she lifts up your shirt and you feel her nails slide up and down your sides and you start laughing, after a minute or so she goes up to your underarms and you watch one of her hands lift up the pillow your head is on and she pushes a button then she lays the pillow back down and starts tickling your underarms. You continued laughing loudly then after about five minutes the door burst open and a ton of girl pirates wearing the same outfit as Ruby came in and started attacking Asuka's guards. Ruby quickly untied you and said \"now help me capture Asuka and I will reward you\" you decided that you might as well help her, so you and Ruby run towards Asuka and Asuka says \"guards get them\" but all her guards are being attacked by Ruby's crew then Ruby grabs Asuka's arms and you grab her legs and you bring her over to the bed and hold her down while Ruby ties her up. Then you both turn around Ruby grabs an extra sword and tosses it to you, then you both help get rid of all of Asuka's guards then once they are all gone you shut the door and Ruby comes over to you and says \"thank you, you were very helpful now as your reward I would like to offer you a position as Quartermaster on my crew, you will be second in command under me and will help me with decisions for plans we make. You stood there stunned for a minute thinking it over, you were really here to capture Ruby and tickle her for information on where some treasure is but being on her crew would mean you would be with her all the time and you could help her find treasure and you would still be able to have some treasure.

Ruby just chuckles evilly as she pulls a stiff feather from the nearby table and slowly walks toward her captive,twirling the plume in her fingers as she watches asika's eyes grow bigger at the sight of it.

Changing tactics by using her index finger to probe the soft meat between her ribs one at a time.

As long as neither of them begin moving to the center of the bed, you should be able to carefully escape from under the covers. You sit patiently, listening to their breathing, as first Yuki then Shira start to breathe regularly, drifting off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't have hoped for your escape to have gone better. But just as you are about to start slowly sliding down the bed to freedom, an arm wraps around you! You freeze in horror as Shira scoots closer to you, cuddling against your left side. Her breathing is still slow and rhythmic, so she must still be asleep. Thankfully your arms are still free above your head. As she grips you tighter, you try to think of a way to pry her arm loose and get her to roll over. If she sticks to you all night, you'll be done for in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her hand starts to absentmindedly scratch your side. You stifle a jolt and try to remain perfectly still as her fingers lazily stroke your right side.

You try your best not to react as five fingers keep stroking your sensitive skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers drift slightly lower and begin tickling your right hip. It takes all your willpower not to squirm as those talented fingers drift over that ticklish spot between hip and leg. A silly grin overtakes your face as you clench your teeth, fighting the giggles welling up inside you. Shira's hand slips under your shirt and begins wriggling her fingers against your bare flesh. You twitch involuntarily at the new sensation, trying vainly to will her fingers away with your mind. What kind of dream could she be having?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand crawls further underneath your shirt, stroking your stomach softly with gentle, unending strokes. Your resistance starts to ebb as your belly begins to shake with silent laughter. You swear you hear Shira chuckle in her sleep at the development, as spidery motions tickle in languorous circles around your belly. Part of your mind pleads with you to let it out and succumb to the irresistible tickling, but if you do both girls will wake up. if you don't think of something soon, awake girls will surely tickle worse than sleeping ones!  </span></div></div>",

If you can't get the reward for capturing a dangerous pirate, you might at least rob the robbers and get some kind of loot. As you pull a length of rope from your belt, a part of your mind admits that the allure of having these two attractive women at your disposal is hard to pass up. As you carefully peel back the blanket, your eyes linger over their forms, impressively beautiful for being ruthless pirates spending most of their days on a dirty stolen man o' war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira's tan stomach and chest rise and fall with her slow, steady breathing. Her red undergarments accentuating her feminine appeal, her light brown hair falling over her face and neck as she sleeps on her side. On the other end of the bed, Yuki's pale skin glows in the pale moonlight from the window, her delicate features belying what must be quick and terrible abilities. Her blue silk garments provide little more covering than Shira's, and you notice goosebumps forming over Yuki's skin. Shaking yourself out of an embarrassing daze, you realize you'll have to restrain them quickly, before they wake up and notice the lack of blanket covering. And of course, that you are hovering over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move to their feet, tying them to the footboard carefully but quickly. Thankfully, neither of them make any movements, and you successfully tie both sets of feet to the bed. The problem, you see, will come from restraining their wrists. You'll have to crawl back onto the middle of the bed to reach a good point to tie them to the headboard. Getting another length of rope and placing it in your teeth, you slowly crawl back up the bed. Every twitch from Yuki, every vocalization from Shira makes you pause in fear. Perhaps this wasn't the wisest decision, you think, as you contemplate how you are once again potentially vulnerable, caught between a seductive Scylla and Charybdis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou maneuver their hands into the proper position, and miraculously manage to not wake either of them in the process. As you begin looping the rope around the headboard, you see jerking movements in your peripheral vision. Both of them are moving at once! Freezing once more and hoping this is another harmless dream, you wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And you shuddered to think what would happen once they realized what you were planning to do to them. They'd probably end up playing with you for the rest of the night, before reporting you to their boss where God knows what would happen next! You'd end up either suffering suffering some horrible torment, taken as a slave, or killed. Worst case scenario all three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these nerve-wrecking facts were coursing through your mind as you quickly made a loop with the rope, slung it around the wrist of the groggy Shira and managed to quickly bind the left arm of the tanned girl. You were impressed by how quickly you managed to bind her limb, one down, one to go... You thought desperately, as you reached for another length of rope. Unfortunately, this was as far as you got, before a now awake and angry Shira leaned forward and punched you in the jaw.<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're gonna make you pay for this, you little pervert...\" She hissed, as she tried to get up, only to realize you had bound her legs down as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeling from the blow, you pushed off from the bed as you tried to lift your stinging face from the mattress. You heard her suddenly let out a yelp as you did so, you looked down and you noticed you had accidentally brushed the bottom of the girl\u2019s right foot. Desperate to get the upper hand back, you quickly used both hands to aggressively scratch up and down the trapped tanned feet. The result was instantaneous, Shira burst into high pitched giggles, mixed in with silent laughter after the intial attack. You marveled at how lucky you were that Shira was a silent laugher, as the last thing you needed was more patrons of the inn bursting in to investigate the noise. Shira kept trying to reach forward to swipe at your arms, trying to get you to stop, but the rope that held her left arm back made it impossible to do so. Your eyes darted away from the wiggling and squirming tootsies and was surprised to see that Shira's fellow pirate was still asleep. It seemed Yuki was so used to the noise of forced laughter that she treated it as background music and didn't even respond to it. This theory really made you wonder what really happened on these pirate ships...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to dawdle though, Shira's right arm was still free, and she could probably untie her other arm or worse, wake up Yuki with a rousing shove. You quickly dropped one hand to scavenge for another piece of rope, while using your other hand to keep Shira's ticklish feet entertained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprang up, rope in one hand, as your scrambled, you made sure to squeeze Shira's knees, keeping her giggling as you then grabbed her right arm and quickly tied it down. The tanned women seemed worn out from the ordeal. This is good news for you, if she seems this 'sensitive', after only a bit more persuading she'd probably be willing to give up some information. A makeshift gag quickly gets made from a piece of cloth, and while she tries to wiggle her head away, she seems breathless and exhausted, and you manage to put the gag around her mouth <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab another piece of rope and nervously turn to Yuki, praying that she was still asleep despite all the struggling.. You turn and it seemed she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing stars, you flopped backwards, as Yuki calmly sat up, seeming to have wiggled out of the bonds you had tied around her legs. She happily took the length of rope you were going to bind her with, \"Thank you, sweetie,\" and then flipped you onto your belly and tied your arms together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not bad with ropes, either, you see,\" she bragged. It was true, she had tied a pretty good knot, but what she didn't know was when you were majoring in adventuring, you had also picked up a few good tricks in escaping ropes, you had habitually tensed up your muscles when she had wrapped the ropes around your arms to bind you, meaning you'd have more slack to work with later. Wiggling your arms free was only a matter of time, you tried to remind yourself. Of course, it was hard when an alluring female was menacingly wiggling her fingernails at you. \"I was really wondering if you can take what you can dish out,\" she grinned, wasting no time in poking her fingers into your sides. You tried to squirm free, but she quickly straddled you, trapping your torso between her legs as she grabbed and goosed your sides easily. Your head was still spinning from the blow to the temple, and you hoped it was sweat you felt on your brow, not blood. All such thoughts were then blown out of your mind as the mischievous Yuki found a sensitive spot along your ribs and began tormenting it happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, anytime you're ready to start talking, sweetie, I'm wondering why I wake up with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You resisted the urge to crack your knuckles and throw out a witty one-liner as you rose up, looming behind her, devising a quick and simple plan.

The asian-looking beauty tried to strike back, using her claw-like hands to scratch at your stomach, but you had grown accustomed to the torturous bristles and managed to shrug it off, and instead attacking her sides and ribs with more vigor as you managed to quickly tickle her till she was practically drooling status within a half-minute of rib tickling. She could barely formulate words, so you quickly deduced that those ribs of hers were quite the sore spot. Possibly a good note for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of her disoriented state, you manage to dive down and quickly pick up the rope than had suddenly turned from villainous captor to faithful friend, and after a quick belly tickle to stun her further, you quickly tied down all four of her limbs, taking advantage of her weakened state. After her right leg was tied down, in which she had recovered enough to try to kick and wiggle her foot away a little, she was caught her breath and was looking as you with a mixture of fear and surprise, and maybe even a little elation as she realized what awaited her. She opened her mouth to say something nasty to you but quickly shut up as you quickly dragged your nails up her right foot once, inciting a yelp from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks a lot different when you have the brush, doesn't it?\" You said cockily as you sat up next to the defeated Yuki, brush in one hand and gag in another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it does,\" she sneered defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like its my turn to ask questions then, and because I'm such a 'sweetie', as you put it, I'm gonna tell you I'm not really a thief, I want information on Ruby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Yuki and Shira shook their heads, Yuki who remained ungagged, did the talking. \"We would never rat out our captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug nonchalantly as you shove the gag in her mouth. \"Let's see if you change your tone after a while. I understand being tickled when you can't even use your mouth to breath is unbearable.

I can't betray Ruby like this!\" Yuki shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of frustration more than anything else you picked up the brush and dragged it across Shira's soles, then Yuki's. Yuki squealed and Shira squealed into her gag, mirroring her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think I've been going about this wrong. I have two hands, this way might even work better,\" you smile, knowing that since you're running out of time, desperate times call for desperate measures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go down onto the floor and pick up a feather, probably a leftover from a bird, or more likely, a tool from the last tickle victim of this inn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter regagging Yuki you position yourself at their feet. \"Last chance?\" You offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls shake their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So be it\", you sigh... tickling didn't seem nearly as fun when you had a deadline to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWielding one feather in one hand and the hairbrush in another, you began, multitasking wasn't quite your forte, but it wasn't as hard as it looked keeping these two ticklish ladies in ticklish torment it seemed. Yuki was the feather's first 'guest' , and she moaned into the gag as the feather swished and swept across her pale, helpless feet. They dangled off the end of a cushion, allowing the tormenting tool free reign to sweep across and between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheheyahaha! Ahahahaa! Please-pleheheheease!\" Shira squealed into her gag, though that meant it all translated into  \"Mmmmmm! Mmmmmm! MMmem-memheheme!\" Having already took so much torment as fell under the same torture that befell Yuki, only the brush with its many bristles were even worse than the fingers. Her feet, though larger than Yuki's were no less sensitive, if not more, she and wiggled and wobbled frantically in a desperate bid to escape the wrath of the feather. Her rosy cheeks puffed as sweet laughter spewed out, unable to keep it bottled up as she tried to plead with their captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki was impressed by how much of this tortorous tickling both Shira and the strange man tickling her had been able to stand. She was actually immensely relieved she wouldn't have to be tickled as the man played his mind games, she was devastatingly ticklish, all over. She figured she was actually getting the lesser of the attack, with the slithery feather instead of the brutal brush and the fact her toes remained free to wiggle and look for less torturous spots to take the tickling (if any), but she didn't know how much more of this she could stand, and hoped that either freedom would come to the two of them, or this crazy thief/treasure hunter would get the picture and realize that they knew nothing of what she wanted. Her toes curled, trying to keep the feather from sweeping between and under them. Unfortunately, brushing over them was enough of a torturous sensation that the stubby digits would spread open and flex, allowing the feather to get to the soft spots within\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki groaned into her gag, as she felt the weapons switch and the bristly brush introduce itself to her right foot. You had cleverly decided to switch the feather and the brush so each trapped girl got a different tool. A move to keep them on their toes, somewhat literally. It was clearly having a good effect, as thrashing her head side to side, Yuki struggled in vain to pull herself off the chair and away from the fluttering torture device. \"Ahahahaaa! Plehehehehee-stahahaaa!!\" She giggled into the gag, her poor little feet flapped and wiggled, one crossing over the other to protect its twin. This only had the amusing effect of leaving the protector vulnerable, forcing the roles to reverse in desperation, repeating an endless cycle of ticklish agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do this all day, or night, mind you.\" You chuckled, lying through your teeth as you guessed you had maybe half an hour left till the people in the inn began to wake up and the other pirates began to wonder where these two had gone.based on their increased struggles you were getting to them. Any minute now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira winced visually as she heard this, her toes curling with dread. She watched helplessly as the feather drew nearer, until the moment when it flicked across her silky skin. Her nerves reacted as if they had been struck by lightning. This sensation proved far more torturous than it had five minutes ago. You noted how anticipation had seemed to magically make her feet more ticklish, laughably enough, as the fluffy tool swept across her tanned feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Willing to talk?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, Yuki was a bit more astute than the average pirate, and bore a smug grin at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? You felt the need to go through all the trouble of trying to tie us up while hunting for gold and treasures?\" She wiggled the brush on your exposed stomach, causing you to giggle madly. \"Especially considering any thief worth her salt wouldn't risk going after two normal pirates when Ruby herself was staying a few floors above? Sounds to me like your story's full of more holes than a rotted ship!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'sahaha truehaha!\" you laugh, barely able to contain your laughter.

You wheezed with laughter and your stomach turned a pinkish color from all the sensations. \"As soon as I untie my lovely cohort here, we're going to have a lot of fun with you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the pirate woman stood up and moved over to Shira, to get rid of the bonds that held her down.

After all, now we have someone new to play with. A little liar to torture!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira grinned. \"I'm ready to show her some payback for trying to bind us up! No one messes with Ruby's Pirates and gets away with it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she spoke that, Shira leaned down and ran her fingers on your sides, sending you back into uncontrollable giggles. \"She's a pretty one, ain't she Yuki?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed Shira,\" grinned the Asian woman, kneeling down beside her and running her own fingers on your sensitive ribcage. \"A worthy capture!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to tickle playfully, never actually breaking you, but keeping your ticklish form on the edge for roughly ten agonizing minutes that would to any normal being have felt like hours. As those few minutes wore on, the girls let up a bit, and began to talk amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's sure trying to be tough huh? Holding in those laughs?\" came Shira, a bit unsatisfied finally of your suppressed giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Shira, as usual!\" grinned Yuki. \"We should move on up a step, don't you think?\" Shira smiled evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they picked up your weary form, and placed you in the center of the bed. Shira gathered the ropes you tied her with earlier, while Yuki started to untie your hands. Too weak from the extended tickling and the lack of proper breathing to fight back, your arms are stretched out taut. \"No need for these!\" came a bubbly Yuki, stripping you of your light jacket and tunic, and then binding your wrists together to the headboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for these either!\" came Shira, who was at the foot of the bed with the ropes. She began removing your boots, setting them aside, and pulling off your plain white socks to reveal your long and delicate feet. \"Oh, what delightful fun we're going to have...\" Shira muttered giddily, as she moved to your waist next, and pulled off your light cotton pants, leaving you completely vulnerable just about everywhere! Shira finished her job by tying your ankles to the footboard, your bare and sensitive feet sticking through the wooden bars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puhahalease...I'm sorry for...breaking in...\" you muster with barely any breath, your hair a wild mess over your reddened face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bite late for thaaat.\" Yuki replies, grabbing the gag you tried to use on Shira and sticking it in your own mouth. As she finishes making you completely unable to say any comprehensible word, she whispers into your ear, \"We're going to make you scream in delightful, ticklish agony...\"</span></div></div>",

They do nothing to obscure the curves of her body or the smoothness of her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said your dream is over, Shira?

Lucid dreaming, that's where you realize it's a dream, right?\" Shira says groggily, opening her eyes and gazing up at you in the dim moonlight coming in through the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, Shira. You are still in your dream, but are now self-aware. But that does not mean your dream will passively obey you. I am a manifestation of your subconscious desires, Shira. The fun part has yet to begin. Do you wish to continue your dream?\" You speak to her in a passionate whisper, recalling that if Yuki wakes, this plan will surely fail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing moment, you think about how stupid this plan really is.

But you're here to bring Ruby to justice! And collect the handsome reward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the hallway, you see it's little more than a corridor with shut doors. Any one of them could hold Ruby, other pirates, or even innocent bystanders sleeping at the tavern. You stop and think, realizing your plan isn't as well thought out as it should be. Just opening doors at random would probably alert them before you could find her. Hands folded across your chest, a pensive expression on your face in the dark, barely lit hallway, you're surprised when suddenly you feel something soft and silky press against your back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you honestly think I was asleep, cutie?\" a voice whispers to you from behind, hot breath tickling your ear. It's Shira! She was pretending to be asleep the entire time! You feel her alluring bosom press into your, just your clothes and her silky undergarment separating you. Her hands slip around your waist and make their way under your shirt, sensually rubbing against the skin of your stomach. You stiffen, remaining still and silent.

So as long as you stay quiet, we can play all night. I promise to make it worth your while...\" She tells you, whispering huskily in your ear as her fingers continue to glide over your belly, barely making contact, drawing out her conquest. You don't know if you can trust her words. If you turn around, she might call out. It may be best to stay still until you think of something. Then again, you don't know how long you can last under Shira's skilled fingers. A forced grin spreading over your face, you decide what to do next.</span></div></div>",

As she gestured for you to disrobe before getting onto the large bed, you heard the door click shut while you quickly turned away with a furious blush, Shira winking as she pocketed the key by slipping it into her brassiere. \u201cWe can\u2019t have you getting any weird ideas now, can we? Now, lie down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Do you promise to let me go if I-\u201d Not getting a chance to finish the sentence as the female fatale pounced on you, you felt the wind leave your lungs as Shira\u2019s\u2026 <i>tools</i> occupied most of your vision, the pirate pressing a finger to your lips, her own curled into a seductive smile. \u201cOf course, of course. But no more talking. Would you kindly lift your arms? Or do I need to call for help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrumming her fingers against your sides to give extra incentive, you squirmed while hesitantly raising your hands to the head of the bed. Bringing out a small coil of rope hidden <i>somehow</i> behind her back, the pirate\u2019s red lingerie rested inches away from your similarly colored cheeks as she leaned forward to bind your hands above your head, with your eyes all the while trying their best to tear away from the alluring sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo obedient\u2026 If Captain Ruby would have given me permission, I would take you aboard our ship as my personal toy.\u201d Smacking yourself mentally, you reprimanded yourself for missing the obvious opportunity.

However, it was too late for regrets. \u201cBut just for tonight, I\u2019ll have you all to myself. As a reward for going along with my whims, I\u2019ll show you a <i>good night</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting by slowly drumming her fingers along your bare sides, you instantly burst into giggles as your hips moved by themselves, trying to escape the digits which were barely making contact. \u201cSo ticklish! You might be even more ticklish than Yuki! How did you even keep quiet when I caught you just now\u2026 Ooh looking at you squirm makes me want to squirm as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at her own antics, you saw her fingers trace teasing shapes along the circumference of your quivering belly. A large grin already plastered on your face, you were no match when Shira skittered her fingers up and down your front, wiggling a devious finger into your bellybutton. Screaming and bucking with ticklish laughter, Shira cooed as she held you down with her body. \u201cCoochie Coochie Coo! Just look at that smooth belly! So ticklish as well! Tickle tickle tickle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mind going crazier with every mention of the word \u2018ticklish\u2019, the constant stream of laughter pouring from your mouth definitely wasn\u2019t helping your cause either as Shira merely laughed at your attempts to escape, raking her fingers upwards to your ribs. Playing a game of counting each individual rib, Shira giggled at your hysterical expense, the pirate constantly managing to \u2018lose count\u2019 when she was almost finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad I kept you all to myself. If I had to share you with Yuki, I don\u2019t think you would have lasted this long.\u201d Catching your breath back in a rare moment of mercy, your lips quickly snapped shut as a lone nail traced its way back to your vulnerable stomach. Drawing maddeningly smaller circles with each pass, the smile on your cheeks grew wider by every second. Dipping low into your bellybutton while you sucked in a huge breath of air, the unexpected sensation of five nails scratching into your taut hollows sent you screaming and buckling into laughter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you like my little trick? Yuki always falls for it, every time.\u201d Snickering as she dug her other hand into your remaining underarm, the electrifyingly ticklish shocks doubled as you arched your back, your mouth open in silent scream before collapsing back into laughter, your begging\u2019s of mercy garbled by your own ticklish mirth as your legs kicked uselessly by the end of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t played with your feet yet. Are they twice as ticklish as the rest of your body? Or are you perhaps you a little tired? I may be a pirate, but I\u2019m no slave driver.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shira placed the candle in a holder, which illuminated it greatly and made it give off a brighter light, like the new electrical lights the alchemists were experimenting with. <br>\r\n\"Uhhh.... hi?\" you offered.<br>\r\n\"Heya, whatcha doing here anyways?\" Shira replied,<br>\r\n\"Apparently getting tied down by you and uh, Yuki, there.\"<br>\r\n\"And tickled.\"<br>\r\nYou gulped.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what we thought. You're either one of those vigilantes here for Ruby, or you're here to make off with her hard-earned loot.\"<br>\r\n\"Pretty much...\"<br>\r\n\"By the way, don't even think of trying to escape, we're part of Ruby's elite guard, we could cut you down in a heartbeat. By the way, nice sword.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhh thanks. Any chance of me getting out of here?\"<br>\r\nYuki decided to answer that question by scratching your ribs, sending you into a fit of laughter. Shira clarified by saying, \"That's a no. But we'll go easy on you because you were honest\" and asking Yuki to stop for a minute so they could find you more... vulnerable.

Her firey mane of hair falls to her shoulders and frames her tanned face. She is only wearing brown trousers and a tight red blouse that had been cut short at the bottom and arms, leaving her midriff and arms bare. Her feet were bare, toes painted red, to no surprise to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmond-shaped green eyes went wide at the sight of you. In a flash, she unsheathes a rapier and points it right at you. Judging by its craftmanship, it was something she stole in a previous raid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" she demands, glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby the pirate, I presume.

Of course they would have followed her, being her personal elite and all. It was now 5-to-1, and would only get worse from the noise a fight would make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... how about you turn yourself in peacefully, and I won't have to harm a pretty hair on your head,\" chuckles Ruby, using your own words against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over your shoulder at the open window behind you.

They killed all the men in my party, but spared me... probably because I was a woman. It didn't mean I was exempt from punishment for trespassing on sacred ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examines her nails in the air, well within your sight. For a pirate they are awfully well kept.

I had to endure it for hours without any way to protect myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nails reach your heels before turning and going back up your soles. Her touch is so light, with just the tips contacting your skin, it feels like a maddening itch at times. You curl your toes down, wrinkling your soles to hinder her, but she merely returns to your heels that remain as smooth as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They found every spot that made me scream, every spot that made me beg, and they concentrated on them all day, and even partway into the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scratches a single nail on each heel. You break out into a wide grin and begin wiggling your toes madly. As soon as you do, one of her hands shoots up and grabs a hold of your big toes. She holds them firmly and pries them back, forcing both of your soles taut. Thankfully, she stops tickling, and you slump down, breathing much more quickly than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, they stopped, and let me rest... but in the morning, do you know what I found out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words hold for a moment, allowing the tension to build, before finishing the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all the men had gone out to hunt, and I was alone with the women of the tribe... and they were the merciless ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, her fingers that had been so gentle up until now, curled into talons before she attacked again. While only five nails now, they scratched firmly up-and-down your right sole, concentrating right on your arch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw your head back and burst out laughing, thrashing madly on the bed. Your toes quiver while you try to curl them, but her grip on them is strong and your feet are trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explores all over your taut sole, her nails leaving thin pink trails in their wake. Down your instep, around your heel, the base of your toes, and right on the ball of your foot, before returning to your sensitive arch once more.</span></div></div>",

Your feet flapped and wiggled, one desperately crossing over the other to protect it's twin, but this only had the amusing effect of leaving the protector vulnerable to absorb the wrath of those evil fingers, as laughter began streaming from your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Ruby begin moving up your trapped body, squeezing and tickling underneath your knees.

Thankfully she then moved to attack your torso, which, looking on the bright side, was less stressful for your bladder, but unfortunately was much more stressful on your lungs, as Ruby's fiendish nails were driving you mad with laughter, as she probed around up and down your rib cage and all over your stomach.  It was definitely a different kind of tickling.  It was still a scratchy tickling with her long nails, but with her also constantly poking and grabbing at your ribs, it was more of a muscle stimulating tickle, and you dimly note how it seemed to incited a more gut-wrenching guffaw type of laughter. Then Ruby's fingernails found your bellybutton and thinking became a bit tricky, as you through your head back and squealed with helpless laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen just when you felt things were becoming tolerable, you felt a set of fingers leave your tummy as Ruby reached over with her right hand and grabbed your toes, curling her fingers underneath them while her left hand continued to torment your stomach.

Ruby gave a notorious smirk tapping it more quickly. Your position was not in question nor was it meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer woman... A yes or a no. Shake your head.... Or turn it side by side... Hurry!\" Ruby began to speed up the tickling sending her nails up and down her soles now barely touching them. You could guess one thing though... You wouldn't escape the tickling either way... You saw the fiery passion in Ruby's eyes that she wouldn't let you go even if you say yes... If you said no... That could worsen her state to make you broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to say something though. If you don't, the results of stalling will deepen the problem of this... And appealing to her mood will affect Ruby's tickling patterns... You... </span></div></div>",

Her nails stabbed into your tied feet fitting onto your soles viciously moving her nails viciously in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not?!\" she asks trying to keep her cool. You couldn't explain yourself putting the gag. Ruby was anger. She began to shake her head saying, \"I drugged your system to take the tickling to a good intensity! You will say goodbye to passing out when I'm going to tickle these beauties for a good long damn while!\" Ruby's hands were running all over the soles. They weren't spider tickling lightly, they were tickling it dead hard. You couldn't bear the tickling laughing and already crying. The movement of her fingers were wild. She began to spread her ten fingers across both your soles, mixing the patterns so you couldn't tell. Even if you were watching, her patterns were rigid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then revealed a table of tools rolling in front of your soles. There was no comment as your eyes were trying to control the tears rolling down your face. Your toes wanted to quiver badly at the feeling of two brushes, one filled with those nasty dark thousand bristles stands as the other one had plastic balls on them running all across the middle of your soles. You explode and let out a high pitch laughter feeling the arches getting targeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your feet are so sensitive! You will become a part of my crew, one way or another!\" she comments blushing a bit heavier now.You wanted to question why she was, but the tickling was maddening your thoughts. She dump the brushes to get two stiff fingers running it up and down your soles. They were only quivering at the touch trying their best to pull them away from the tickling. The toes fidget but barely as Ruby shook her head still mad. \"Your toes, your entire soles are mine and at my mercy and you say no!\" She surprise you by sending a sudden brush buzzing at your heels making you shake your head viciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky that it's just me! The other girls will so get your feet in such an exaggerated way! Ganging up these cute tied up toes and showing no mercy! But I am... yet the message isn't clear yet!\" Ruby stops the tickling to give you a breather. You were sweating, panting heavily as drool was coming out of your gag mouth. You shook your head wanting to stop these sensations. Ruby walk towards you grabbing your chin. She began to viciously scoff the stiff feather up and down your right nipple watching your sudden reaction. You couldn't help but moan and laugh in a twist of sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be yours... Everything, under your wildest dreams.\" Ruby taunts showing her own body a bit. You blush maddened at the thought. The sudden tickling at the nipples were making your body feel aroused. You shook your head getting the dirty thoughts out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic!\" she roars, tossing your gaze away. She went back towards your feet saying, \"What will it take for you to get you on my crew!?\" She wanted you... There was no doubt about it. You began to wiggle yourself teasing Ruby. She blush madly slapping her face though. You blush noticing why Ruby wanted you... Does she really want you because she loves you? You would ask her but Ruby just scoff turning her face towards the side saying, \"Yeah... I love you...\" You gasp in your gag confuse if you should be stun or happy? You just want to know why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you because you're one of those rare ticklish gals I would love to have beside me. I don't care if I was rich, or one of those strongest and hated pirates of the seven seas... I want you as my wife.\" she blows a sigh of relief glancing at you in the eyes. \"I can't stand it when girls of your caliber goes out of my grasp.\" You blush slightly still doubting your decision to join or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you reject me,\" Ruby shrugs taking her hands on your toes sending a sudden nerve to watch her next moves. \"I just want to have fun before I set back off...\" she realize she forget something laughing, \"Ah... What was it that you wanted from me? I never ask why you intrude in my boat... You were just making me all dirty by tickling you. Jeez...\" there was silence. You just couldn't shrug off the feeling that this pirate was hitting on you. You were blushing and shuddering at the nails on your pulled toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she continues going towards your gag and taking it off kissing your lips. You couldn't say much overwhelmed by the sudden move and feeling her tongue enter your mouth. She withdraw glancing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you go or stay...?\" she asked it in a nice and alluring tone making you blush. </span></div></div>",

You turned on your heel and sprinted to the window, sheathing your sword. You went into a swan dive-style leap of faith. The ground was rushing toward you, and you got ready to convert your momentum into a forward roll. You timed it, timed it and you managed to half perform the somersault , but your back took a lot of the hit, and the energy went into your leg, slamming it into the ground. Your leg had been hurt, although at the moment, you weren't quite able to diagnose what type of injury you sustained, only that you couldn't walk, and your back was in bad shape, as well as most of your right side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's head appeared out the window and she taunted you, \"I see you WERE thinking of doing something stupid. However, my guards thank you for saving them the trouble of a chase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, are far too stubborn to not give them a run for their money! You turned onto your left side and tried to get up, making a Herculean effort. No way would these injuries keep you down! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pain shot up your back, you realized that the injuries would indeed keep you down. At least 10 minutes passed, and you thought of what course of action would be best for this situation. Immobilized and in pain, you heard footsteps approaching you. You looked up and saw none other than Ruby and her elite guard, ambling towards you, chatting and laughing about the idiot who jumped out the third story window. You remembered Ruby's taunt and thought, \"If I can't give them a run, I can at least give them a fight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every muscle in your body straining, you managed to pull yourself into a sitting position, and finally worked onto your knees. One of the guards raised an eyebrow, while Ruby watched you intently. You drew your sword and prepared to make a heroic last stand! Ruby sighed, but then smiled. She seemed genuinely impressed by your determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of you give me a sword, let me handle this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby brandished her blade and swept under your own, flinging it to the side, but you tenaciously held on to your sword. However, Ruby stepped on your wrist. With a sigh of resignation, you released the sword, and she kicked it away. She turned back to her elite women and returned the blade she had borrowed and ordered two of them to pick you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood haphazardly, your arms around two of the girls who lent you support.

You felt like you needed to stall and think about this more, as well as wean some more information out of her. \"What would happen if I were to accept?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby matches your smile with one of her own. Her brilliant white teeth catch what little light there is outside of the tavern. \"We'll sail the seas together. You'll do what you want, take what you want, and no one will stop you.

One of the guards, named Clara, provided you with medical attention. She seemed to be quite skilled in her trade. She applied salve to your ankle, which was fractured in two areas while you laid in a comfortable bed. You were in nothing but underwear, but you were mostly covered with bandages by now. She had already wrapped your lower torso with enchanted bandages, which were quite thick and stiff. You looked up at her as the sun poured in through a window. She had back-length dirty blond hair with bangs that she seemed to always be pushing out of her eyes. You wonder if she stops during a battle, perhaps in the middle of a charge to fix her bangs. The other defining characteristic of her face are her cheeks, which seem kind of big. It gives her a cute look, and you wonder if you would have been able to take her too seriously, even last night, if you saw them. You just want to reach out and- <br>\r\n\"Pinch my cheeks and I'll stab you.\"<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\"<br>\r\nShe gave a giggle and said, \"Because everyone does. I can't stand it!\"<br>\r\nYou smile at her. At least she's friendly. \"I'll keep that in mind. I know how you feel.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will!\" she said in a half-threatening voice and with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to work. Your arm had taken a hit too, especially your shoulder. You notice that she's wearing a sleeveless shirt that hangs on by two thin straps that criss-cross above her breasts, over her shoulders and connected to a brass loop. You eye her defenseless underarms and imagine tickling them. Your imagination is cut off by a ticklish feeling. While working around your shoulder, she accidentally got into your own underarm. You let out a squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ticklish?\" she asked with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I'm really ticklish there..\" You admitted. <br>\r\n\"I like you; brave AND honest. I'll tell you what. In an hour, your wounds should be in good shape. If you let me tickle you for...\" she paused and thought, \"two hours, I'll let you return the favor... or do anything else you want.\" She leaned in with her face quite close to yours in a seductive smile. You smiled yourself, and were very happy with your decision to join up already. You jokingly asked, \"Like pinching your cheeks?\" You both laughed and she said, \"Does that mean you're in?\" <br>\r\n\"Well of course!\"<br>\r\n\"Then I'll go get things prepared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one of the slowest hours of your life, the door opened and you saw</span></div></div>",

The prospect of spending months at sea as the only male on a boat full of women is fairly enticing no matter how you slice it.  It Seems Ruby anticipated that though. \"Don't look so happy. The last male we had on board only lasted a week before he went insane from the tickling. We dumped him at the next port naked and blubbering in laughter\". With that not so veiled threat, you let out an audible gulp. \" That poor fool was just a humble stable boy though. He didn't have the resolve or will of an adventurers such yourself. Of course he wasn't as ticklish either. C'mon put your clothes on and follow me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the outfit Ruby gave to you and examine it. Outfit is a very loose term. It's more like a piece of lingerie. A red, see-through mesh tank top cut just below your nipples and two more mesh sheets wrap your forearms and are linked with brass rings to the torso. your armpits, shoulders, and neck are completely exposed. <br>\r\nthe bottom is merely loincloth, also red, that leaves your genitals open to the wind underneath. A swift wind would bare all. brass colored sandals complete the harem-ish outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly don the skimpy outfit, leaving nothing to the imagination and slip on your shiny footwear, then follow Ruby out of the cell.Upon shutting the door behind you, you see in the cell next to you another figure, hooded and bound to a chair. interesting, but not immediately pressing. \"We're going to my office. theres just a couple more things we need to take care of\". Not fully paying attention to her, you notice the city in the not-too distant horizon. Even if you were to escape, you couldn't swim that far. The ship was full of humanoid females working in different capacities. Mostly humans, but also multiple drow, halflings, you even noticed a particularly foreboding Oni that likely served as the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-so mostly its just a formality, but its one that I've really grown to like\" You aren't sure what she was talking about, but you'll find out shortly you guess. it seems you've arrived at her office, The door guarded by a gruff looking human fighter. She eyes you wearily and follows you in, making eye contact with a distant Halfling and nodding before shutting and locking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby sits behind her very regal and expensive-looking albeit most likely stolen desk. \"Please, have a seat\" Ruby asks very nonchalantly. Still somewhat unnerved by your new wardrobe, you sit in the very sturdy but comfortable brass chair lined with fluffy down cushions that are, you guessed it, Ruby red, Very careful not to inadvertently expose yourself. Ruby notices your discomfort \"I know the clothes take a bit to get used to, but you won't even notice them soon I promise' She retrieves a document from her desk and pushes it in front of you. \"So all I need you to do is sign at the top and bottom dear and we'll be all set\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sign what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh silly weren't you listening? this is the slave contract! it says you legally belong to me for an indeterminate period to do with as I please\" Ruby puts her botted feet up onto her desk casually, waiting for you to sign. \"You seriously don't expect me to sign this do you?\" Ruby laughs. \"Of course I do. Anyone can keep a hostage to play with, but a good slave submits to ownership. This symbolizes your total submission to me\" Ruby snaps her fingers while you scan the document, noticing various instances of words like \"tickle\" \"torture\" and \"orgasm\". The buff human you saw at the door walks up to the desk and pulls off Ruby's boots and socks, revealing some very sexy feet. \"Of course there are some perks to the job. If you behave, you get to massage these beautiful feet of mine. Prove yourself very loyal and you may even get worship them, assuming I'm feeling generous\" She teased while wiggling her toes. You had an unbelievable urge to grab them in an anklelock and scribble all over them and you probably could, but theres no telling what that guard would do to you. Her feet mere inches away from your face, she covers one set of toes with the other and spreads her heals, looking at you inbetween her soles. \"So, Ready to sign?</span></div></div>",

Its so adorable when they fight it.\" Before you could react, manacles popped out of the chair and grasped hold of your ankles and wrists. Ruby got up and walked in front of you, sitting on her desk and sticking her bare feet your midriff, rubbing and scratching with her toes. You start groaning and giggling. \"But you see you were wrong about something, You don't have pride. You have what I allow you to have, and right now, you have nothing\". One of her feet slipped under your vest and began teasing and pinching your nipple with her toes, while the big toe of her other foot burrowed its way into the waistband of your bottom. \"You see this is just a taste of the bliss being my faithful slave can be. You can fight it, but you know you love it\". With Ruby's tactile toes getting you hot and bothered, you didn't notice the guard sliding your sandals off. It seems your outfit was designed to provide access to your ticklish spots with the least amount of effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Half-ling the guard had motioned to burst through the door suddenly, holding two buckets full of some sort of viscous clear slime.\"You'll notice Theresa over here is holding some buckets. If you don't want to find out whats in those buckets, I suggest you sign the paper. If you're the inquisitive sort though, by all means keep playing tough. They all crack in the end\" She pushed the toes of her right foot in your mouth, effectively gagging you, while simultaneously digging her other foot into your groin. Her face became very stern \"I want you to think very carefully before you answer though, because if you say no, Then you're not gonna get to play with me for another seven days, and I'll toss you to that very, very tickle hungry crew I have out there. some of them haven't seen a man in a year. think about all the pent-up desires they've got\". You should give in. Any sane person would give in. but you don't.  \"Fine. You are proving to be quite a challenge. No matter. Her feet immediately withdraw from your body, back to the desk with her soles pointed at you, fueling every desire you have to tickle her to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard pulled on the back of your chair, leaning it on the back legs and scaring you enough to splay your toes wide, which was a big mistake as it turns out when she let the chair slam down into the buckets of good. As soon as your feet plunged into the slime, they were on fire with ticklish ruin. Your eyes and mouth widen as you cackle maniacally. Scrunching your toes and squeezing the slime just seems to make it worse, and keeping them open lets them cover more area. its sheer madness.You never imagined you could feel so much tickling concentrated in one place. \"Wonderful little recipe. Slime monsters combined with a sense-boosting spell. the Paladins and Templars in the west use it for interrogating suspected dark magic users\" Ruby pokes a finger into the bucket and dabs it on her sole. She fails terribly to hold in a raucous giggle before it erupts into a full laugh. She then wipes her foot off on your nipple, adding a new erotic layer to the torment \"I forgot how bad that was, and your whole feet are covered in the stuff! well we can make it stop if you sign that paper. Just say the words my ticklish little toy, say \"I'm your tickle slave\" If you don't, it's gonna get a whole lot worse.</span></div></div>",

Her hair was as white as snow and her eyes were as clear diamonds, but you reconige her voice. \"Where am I?\" you managed to choke out.

Ruby and got her to watch over you and she would rather e doing something else. \"Who are you exactly?\" you asked out of curosity. She seemed puzzled at the question, but then giggle. \"Of course you can't tell who I am.\" She said as she turn her head back to the window.  She started singing a beautiful song, but soon follow by tear drops. She then latches herself on to you, but then stops. She would start to bang her head her head n the wall. \"Stupid this is why yu ight lose your elite status.\" she said ocking Ruby's voice. She returned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided that you could talk her into letting you escape or you could get more info from by letting her tickle you. You know it might be hard to get away from Ruby, but it might save your life. You need to find the right choice to do. The worse could happen to her if you let tickle her and RUby finds out and kick her off the ship. Which also might be your ticket into escaping.</span></div></div>",

However, before you even open your mouth to shout a warning, you see two of Ruby's elite guards creep up behind her, both of them smiling as one of them has a coil of rope in her hands. After a quick tussle, the slender Moon Elf proved no match for both of Ruby's more tougher feminine pirates, quickly getting pushed to sit in a chair, as one of her assailants tied the rope around her arms and around her thighs, preventing the struggling Elf from even squirming an inch. Ruby walked over to her and with a flick of her wrist, pulled down her robe's hood, revealing your companion's pointed ears, as well as her identity as a Moon Elf, to the collective gasps of the people in tavern, barmaids and patrons alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what the cat dragged in. You don't get to see a Moon Elf that often these days. I'm guessing that you are chasing after me, aren't you, you feisty little thing?\" Lifting one finger, she lifted the chin of the Moon Elf, quickly retracting it before she had a chance to bite it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly a feisty one\u2026 I have the perfect punishment for you, trying to capture me and all. Crimson Pirates; let\u2019s show her what happens when you mess with us! Meanwhile, you over there. I\u2019ll give you a front row seat at what will happen to you later!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo female guards that were behind the elf moved in front of her, with grins on their faces. One of them grabbed two small wooden stools; while the other carefully lifted the Moon Elf\u2019s removed the other removed her boots, and placed her feet on one of the stools, as Ruby sat on the other stool, which was in front of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked on, curious and scared as to what dastardly tactics Ruby might try. Your companion tried to put on a haughty look, ready to face anything that Ruby might try. <i>Almost</i> anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you might try Ruby, I won\u2019t ever break to you-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst question for our infamous Moon Elf!

No!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou craned your neck, seeing that the once proud look of the Moon Elf was replaced with a flustered look, a wide grin appearing on her face as she tried to squirm in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that, I think you need to finish your sentences properly, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said stop tickl-eehheheheeheeeng my feeheheheheheeet! Stop touching theehehehheheem!\u201d Now giggling, you notice Ruby\u2019s fingers trailing over the Moon Elf\u2019s creamy soles, drawling over her arches in random patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll stop tickling your arches with these curious fingers of mine once you tell me your name. How\u2019s that for a bargain?\u201d Grinning, Ruby continued to trace all over her victim\u2019s soles, making the elf burst into a flurry of giggles, unable to contain herself any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk ok! It\u2019s Miranda! Now stop tickling my feet!\u201d Managing to blurt it out after a few minutes of tickling, she caught her breath as Ruby lifted her fingers away from the soles of her ticklish feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, So it\u2019s Miranda I see. You\u2019re that famous Moon Elf who captured a whole underground ring of thieves in the city of Coninze. You also helped stopped an Illegal slavery ring in Rylestia. Yes, you\u2019re quite famous. It seems this vigilante is also quite ticklish. I wonder how much this information will go for on the black market\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you dare release that information, I will personally hunt you do-ahahahahhaaahaa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes,  I did say that I won\u2019t tickle you with my fingers. However, I didn\u2019t say anything about my loyal guards\u2019 fingers, or this feather for that matter. Coochie coo!\u201d Grinning, she nodded to her guards, who took up positions around Miranda\u2019s wriggling body and started to get to work. One guard wormed both her hands under her cloak, squeezing her ribs. Another guard kneeled down in front of her belly, wiggling her fingers into Miranda\u2019s sides and pale belly. Finally, Ruby sat cross-legged at the front, using a Blood Red feather to delicately swish and sway across Miranda\u2019s feet, all of this causing the laughing elf to throw her head back in laughter, her feet trying to scrunch themselves to alleviate the tickling sensations, her body thrashing in the ropes trying to escape, her mouth unable to form coherent sentences anymore.<br>\r\nAfter what seemed liked a few minutes, Ruby stood up and walked over to you, leaving her two guards to continue tickling the poor hysterical Moon Elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All you could see was the amazing beauty that radiated from the captured deity. Her smooth, green skin positively radiated beauty, identifying her as an earth or nature goddess of some kind. Three well placed leaves covered a portion of each breast and between her legs, seemingly hanging over her by some magical force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was perfect in every way.

You look back to her, as she opens her mouth to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unchain me, apprentice, and I shall show you pleasure beyond the comprehension of mortals.\" She tells you, in a voice that seems to caress your ears, a sound possessing a sensuality only matched by her physical form.

Dragonites are similar to dragons, though more human in shape: they walk on two legs instead of four, have two arms as dexterous as a human's, and all the other basic body characteristics. They wear clothes, but little of it - they prefer to remain closer to their dragon side in that regard. They're wild to a point, but some speak the languages of humans and they never cause damage to their wingless relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you, the young dragonite turns and you are met with the dragon-ish face. The creature is obviously female, as shown through her ample bosom and curvy form (another aspect dragonites share with humans). Dark blue scales cover her back and wings, and a tail lies on the ground that curves around so the tip is near her feet. Covering what needs to be hidden on her body are a couple of azure cloths that look silky smooth, probably provided by the mages. Her wings, until recently folded up, now stretch wide for some reason or other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder who lead you here chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is showing off,\" he says, amused. \"That is the first time since she's been brought here that she has ever displayed her wings.\" Relying on an old willow staff to support him, the elder makes his way to where the dragonite is standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from the manacles the dragonite is left free of restraint, and the chains are quite loose. To be honest, the clamps look quite comfortable. The dragonite looks at the approaching elder with a mix of excitement and curiosity, a confusing combination when displayed across her reptilian face. As soon as the elder is close enough to the dragonite, he turns to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your challenge, and quite a peculiar one too. You see, this young dragonite came to us asking for someone to serve. Her reasons remain unknown, but this is an excellent opportunity to study dragonites more thoroughly and experiment with their magical potential. Perhaps we can bring our two species together - who knows? This might be the beginning of a mutual friendship with our winged relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the meantime, this young dragonite needs someplace to stay - errrr, and someone to serve I guess - so the council has chosen you for this task. Don't look so relieved, it is not as easy as you think. And I daresay your small chamber isn't enough to house her. You must begin by building her a home outside the tower, and from there see what you can learn about her past and her people. Despite their likeness to humans we know little about the dragonites and their culture, so this is a great opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you are to be her, erm, master? And you're supposed to look after her. Not <i>quite</i> what you were expecting, but hard enough. Question is though, for how long? This isn't going to be a 'do this and you pass' test. This will take along while. There is also the matter of <i>why on zenith</i> she wants a master, but it isn't very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" you ask the dragonite tentatively. It is an odd position you find yourself in, being the master of another species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Hannah,\" the dark blue dragonite replies calmly. \"I've come to look for someone serve. May I serve you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeculiar indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooookay, this is a <i>little</i> weird.\" You turn to the elder, who is busy unlocking the manacles. He faces you and smiles, before offering some advice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you begin by taking her outside,\" he says. \"It is where she will be spending most of her alone time, so she better get used to where we are so she can come back from long errands. It would also be good to get started on building her a new home out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the other hand, you could take her to your chamber, show her some of your books and tomes, and some of your, ahem, <i>projects</i> that I know you've been working on. Letting it get to know you better will be the foundation of a good, ah, friendship I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alternatively, you could simply wander around the tower with her and show her some of our training rooms or laboratories. We will need to perform a few tests, and letting her practice spells with you will be a good way to gauge her potential for magic. She will need to learn her way around, sommay as well start now.\"</span></div></div>",

As you walk, you try to get to learn about her better, but each question you ask only makes her seem more mysterious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Hannah, what would you like to do here? Do you have any experience with magic?\" you ask her, making conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to serve you, of course. I will have experience with your magics, whatever spells you wish.\" She tells you, not exactly giving helpful answers. Still, you're eager to test her enthusiasm. Arriving at your quarters, you open the door to reveal a small space, barely enough room for the two of you and your possessions. Piles of books and tomes lay in corners, a medium sized bed underneath a window at one wall. The dragon woman looks about the room. \"The space is too small for the two of us to live, we will have to build outside the compound quickly. But until then I can fly in through that window whenever you call me, master. I have excellent hearing.\" Hannah tells you, seemingly proud of her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looks around, you take a good long look at her. Her dark blue scales cover arms, legs, feet and back. But the front of her torso isn't scaly at all. Smooth, sky blue skin stretches from waist to chest. Small silky garments cover her breasts and hips, but you notice her belly is as smooth and vulnerable looking as a humans. You've just thought of the perfect first spell to test on your new servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, stand still and face me for a moment. I'm going to try a spell.\" You tell her and watch pleasantly as she obeys, watching you expectantly. You channel your mirth magic into a new spell you've been working on. This one magnifies a being's ticklishness tenfold, and the only way to undo the spell is to have someone tickle your worst spot for a considerable period of time. You eye that toned belly again as you contemplate what will happen to her, briefly imaging your own ticklish midriff under the same spell. It is a difficult spell to cast, but you can't pass up this opportunity with the attractive looking dragon woman standing right in front of you. As you silently murmur the chant for the spell, the room brightens. Was the spell a success?</span></div></div>",

She's almost twice your height! While you've always been on the short side, you still marvel at her stature. Her long, think hair is wild and unkept in a tussle above her head. She glares at you silently, her dark eyes boring into you as if she were a caged animal and not a woman. She wears little, some type of animal skin wraps around her chest, barely covering her appropriately giant breasts. A similarly... furry garment is unevenly tied around her waist, wrapped around a hip and thigh. The lack of clothing shows off her fit physique. Her tanned skin looks strong without being overmuscled, perhaps like a runner's build. A giant runner, at least. The only normal garment appears to be a set of long boots, coming up to just below her knees, and looking capable of squashing sheep as if they were roaches. As you approach, you can see her body movements with each deep breath. Certainly, she's no mere human. But if she were normal sized, she could be the beauty of many a town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's quite a specimen, isn't she?\" the elder says to you suddenly, pulling you out of your reverie. You turn to find her grinning at you with a knowing look. You feel yourself blushing slightly, caught ogling a creature you should be analyzing. The elder turns back to the giant, continuing. \"She was given to us by the Kitcha tribe as payment for our services. An unseemly practice, slavery, but they don't have much else to trade but their disgraced warriors. You remember your studies of giants?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod knowingly, but secretly your mind is racing. You don't remember ever studying giants! What lesson was it in? Summoning? Who could summon a creature that large? She's apparently a disgraced warrior, what was the significance of that? Your mind races behind your confident veneer. All the while the giantess seems to be staring directly at you. You flinch slightly as you try to imagine what she's thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether the elder picked up on your thoughts or not, she spoke on. \"She hasn't spoken a word to us. She won't even tell us her name. I'm hopeful you can change that. As you might have guessed, you're going to have to earn your keep today.

You blink, slightly astonished at the relative quickness of this trial, and then you remember the giantess that was just set loose.

Casting a shield charm, you managed to catch her first attack, though much to your horror cracks start to appear in the shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow strong are!!?\u201d you shout surprised at the apparent strength that the giantess had, though the only response you got was a very creepy smile on her face, along with a malevolent glint in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy\u201d you mutter to yourself, teleporting behind her at a distance, and prepare another spell. Of course, the giantess had already covered most of the distance between you. Unfortunately for her your spell was ready.

Thankfully you were somewhat proficient in combat (really the only interesting class, and the teacher was hot), thus your second spell was already in your other hand. Flinging it forward you release an arctic blast that stuns the giantess in her charge, but she eventually pushes her way through the howling winds. This once again forces you to evade as her fist comes crashing down cracking the floor that you had stood on a moment ago, rolling away to create distance you notice your handiwork. While her body itself was mostly unharmed, the same couldn\u2019t be said for her apparel. The hide wrappings around her body were singed in places where the electrical bolts had struck, long with frozen bits from the chill wind. Her boots however were a different story as the ice had forced her to tear them up, leaving her massive feet bear. You quickly form two plans to deal with her, but which one?</span></div></div>",

The skilled woman wore loose silk pants, a thin sleeveless vest, and a Gurkha which hid most of her face. Everything was red, but her vest had a gold trim which told you that she was more than a common mercenary. Then again, her swordplay was enough to prove that. A jet black ponytail bobs behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your business,\" she ordered, huskily. Her voice was smooth and feminine, but carried a dangerous edge to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer \"I'm here to trade with the merchant.\" The scimitar doesn't back away from your face, and you begin to get more and more nervous. Most of the crowd ignores you (and the headless body on the ground), but you do catch glimpses of people glancing at your predicament occasionally. \"I have some money, I'm not here to steal anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know you're not lying you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna! What are you doing?\" cries a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look left to see the woman in blue emerge from her shop and run to the scene. She quickly starts talking to the girl in red - Jenna, you presume - in a language that sounds something like the native dialect of these lands. There are some faces and gestures, but the conversation ends with Jenna lowering her scimitar and giving you a frosty glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry sir,\" apologizes the merchant, whose voice is melodic, soft, and slightly accented. \"My daughter can be a little... Ah, jumpy. She's used to people trying to steal from our store.\" A quick comparison in your mind confirms it: these two are mother and daughter. The merchant looks just like Jenna except she wears blue instead of red, stands slightly taller, and has turban on her head as opposed to a burkha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, that must've quite a shock for you! As an apology, you may have a discount at my store. Why don't I get you something to drink - on me. Please, come in.\" She walks back towards her store and beckons. Jenna follows close behind, throwing one last glare at you before dissappearing into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with nothing else to do and the invitation open, you decide to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop was not the largest shop you'd seen, but certainly not the smallest. All kinds of foreign items lined the shelves, presumably from the merchant's travels. On one wall is a row of hangers, with unique clothing hanging from each one. On the counter at the back are some small local souvenirs - hand-made by the look - and a pile of white cotton robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering into the back room, you see the merchant approach you with a cup of ice water in her hands. Jenna is leaning on the entrance to the doorway with her scimitars leaning against the wall. After the little event outside and her frosty glares, she refuses to look at you. The merchant on the other hand is quite warm and friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, don't be shy: have a cup! I know how dreadfully expensive water is here, so consider this as part of my apology on my daughter's behalf.\" At hearing herself mentioned, Jenna glares at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much appreciated madam,\" you say politely. The merchant chuckles and hands you the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, just Julie will do.\" The merchant disappears into the back room, and after a while says \"Come in!\" You oblige, sitting in the chair Julie beckons to. The back room is a kitchen, with a large table in the middle. There are a three doors leading out besides the one to the shop, one of which Jenna enters and doesn't emerge. After some fiddling, Julie grabs a cup of water as well and sits down opposite you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings you to this desert town?\" Julie asks. \" Judging from your clothes, you don't look like you're from anywhere near here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you start to explain. Your quest for the oasis, your talk with the bartender, and the fantasies that drive you. You don't want go into too much detail, wanting to make this conversation a short one. However, once you start talking, you find it hard to stop. You go into every detail about everything that brought you here, even about your wishes. By the end of it half an hour has elapsed, and Julie takes a whilebto sip at her water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound like life or death,\" she says finally, calmly resting her cup on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know anything about where it is, please tell me! I'll pay you watered I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, keep your money. If you want to know that badly, I have another idea of payment.\" Julie smiles cryptically. \"You will spend the night with us, and we will provide dinner and breakfast. However, from the dusk to dawn you must do whatever me and my daughter tell you to, unless it is physically impossible or brings any injury to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp loudly. \"Doesn't your daughter want to kill me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie laughs. \"Oh no dear! She's not angry at you, she's just a little embarrassed and frustrated that she threatened you without reason. If she's angry at anybody, she's angry at <i>me</i>. But back to the deal dear. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider. It sounds like a good deal, and from dusk to dawn in these lands is only a few hours. Besides, if there's nothing painful there's nothing to be afraid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this: as well as telling you what I know about the oasis, I will give you free provisions and clothes so you can get there. Deal?\"</span></div></div>",

Even more surprised to see her looking sheepish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...umm...wanted to apologize for my actions earlier. I was paranoid and jumpy after the guy with the dagger.

Afterall, she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't worry about it. Your mom is more than making up for that with the deal we made.\" You were slightly worried about the impish grin that Jenna grew at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd wait on that belief until dusk comes. By the way, dinner is ready.\" She began walking away, giggling musically to herself. You wondered what she meant by that. No matter. It was dinner time.

You had come too far now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well\" The white ragged wisewoman rasped. \"Now, not a word\" she ordered. She gently picked up your immobile legs and put them on her lap. You had to admit you were surprised as you watched her tug off your boot and set it on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are yo-\" You stopped yourself. \"No talking.\" She responded, a loss of patience evident in her voice. Your other boot quickly joined the table You were shocked to see a glowing symbol on top of each of your bare feet. You crossed and flexed them, the desert breeze highlighting their dampness. The blue runes immediately vanished. \"A scrying spell\" the hermit explained. \"Nothing more. Do not worry.\" You felt relieved that she understood your concern. But what your feet had to do with this still escaped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came quickly. Your unsuspecting appendages began to be teased by the hermit's long nails, and you were not prepared. You shifted from leaning on one arm to the other, hoping the hermit would finish whatever she was doing. You let air build in your cheeks, looking at her with quivering lips. You clenched your toes and swung your ankles, desperate to get your suffering feet away from the wisewoman. \"No laughing\" the hermit warned. \"But you're tickling my fehmmph!\" You clamped your hands over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell forward and used one hand to bang your fist on the table. You were so off-guard, being tickled like this, that the sensation shot through your whole body. You looked up, hoping for some sign you would be spared this torture.

She drags her fingers from your heel up to your toes, then she holds your toes back and licks your arches.  \"PLHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEAASEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE STAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAP!\" you exclaim with tears streaming down your face.  Suddenly she does stop, you pant heavily trying to catch your breath.  She leans over resting her hand on your waist and leans in close smiling smugly all the while until your forced to look up at her.  You raise an eyebrow quizzically at her she then removes her hand from your hip holding up the special nectar that you use to draw fairies.  your still puzzled until you consider your position; your incredibly ticklish feet are bare, your tied up by a tree, and the only other person for miles around is your captor the druidess who is still mad at you for digging up the flowers.  She uncorks the nectar bottle and holds it up in the air and it isn't long until you hear the buzzing of fairy wings.  The druidess pours the nectar all over your bare feet despite your protests, she turns around and waves her hand and a tree opposite your own lowers its branches and the druidess sits down and crosses her legs and stares at you intent to watch you suffer horribly at the hands of the incoming fairies.  A horde of the winged fiends arrives in the clearing and upon seeing the nectar they all chatter excitingly and dart towards your exposed soles.  The Fairies lap up the nectar hungrily once again driving you into hysterics you cry and plea with the fairies to stop but they just lap the nectar from your heels, soles, arches and between your toes the torture continues until... </span></div></div>",

Your head is pounding and your muscles ache. You groggily determine you're pinned to the thick trunk of a gnarled tree near a desolate stretch of road and you're totally naked! You look a bit like a racy figurehead on the prow of a ship. Darkly verdurous vines wreathe your ankles and body, while an unnecessarily ropy tendril sits snugly between your teeth, holding your head in place and inciting a steady stream of errant spittle to drip incessantly from your chin ... on to your belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice them then, piled neatly in the bed of ivy ringing the tree trunk, your clothing, boots, and sacks, emptied now, no doubt. A single toothy sprig of holly sits atop the pile. Perhaps Fairy Dust Collector is a less worthwhile occupation than you previously thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle feebly, but the scabrous tree bark scraps uncomfortably against your naked skin, and you don't make much progress loosening the vines anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning cheerlessly, you try to call out for help, but your voice is hoarse from the furious fairy tickling in the druid's grove, and the sinewy gag in your mouth reduces most of what you say to slobbering nonsense and gouts of dripping saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours seem to pass, but morning never arrives. You drift in an out of consciousness until you hear voices in the distance! Two slurring songsters mumbling through some bawdy tavern ballad. You struggle and moan with renewed vigor as the voices grow nearer, and the road is increasingly bathed in wavering lantern light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Squeaks a woman, drunkenly, illuminating your helpless, naked body with a tarnished brass lantern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well!\" Laughs a man, boisterously, staggering past his momentarily stunned companion. \"Looks like someone's run afoul of nixies ... or some such ill tempered fae!\" He hiccups, belches, and kneels clumsily next to your pile of belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No gold I suppose,\" the plump but not unlovely young woman says, standing waveringly next to her smartly mustachioed companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Filthy, drunken thieves</i>!

Until something catches the woman's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What soft little feet you have!\" she coos, sauntering toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide as saucers and you begin struggling like mad. You're suddenly aware that hanging here off the ground for as long as you have has turned your bare feet a ruddy crimson and exponentially increased their already extreme sensitivity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can't have gold, let's have fun,\" she giggles to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, a bit of conscripted singing, eh?\" The man replies, smiling widely. \"They do look like an awfully good singer don't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two inebriated bandits step menacingly toward you, wiggling their cruel fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clearly, this isn't the first time they've had someone 'sing' for them. The night air is cold on your bared soles, the rough vines holding them entrapped like an insect in amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you still can't believe it -not your feet! As long as you could remember, you'd always tried to protect them from such tortuous attentions from all and sundry, failing as often as not. Since you were little, siblings and friends had never left them alone, and compromising accidents had befallen them wherever you went. Tangled in sheets, trapped under a fallen log, stuck in a piece of farm equipment, wrongfully accused and sealed in the village stocks -you had to be cursed. And now, as the two smirking bandits exchange grins and go to work, your ill-fortune has caught up to you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFingers claw and skate over your rouged soles without the most minimal preamble, plunging you into hysterics. Your eyes roll in desperation and panic as you try to fight against the vines, now completely heedless of the rough bark.

Overall, you can do naught but moan into the gag helplessly, feeling the endless tickling stretching on and on, the thugs never tiring of your stifled laughter.     </span></div></div>",

Her intoxicated friend continues his scratching of your soles, but she begins to gently tickle your immobile head's ears, nose, and cheeks with her fingertips. \"Mmmmph! Mhmhmhmph!\"you scream into the ropy tendril holding your mouth shut. The most you can fight against this aggravating assault is to slightly wiggle your head, as the thick vine gag prevents anything more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two have fun for an even longer time, long enough so that your stomach begins to moan and you notice your thirst between muffled sessions of agonizing laughter. Soon the two rascals stop to take a drink, but give none to you. The thieves are obviously feeling peckish and maybe a bit hungover too, and so the woman stops poking your neck and goes to fry up some sort of meat strip on a pan. Her mustached friend puts all your belongings (really just clothes and a blade) in a leather sack, and you catch a glimpse of some stolen silver utensils, probably stolen from the very tavern they got drunk at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a wriggling sensation in your mouth. It's the vine that makes up your gag, slowly drawing back. The druidess's spell must be wearing off! Soon you can actually take in deep breaths, but you don't speak in fear of being gagged by your ticklers. They don't notice that the vines covering you have loosened as they are too busy eating lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready the vines are loose enough to start wiggling around in. Then- <i>Whump!</i>- you hit the ground. Your legs have been stiff for so many hours that you immediately collapsed as soon as you were free. Before you can run away the two bandits are upon you yet again, unhappy that the vines have become useless. However, they make up for it by pouncing on you and tickling to their hearts content. You wriggle around on the ground as the man and the woman dig their fingers into you sides, belly, and armpits. When you are good and exhausted they both tie rope around your wrists tightly, binding them behind your back and soleaving you able to walk but not to use your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take him to the hideout.\" says the mustachioed thief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" purrs his plump companion, \"I can think of a number of things I'd like to do to our captive there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lead you down a dirt path for a while, with thick foliage on either side. You feel dread well up inside you as you think on what might become of you now. If only your hands weren't tied!  Perhaps you should make a run for it? If they catch you you're no worse then before, and as it's getting dark you might be able to lose them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolt off to the side, much to the thieves' surprise.</span></div></div>",

Her green eyes appear quite human and are twinkling with mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hand touches your other arm. You turn your head and see that second dryad is sticking out of the same tree. The branches hold your body tight, allowing them to freely brush their hands along your arms, seemingly examining you. Perhaps they do not have much contact with humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the dryads' hands brushes along the side of your neck. You let out a soft gasp and quickly tilt your head, shielding your skin. However, this leaves the other side more exposed, which the other dryad exploits by fluttering her fingertips at the base of your neck. You giggle and snap your head the other way to shield that spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them squeal and clap with delight. Something tells you that showing weakness was the last thing you wanted to do in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a finger begin poking you in the side, causing you to stretch to the side with a wide grin on your face. The other dryad pokes you in the other side and you quickly pull the other way, only to be poked again in the first side. Back and forth you dance, being sent to either side where the dryads await, poking along your sides randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft giggles pour freely past your lips. Your own fingers strain to curl into fists, but the tendrils around them prevent even the smallest movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeheheheease!

She stood up off her tree stump and approached you. She waved a hand and the tree spirits backed off, watching their summoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pulse quickened as she yanked off your boots one at a time. She wasted no time in pulling off your socks, leaving your bare feet exposed to the outdoors.

Especially given your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Druidess smirked, let out a \"hmm\" then looked up at you. She grasped the top of your left foot, feeling the imprint on your skin left by your sock, and pulled it up. You jerked, just the feeling of someone touching your foot felt invasive. You braced. You couldn't let her see how sensitive your feet felt. \"It's here isn't it?\" She asks in a accusatory tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare her down with the sternest face you can manage. \"Thick boots. Thick socks. Hence the sweat.\" She traces a single finger down your sole. You bite your lip. \"Every human has a weakness.\" She begins lightly grazing your sole with her fingertips, spidering in one spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour foot waves slightly to free from her grasp but you stop yourself. You can hear the air of giggles in your breathing. \"Yours just happens to be your bare feet. And I will play with them just like this. For as long as I and the denizens of this grove see fit.That will make you think twice about bringing your feet here, to be stripped bare and be at our mercy.\" The Druidess' teasing was torture itself. Her nails felt worse as she went on. More accurately, you felt more aware of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was keeping you on edge on purpose, not letting your dam break, knowing you'll fight it.At once she dropped your left foot and changed stance. She stuck her fingers up into your arches, pushing them in and out of the soft soles. She kept you from lifting your feet with her thumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pleheheheaase!\" Was all you could bubble out before laughing through a closed mouth.. \"How fitting\" The Druidess remarked still goosing your damp flesh. \" One so disconnected from nature as to disrespect it would have such soft feet.\"  She mused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the feeet! Staahap!\" You begged as jolts shot up your thighs. Jumping laughs poured from your throat. \"It's not my fault your feet are so ticklish.\" The Druidess stated innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then wiggled all ten fingers in different patterns on your soles, running nails along the lines of your feet. She allowed you to dance your feet in vain to get out of your grasp, wiggling your toes frantically for a form a respite. The dryads watched this with giggles and squeals, enjoying the show your feet put on for them. It was clear they desperately wanted a turn with them.

However, that hope was vanished as soon as it appeared. With a mischievous glint in her eyes, one of the Dryads placed a finger on your bare soles, dragging it down your arch. Grimacing inwardly, you grit your teeth, begging them not to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour slight grimace did not go unnoticed however. The other Dryad saw the slight tilt of the corners of your mouth, an idea already forming in her mind. Calling the other Dryad closer, she whispered something into her ear. When they were both done, they turned towards you, giggling menacingly as they raised their fingers towards your wiggling feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back! Don't you dare touch me! I'm not afraid to-ehahahah! Sta-ahahhahap!\" Giggling, they continued their tickles, both of them taking one foot, their bark-like fingers scribbling up and down your bare soles, digging in between the sensitive areas of your toes. Throwing your head back in laughter, you struggle as hard as you can to break out of the branches holding you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Dryads continued to giggle to themselves as they were tickling your feet, you couldn't figure out which was worse, the Druidess' constant teasing, or the Dryads' infectious giggling. Shaking your head from side to side, laughter continued to pour from your throat, your body not having the energy to do much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity of fingers scraping across your feet, you feel the bark grabbing at your arms and body creaking. Looking up, the Dryad's saw the branches holding you starting to weaken. Giggling to themselves again, they gave your feet one last flutter of their rough fingers, before disappearing into the trunk of the tree that was binding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping heavily, you hear the sound of branches snapping as you fall to the ground, spent and exhausted.

Walking slowly towards you, she gently turned you around, so that you were now facing the rocks surrounding the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... Now if you would just lie down on this big rock in front of you... Just relax, and let me show you nature's techniques.\" Obeying her, you lie down, your face resting on your hands. You feel the Druidess smooth hands peel apart your towel, letting it rest between you and the rocks. \"Such smooth skin... Even I'm envious... Let me have a feel of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, you felt her hands make contact with your back, the palm of her hand smoothly gliding across your back. \"No resistance whatsoever... I wonder how you have kept your skin in such a refined condition...\" Feeling her nails drawl up and down your back, you bit your lip, the ticklish sensations already threatening to make you giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh where are my manners, let me begin right away.\" Stopping her teasing of your back, she got to work, her hands starting to squeeze your shoulders. Tensing up, you prepared for the inevitable mischievous tickle from maybe a finger, or perhaps a fluttering of digits. To your surprise, you softly moan as she continued to work out all the tension from your stiff limbs, taking extra care where your muscles felt taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh... Right there... Yes a bit to the left... Ahhh yes... That's it... It feels so good...\" Softly letting out a breather, your whole body felt like it was in heaven, no other fingers having been able to massage better than her's. Smiling, the Druidess continued rubbing your back, slowly going lower and lower. \"To be honest, I actually think that tickling, the sensation of it, is actually quite nice, when done correctly. Do you want to try it out?\" Nodding your head subconsciously, you felt like you were in utopia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after a second did you realize what you had given her permission to do. \"W-wait, tickling can be good, but I don't think we need to bring that in here!\" Giggling to herself, the Druidess got ready her fingers, eager to show you what she meant. \"Ohh don't worry, it won't be like just now. I'll be <i>extremely</i> gentle with you this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting your eyes, you waited for the inevitable tickling to come. After a few moments of nothing happening, one eye opening in question. You didn't need to wait for long, however. You first felt the feeling of light fluttering fingers, skittering across the small of your back, bringing a small smile to your face, as well as a pleasurable sensation in your mind. Soon after, the dancing fingers moved to your sides, giving them a quick tickle before moving to the sides of your exposed breasts, light spider tickling them. Unlike a few moments ago, you let your giggles flow freely from your mouth this time, not wanting to hold it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooohhh, it seems I found quite a ticklish spot over here. Such <i>ticklish</i> breasts... And so <i>firm</i> too... I wonder how long before your giggles turn into laughter...\" Giggling herself, the Druidess continued to use one hand to skitter across the sides of your breasts, her other hand moving downwards to drawl across your quivering belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It reheheheally feheheheeels good... I didn't imagine tickling would be like this, heeehhhahhaaa!\" Giggling to yourself like a little girl, you tried your best not to move from the Druidess' teasing ministrations, her fingers working your whole body in tune like a precise instrument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing up with a skitter of her fingertips to the undersides of your breasts, she stepped back, giving you room to tie your towel around your body again. Stretching around, you truly felt that all of the knots and stresses in your body have been relieved, through a mixture of massage and tickle therapy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the Druidess inquired. \"So, do you want to...\"</span></div></div>",

Different colors have different properties, but you can't remember which were which. At any rate, that pink fairy dust is probably worth any risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to the bucket to carry away the fairy dust, when suddenly the ground gives out under you. You let out a yelp as you feel yourself falling. Looking down, you see a massive deep hole opening up underneath you. Acting on instinct, you grab onto a large root, hanging on for dear life. Looking around, you see a number of roots sticking out of the ground into the hole. Below you is only pitch blackness, who knows how far you'd fall if you let go. As your predicament begins to sink in, you wonder with more than a little resignation what's going to happen to you next.</span></div></div>",

It's all you can do to cling to a well placed root and dangle like a worm on a hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't do that silly, we built this trap just to get you here!\" Fay tells you, as you see two fairies drift down in front of you. They do indeed look like small women, only a foot tall. They have pale, smooth looking skin, long blond hair, and blue eyes. They also have pink butterfly wings on their back, as you realize that these must be the ones who laid out the pink fairy dusk. The situation having gone from bad to worse, you eye them carefully. The fairies flutter to either side of you. Ali, on your right, casually places a hand on your upper arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" she says, \"I don't think you're just a traveler. It looks to me like you're some kind of hunter.\" As she says this, she slowly drags a finger up and down your upper arm. On your left, you feel Fay do the same. The light touch sends a shudder down your spine, as you realize how vulnerable you are. Having discarded your jacket, you're left with a sleeveless shirt, some cloth pants and leather boots. Hardly the protection you'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right, Ali\" Faye says, \"Now that I think about it, you aren't a fairy hunter, are you?\" The fairies begin stroking your arm a little faster, making you twitch before quickly regaining your composure. The fairies both grin at your reaction, and now you realize: they're tickling you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I'm not. Hey girls, c-come on, cut it out.\" you plead, trying to stop them before the situation gets any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut what out?\" Ali asks, a mischievous grin on her face. \"You mean this?\" As she talks, her finger drifts into the hollow of your exposed underarm, causing you to flinch away. But this only exposes your other side all the more, causing Fay to begin gently tickling your left underarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,  does this tickle? Do we have a ticklish fairy hunter in our trap?\" Fay taunts. You don't respond, trying to keep your composure as the fairies continue to gently tease your underarms. You don't know how long you can hold on like this...</span></div></div>",

Ali and Fay continue to deftly stroke around your defenseless underarms, their touches feeling more like crawling ants than fingers. Not that it helps much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teeth grind together in a permanent grin as you try to hold on. The tickling is keeping you from pulling yourself up, but maybe you can find a place to put your feet and finally defend yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wheee!\" shouts one of the fairies before she suddenly burrows into your shirt and tumbles down until you feel her on your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gehehet out from thehehere,\" you demand through your giggles. That leaves Ali, you finally identify, as the one still outside brushing your left underarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo, what's in here?\" you hear Fay ask just prior to her sticking her hand into your navel and lightly tickling around the sides. Your eyes bulge out of your head and you cackle, twisting madly. Your grip loosens for just a fraction of a second, but it's enough for you to slide an inch down the roots before you can catch yourself. The soft tickling in and around your navel is driving you crazy, but no matter how much you buck your hips you can't get her away. Why did you have to tuck in your shirt this day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to let go so much. The tickling is driving you crazy, and the idea of just risking the fall to escape them crosses your mind repeatedly. But even if you survive the fall, what if there is something worse waiting for you down below? It's the only thing that keeps you holdong on to the roots... and suffering more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling at your navel finally stops, thankfully, and you can feel your shirt being untucked before the fairy slips out from underneath and flutters before your face. Ali ceases as well and joins Fay's side. You don't question the moment of peace and use it to gasp for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hunter is doing quite well for a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Do you think we have to go to extreme measures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we do, Ali!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw hangs wide open. They have something worse in store for you?!</span></div></div>",

You can see Ali fluttering right in front of your manhood, but you've lost track of Fay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooow, I don't get to see this often,\" says Ali, which prompts more giggling from her. All you can do is whimper as she slowly reaches out with her wiggling fingers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fay zips past your vision and stops beside Ali, having returned from a short but quick trip. \"We're lucky! I found one in no time,\" she says. You aren't sure what she means at first, but then you notice that she's branding a short bird feather in her hand like a sword. She hands it off to Ali who eagerly takes it. \"You do the tickling, and I'll do the talking. We'll switch if he doesn't fall soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFay flutters back up and takes a seat on your right shoulder, legs crossing daintily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a ticklish human... helpless... unable to stop us.

But the two of us is all it takes to make you let go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she speaks, Ali begins to stroke the feather along the length of your limp shaft. You gasp and your lips quickly turn into a smile. It tickles immensely, but at the same time it also stirs feelings of pleasure deep down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't hold on forever, human... Ali is going to keep tickling you... just tickle tickle tickle... kitchy kitchy koo... can't you feel it? Doesn't it make you want to laugh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure if it's Ali's touch or Fay's words but you burst out giggling much quicker than you would have liked. The feather continues to glide up and down your shaft, from the head down to the base. Your hips squirm side-to-side, but nothing can protect your sensitive parts from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFay leans over closer to your ear, allowing her to speak both quieter and more sensually. \"The best part about this is, the more excited you get... the more space we have to tickle! And if you <i>really </i>like it, well, let's just say it's impossible to hold on during the 'finale.' So... tickle tickle...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no way you can resist the sensations down below even if someone promised you your own kingdom. You feel your manhood stiffen, and Ali's feather brushes and swirls just below the head, both to speed up the process and elicit a fresh wave of helpless giggles from you.</span></div></div>",

Her smirk is gone, replaced by a full blown grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening,\" you mutter to yourself, squirming around. You close your eyes, hoping its all just an illusion, but the quick return of fingers squeezing your lower ribs forces you to guffaw and snap your eyes wide open again. The statue's hands are now lower, right where you felt the tickling. Why did it stop? Was it teasing you? Maybe it's judging your reactions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it doesn't like being seen. You quickly connect the dots in your head. Any time the statues moved, you weren't looking at them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare intently at the statue ahead of you... until you have to blink, that is. It's only a fraction of a second, but in the brief frame of time that your eyes are closed, the statue's hands leap to your hips and give them a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a loud squeal and jump up in surprise. How could a statue move that fast?! A bead of cold sweat runs down your temple in realization. You have to blink, and it'll get you each time you do!

Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, you feel a bulge beginning to grow in your pants, indicating your involuntary excitement at their actions. Through your laughter, you caught a sight of the statue that her her faced almost pressed against yours, her grin almost becoming even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, you feel the cold fingers that were tickling your waist stop, giving you an unexpected pause. Catching your breath, you look into the glowing eyes of the statue holding you, trying to figure out what the both of them were planning. You didn't have to wait long, feeling hands grab at your pants, pulling them down to your ankles, exposing your stone-hard member to the cold air of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to stretch your head forward to see what the other statue was doing, but the arms of the statue holding you in a full nelson still wouldn't even allow you to squirm an inch in her grip, her eerie smile still plastered on her face. You jump a little in shock, feeling one hand of the other statue grabbing your erect member, and slowly started stroking it up and down. A slight moan escapes from your lips, your mind trying to resist her playful torments. Your body however was thinking of the exact opposite, your member instead getting full and if even possible, more erect from her ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Grrnngghhh... Stop it... Let go of me! Get your hands... Uggghh... Out of there!\" You try to plead for them to stop. After hearing your words however, it felt as if she got more motivated, and started stroking a little faster. As more moans escape your lips, you felt something tickling the area around below your balls. As giggles started to bubble out of your throat, you felt a stoney fingertip wiggle around in the area between your family jewels and your member. The result was a constant ticklish yet pleasurable sensation, almost causing you to purr out loud. Instead, your moans were intermixed with giggles and boyish laughter, your face going a shade of crimson red from the mounting pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said-ahahaha! Don't... Don't stahahahaaap! It teheheheeckles so much... But don't you-ehehhehee, dare stop!\" Pleasure finally overcoming your desire to escape their grasp, you lay in their arms, laughing and moaning, the statue at your lower-body expertly stimulating and tickling you to pleasurable hysterics, sometimes pumping your member with delicate touches, and sometimes wriggling the tips of her fingers along your shaft and your balls, making you burst into more giggles and laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, finally...</span></div></div>",

Slowly opening your eyes, you see the other statue a few feet away from you, with a poker face, with her arms in the first position that you saw her in, hands raised above her head, as if she was carrying a vase of pot on top of her head. You also noticed she failed to pull your pants back up when she went back, leaving your still erect member exposed to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while, you see a figure appear in the cave.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You lay there panting. The statue tickling your genitalia stopped, much to your disappointment. You wanted the torture to continue, and you wanted a sexual release more than anything. Over your long exhales, you could hear the sound of more stone grinding, as if there were more statues approaching. The statue holding your head in place still prevented you from looking around, but as soon as you blinked, she released your head and allowed you to look around. You gasped at the sight of two more statue girls, one on each of your flanks. The one that was expertly tickling you before stares back at you, still maintaining her wide grin. Part of you wants to be free from their clutches, but the other desperately wants more tickle torture. Your body is starting to ache from being held in this position for so long. Why not ask them to reposition you? They're likely to comply considering you want to submit to them. So you make a proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you aren't finished tickling me yet, especially since these two... lovely ladies showed up.\" You blink and get a quick poke on your side from the left statue, confirming they want more of you. \"This position is starting to hurt, and I am willing to close my eyes and allow you to put me exactly how you want. I might regret this, but I trust you will make me somewhat comfortable.\" The statue behind you that wasn't in sight began to sensually massage your shoulders, giving you some confidence that they would respond well to your request. Letting out a deep breath, you felt giddy and excited. You closed your eyes, and the statues immediately, yet gently, began to position you to their liking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one behind you guided your upper body towards the cave floor. Once there, you felt your shirt being lifted up and over your head and past your arms. The others pulled your pants over each ankle, and began to spread your legs wide. Then you felt something different. You felt a stone arch form around each ankle and wrist. They tightened, holding each of your limbs securely, and comfortably to the stone floor. You realized that this meant there wouldn't be any need for a statue to hold you in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the stony movement subsided, you opened your eyes to see one statue on each side, one between your legs, and the last one in your peripheral vision. You assumed she would move to your feet once the tickling commenced, yet you wondered what she was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and waited for the tickling to begin. There was a long pause, however, and you felt a statue move closer to your head. She was concealing a thick black cloth that she then tied around your eyes, effectively blindfolding you. She then moved to your feet as you had anticipated. They started out with very light tickles, sweeping their stony fingers across your armpits, chest, belly, and hips. The one by your feet traced along the outside of each foot. You giggled quite a bit but wanted it to intensify. You didn't have to wait long. The sweeping tickles transitioned into light pokes and gentle squeezes, earning some boyish laughter. The statue to your right was constantly spider tickling your right armpit, whereas the other one drew circles, poked and prodded, and dug deep into your armpit. You couldn't decide which felt better. Your ribs received constant attention as well. Every time a rib was kneaded you wanted to leap from your stone prison, but you're glad that it held you firmly in place. Your belly was by far the most ticklish region on you, and it seemed to have attracted the best tickler as well. She constantly found the most ticklish nerve clusters and gave them a deep, resonating squeeze that brought your laughter to new heights. She varied her techniques by wiggling her stony fingertip in your belly button, eliciting numerous giggles from you. She also explored your hips and thighs, never giving you a moments peace. The tickling at your feet wasn't as extreme as the rest. She spider tickled your arches quite a bit, and it tickled immensely for a while, but it wasn't as effective considering you were already tickled extensively there. She did however discover that you are quite ticklish between your toes, and she exploited your weakness, much to your liking. You were already aroused from the earlier tickling, but this far more intense second round has you stiff yet again, and there is no way the girls haven't noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tickling went on for some time, but you hoped for some kind of change, and soon. You felt that you might pass out if this continued at this pace. Your thoughts did not go unanswered.</span></div></div>",

The other two statues resumed their tickling, one lightly scratching her nails across your soles, the other softly spider tickling your armpits. Mercifully, they avoided your belly and your ribs. This battle between tickling and pleasure kept you on the edge for a while, laughing and moaning both, but the pleasure eventually won out as the statue stroked your shaft faster and faster until you went over the peak, orgasming with a cry, bucking and moaning as much as your stone restraints allowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statues kept going however. The statue that was stroking your member continued to speed up. The pleasure became unbearable and your body bucked like a wild animal, with sounds and moans to match.

I wonder if anyone has ever tickled <b>you</b>. That sounds like an interesting question doesn't it?

You were sure it was just you, but you see the corners of her open mouth slowly close, the corners of her lips turning down to up, as though she was trying very hard to keep her giggles inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling even more at this discovery, you used both your hands, and started squeezing her stone-cold hips at random intervals. As your eyes watered up and you blinked, you see her eyes closed and her mouth open in mid-laugh, her hands trying to reach for yours to get you to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hun, I ain't stopping anytime soon, after seeing what you had planned for me. In fact... these sides and ribs of yours... They do look so <i>terribly</i> ticklish indeed. It would be a shame... I someone did... this!\" Moving your hands upwards, you gave her ribs a good squeeze, before poking all around her sides, moving randomly up and down, sometimes squeezing and poking her bare ribs, sometimes pinching and wriggling your fingers along her bare sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking again, you see her hands almost managing to wrap around her waist, her eyes open, hysterical giggling hidden behind them, her mouth in a wide smile of eternal laughter. You continued to torment the curvy female statue, spider-tickling your fingers over her taut belly, sometimes tracing around her navel. You could have sworn that you saw a small tear of mirth appear at the corner of her right eye, the corners of her lips moving even higher in an even larger smile from these new tickling sensations that she couldn't even respond to.</span></div></div>",

As you see a gleam of curiosity in her eyes, you look a her, carefully keeping her laughing sister that was in your arms in the corner of your eyes. When you thought that you had dragged her close enough, you carefully slotted the statue that was laughing into the arms of the other, causing the statue that was in a full-nelson to hold in her grasp the statue that was still in mid-laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased at your work, you rubbed your eyes for a second to remove the sweat. When you opened your eyes, you see both of the statues now had looks of horror, almost openly begging you to not do what they thought you were about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well girls, it seems that you're both in quite the pickle. Both of you stuck like that... With one grabbing the other... No way for either of you to escape. Now let's see, I wonder where the both of you are most ticklish at. Will it be your underarms? Your sides? Or maybe somewhere else? Oooohh the possibilities....\" A sly grin appears on your face, your mind already thinking of another way to further their torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you both can only move when I don't look at you, I wonder what happens if I do... this?\" You walk behind the statue that was in the full nelson pose, deliberately moving yourself forward to look closer at her back. Your suspicions were confirmed, as you feel movement from the statue in front, the one who was held in grasp of the other, trying to free herself from her sister statue, but failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't escape, can you now? Now let's see where you're ticklish at... Coochie coochie coo!\" Giggling, you reached your hands forward and dug your fingers into her outstretched underarms, feeling her stone skin squirm against your fingertips. Meanwhile at the front, the statue burst into silent giggles, her inability to laugh causing her to go insane, her whole body thrashing about, try her best to escape from her sister's unwilling grip. All the other statue could do was give a sad look, knowing that it was she who was causing her sister to feel ticklish agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what's wrong? Don't be sad, your sister's having fun! Can't you see the smile on her face, silent laughter flowing from her mouth? Oh I know! I probably shouldn't let you miss out on anything either! Here, since you so <i>kindly</i> exposed your silky underarms for me, let me help you decide which of you two has more ticklish hollows!\" You pull back your left hand from the squirming female statue in front, and started to skitter your fingers in the left underarm of the one directly in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results were appearing slowly, even though you couldn't see it. Since you couldn't see her face, the statue in the full nelson was free to move it, biting down on her lips to try and stem the flow of silent giggles about to come out from her throat. After just a few seconds though, her stony facade cracked, her mouth also open like her sisters in silent laughter, her head thrown back in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that you have the more ticklish underarms, hmmm? Don't worry though, even though your sister's underarms are less ticklish than your's, I bet her belly is <i>much</i> more sensitive, wouldn't you agree? Tickle tickle tickle!\" Grinning, you moved your right hand downwards, towards the belly of the statue that was in front. When you reached your destination, you started to poke and prod her smooth belly, sometimes poking, sometimes skittering your fingers. You felt the struggle of the statue that you were currently teasing intensify, even more movement coming from her in her feeble attempts to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both are so ticklish... Such a shame that I can't hear your laughter... No matter, I will let you <b>both</b> experience the joy of tickling! Now writhe, struggle in each other's ticklish embrace!\" With a flourish, your right hand dug into the full-nelson's statue's hollows, while your left hand reached forward, and grabbed the moving statue's hips, in the extremely ticklish area between her sides and thighs. Your hands moved as if they were playing a grand piano, skittering in one's underarms causing her face to explode in a symphony of silent laughter, while your other hand squeezed and poked, eliciting a flurry of movements and a stream of silent giggles from the one in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity for them, which was only few minutes for you...</span></div></div>",

You waited for a massive flock of imps and greater demons depart from the castle for their duties, with a few remaining as sentries.

You yelled, \"My father was a gr-\"<br>\r\n\"Your father,\" Chatouilleux interrupted, \"was going to kill me! Was I simply to let him shoot me with that crossbow? I tried not to make bad blood boil, I even sent your father's equipment back, but what do I get?

Just trying to live out her existence in comfort, but people keep trying to kill her. Even in this heavily guarded castle, you couldn't imagine how she sleeps at night (or day, you're so far north that at this time of year, it's almost always daylight outside). Wait... she's a vampire! Of course she'd just lie to trick you! You went to say something, but she put a finger to your lips, gagging you with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, save your breath.

You looked your body down and realized that while you were out, she changed your clothes! Your shirt was sleeveless and thin, and your boots, which were as thick as combat boots, were gone. One foot had a nylon stocking on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began teased, \"It's so much warmer in here, so I figured you wouldn't be needed all those heavy weapons and clothes.

The skin where it touched feels very sensitive and ultra, ultra ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChatouilleux leans in over your head, offering you a fair view of her cleavage, stuffed into a thin Gothic corset.

It's a VERY tickly process: one scrubs every inch of your feet (she removed the nylon stocking) and privates with the soft brush while the other cleans the black tickling stuff and layers of sweat off your chest. She pays special attention to the armpits, rubbing the soapy cloth all over your pits and then roughly washing your ribs.

Unfortunately, your dick was become erect at the tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be so much fun...\" she said. Chatouilleux began to dust your slightly erect dick. You howled in laughter and torment, hapless at her tickly treatment. The feathers of the duster swished around your dick, ran over the tip, and crawled on your balls, creating maddening feelings. She smirked at your reaction and began too increase her dusting speed. Tears of laughter began to form in your eyes. It was just too much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes (which felt like hours) passed as your torment continued mercilessly. You were so aroused by the tickles. \"Someone seems to be enjoying their punishment,\" she teased. \"It's helpful for me, as your erect dick gives my duster more space to tickle. It's unfortunate for you, however. Eventually you won't be able to hold it anymore. After that, my arousing tickles will become torturing tickles.\" She was right! You were nearing the edge! Suddenly, you felt another duster brush on your stomach. Your laughter soared to a new level. \"Coochie coochie coo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, your senses started to weaken. You were finally about to pass out, you thought, as it would be better than enduring her tickles. At the same time however, your body began to twitch as your dick was about to let it go. You would probably pass out from that! Barely breathing and heavily laughing, you began to fade out to blackness. \"Don't worry, slayer. The payback has just begun...\" said Chatouilleux with true satisfaction in her voice. Finally, you blacked out.</span></div></div>",

As you try to move, you quickly realise it is due to the short chains that are shackling you to the wall. You look down and see manacles around your ankles as well that are connecting you to the wall. That, and you have been relieved of the minimal clothing you had had with Chatouilleux, leaving you completely naked. You pull against your metal bonds and they unfortunately stay sturdy, despite their aged look. They also appear to have short chains by design. Short enough that you couldn't attack anyone that came near, but had enough length to say, lift up your foot for some tickling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to hell friend.\" You jolt and turn your head to where the voice came from. On the opposite wall, to your left was a woman, also shackled and naked. She had black hair that went down to her shoulders, average sized and perky breasts and dainty little feet. \"I'm Ingrid. This is Erin.\" She motioned to the other naked woman beside her. This woman was more curvy with short, blonde hair, who was clearly not coping with the situation as well as Erin was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll get used to the noise,\" Ingrid said nonchalantly. You were about to ask what she meant, when your ears began to focus on it. The agonised laughter. Forceful moans of pleasure. You slowly looked to your right and saw this dungeon was actually one long stone passageway. And lining the walls on either side were people. Men and women, all naked, all waiting for when it was their turn for torment. You saw vampiresses and other evil creatures unlocking people from their chains and whisking them away. Some apparently didn't have the patience for that. Down the passage, you saw three vampiresses tickling away at a poor lad who's face was covered with tear streaks. A little ways from that was a pale skinned, brown haired girl who had a single vampiress sucking her nipples, while feverishly rubbing her pussy. You saw this girl reach orgasm as she threw her head back and emitted a guttural moan of pleasure. This was clearly not the first time today, or even within the last hour she had been forced to climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately start yanking at your chains. \"Don't bother,\" Ingrid said. \"There's no escape from here.\"<br>\r\nTears started to flow from Erin's eyes. \"I don't want to be tickled. Not again!\"<br>\r\nYou saw that anyone who could stop you were a ways down the passage, concentrating on their current prey. Maybe they wouldn't notice you get away. The chains were sturdy, but perhaps you could yank them from the wall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been the center of your attention ever since you found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA book. One, small book that is barely big enough to <i>be</i> a book. The edges are worn, the color is faded, and the spine is barely holding it together. It looks fragile in the extreme, too delicate to be handled, too old to be of much use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, you feel, <i>something</i>. Something about the book grabs your attention, making it stand out amongst the thousands upon millions of tomes within your library. Just a dusty old book, sitting on a desk in the corner, busy collecting dust. That is the first time you have ever seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, you have no recollection of ever purchasing the book. It may not sound worrying, there being thousands of millions of books and tomes stored in your vast, nearly mile-long library. You memory is photographic however, and you have personally purchased and read each and every book in your library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept this one. You are positive that you have never bought anything even <i>like</i> this book, it being so small. There is no other way you could've acquired the book, as you would never steal - it is dishonorable (yeah you're a necromancer, but you didn't get where you are by pillaging and plundering. Besides, it's bad for business). That only leaves it to someone putting it there, but no one besides you can access your enormous mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment you are staring at the small worn book, wearing extremely loose black robes, a pair of black socks made of the softest silk money could buy, and black laceless shoes that fit your feet exactly, allowing you to slip them on and off with ease. The faded black cover bears no title, and the front and back are firmly clasped together by a lock that outwits even you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table it lies on is tern with all sorts of magical apparatus and thick tomes, all assorted and used with the intention of breaking open the lock keeping you from opening the little book. Unfortunately, none of them worked, and you are just too focused to bother reorganizing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I have brought the boy you asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see your favorite minion push in a small boy around the age of sixteen. The minion is a deadly looking thing, being revived from an era where two vast empires warred over five thousand years ago. His entire eight foot tall body is encased in black and silver heavy plate armor, with wicked spikes jutting up out of his shoulders and barbs covering each joint of his gauntlets. In his right hand he holds a massive zweihander, almost as large as the knight himself. His head is covered in a helmet with no visor, sharp points extruding from the top and a black void where his face should be. He is, in a word, terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other figure, the polar opposite of the awesome knight, is too busy being terrified to be terrifying, not that he'd be too scary anyway. Cowering at a rather short five foot eight, he immediately gales when he sees you standing before him. His shoulder-length brown hair whips back as he bows, pretty much flattening himself on the floor. His tattered clothing reveals a lot of skin, tanned from exposure to the sun. A slightly athletic build, he strikes you as wiry guy, whose lean body would be better suited to acrobatics than combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy is no longer shivering, now in awe of your presence. When you're known throughout the entire world of Zenith as the most powerful necromancer since the creation of the magic art, you tend to have that kind of effect on people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the one you sought, master,\" says the giant minion. \"The thief who tried to break into your mansion the day before last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't me!\" the boy protests. \"I swear, I saw the man who did run off into the market...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lies pour from his mouth like water from a fountain, painfully noticeable to one as practiced in the dark arts as you. You try to hear him out, but you cannot put up with it for more than ten seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" you shout, silencing the boy immediately. His face visibly pales, and his gaze slowly turns to meet yours. \"Do not deny it, I <i>know</i> it was you,\" you continue. \"I can easily detect lies coming from one who's so bad at telling them. You broke past three of my ten safety enchantments and locks, and you would've broken through the fourth had my guards not noticed you.\" Calming down, you begin to explain why you brought him here. \"Before you, no one has ever been able to get past even the first one. I brought you hear to ask for your services.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gesture towards the locked book. \"I have been trying to open that for days. Unfortunately, I have more experience in making locks than breaking them. I brought you here to offer you a solid reward for helping me open that book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gets up - slowly - and approaches the book. You step aside, allowing him to pick it up and inspect the lock. After about a few minutes, he sets the book down and turns back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lock is fairly simple,\" he starts. \"Extremely effective, but simple. Many people, like you, would think that the lock would be complicated, and try clever ways to open it. Really, all you have to do is overpower and break the lock through sheer force. But a lock like this needs a lot of power to break, which is why it is effective against someone like me.\" He makes eye contact with you. \"But for someone like you, opening this should be effortless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenuinely impressed, you motion back towards the door. \"Well done. Exit this room, take a left, and the third door on the right will have your reward; a chest of gold trinkets and some fine clothes. From there, my minions will show you out. And don't snoop around, for I know all that goes on within this household.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding gratefully, the boy turns and runs down the room. His quick exit is almost stopped by the knight, but a motion from you gets him to stand down. It will be a while before the thief spends all his money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are your wishes, master?\" asks the giant figure, awaiting your next command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here,\" you say. \"I may have need of you.\" Clutching your staff (a beautiful artifact of gold, painted black willow wood, and encrusted onyx), you send a small yet focused blast of pure force at the lock. It makes contact, and suddenly the book flies open, pages turning rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the book, trying to discern the meaning of the flipping pages, when suddenly it stops. Standing at the table now, you look down and see the name of a very formidable demoness. In fact, you are so shocked you unconsciously whisper her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, most necromancers need aid from their appendages and items and concoctions to summon a demon. Not you. No, you are so powerful that simply speaking the demon's name is enough to bring it to this world. Also, if the demon is trying to come into this world, they may come unbidden to the most powerful necromancer who knows of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn both cases, it doesn't take much to bring Serelia into your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vortex between worlds opens, filling the room with pure darkness and unspeakable energy. Slowly, a figure emerges from the twisting shadow, and you are at first surprised at the demoness'  beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body is very shapely, with curvy hips and an hourglass form. Two small patches of cloth are all that is on her supple breasts, magically held in place to offer what modesty they can. Her legs are long and end in cute feet, surprisingly small compared to the rest of her body. Her face is that of a rare beauty's, and her flowing long black hair nearly reaches her butt, broken by two long ram's horns protruding from her forehead. Long nails extrude from each finger, and each comes to a dull but pointy claw.  Her skin is a very light red, clearly a demon but not crimson, and all she wears besides the patches on her breasts is a loin cloth that can only be described as skimpy at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, her looks are perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vortex closes, the darkness ceases, and you are left upright, gaping before Serelia, the most beautiful and possibly most powerful demoness in existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her eyes open, revealing green irises the color of moss. Her mouth opens, and in a voice that sounds more than human she says...</span></div></div>",

It tingles with an unearthly power which causes not only the hairs on the back of your neck to rise, but a sudden tinge of pleasure deep within yourself. A shiver of anticipation runs down your spine for but a moment before you regain your composure. This was no time to let your mind be distracted by dirty thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour snap your head over towards your loyal minion still standing by the doorway, suddenly finding it absurd that you even have to give the order. \"Get her!\" you shout, swinging one arm out towards the demoness to make it perfectly clear on who you are referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own head turns towards the demoness, his armor clanking together as sharp bits scrape and slide over the plates. With a seemingly calm demeanor, the armored creature strides towards her, effortlessly lifting the large zweihander in his right hand hand. Serelia slowly turns to face the oncoming foe, an amused smirk tugging at the corners of her lips. Even as the armored man brings the two-handed blade high above her head, her posture merely shifts to one of slight-interest, her hip sticking out to one side as a hand dropped to settle upon her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, he strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade swings down with such velocity that it appears a blur to even your trained eyes... but stops only inches from Serelia's head. One of her slender hands is pressed up against the sword, her long fingers having curled around it. She doesn't even appear to be straining. Had your minion still retained his face, you're sure he would have looked as surprised as you were at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh... is this what you deem as help these days?\" she responds, her tone just condescending enough to overtake her sensuality and cause a streak of anger to race through you. However, before you can respond, her free hand thrusts straight towards the armored man's midsection... and continued on through to the other side. Shards of twisted metal fly out in all directions, and his body shudders from the force. She lifts up one beautiful foot and kicks straight forward just below where her arm has gone through, sending your minion soaring backwards into the wall, and clear on through, sending bits of wooden debris falling down through the large hole his body creates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerelia slowly looks back at you, letting the zweihander finally slip from her grasp and clatter to the floor beside her. Once more a beautiful, yet startlingly predatory, smile forms upon her plush lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Care to test your luck, too?\"</span></div></div>",

Many have,\" comes the casual response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, you point at her with the onyx staff and position yourself in a casting stance. It is common knowledge that demons, being made from pure evil, are immune to all forms of dark arts. To defeat her, you'll need to rely on a more primal force of magic, similar to the blast you sent at the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncantations fly through your head as a green mist fills the room. Determined to make your first blow your last, you begin to pool your strength into the powerful artifact in your hands. Below you, a rune engraves itself on the floor, an enchantment you cast to help double the effectiveness of your magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this were a human you were up against, they'd be desperately trying to attack you, find a way to stop you from casting.

At least that would give You <i>some</i> satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you look on helplessly as you blast is simply blocked and neutralized, all the strength and energy and pure <i>power</i> within it dissipating into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know what is happening, your staff shatters, your runes vanish, and the demoness is standing above your kneeling body.

However, you may not be able to fight her, but you can still make out of this with your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou summon the last dregs of your mana in the form of inhuman speed, but instead of crashing into her or running backwards you shoot to the side. Your body impacts with a window and you smash through the glass, plummeting from the top story of the immense library. You take some pleasure in her cry of fury before you hit the muddy  ground below, <i>hard</i>. Your now-befouled robes stopped the lethal fall from killing you, but for the first time you feel pain as the wind is knocked out of you. You limp off into the nearby forest as the demoness's powers engulf and further corrupt your fortress behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night you spend huddled in a small cave on the outskirts of a village, cursing your reduced magical abilities. It seems your powers have been reduced to that of a common hedge wizard: basic conjuring and elemental spells. No summoning dark minions from the void, binding lesser creatures to your will, or choking the air with vile poisons. All those secrets are condensed in your staff and in your books, which lie gathering dust in the fortress Serelia has taken over. At least your age was frozen when you lost your powers; you're stuck looking like a person in their 20-somethings rather than around 2 centuries.

You finally come to the conclusion that you'll need to do the unthinkable: join the Academy of Light. The light magic taught by these mages could prove invaluable to defeating Serelia, though it might be hard to fit in with weak do-gooders like them. As you come to the uncomfortable conclusion that you'll need to enroll in this Academy, you hear screams from the village nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the commotion you steal a sturdy horse from a nearby tavern and ride out of town. Just in time, too, for behind you Serelia has unleashed her own forces on the town: numerous lesser succubi, inferi, lecherous rusalki, screeching harpies, and other beasts stream forth from what had once been your gates. Yesterday you could have eradicated these things with a mere wave, but today you doubt you could defeat more than one. Still, you have to glance back with a smirk at the plight of the townspeople, what were they thinking living so close to such an ominous fortress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knit your brows in confusion when you see that instead of screaming in pain, they seem to be laughing because of the various monsters' ministrations. Then your filched steed rides over a shallow riverbed, and you have to blink to get the water out of your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Off to the Academy of Light</i> you think to yourself bitterly, wondering how you ever got yourself into this miserable mess. The black robes on your back are the only reminder of the power and knowledge you've been forced to leave behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before now, you thought the words were cowardly, and only now do you see the logic behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your clothes aren't exactly tailored for running. \u00a0Your movement is restricted within the confines of the robe, and you need to struggle to run in the comfort-made shoes. You try to compensate by throwing up walls and barriers, but Serelia tears through them as if they were paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back, and are met with an unwelcome sight. The demoness is quickly walking after you, shrugging off all your spells and enchantments. Despite the fact that she's just walking, she is still slowly gaining ground on you. A little pathetic, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing forward again, you see the tan thief and one of your servant minions exit into the hallway. The minion notices you right away, but the boy is still trying to grasp the large chest in his arms without dropping it. This might come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Distract her!\" you shout at the minion. As it hastens to obey, the thief finally looks up and sees you 'running' from the demoness. He only has the time to look confused as you pass him, throwing him to the ground as you do. Desperate, you risk a backward glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerelia has to slow down to contend with the minion you sent at her, but it still only takes a second for her to dispatch it. However, the thief does a much better job, getting up right in the middle of the lavish corridor, blocking the demoness' path completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerelia almost just kicks him aside, but something stops her. What happens instead is much more disturbing, even to one like yourself. The thief looks up to see the demoness' face, and blushes at her beauty. Irritatedly Serelia lifts a finger and points at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy vanishes, pulled into a pool of black, colorless darkness. You can hear him scream in pain as the vortex closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the motivation you needed. In a desperate move to gain speed, you reach down and tear off the lower half of your robes. It exposes your knees and downward, but it allows you to actually <i>run</i>. Just in case, you kick off your shoes so your footing is more sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Serelia seems to have stepped up her game too. Your left sleeve is cut off by a whizzing slice of darkness, which then proceeds to cut through the ceiling and out into the air. The damage to your expensive mansion pains you, but fear for your life is still more urgent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother blade of darkness takes out a large portion from the right of your clothes, exposing your hip and side to the air. Soon darkness seems to be flying at you like volleys of arrows, most of them missing but some taking bits and pieces of your tattered robes. None of them actually hit you, which seems strange. But you have no time to ponder it, as you turn to see the demoness running and gaining on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn an instinct you turn to your right... and are met with a wall. Not a wall like the ones that are on either side of the hallway, but a magical barrier put up by Serelia herself. Apparently she's done playing cat and mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash you're flat on the ground, naked save for your undergarments with one of the demoness' pretty little feet pressing into your back. There is little resistance left within you, though your pride objects to being put in such a shameful position. Then your thoughts wander to what happened with the boy, and you feel a heavy sense of dread within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that voice that is both frightening and sensual, Serelia puts her head next to yours and whispers in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" she coos. \"I won't kill you off like that petty mongrel of a child. You're much too powerful to go to waste. I think I'll have you be my personal slave, doing whatever I wish.\" She giggles, a sound that is both dreadful and beautiful. \"But tell me, what should I do with such a...</span></div></div>",

Your father will be done with his meetings soon, and I'm sure he'll want to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe riding track ahead of you continues to twist away from the royal palace, much to the concern of your attendant. Tall oaks on either side of you provide excellent shade from the giant midday sun, and the sounds of wildlife surround you and help you feel relaxed. Turning back, you see the enormous stone castle with majestic spires and tall towers get smaller and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg of you, your highness, the king worries for your safety and so do I. It is a common known fact that are national security is not what it should be, and if we're ambushed I won't be ample protection for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Jasper,\" you say, trying to soothe him. \"It is just a quick ride, we'll be back to the palace before sundown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sundown is several hours away,\" Jasper points out. \"And in that time anything could happen. It worries me to think what might become of you if you happen to get captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're worrying to much, Jasper. Just calm down and enjoy the forest.\" You spoke the truth, but it has always been Jasper's nature to worry. Nearly six feet tall standing, he was easily taller than many in the palace - you included. His angular features were creased with worry, his short black hair combed to perfection without a stray strand to be seen. His clothes were elegant and straight, and his demeanor always made it clear to whom he owed his loyalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour caretaker for several years, Jasper has always been by your side and ready to make himself handy. If only he could be a bit more relaxed, he'd be the perfect person to have around. As it was, his excellent manners, good sense of humor, and his ability to talk his way out of any situation makes him a valuable friend, and one of the closest people to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing about Jasper though, he is always worrying about something. In his defense, a member of the royal family is a huge responsibility, and in this particular instance his worries were well-founded. Hostilities have been brewing for many years now, and the allegiance of your country will be the key to ensuring its safety as well as the outcome of the war. It's times like these that a country could make use of a skilled diplomat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr a hostage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the declaration of war, your father has made sure you've been well protected. He says it will stay that way until he makes his decision on which coalition to join and can move you to a safer location, preferably far from enemy borders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it has been, for the past month, that your father has had several diplomatic meetings and met with other monarchs and rulers that he may make a more educated and wise decision. Because of all that he has had little time to see you except to make sure you're all right from time to time and for some formal presentation to a potential ally. And whenever you <i>are</i> alone, it is with a dozen guards outside the door and windows, making sure no one can get near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn politics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis horse riding trip was the first opportunity you've had to even get out of the palace. And to your surprise, Jasper was to be the only one accompanying you. Of course the attendant tried to 'reason' with the king, but your father said you needed some time away from the worries of international politics. Whatever the reason, you were glad to get the chance to step out into the wild. And so far the trip has been turning out to be exactly what you need, calming your mind and relaxing your worries, and no sign of anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness, I understand your desire to get some fresh air but there's plenty of that in the garden. This far out from the capital there's sure to be some horrible fate awaiting us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's going to happen. Besides, kidnappers would expect me to be <i>in</i> the palace. You need to just calm down, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden an arrow come hissing out of the trees, burying itself in the neck of the chestnut horse you're riding. The well aimed shot kills the horse instantly, which falls to one side as two men step out of the bushes and hurry towards you. Trapped between the dead horse and the ground, there is nothing you can do but wait for them to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go back to the palace your highness! Your father will know about this, and not rest until you're found!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry Jasper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe galloping of Jasper's horse grows quieter as he hurries back to the capital. You're glad he had the sense not to try and save you himself: Jasper is a smooth talker, but by no means a fighter. Turning to face your attackers, you see that one of them is holding some rope. You have no time to register this information though, as the pommel of an unseen sword makes contact with your temple, and you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stir. Your head is still throbbing from the blow, and you wince in pain. Trying to bring a hand down to rub it, you realize you can't. It is then you notice that you're no longer in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is empty, not even a table or chair to furnish it. Directly in from of you on the far wall is a door, old but solid. The walls and floor are also made of lumber, but the roof seems to be made of thatch like a farm cottage. There is a gap where some of the material has fallen, allowing the morning sun to shine through and give light to the barren scene. You try moving again, but are still unable to do so. That's when you look at what you are restrained to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProving your earlier assumption false, there is one thing in the room. A hook, originally put there for hanging paintings, is now used lift your bound hands above your head. Looking down you see your feet are tied in a similar fashion, except that there is a heavy stone on the ground to which they're attached. The wile layout has you spread taught on the walls, with little slack and your body completely exposed. Speaking of which, it finally hits you that you are nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to blush, but are distracted when you hear the door creak open to admit a woman in tight-fitting dark clothes. Entering, she closes the door behind her. \"Well well well,\" you hear her say.</span></div></div>",

She saunters towards you, swaying her hips in a most seductive manner as you avert your gaze, determined not too show how shaken you are, or how pleasing you find this woman's appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to say little Prince?\" She asks, continuing her mocking tone before reaching her destination right in front of you, her breasts pressing lightly against your chest as she looks up and down at you \"I suppose it's only right, I haven't acted as the most gracious of hosts after all. My name is Lucrecia. You're here for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be your hostage in order to get my father to ally with one of the coalitions? That's it isn't it?\" You demand with a great deal of bitterness in your voice at having been captured so easily and this woman now toying with you. It was almost too much to bear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucrecia simply gave a predatory smile in response as she continued to brush against your body, evidently enjoying the growing blush on your cheeks \"There is that yes.\" She admitted \"But I have... other skills that those who're employing me value. This isn't the first time I've captured a cute member of a Monarchy such as yourself. Nor is it the first time I've tortured one for information either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your best attempts at self control, you flinch at the mention of torture and fear whelms up inside of you \"Y-You wouldn't!\" You demand, unable to completely keep the tone of horror out of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucrecia simply giggles once more in response \"Oh don't worry, it's not the kind of torture that'll hurt, or leave a permanent mark.\" She says, doing little to alleviate your fears. She suddenly reaches out with both hands and starts to skitter her fingers up and down your side, grazing softly against your skin \"It'll be a laugh in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink in surprise from the sudden tickling before clamping your mouth shut. She couldn't be serious, could she? You squirm in your bonds, writhing and twisting about as you try to fight the laughter bubbling inside of you from the tingling going up and down your sides. You couldn't show weakness in front of this woman! Especially when it was something as childish as tickling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly noticing the inner conflict within you, Lucrecia sped up her fingers, tickling up from your ribs down to your hips at a rapid pace. She stroked and scratched all over your flanks for any weak area, smiling at each suppressed squeak and laugh from you \"Open up little Prince.\" She whispers into your ear \"Open up or I may have to look for other places to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her warm breath caress your ear and consider your options. You refuse to show weakness to this but considering you're naked and completely open to any kind of ticklish assault, it's a tough choice. Eventually you decide too...</span></div></div>",

Light feathery touches drag up and down the sides of your belly, nearly causing you to laugh. You persevere though, and manage to force down the laughter, though giggles are still bubbling just behind your forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tickles, and you know it,\" Lucrecia teases. \"We both know that you can't hold out for long, and I haven't even gotten serious yet. I can if you want though.\" She leans in close, her mouth right next to your ear. \"It can get a whole lot worse,\" she whispers seductively into your ear. \"But it doesn't have to. Just laugh little prince, and I may start asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can manage without laughing is \"Mmmmphmhmhmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? Alright then.\" Suddenly the assault on your abdomen ends, giving you a moment to relax. That was a mistake, as when Lucrecia's nails make contact with your stretched underarms you immediately burst out laughing. Your left armpit is subjected to scribbling with just the tips of her nails, while Lucrecia's other hand draws lazy circles in your right armpit, getting gradually slower and focusing on the worst spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh freely now, all restraints broken by her sudden attack. Attempting to squirm, you find your movement greatly restricted by the way she tied you. In your current state you are stretched taught with every part of your body exposed. In fact, she could go behind you and tickle you from there if she so wished. She had access to absolutely every part of your body, while you were completely defenseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucrecia begins whispering in your ear again. \"That's it little prince.

I'll have to receive my reward now, so don't expect me to let up for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer left hand, the one drawing circles, now does so on your belly. To replace it, she moves her mouth right next to your armpit and starts dragging her tongue up and down the hollow that forms there. Your laughter becomes even more frenzied as a result, as the feeling of disgust mixes with the overload of tickling sensation. A higher pitch is reached in your laughter as Lucrecia's questing finger finds your navel, and decides to stay there for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the flurry of tickling you barely have the awareness to notice the door to the little cottage opening.

It is clear that she is outmatched however, as the six troops line up and point their broadswords. Your family crest shone on their polished blue armor, a black eagle holding a hammer in its right hand and a pickaxe in its left. At an unspoken command, they all at once start advancing towards your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from the full armor plating and the visored helmets, they belonged to the Elite Guard of the palace, responsible for the safety of the royal family. These men and women were handpicked by the King's military commander for their height and strength, then put through an intense training program that pushed their skill higher than the elites of any other country. Their numbers were only a couple hundred, but with their skill each man or woman counted for a dozen on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're the reason why no other country has dared attacked your home. An attack would beckon your father to join the opposing coalition, and while the Elites could be overwhelmed though sheer numbers, if they had a supporting army they'd be unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, these six would make quick work of your eccentric interrogator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling nervously, Lucrecia slowly backs towards the wall you're restrained to. \"It looks like I wasn't careful enough,\" she says. \"Should've seen this coming, you can never trust mercs.\" In a flash, she has a short knife pressing against your throat. \"Step back, or he's breathing through a new hole in his neck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elites stop at once. Charged with protecting your life, they could not do anything that might endanger you. They stand and stare, unsure of how to proceed. Then they part, allowing Jasper (who stood nearly as tall as they) to pass through and confront Lucrecia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scrutinizes her for a long while, then nodds as if having confirmed something. It is clear: he's preparing to talk you out of this. Knowing Jasper, he could talk Lucrecia into dropping the knife and make her feel good about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're bluffing,\" he states blankly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Lucrecia's blade push a little harder against your skin.

I've killed boys younger than this!\" Lucrecia yells wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said you lacked the ability to,\" Jasper corrects. \"I simply said you're bluffing: you <i>won't</i> kill him. If you do, you have no hostage, no source of information, no leverage against our king, and no way out. Our King will declare war on your country - which I daresay he will anyway - and these soldiers will cut you to pieces if you so much as scratch that boy with your dull knife there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hits you like a hammer, and you mentally kick yourself. Of course! If the knife were sharp, Lucrecia would have drawn blood already with the intensity she's holding you with. You turn as much as you are able, enough to see your tormentor's flabbergasted expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, Jasper was just <i>that</i> damn good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now please back away from our beloved prince, before I order these vengeful guards to turn you into a corpse.\" Despite the venom in his words, Jasper carries himself with a calm demeanor and stance, though his eyes betray his icy fury. At their mention, each armored soldier takes a step forward that panics Lucrecia greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, fine, you win,\" she says resignedly. \"Just be cautious when declaring war, as my King will call his allies to bring hell to this little country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, the only ally your country currently has right now is Rylestia, who's caught up in some border war with Coninze, and an abysmal island state hundreds of miles from here.\" As Jasper turns to face you, he suddenly realizes you're stark naked. \"And take off your clothes while you're surrendering: this is no way for a prince to be seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucrecia starts to protest, but one of the huge guards steps forward and she complies quickly enough. As she slips out of the tight-fitting black clothes, you find it hard not to stare at her exposed skin and undergarments. Just as she's about to take of her bra, Jasper speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite enough. There's no call for you to strip, and I daresay the prince won't be needing any of your undergarments,\" Jasper says without emotion. Motioning to the guards, he bends down to gather the discarded clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo step forward and draw Lucrecia off to one side, while two more approach you and cut you loose. The ropes are cut like butter, betraying the sharp edge that each broadsword has. Just an example of the great craftsmanship your country produces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing your wrists, you turn to see Jasper offering you Lucrecia's shirt and pants. \"Please put these on your highness,\" he asks. \"We have brought a wagon with us, so meet us outside once you have finished dressing.\" With that, the six guards push Lucrecia out the door, followed by Jasper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dress quickly, testing out the clothes. A little loose on the hips and very loose on the chest, but manageable until you returned to the palace.  Stepping out of the house, you are met with the sight of the very forest you were taken in. The little cottage is situated in an open clearing, which explains the sunlight shooting through the hole in the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the thick forest is glimmering with sunlight reflected off of the thick undergrowth. Clumps of bushes scatter throughout between the trees, creating a natural barrier that even a dismounted man would have trouble getting through. The only way out is a single dirt road, leading straight from the little cottage to the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSituated on the road is an open wagon, meant for carrying supplies but turned into a makeshift transport. In it Lucrecia sits with ankles and wrists bound together, surrounded by the six Elite Guards that sit patiently. From the front seat, Jasper waves at you as he tries to grab your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here your highness!\" He beckons to the shotgun seat next to him, a wooden bench made for practicality as opposed to comfort. You don't complain though, not being the stereotypical stuck-up prince that gets pampered all the time. As soon as you sit, Jasper hits the reins and gets the wagon moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again you have proven your worth Jasper, as a friend and ally,\" you tell him appraisingly. \"Though I must ask, how did you find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We spotted a couple of mercenaries near the area where you were taken,\" Jasper answers, his formal demeanor starting to melt slightly. \"They were trying to dispose of your dead horse, but we caught the brutes before they could run. Some quick talking and a threat or two loosened their tongues enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw a glance back at the Elites and Lucrecia. \"And how do you know which country she belongs to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The clothes are a dead giveaway. Only one group of kidnappers wear clothes like those, belonging to Fraug to the south west. The country is less of a nation and more of a loose confederation of city-states that have pledged allegiance to their 'King'. Because of this Fraug has seen multiple uprising from the various nobles, so this group of kidnappers were put together to take hostages and force the rebelling nobles to stand down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to look at Lucrecia's bound form. \"And you think she's one of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper nods. \"As I have said, they are the only to wear such clothes. They are also trained in retrieving vital information without leaving any marks or scars. In this way, they are able to keep their captives intact forever whilst subjugating them to a near endless amount of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickling,\" you say, shivering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Jasper nods. \"It appears that you have already seen what she can do. If your highness so wishes, you could repay the favor in kind. She will be needed for interrogation, but I'm sure it will be easier if you soften her up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wagon continues its journey out into the open, away from the forest and towards the palace. The mid-morning sun shines brightly,and the grass sways gently the wind. Before you, a huge wall with a single gate looms over the wagon. Entering the castle grounds, you are met with a familiar sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gate opens to the private gardens, a large space with exotic plants arranged in neat rows separated by rock paths and grassy clearings. Further back, the entrance to the palace was a set of double doors inlaid with precious metals, which was merely a back door. Towering spires and parapets loom above, rising out of the giant structure of stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Jasper brings the wagon to halt beside the door, where two more Elite Guards stand at attention. The wagon halts, and Jasper steps down to allow one of the guards to take his place at the reins. You follow close behind your attendant, but before you disappear into the palace a voice speaks up from the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness,\" a guard says, gesturing to Lucrecia. \"Where do you want this prisoner sent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Jasper, who nods and beckons for you to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards,\" you begin.</span></div></div>",

Since the noise appears to be coming from all directions, hiding in the undergrowth seems ill advised. You peek at each of the nearby trees- too small, not enough leaves to hid you, too hard to climb- before finding one with just the right amount of handholds to climb and hide in. As fast as you can, you shimmy up the tree until you're at a high branch with enough foliage to hide you effectively. As whatever is making the noise finally arrives, you peek through the leaves to get a glimpse of it. What you see surprises even your well traveled eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnakes. Hundreds of them, of every shape and size. Cobras and pythons and harmless garden snakes, snakes so big they could easily eat a cow and snakes smaller than your pinky finger. Many of them you are pretty damn sure aren't native to this area. All of them slither through the undergrowth in a single direction, moving deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurs to you that such an insane event would not happen without cause.

At the tree-line, several archer squads are positioned and poised to strike. The rest of the outlaws, the ones more suited to close combat, are slowly but surely making their way to the foot of the wall. Once the melee troops are in place, the archers will rain fire arrows on the town and generally get themselves noticed. With the town in a panic and the garrison rushing unprepared to the walls, the bandit warriors will scale the two meter tall barriers with ladders and grappling hooks and finish off any spell casters before cutting through the populace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything is tipped in your favor.

The road into the city is far to your right, guarded by a gatehouse with towers, and is currently empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whisper from your squad leader.

That's right, the bushes. Ropes and roots shoot out of the shrubbery and ensnare the bandits nearest them, catching them off guard and throwing them to the ground. The rest of the outlaws, surprised at the suddenness of it all, are attacked by the well-hidden militia that were hiding in the bushes. You kick yourself mentally: you passed right by them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as you can tell, you are the only one not engaged. Should you join the fray and try to help your comrades?

Your only other options force you to follow the wall, which isn't fitting with the idea of getting <i>away</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash in-between duels, avoiding the occasional stray blade or axe. Thankfully the bushes don't hold any more surprises, and you pass clear on through. You feel a little shame leaving your comrades behind, but knowing them they'd do the same in your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems way too long a time you finally make it to the forest. Jumping into the trees, you begin to continue running when something strikes you as odd. The outlaw archers should be here, and yet they aren't. But you swear you saw the volley of fire arrows disappear into the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking left, you spot an abandoned bow and quiver, seemingly dropped at a moment's notice as the owner ran. You are about to pick up the equipment when you hear a strange noise. It reminds you of something, right at the tip of your tongue. You follow the noise, and remember what the sound reminds you of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBound not ten feet from you lies a bandit, one of the archers who supposedly fired the flaming volley. The sounds are coming fro his gagged mouth, and you notice his ankles and wrists are bound tightly as well. This begins to register in your brain as the sign of an ambush, but before you figure out it means there's an enemy here you feel something thick and heavy hit you across the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head to clear it of sleepiness, you look at your surroundings. You are...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The square is full of people staring at you. Most of them appear to be elves, but groups of humans are scattered throughout the crowd. All seem to have simply stopped with their daily lives just to take a look. One man is hefting a large sack of flour, another is holding a pile of books, a woman is carrying a basket filled with vegetables. You even see some people in the middle of a purchase, vendors and customers, pausing to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloser to you, you see a circle of eight elves - all women - chanting in quiet and hushed tones, heads bowed. They are all wearing some sort of robe, with a feathered headress that covers all the face except for the mouth. Each one has a unique silver designed sewn onto a mixture of different shades of blue. The colors remind you of a flowing river, <br>\r\nwhich suddenly sparks a memory of some ritual they perform in this village. Hazy, something about a... tentacle? The details elude you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssessing <i>your</i> situation doesn't take long. Put simply, you are strapped naked to a table structure in the middle of the plaza with your arms and legs stretched to the corners. Not exactly a dignified position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith bright red cheeks you turn to the nearest person - one of the priestesses - and ask \"Why am I here? What's going on?\" The priestess simply ignore you continuing with her mumbling. You turn to the other side and repeat your questions to another priestess, and you get the same reaction. Just when you're about to start shouting, the chanting stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around you the priestesses raise their arms, as if beckoning to the sky in a dramatic performance. What they say next isn't in any language you know:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hie erit sacrificium nostrum.<br>\r\n   Offerimus eum magnam.<br>\r\n   Audiat risus.<br>\r\n   Gaudeat de dono nostro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their little speech done, they slowly begin to walk towards you. The new ring they form is just next to the table, to the point that they can reach out and touch you. Though you can't see their eyes through the headdresses, but you are sure each priestess is staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some unspoken command, they shift formation slightly in a way the places four of them on either side of you. Your heart pounds in your chest, anticipating what they might do to you. Did one of them carry a sacrificial knife? Were they going to paint you or something? There was no indication as to their intention, but the silence was broken again by speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, the eight elves shouted \"Incipere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of them reach for your naked and exposed form. What they plan becomes apparent when their fingers begin to wiggle slightly, causing you to struggle against your bonds. Were they really planning on tickling you? Thinking back to the crowd, you wonder whether this is public amusement. One would assume not though, otherwise there would be no need for priestesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a desperate attempt to escape the fingers, you yell \"Please! I'm sorry! I'll do anything, just don't tickle me! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once all eight women turn to face the head of the table. Actually, they are facing someone who has appeared at the head of the table. You look up to see another elf priestess, though this one seems different than the ones on either side of you. Her roves are similar to the other priestess', but they are shades of green with gold designs sewn on. Her headdress also has more feathers and is bigger than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a voice that holds no mercy, she speaks to you. \"You have raided this land, desecrated our forest, and tried to pillage our city. There is no reason we should listen to your pleas.\" She pauses.</span></div></div>",

Inside is a small room that consists of a dresser and a bed, with a small barred window to let light in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe orders you to lie down on the bed then retreives a set of thin undergarments and orders you to put them on.

But when she finally did she had quite the un-eventful night. In the morning she re-stripped and spent her morning examining the make of her new clothing. They were made of some form of slightly uncomfortable black fabric, but they did their job very well and that was all you could really ask for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand to attention as you hear the door being unlocked.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To the far east, farther than the easter deserts but closer than the Horizon Islands, lies a forest of lush green and bright flowers. This lush vegetation spans all the way to the coast, encompassing more than a fifth of the continent. No nation has ever managed to tame these woods, but people who seek independence have set up towns and posts where once can spend a peaceful life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the coast of Nguya on the eastern edge stands a great pillar of stone, reaching high into the sky. No one has ever seen the top, nor has anyone dared try to scale the sleek cliffs in search of it. If the landmark were in some country it would easily be marked as a natural wonder and attract travelers from the entire continent. Instead, the only ones who ever see it are the travelers who wish to venture deep into the forest and the religious humans who believe it is a staircase to heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir temples are ancient structures of rock, surrounding the great stone tower. Heaven's Pillar they call it, and they worship it as a living entity as well as the gods and goddesses they believe stand watch over it. The temple complex makes a ring around Heaven's Pillar, big enough to support hundreds of believers and have enough room for all the practices and shrines to the many deities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself before the rigid stone structure of the temple complex right now, seeking solace from your shady and shameful past in religion. The Worshippers of Heaven's Pillar led comfortable lives despite their constant practices of faith, and every convert is promised to be allowed to ascend in the afterlife. You want to atone, and be promised with utopia in the next world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance is very cubic, with stone steps leading up to a square open entrance and straight pillars that support the flat roof. Moss grew fervently on the stone walls, but the plant seemed to stay away from the inside of the temple itself. Behind and to either side of you the forest looms, inviting and mysterious. On the far side of the temple, behind Heaven's Pillar, the coast of Nguya stretched left and right as far as the eye could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few steps towards the stairs, and uncertainly climb them until you're standing next to the pillars. Before you a large stone passage reaches deep into the building, with several hallways branching off on either side. Unsure of what to do next, you stand there and debate whether you should shout. Fortunately, it seems that they've noticed you as two men in yellow robes walk towards you from one of the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome stranger,\" greeted the young man to your right. His chocolate brown eyes seemed welcoming behind a few wisps of hair that fell in front of them. Black hair covered his ears, and his warm smile helped ease your worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you come seeking a place to rest? We Worshippers offer a bed and food for any who need it,\" says the man to your left, old yet with kind features. A bald scalp crowned a pair of blue eyes, wise and knowledgeable. They seemed to whisper to you, years of faith and religion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of these two, it is suddenly much harder to speak your mind. \"I, um, I wish to join the Worshippers of Heaven's Pillar,\" you say, shy for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, their smiles grow even wider. \"Then follow us, stranger, that we may bring you before the High Priestess,\" instructs the elderly man, who then turns and begins walking deeper within the temple. The other man beckons to follow, and soon the three of you are walking down the large passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylights in the roof of the structure admits the radiant sunshine into the ancient stone building. Lit by the natural light, all kinds of wall art line the passage: murals, mosaics, carvings. Pictures of Heaven's Pillar and its reverent worshippers cover both walls. However, amongst them are depictions of worshippers laughing, bound in different positions and structures. In these pictures, other worshippers seem to be tickling the captives along with... something else. Larger beings that are shown differently than the worshippers; some with multiple arms, some with hair that moves, some that have tentacles. Curious creatures of which the likes you've never seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hall you see another doorway, probably leading to your destination. The worshippers lead you through into what looks like a throne room. Opposite where you entered is an enormous statue of a six-armed woman, hands open and lifted. The eyes seem to be made of emeralds, glowing green on a gorgeous stone face, hair falling all the way to the floor. Her robe looks much like the robes of the worshippers, except with designs written across the sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you correct your analysis. The only quality this place shares with a throne room is the size. Carvings line the walls, all with similar depictions as those in the passage outside. No throne, or chair for that matter, exists within the room. Instead, where a throne would normally be place is a circular pool of water, shimmering with reflected sunshine from the skylight. A figure is kneeling before it, head bowed and silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men who led you here kneel and bow, assuming a posture similar to the person before the pool of water. \"High Priestess,\" begins the youthful man. \"A traveler has come in hopes of converting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, the woman who you assume is the High Priestess turns and looks at you. Her face bears a startling likeness to the statue's, with green eyes and long brown hair almost reaching the floor. Gorgeous features examine you, your traveler's attire, your weary body. A solid expression turns soft, and her voice is sweeter than honeycomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Temple of Heaven's Pillar traveler,\" she says with authority. \"Many have traveled far to join us, though none as far as you seem to have. Are you from beyond the forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes High Priestess,\" you answer. \"I've led a shameful life of thieving and lying, a life I wish to leave behind.\" You kneel and bow like the others have done. \"Please, I will devote the rest of my life to Heaven's Pillar if I may be granted forgiveness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile forms on the High Priestess' lips as she turns to face the enormous statue and pool of shining water. \"Heaven's Pillar is a staircase for many gods and goddesses, those who watch over it and carry those who passed from this world up into utopia. To each of these deities we have built a shrine within our temple, each containing an idol of their physical form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman kneels and looks into the water before continuing. \"Today, you will be brought before one such idol. Left alone in the shrine, you will confess your shame to the deity and ask forgiveness. Worshippers will come to get you at dawn, by which you will either be marked or left unscathed. This will reveal whether the gods and goddesses accept you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you hope that whichever god or goddess that judges you will be forgiving. Before you, the two robed men stand in preparation yet keep their heads bowed in respect. You do the same, eager to start what you hope is the ritual which will grant you sanctuary from your past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring deep into the pool, the High Priestess takes a moment before declaring which shrine you will be brought to.</span></div></div>",

They reach a heavy stone door, and opening it, wait for you to enter. As you enter, the robed men shut the door heavily behind you, leaving you alone in the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, the shrine seems lavish. The floor is carpeted by a fuzzy rug, perhaps made from some kind of wool. On the walls of the large room are torches, keeping the shrine lit and warm. In the center of the room is a large statue, presumably of the god Rakshu. He is not like what you expected. His form is not one of a man, but of an animal. He is a gigantic snake, adorned with feathers across his body. Coiled and facing your direction, the gigantic serpent god rears back, revealing an open mouth and lolling forked tongue. The eyes are made of some reflective jewel, perfectly round and smooth. There is a hypnotic quality to them, something that makes you unable to look away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering why you've come, you bow before Rakshu and begin describing your sins to him. You tell him of the thefts you've committed, all the lies, the deceit, the pain you've inflicted on others... the litany pours from you. You've perfected this list in your head throughout your journey here, and despite your nervousness at being presented to this large god, you speak it easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving spoken all you can think of, you stand there, silently. You want to shift nervously, but realize you cannot move! Somehow, you are stuck in place, unable to even tear your gaze from the hypnotic eyes of Rakshu. There's something comforting about his eyes, something that saps your will to even try and resist your immobilization. You await for Rakshu to respond to you.</span></div></div>",

The floor is strewn his lavish pillows in a haphazard manner, perhaps as gifts to Umia. The priestess never did tell you what Umia was the goddess of... sleep? comfort? luxury? It's impossible to tell from the room itself. Looking to the center of the room is a statue of Umia herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is made slightly larger than lifesize, at least if she were a normal woman, perhaps 10 feet (3m) tall. She seems to be made of marble, and is shaped as a beautiful woman. Umia wears a small garment over her shoulders that comes just down to her chest, exposing the underside of her shapely breasts. Her midsection is bare, revealing a slender, curvaceous figure. A many faceted emerald fits snugly in her navel, glittering attractively. A long skirt hangs low on her hips, and covers her legs down to her ankles. Her feet are bare, each with an anklet of feathers or leaves. The statue is painted, her skin a pink-red, her clothing a pure white, her eyes the deepest brown-black. She reminds you of goddesses of love and beauty in other parts of the world. Maybe that's it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her most notable feature is her hair. Her long black locks are tied in many braids, each descending to mid thigh. Some fall down her back, others in the front to either side of her face. There must be... eight of the long braids. As you stare at the incredible statue, you notice the braids are starting to move and writhe! Her hair coming to life, and the statue of Umia itself begins to move in front of you. Umia stretches as if awakening from a long nap, the alluring view presented making you blush. She then sets her eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the newest of my followers.\" She says to you in a voice sweet as honey, its sound music in your ears.

Are you the goddess of foresight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiting cross-legged on a nearby pile of rugs, Umia replies, \"No I am not.

I cannot say exactly what you will do or when they will happen, but you will do great things here.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What you see is both puzzling and frightening. Instead of awakening in Umia's shrine, you find yourself in a sort of mind-world, with blue mist hiding anything farther than three feet. Of course you've heard of such things before, people able to retreat to a reality that only exists in their mind and invite themselves to others'. You've had a run in with a sorceress who could perform such a feat, and the result was very embarrassing. Looking around for Umia, who you assume is the one who brought you here and therefore present as well, you find nothing but the black ground and blue haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are about to undergo a trial mortal.\" Umia's voice booms from every direction at once. \"Well, we call it a trial but it's really more just something we do to initiates who want to join. There is no challenge, no goal except to experience what I want you to. And where we are right now it will be hard for you not to.\" This time her voice has a definite direction. \"My kind and I have been obsessed for the past few millennia with an activity which you humans call 'tickling'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow looms just beyond your vision, and despite your best attempts to peer through the mist the shape is still well-shrouded. \"We use it as an activity to bring happiness to our worshippers and for them to bring happiness to each other. Thus we have also implemented it into many of our rituals as well, so that whenever the worshippers practice brining happiness to each other they are honoring us. We feed off of your laughter mortal. We grow strong with the expression of pure joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, you feel yourself being raised into the air. The mist between you and Umia disperses, leaving you to face the goddess' gaze unprotected. As her marvelous eyes look warmly at you, you become aware of all your clothes melting off of your body and falling endlessly into the blackness below until they are out of sight. Your limbs are spread apart, giving full access for the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so we begin your acceptance trial initiate. Your task: enjoy what is to come. If you cannot, then it would be unwise for you to stay here.\u201d With that her hair begins to animate, each braid wriggling and writhing as if only slowly becoming aware of its new life. Once they are done, they move around like snakes, slithering through the air towards you. If one is too short to go any further, the braid continues anyway as if it were pulling more hair from the goddess' head to replace what was there before. Soon Umia has all eight of her braids extending towards you, nearly upon your helpless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they strike, you quickly go over what Umia just said. There wasn't anything in the rumors that involved tickling, at least not in the rumors surrounding this temple. You've heard stories that their practices seem strange for religious rites, but you have never until now guessed what they might be. The mere thought of being tickled is enough to send you into a bout of shivers, as you have had more experience with it than you would like. There have been numerous times on your voyage here where you found yourself short of money and needed to make strange agreements with the inn owners involving tickling, and even further back your weakness has always been exploited by the other very young pickpockets to bully you around, not to mention that a lot of the time the most popular punishment in an isolated town is tickling by the people in a pair of stoks in the village center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo to see these eight braids approach you with tickling as their intent scares you greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze your eyes shut, dreading each second that the 'trial' may begin. Almost a minute passes, yet nothing happens. Slowly, you open your eyes to see that Umia's braids have stopped in their approach. The goddess herself looks at you with concern in her eyes. \"What is it mortal?\" she asks in her oh so sweet voice, laden with worry. \"I sense anticipation, but whereas in most I feel a sense of giddiness, you emanate fear and distress instead. Why do you find tickling frightening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you explain your history concerning the activity to the goddess with great trepidation and solemnity. After recounting your multiple unpleasant experiences with it, Umia nods comprehensively. \"I see. So because people have used it as a tool against you, the fear of losing something to a thief evolved into a fear of tickling. The remedy is simple: we just need to separate loss and tickling again. Unfortunately, the easiest way to do that would be for you to experience tickling at my hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, without any pretext or warning, Umia's eight long braids jump into action. As you begin to erupt in laughter, you can't help but find pleasure in the silky touches of the goddess' hair, which feel so incredibly soft and luxurious like gentle furs. However, those silky soft touches are exploring every ticklish nook and cranny of your exposed form. Strands of hair slip their way in-between toes, up and down arches, across your ribs and sides, exploring your armpits, and venturing into your navel and the surrounding tender area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair and panic soon ensue, and you feel all your worst fears come to light as your nightmares become reality. Or perhaps, as this is only a mind-world, this is one of your nightmares and you are simply living it. Regardless, all that pent up anxiety is now released, pushing you closer to the realm of Madness than you ever have before. Struggling is impossible entirely, as the will of the goddess prevents even the slightest movement. Wishes of death nearly spring to mind, but before they do a miracle occurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of riding your wave of anxiety all the way to Madness, you feel it drain away into another realm. This realm is foreign to you, and you do not yet know in which of the gods' domain you find yourself. All your fears and phobias, all your distraught emotions instantly dry up upon gushing into the realm. Even though you are unable to identify your location, you feel a familiar presence. It is Umia. Suddenly, a phrase she said runs through your mind: \"<i>Kiss my emerald, and receive the mark of Love.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you begin to understand what has happened, and more importantly where you are. Because your parents passed away when you were a mere child, you have not been to this place for years and years. Here, fear and madness dry up and wither, disappearing in the overwhelming essence of this realm. Instead of the tickling pushing you to Madness, it has brought you to Love; Umia's domain. As this thought rings true in your head, you hear the goddess speak though her lips never move. \"<i>The High Priestess knew to send you to me. It is no coincidence that you have become my follower. You unknowingly desired this forever, as much as you desired forgiveness. So here you are in my realm once again. Welcome back.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis newfound discovery, along with a sudden urge to thank and please the goddess, changes your panic from the tickling to joy. After finding Umia's realm again, you love and cherish every second her hair explores your most sensitive areas. Your laughter, once tinted with dismay, now reverberates about the mind-world with happiness ringing in every note. As the revelation washes over your body, you shudder and, unable to take such amounts of a new feeling, pass out from the pleasure.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon opening your eyes, you find yourself huddled in the goddess' lap, staring at the sparkling emerald nestled in her navel. Slowly, you let your eyes wander up to meet her's, and she smiles radiantly. You find her size and proximity a little intimidating, but you blush as you think of how intimate this instance is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not feel ashamed,\" Umia assures you, the sweetness of her voice a welcome sound. \"It was I, not you, who placed you here. Even though my followers have generously and lavishly decorated my shrine, I still think my lap is more comfortable. Do you not agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlushing more madly than ever, you nod meekly and slowly crawl onto the lush carpets and pillows. The goddess chuckles at your reaction, causing your cheeks to burn even brighter red. Kneeling, you face the goddess and begin to bring your head to the ground in an act of worship and gratitude, but Umia waves her hand disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please do not. Unlike the stuck up gods of the other pantheons, we do not ask for servitude or sacrifice. Frankly I find both practices insulting: humankind owes no more allegiance to us than to the air they breathe or the ground they walk on, and to sacrifice in the name of eternal life is hypocritical at best. Simply by giving others joy in the way I gave you is more than enough to honor me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you goddess,\" you say reverently, bowing your head slightly until she beckons for you to stop that as well. \"You truly are benevolent if that is all you ask for. And you have my eternal gratitude for leading me back to your realm again. If there is anything I can do to please you, I would be honored if you allowed me the privilege of doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Umia chuckles, extending a hand and brushing your cheek. Once more you feel your face flare furiously, but you force yourself to remain still despite your surprise and embarrassment. \"Oh you are so innocent!\" she giggles gleefully. \"It will be refreshing to have someone like you around. Yes, I will not hesitate to talk with you my loyal follower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, there comes three careful taps at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would look as if the time for your trial is finished. I have enjoyed our first meeting initiate, and look forward to when we will meet face to face again. Now you leave this room forever, and join the those who worship Heaven's Pillar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock and curiosity flash through your mind. \"Forever? But how will I see you? <i>When</i> will I see you? I don't want to leave if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft and gentle finger is pushed against your lips, quieting you. \"Hush, my avid worshipper. It gladdens me that you do not wish to leave my side, but you must go meet the others - the worshippers <i>and</i> the gods. Do not worry, we will see each other again. Until we do, I say farewell and good luck to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, Umia returns to the podium on which she was standing when your first entered her shrine. She mounts it, faces the door, and resumes her original position. Just when you think she's frozen again, she winks at you and adds, \"Oh yes, and welcome to the temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that exact moment the door opens and in walks a monk from before. It is the older one, whose knowing eyes regard you intently. \"So, did you receive Umia's mark?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly shift your eyes to the goddess. Not once since before your trial had either of you mentioned the mark. She obviously meant for you to join, but you did not know exactly whether she actually bestowed the mark upon you. \"Uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, the old man approaches you and takes your right hand. Ignoring the puzzled look on your face, he flips your hand over and spreads your fingers. \"Ah, so not only have you been accepted, it seems that you are favored by her as well.\" You have no idea what he means, that is until you follow his gaze and see the emerald embedded in your palm. It spans most of the surface, yet as you run your fingers across it you feel the warm flesh of your digits while the fingers feel only gemstone. It is unnerving to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most only receive a tattoo. To be blessed with one of Umia's emeralds... And you're only an initiate!\" The old man shakes his head in wonder. \"In all my years, never has one so young received any deity's favored mark. Anyway young man...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you fidget with your new gemstone, the old monk leads you from the shrine and towards the chamber where the High Prietess met you yesterday. Outside, the dawn filters through the thick trees and leaves, shining slits of light on the forest floor. Through the south-facing windows you see spots of color in the thick jungle that engulfs the temple. The dense vegetation has made the temple hard to find, meaning that many a traveler has walked right by it without noticing, as even Heaven's Pillar is difficult to see through the canopies. Such was the rampant growth of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive in the chamber to find the High Priestess by the pool again, kneeling in the exact same position she was when you first saw her. Near the western entrance are two slivers of light cast by the rising sun, with the shadow of Heaven's Pillar cast right in-between them. From the southern entrance, the giant statue sits to your right at the top of a small yet very wide flight of stairs, resting on it's own sort of podium. The circular pool at which the High Priestess is kneeling seems to shine with reflected light in front of the depiction of the enormous goddess, whose emerald eyes seem to sparkle as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, reflect, sparkle? There are braziers on either side of the chamber - big ones too - but they aren't lit. The only light is coming from the specks cast by the sun, and there isn't enough for the gemstones or the water to be shining nearly as much as they are. Looking at your emerald you see it too is faintly illuminated. Perhaps there is some source of energy, godly or otherwise, that is keeping these things alight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are favored by Lady Umia. Such a curious man, to receive her emerald upon initiation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your contemplation, it appears that the monk has ascended the steps and talked with the High Priestess, who is now standing and facing you. Unsure of how to respond, you stammer and start for a second before collecting your wits enough to give a proper response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know much about that,\" you confess rather uselessly. \"Er, this gemstone is a bit awkward. Will it stay in my palm forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that emerald will be with you for life,\" informs the High Priestess. \"It may feel uncomfortable at first, but you will get used to it. Besides, the powers it provides will undoubtedly outweigh the annoyance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to the monk at that point and nods. Apparently it's a practiced routine, for the monk promptly bows and leaves the room. Once he's gone, you hear the priestess sigh as she sits on the steps, seemingly exhausted. \"You truly are fascinating. Converts are very rare, and on top of that you were blessed on your initiation. It is almost as if the gods themselves called you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, puzzled over something the High Priestess said. \"If it is rare to find a convert, than where do the worshippers come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs. \"Most are born here. To be honest, I was surprised when Old Paul and Kurosa said you wanted to convert. So where did you come from and why did you come here?\" Crossing her legs, she leans forward intently as if she were a child being told a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was born in Eisbrecher, far to the northwest, but I didn't stay for very long. I had just turned five when my parents died to a disease that was common among the poor in those mountains. A traveling fur merchant named Gustaf took pity on me and let me travel with him.\" You close your eyes, remembering what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was during one of his journeys around Coninze that I began thieving. Just small-time stuff in remote villages in the northern countryside, but I kept it up. I was nine when Gustaf found out where the extra coins were coming from. He told me that I would have to stop or he'd get in trouble, but I didn't listen. Two days later I was caught stealing a family heirloom from the village chief. Gustaf took the blame and was locked up because of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories come rushing back, all the harsh lessons you never learned. Umia may not have wanted to hear it, but it seems that you are reciting the sins you forced yourself to relive on your way here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should've given me pause but I couldn't stop myself. After stealing in the Coninze countryside for several years I made my way to New Forazio, where I became more bold and foolish. It was sometime later that I came to my senses, remembering Gustaf and what he offered me. He let me escape a life of poverty, and in return I sent him to prison. Not once did he get angry with me, and I finally understood how hard it was for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe High Priestess, who until now had been running her fingers through her incredibly long hair, leans back and cocks her head to one side. \"But why did you decide to come all the way out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"I gathered a lot of rumors about the various faiths that would forgive me. Yours sounded the least painful, and besides you have the giant tower of rock to prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, the High Priestess smiles at you. \"Thank you for telling me. I didn't expect you to really, but it's nice to have an honest and trusting person around. I formally welcome you to the Worshippers of Heaven's Pillar, follower of Umia. Now...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon being called by the High Priestess, the old monk who led you here, who you assume is Paul, returned and kneeled before her. \"Take our newest worshipper to the chambers where Umia's followers rest.\" The High Priestess turns back to regard you, green eyes sparkling. \"Thank you for talking. Whilst you may not have felt anything change, your initiation is now complete.\" With this, she returns to kneeling by the pool, arms held out in silent prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Paul beckons, and you follow him quietly out the door. In fact, it appears you are heading back in the same direction of Umia's shrine. As if reading your thoughts, Paul explains. \"Only converts and Senior Priests set foot inside th shrine, this is true, but the Followers of Umia take up residence in chambers around the shrine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat makes sense. This is confirmed when you recognize the doors to the shrine up ahead but instead take a left away from it. Now small chambers line the corridor, each one only about a dozen square meters. Inside each of them is a shelf, a bedside table, and a rug with a glorious emerald woven in it. You assume that this indicates to whom these rooms are allocated. Thinking back to your initiation, you puzzle a bit on what the High Priestess said. Even though nothing felt different, you were initiated. \"Paul,\" you begin, \"what did the High Priestess do to initiate me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man chuckles. \"It is not for me to tell you. All converts ask that, but that's only because they do not understand our ways. Here, we believe that a person is defined by their memories. The human body is only a tool that we use to experience the world and add to it. We create, we experience, we discover. Yet everything we do is a part of our memories, ourselves. I can say no more, lest I give away comepletely the point of your private chat with the High Priestess.\" And so, left with more questions than answers, you follow Paul through the halls a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops outside one of the chambers and faces you. \"This will be your room,\" he explains. \"What you put in it and what you do inside is entirely up to you. Keep in mind that beause of the nature of this temple, there is nothing to bar entry or exit nor is there anything you can hide your room with. This is to uphold one of our beliefs: what we experience, we let others experience freely. You cannot keep anything to yourself besides your memories - everything else we share amongst the rest of our family.\" So the price of peace was privacy. Not a horrible deal, but a good amount less than you were hoping for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop Paul before he can leave. \"Wait, what am I supposed to do? Are there any rituals that I must attend to? Any responsibilities, any chores?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling warmly, the elderly man looks into your eyes with his piercing blue ones. How young those eyes look, you think. \"You have aresponsibility to share what you an with the rest of the Followers of Umia, if not all the worshippers. You have the responsibility to make sure that you work honestly for the good of the Worshippers as a whole. You have the responsibility to bring joy to others as Lady Umia has brought joy to you. You have the responsibility to experience that joy, for you and for the rest of us. How you go about that is yours to decide.\" Old Paul bows slightly. \"Until next time, initiate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone, you wonder a little about what exactly the old man meant. More than a little of your wondering was whether the old man liked speaking indirectly. What it sounded like was that as long as you shared other people's joy and burdens, you wouldn't have to worry. Of course, the circles that Old Paul talked in didn't make much sense.</span></div></div>",

They're the only thing you've worn since setting out to find this isolated temple, so whilst you dislike the thought of wearing them again you feel strangely attached to the near-rags that you've traveled in for weeks. You can't say you dislike your new robes however; they're made of something that's as smooth and light as silk, a nice feature to have outside when the sun is high and its heat strikes you full force. Like everyone else's you've seen so far, the sleeveless vestments are yellow with a red sash draped from your right shoulder to your left hip. Some richer people you've known (or stolen from rather) would've paid a lot of money for something as exotic as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching the floor and mat, you find no alternate footwear to go along with your new clothes. Actually, you don't recall anyone else wearing shoes or sandals either, and wonder whether enyone does. Of course you have no complaints as you slip off the worn boots that carried you the entire way here, flexing your feet as if freed from a prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of your new room with your new look into your new life, you feel... new. This entire temple is your home now, the worshippers your family. Speaking of which, you should probably explore your home and talk to your family. Outside the temple looked enormous, inside it looks complicated to navigate. You'll likely have to ask your way back here for a while before you finally familiarize yourself with the place. You return to the main hallway that leads to Umia's shrine and look at the large double doors. Despite yourself, you're quite tempted to open the doors to take just a peak at your new Goddess, but you refrain from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you take a random hallway leading deeper into the complex. You try to remember which turns you make, but after a while just give up. It's much more fun to get lost - that way you need to talk to people to find your way back.

Since you're new here you have no idea who it might be or what it holds power over, but the carving depicts a strange being: a mass of branches and roots, with two root tree trunks as his legs. Leaves decorate his form, and on either side of his body the branches intertwine to make long arms. He might be the god of nature, but the eye throws you off a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a quick look at the ritual reinforces the idea of nature. The ritual itself was what you expected it to be, tickling, but the device restraining the worshipper was very intricately made. Supported by a metal base shaped like a tree trunk, the rest of the restraint grows out of it in the shape of metallic tree branches and sticks. It's so beautifully done that it'd be in a museum were it in any big city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this detailed restraint sits a nearly nude woman, the furniture forcing her limbs to point at the four corners of the room while arching her back to open up as much of her torso as possible. Two other worshippers were tickling her breathless, a man on her right and another woman on her left. Using only their fingers they searched relentlessly for new ways to torture their victim, kneading her hips or digging into her armpits. A little embarrassed, you sort of hang back in the shadow of the entrance, away from the light cast by the braziers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a blue flash shines from the engraved deity's eye, and the worshippers stop torturing the restrained woman. To your amazement, the metal structure begins to move! The branches withdraw and shift until the woman inside is sitting why looks to be simply a fancy chair. The other woman's hands her her robes, and the former victim gets dressed. All three bow before the altar, then file out one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the woman tickler was about to leave she stopped. Turning her head slowly towards you, she sees you standing there in the passageway a little confused. Smiling widely, she walks over and takes you hand. \"Welcome newcomer,\" she said, \"to an altar of Rawst, god of growth. He watches us with his single eye, seeing us grow, observing our maturation. Nothing else please him as much as seeing his followers grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow how?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's smile turned absolutely radiant. \"In any way at all. He loves watching the worshippers grow physically, mentally, emotionally. He's even satisfied if our love for tickling grows. And just because you are not his follower does not mean you cannot be blessed by him. Come, I will perform the ritual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know exactly what's going on, the woman grabs you and pulls you over to the chair. \"Wait!\" you yell. \"You mean I'm going to be tickled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways smiling, the priestess nods. \"That is the ritual of every god and goddess.Sometimes the manner is different, but it is always the release of laughter. Now please undress - it would make this much easier and more comfortable.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the entire history of Zenith, few people are able to brave the unknown. Those that do are known forever, like the man who first wove necromancy out of death and pure darkness or the woman who established the borders of a small yet prospering mining and crafting country nestled in a northern valley. However, one such explorer has achieved a near-impossible feat, and yet she has never been talked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to set up a town underground. Not only that, she has managed to find a sustaining way of life deep under the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe herculean feat was downplayed though, and over time the surface dwellers have forgotten about the pioneers below the ground. Despite the lack of support from higher up, the town managed to dig more tunnels and find more caverns, flourishing into a small country. The underground world became that of prosperity, though very different from that of the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe generations born under the ground were extremely pale due to lack of light, and the young were weaker because the protein was in the things they <i>didn't</i> want to eat. They were also extremely sensitive because they never experienced wind or battle, though as they grew older and used stone more often they became callouses and tough. Stand a surface dweller next to someone from the underground, it would be hard to recognize them as the same species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, even when the underground was all but forgotten by the surface dwellers, stories of the surface in the underground grew and grew. Tales of a giant fire in an open sky, a place where the ground is green, and buildings are made from wood instead of stone. So many unbelievable tales, but no one underground has ever seen this so-called sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide you will be the first. Having grown up in the small town of Ruken, the first town set up beneath the surface, the rumors of open space and green ground were always around you. It is a place of discovery and creativity, with no boundaries and people who were tall and strong. You've carried these dreams since childhood, and now that you're old enough to set out on your own, you plan to find the surface and reconnect the two peoples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving set aside some provisions for the journey, you step back to take stock. Enough food and water to last a week, some torches and matches, digging tools should you get trapped, and a short dirk should the need to defend yourself arise. You are going alone on this quest, so no need to worry about anyone else's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all set?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, you see your uncle enter the carved out room of stone. A grizzled man, he claims to have traveled the entire underground alone. Judging from his numerous scars, he may well have. True or not, the man knew how to survive in the tunnels of the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does me proud to see the child of my brother set out on such a daring exploit,\" he says. \"I once sought the surface, but could not for the life of me find the exit. I always ended up circling myself, and it's a miracle I made back. I wish someone were going with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at the old man. \"Who would? As you have said, only the brave or the foolhardy seek the surface, and there is a shortage of both in Ruken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too true,\" he chuckles. Fumbling inside the satchel he carries by his side, your uncle hands you a large roll of parchment and a quill pen. \"Do not forget to map your journey as you go. It will be essential to your return should you run out of supplies or decide to give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will never give up,\" you tell your uncle. Nonetheless, you take the parchment and pen from him and intend to use it often. You collect all your supplies and slide it into your knapsack, slipping the dirk into a loop on your belt. Turning, you embrace your uncle for what you feel is the last time. \"Thank you uncle. I hope I'll see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so too, young one.\" Is that a tear in his eye? No. Never. The man who traveled the entire underground, crying? Perish the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a huge amount of will, but you step out of the dwelling that has been your home for all your life and out onto the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight is familiar, a tunnel with homes carved out on either side. Not very fancy - especially when compared to some of the huge cities - but it's place you know best, and the rows of caves give you a heartwarming feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome turns, a brisk walk, and ten minutes sees you at the edge of town, where the grey rock tunnels become black dirt. From here there is only one place to go, and that's to the surface. However, it is like a labyrinth in there, so it's not as simple as 'go up here'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where are <i>you</i> going?\" says a familiar voice. Smiling, you turn to see your childhood friend...</span></div></div>",

All the trouble of finding a captain willing to take you all the way here (no small feat in itself, considering the bad reputation of this place) finally seems worth while. You had to sell family house and basically all of your possessions to be able to pay for this little expedition, but you have no regrets. You are a free spirit, who never enjoyed being tied up to one country, let alone to one city, so you are looking forward to the new life of adventure and exploration, with nothing to tie you back to your previous life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping anchor several hundred meters off shore, you and a landing party load your cargo onto a small boat and complete final stage of the journey. Standing knee high in the water after jumping off the boat, you see relatively narrow stretch of beautiful sandy beaches both to the left and right and beyond them, to the left a forest for as long as eye can see and to the right forest gradually turning into a low grassland for many miles. Wonderful position to get some rest and enjoy a seaside vacation for a few days, before you go on exploring, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter unloading your equipment and supplies and helping you to set up a base camp at the edge of the forest, captain and his crew bid you farewell and head back to the ship. Their plan is to travel back as soon as possible, leaving you all alone, but you don't mind that one bit. A little solitude sounds prefect to you right now. After all, though a girl, you are one of the best sword fighters of your (now ex) homeland. You have been in many dangerous situations before and managed to get out of each and every one of them unscathed. You are more then capable of taking care of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you change your clothes and boots from those suitable to the sea voyage to more land-friendly ones, you see ship already turned around and slowly getting away towards the horizon.

After you take about 20 steps into the forest, you realize trees are high and though they are not too dense, amount of light reaching you is still limited. More importantly, though unbeknownst to you at this time, a pair of eyes is carefully watching your every step and studying your every move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start off going parallel to the shore one way and then back and keeping close to your camp, but very soon you can't see the beach any more. Every now and then you you kneel down to inspect some berries or mushrooms, in order to discover alternative food sources. You can catch fish, as long as you are near the sea, but you prefer more diverse diet, if you can help it, especially since you prefer to keep your food supplies carried from the ship in-tacked for as long as possible, because they may prove much more valuable once you journey further away from the the shore. At one such time you feel something sharp and hard inside your boot get stuck into the sole of your foot. You sit down and take off your boot, you turn it upside down and a small rock falls out of it. You remove your sock too, to reveal soft-looking, wrinkly sole and your pretty burgundy red painted toes. You rarely used to wear any foot-wear that displayed your feet, but you enjoy painting your toenails to match your hair color. You made sure to bring with you ample supply of your favorite toenail polish into this adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little further away from you inside some bushes, that pair of eyes was still staring at you very hard. The moment you removed your boot, a hunger grew in those eyes and the moment your bare sole appeared outside your sock, a tongue came out of the mouth beneath those eyes and lustfully licked the lips out of which it came. While you were sitting unsuspectingly and massaging your sole to make the pain go away, a decision was made and a plan was hatched in the brain behind those eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter few minutes you replaced your sock and your boot and decided you ventured deep enough and should be getting back before you lost your way in the maze of trees.

She doesn't wear any armor, but her clothes outline strong muscular body. Confrontation would probably not end well for you, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that one sentence and one step she stopps again, studying you with those mean eyes. Her gaze tells you that she does not mean you well, at least not by your definition of well. She has already decided that you are not a bigger threat then she can handle, otherwise she would not have came out from her cover, and now she is just trying to make sure before she comes at you. Also, though you can't be precisely sure of it, it looks to you that, from time to time, her eyes drop down to your feet for a split second and then go back to your face. You don't even want to begin to think about what her intentions are. Orcs have a bad reputation in your homeland, even though they are not native to it or to any of the neighboring kingdoms. They are not all evil, but they are clever and many of them can be greedy or cruel. Some of them are known to be killers, looters and pillagers, but such tribes lived far to the east of your home and you never heard of any o them coming close to your kingdom. Others are notorious assassins, thieves and burglars trained in special guilds, but those too are known to you through stories only. Finally in some countries they even live alongside humans in towns and cities, but they are not much liked even there. Your realize that your knowledge of their specie is unfortunately lacking and you can not use it to deduce anything about your rival. Could it be that your mother did not know about them much more then you do, and that swine-people she described to you, were actually orcs, whom she have never seen before and thus couldn't recognize when she saw them here? It doesn't look too unlikely at all, from where you're standing right now. You would probably not realize that the creature in front of you is an orc, had it not told you so itself. The thought of being all alone on the continent full of orcs did not appeal to you one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you are pulled away from your thoughts, as the orc starts again towards you. She doesn't seem to be running anywhere close to full speed, still you don't have time to study here moves and try to guess her motivations. The moment you caught full glance of her appearance and equipment, you decided that you probably can not win a fight, at least not without major injury, so you decided that flight is a better option. It's true that orc knows the surroundings better then you and that you probably can not hope to outwit her in the forest, but if you can only manage to get back to your camp, you'll find your sword there and that should boost your odds in the inevitable fight.</span></div></div>",

You try to concentrate and detect what's going on, but you can't hear or feel anything. After a minute you decide to try to think of some kind of escape plan. Even though your mind is working at full speed, you are drawing a complete blank. You have never been in a predicament remotely similar to this, being strong self-reliant young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are lost in your thoughts you seem to feel a barely detectable prick at the side of your right foot. You try to concentrate on your feet, but still being a little dazed from the initial fall, you can't seem to feel anything. You decide that it was probably nothing and that your senses are probably playing a trick on you in your groggy state. As you try to go back to thinking about escape, again an odd feeling comes from your right foot. This time it seems that the sole of your sock has been stretched away from the sole of your foot, and then as you hear ripping sound, the terrible realization hits you. The earlier prick on the side of your foot was actually a knife cutting away the sole of your boot, and now with the sock ripped open, the bottom of your foot is completely exposed and facing up towards the orc. Before you have time to ask yourself why, you hear the orc's euphoric voice:<br>\r\n\"Well look what we have here! It seems I hit a major jackpot today.\" As you hear her talk you feel the weight on your ankles shift towards your feet a little bit, as if she was leaning towards them to inspect her handy work. \"I think I'm gonna have lots of fun with you girlie. Look at all those beautiful wrinkles\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hear her utter those words, you realize that you are reflexively scrunching your toes, making your already wrinkly sole even more wrinkly in the process. You relax your foot, but only for a second, as you feel a poke of a sharp nail in the middle of your arch. Giggle escapes you and you hear your captors satisfied giggle as well. Getting you here so she could tickle your feet, would seem as far fetched motivation as any, just half an hour ago, but at this moment, you have no doubt of it. Those glances at your feet, back in the forest, make sense now. She was teasing herself, knowing what she was after, even then. Also taking off your boot and sock in the middle of the forest, now looks like a much less smart thing to do, knowing that those hungry eyes were gazing at you all the time and were even more stimulated to come after you, after such an inviting display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are brought back from your thoughts as you feel a finger, starting at your heel, going over the arch and up resting on the ball of your foot. You fight hard to suppress further giggles, but your tormentor seems annoyed by your resistance and wriggles all five fingers of one hand all over your sole, getting you to laugh hysterically in the matter of seconds. Satisfied with the result, she pulls her hand away, but before you have time to thank the sky for that mercy, you feel something wet and hot traversing the same path as fingers, just a few moments ago. Starting at the heel, paying special attention to the arch, continuing over the ball of the foot and ending at the toe-pads. \"Who would have thought that a sole can taste so good, after a long run. I'll have to keep that in mind' she announces as she goes for another lick, electing new stream of giggles out of you. \"I love big wrinkly ticklish soles, and your sexy meaty tootsies are gonna keep me happy for a long long time\", she announces as she goes for another lick.</span></div></div>",

She throws you over her shoulder and starts walking. Soon you can hear the door slammed shut and you realize you're inside the hut. She takes another step and then you hit the floor. You feel the orc grab your damaged boot and brace yourself, but the tickling doesn't come, although she is definitely doing something to your boot. After a minute or so, your blindfold is removed. You survey your surroundings, but there's not much to see: no furniture of any kind except for one chair and a blanket in the corner.. Also in the middle of the room, on the floor, there is a heavy looking wooden hatch, leading under ground, obviously. All over the walls are grim trophies, pairs female shoes, saome completely solelles, others with soles still attached to them by the heel, like your boot. Also there are many ripped socks and stockings. Some are open at the toes, while others, much like your own sock, are just ripped along the sole. Suddenly your ankles are freed of their restraints and your hands are soon to follow. Quickly you jump up and turn around to face your tormentor, but she just stands still in the door frame smiling at you. Your boot has been taped around your foot using some kind of strong tape, so that the sole is holding in place, for now, even though a strong shake of your foot, reveals your toes under the flapping boot-sole. It was obviously fixed just enough to serve her current intentions, but can be easily re-opened at any time. You decide not to even think about that, as you wiggle your still dump toes inside your boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she speaks: \"How do you like my collection\", she asks, waving her hand at the walls. \"I've had many, guests\", she utters that last word with an evil smile on her lips. \"Most, I had to go a long way away, to invite and few of them came to my doorstep, as you did. Some of them have some big and delicious tootsies, but it's been a long time, since I had a pair, quite like yours. I must admit. I'm looking forward to having my way with yours. But since I'm a good sport, I'll give you one chance to escape\", she says. \"If you can make it through this door, I'll give you one hour before I come after you, but if you can't...\", she looks down at your boots and slowly licks her lips. Mere sight of that tongue, makes you shiver. She is certain that you can't defeat her, or evade her for too long, even if you manage to, somehow, get passed her. Based on your experience so far, she is probably right, you decide. You need to come up with a plan and you need it soon. \"Come on now, you can't stand there forever, come and get some more coochie choochie coos\", she starts teasingly wriggling her long fingers. Those fingers end in nails, perfect for extracting laughter from ticklish women, you think to yourself. Several feet left of the door, there is an open window, the only one on the hut. You have two options, either go at her and pray for the best, or try to jump out the window and make a run for it. As you are thinking about each option, she starts moving very slowly towards you.</span></div></div>",

More alarming though is, the fact that your soles (both bare and booted one) are upturned and that she is facing them. Struggle as you might, you can't get up, she is too strong and heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel, what you've been dreading all the time, she grabs the ankle of your soleless boot and pulls it towards her. Her grip is strong, you can't pull your foot free. As you brace yourself for the inevitable, you feel a soft breeze on your toes, as she blows on them. Even that feels tickly and you wiggle your toes in anticipation. You hear her amused giggle and curse yourself for being so weak. It's just tickling you try to tell yourself, but it doesn't help much, panic is setting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually I have to search far and wide, to get myself a prize like you. Your heel is just begging to be touched, those wiggling toes are made to draw attention and tease, especially with that sexy toenail color, but the wrinkly sole just make my mouth water. I'm gonna enjoy our time together, so very much.\" Obviously she has a huge fetish and nothing you can say can make her leave your feet alone. Still you are trying hard to find some way to reason with her. Promise her wealth, promise her glory, promise to find other women to take your place. That las one might actually work, but before you can develop that idea, she speaks again: \"you fought well, even if not too long\", she says, \"you are a good warrior. My victory over you is a glorious one. All great victories deserve great feasts. Fortunately these huge delicious soles of yours, are going to provide a feast to remember\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words she grips your bare soled foot even more tightly and pulls is slightly more towards herself then stops. Though nothing is happening, you can't stand the anticipation any more, all thoughts and plans vanish from your mind, as the memory of your recent foot treatment returns to you. You start giggling preemptively and once more desperately try to pull your exposed foot free. Then, obviously waiting for your nerves to betray you, she begins, as you feel hot wet tongue land on your heel, covering it almost whole, and start its agonizingly slow ascent up your bare sole. As it travels toward your arch, the skin of your sole becomes taught behind the tongue, while the wrinkles are pushed and bunch up in front of it, until the tongue reaches the ball of your sole and wrinkles are passed over and released to return and spread out all over the arch and sole  Mean while the tongue licks hard at your toes, then the process is repeated again, slowly, thoroughly, lovingly. Fortunately for you, you're not able to see entranced look in her eyes and concentration on your arch, or you'd know she's not stopping any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever her tongue reaches your arch, your laughter goes up a notch, only to go back down as she gets to the toes. She seems to like this and starts concentrating on that area more, mixing in quick licks with the tip of her tongue, between slow long ones. This keeps you unable to even slightly adjust to the feelings invading the bottom of your foot and makes your laugh even harder. Soon you are becoming exhausted from all the laughter and what's left of your sanity is welcoming the possibility of passing out with the lack of oxygen. She, however, seems to sense this and changes tactics. Now she is sticking her tongue between the helpless toes and stimulating sensitive nerve endings, or licking and kissing the heel with occasional lick of the center of your sole, just to keep you laughing hard, when your laughter begins to die down a bit. She seems to be in the mood for a long day of foot fun</span></div></div>",

Finally you manage to pull yourself out of the sand and take a look at your situation, your half naked on an isle which is said to steal the souls of people and you have no idea what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn around you see a dense forest that may have shelter, but also many unknown dangers, or brave the beach.</span></div></div>",

Every inch of your soles and toes is tickled with wild abandoned. You squeal and renew your efforts to escape the sand but you only sink deeper.

You push against the sand with your hands to escape but your hands just go straight into the sand and are captured as well. You had no idea the palms of your hands were so ticklish.

Not that they were much to begin with, but after running from those bandits, and getting caught\u2026 well, the old things were bound to fall apart sooner or later. You look down at the chains at your ankles. You could escape into the night, but unless you get these chains off, you'll be easy enough to track down. As it is, you can't do more take more than a half-step in them, and they clink around enough to make you a belled cat. But there is one way to get them off\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the overly large wagon, and the prize tightly tied down inside: the tickle dragon. A short coat of soft gray feathers covers its form as it lies curled up inside the wagon. It can barely fit in there, its long tail curled back against its body. You can see the fluffy tip, like a lion's tail\u2026 although that feathery appendage can do much more than anything a lion could do. A long forked tongue slips in and out of its mouth quickly, tasting the air. As you watch the darting, wet tongue you notice the tickle dragon's saliva, famous for being able to sensitize even the toughest of skin. Being licked by a tickle dragon is supposed to make one's skin as smooth and luxurious as a newborn babe's\u2026 and twice as sensitive, you think with a shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon is no more than twenty feet long, not including the tail, making it a relatively young specimen. If the rumors are true, that means the dragon will have much more energy, not bound to a lair like its full grown brethren. You can't tell if its male or female, but then again the distinction doesn't seem to matter. It's eyes are shut as if asleep, but you notice its catlike ears twitch. Tickle dragons are supposed to be intelligent, and you realize the thing is perfectly awake and attentive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026\" you whisper loudly, sneaking closer to the dragon. \"I need to get out of here. Once those bandits realize I'm not of noble birth\u2026 well, I'm sure you can imagine.\" You pause before continuing, the dragon showing no signs of hearing you, its ears still idly twitching. \"I can get those straps off you. I heard them talking earlier. They're going to sell you to some noblewoman down south. You'll be her prized pet, a jewel in her crown to brag about. Just thrown a ticklish prisoner every once and a while. You wouldn't want that, right? But if I let you out, and you break my chains, we can both get free\u2026 do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for what seems like an eternity, but must be no more than a minute. The dragon snorts dismissively, still not opening its eyes, making you crestfallen. \"Please\u2026 I'll do anything! I need your help!\" At this, the tickle dragon finally opens one eye, looking at you passively from the golden cat-like orb. It opens its mouth to speak...</span></div></div>",

I thought dragons were free spirits. Did I get the one dragon in Zenith that wants to be a pet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon snorts again with what you can only assume is disdain and a puff of smoke or steam, you can\u2019t tell- you don\u2019t remember if tickle dragons were fire breathers, billows from its nostrils and evaporates into the moonlit night. \u201cYou know nothing young human.

They slew my sire and my dam. They took my brother.\u201d Its eyes darken and narrow. It occurs to you that this dragon must be younger than you thought. Or maybe tickle dragons spend longer as nestlings.

But you won\u2019t. Not here. Not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Took my brother\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint, stupid, crazy and unworkable notion works its way into your head. \u201cYour brother? What was his name? Is he still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the dragon looks uncertain. Then, deciding that it wouldn\u2019t hurt to share the information says, \u201cFenrir is alive. Of that much I\u2019m sure. But the world is vast. And we are small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to the free spirit of the dragon the bards always sing about?\u201d You ask. \u201cYou help me? I can make you a deal. Help me escape.

No matter how far we have to go or how long it takes for us to get to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, the dragon examines you suspiciously. \u201cAnd what do you get out of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk as if the answer were obvious. \u201cMe? I never have to know what these flesh-mongers were going to do to me.\u201d For a moment the dragon seems unsure- maybe it doesn\u2019t believe you, afraid that once it cuts you lose you\u2019ll bolt. \u201cYou scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours.\u201d Once more the dragon snorts and once more a cloud rises from its nostrils. \u201cDo we have a deal?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The dragon isn't far from you but the distance between the two of you seems impossibly wide with your rattling chains. If only it had been rope...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no-one around that you can see but you can hear the bandits well enough. Beyond the line of sharpened poles is the rest of the camp. By the sound of it they struck rich today. Shouting, clashing blades, smashing glasses and singing- all the usual sounds of a party. But just below that you can hear low voices discussing something in private. Not all of them are so distracted. Which means you need to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the chain that binds your feet and realize that's so much easier said than done. For a second you think about clawing your way over with just your hands before thinking you could do without scraping the skin of your back off on the rough ground. Maybe if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading your legs wide, you take up the slack in both hands. You take a step that's almost silent then, carefully make your way over to the wagon.

TROLL SPIT! That hurt. Gingerly, you feel around this time before you lower your foot and do your best to keep your weight on the uninjured one. Carefully, one step at a time you make your way over, grimacing every time your left foot goes down. But then you're at the wagon and the dragon trussed up on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to help me first.\u201d You say. Can you cut through this with your claw?\u201d It\u2019s awkward for the both of you but after a few minutes of shuffling, curses and suppressed chain clanks you manage to position yourself on the ramp attached to the front of the wagon so that its front claws can slice through the chains on either side. The shackles remain in place but you can worry about those later. For now you can move around without the tell-tale rattling and restricted movement and that\u2019s all you need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now for the dragon. You examine the restraints attached to the wagon in the pale moonlight. The straps that hold it down are thick and the tension keeps them tight but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" You grin just loud enough for the dragon to hear as you manage to release the first strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s working?\" The dragon asks, a hopeful undertone in its voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s working.\" You utter back. \u201cI\u2019ll have you out in no time.\u201d Well- maybe not no time. They\u2019re faster to release than say untying knots. And some of them are old and worn, making them easier to release. But even so there are enough of them to make up for their quality. You've managed a few so far but there must be at least fifty more up and down the dragon's length. This could take a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the gate to your section of the camp opens your heart stops as you realize it's time you don't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand frozen still as wide eyes stare at you. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've never known much about the places outside of your little corner of the world. Her eyes and hair are dark, both almost black, in a way that doesn't match the looks of any local. But her skin is as pale as yours, perhaps even more so, and a fair amount of it is visible from the meager clothing the bandits have given their wench. Then you notice the tattoo: just below the woman's exposed navel is a small rune that anyone in any land understands. \"Slave.\" This girl was bought from a slave trader, either from the bandits themselves, or from someone they plundered. In either case, the woman is no more than property to them. Even if she were to escape, she'd have to hide the mark from everyone. An escaped slave has little rights in any land, and the authorities didn't take kindly to their emancipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" the serving girl asks again. \"You can't let it out! Don't you what that is?\" Her voice is low and quiet, with a faint accent of somewhere exotic that again betrays her foreign origins. But whoever she is and wherever she's from, you're glad she's at least not shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\" You tell her, trying to calm her down and reassure her. \"It won't hurt anyone, it's just a tickle dragon\u2026\" you can hear the dragon bristling at being called 'just' a tickle dragon, but he doesn't press the issue, seeming to understand the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026 if it gets out\u2026 they'll be angry!\" The girl retorts. \"We'll all be blamed! You have to stop!\" Her voice is starting to raise in volume, signs of alarm growing in her voice. You needed to get her on your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we\u2019re not so different. We're both their captives, right? Why don't you come with me?\" You ask, and the woman looks at you curiously. \"Help me get the tickle dragon free, and its promised to help me get away. You could come too! It's got to be better than being a slave for these bandits, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl pauses, thinking about the possibility. You didn't exactly give the tickle dragon any say in this, but if it gets you both out of here, it can't object, right? Two women can undo the ties twice as fast as one.

Not theirs and not yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, as a grin of relief sweeps across your face. \"I never assumed you would be.\" You reply. \"Now hurry- I don't think the next person through the gate will want to escape with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they do,\" The dragon rumbles quietly, \"I might not be able to take off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nods and quickly closes the gate behind her as silently as possible. You focus on the next strap as the footfall of her sandals get closer, trying to force the buckle prong clear of the hole in the strap and having to fight against the dragon's mass to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breathe out.\" You hiss to the dragon. He exhales deeply as suddenly your job becomes that little bit easier. The strap comes loose and you waste no time in moving to the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two of you now working to free the dragon your progress is much faster. Alone you might still have been here when the sun came up. Even so it's not an instant process and the closer you get to freeing the dragon the more you find yourself shooting glances at the gate, half-expecting it to swing open at any second. Your fingers fumble with the second to last and your end, holding down the dragon's head and as just as you finally undo it you hear a voice that makes your blood run cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she?\" A bandit bellows from the other side of the wall. You know who she's talking about in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bleeding serving wench you maggot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last I saw her-\" Your fingers instantly attack the last buckle with desperate fervor knowing you're out of time. \"-She went to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where she went, I sent her! But that was quarter of an hour ago! Where is she now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart pounds in your chest, slamming so hard against your ribs you're sure it's giving you away. Sweaty fingers wrestle and frantically attack the strap, fighting to undo the buckle. This one's so much tighter than the others- probably because it's over the dragon's skull, not the neck- and it refuses... to... give...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon winces slightly as you keep pressuring it's head but you ignore it because there'll be time to apologize later once you're away and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the gods decide you've had enough good fortune for one day. As you move to the final strap over the dragon's snout the gates creak open. Slowly at first as one person comes through. And then they see what you're doing. They fly open with a speed that should be impossible as the screaming bandit bears down on you, screaming for help. Before you can even touch the final strap, she slams into you knocking to the ground hard and drawing a wooden short-bow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You treacherous little harlot!\" She sneers as you look up to see an arrow aimed down at your chest. Her eyes regard you coldly as if she's considering letting the arrow fly now and be done with you. \"Did you honestly think you'd get away with my dragon, girl?\" She asks coldly. Behind her, the gateway fills with bandits who heard or saw the commotion. Each one brandishes a vicious looking weapon, a tankard, or a musical instrument which, in any other circumstance you could have laughed at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And dear little Ilya.\" The bandit sighs as she notices the serving-girl. She'd been desperately trying to keep working unnoticed and by how far done she managed to get she was as close to finishing as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we'd made progress- I really did. But it looks like I need to take you back to my tent for 'correction'. Isn't that right boys?\" Behind her the bandits break into harsh laughter- they all know what that means. You can only guess but the way Ilya stares like a rabbit caught in lights it can't be good. Her eyes flick to make contact with your own for a second and she makes a pleading look as if she hopes you can help her. But if that's the case, her hope is horribly misplaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as for you- guess what?\" A smile creeps into existence on her thin lips and she keeps the bow aimed at you. \"My scouts got back today. No noble family in the land is missing a daughter. Imagine that? No long lost blood relatives. No orphaned heiresses. Which I suppose means you lied to us. And I don't like liars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was probably more. It was the perfect situation for a monologue- nobody coming to help, no time pressure and nothing to stop her. Except- well the fact that the dragon realized all that held it from freedom now was a single leather strap. The sound of it snapping barely has time to register before its head snaps to the side and its teeth clamp shut around the bandit's waist. The arrow flys and buries itself into the ground a foot from your arm as she drops her bow. She screams as the dragon throws her back towards her gang and roars with a thunderous snarl that echoes through the night. As impressive as the display is, the effort of throwing the woman clearly took its toll and you hope that bandits don't pick up on that as you roll over to grab the arrow then scramble to your feet, snatching up the bow and nocking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on my back.\" The dragon growls. Not like you need any words of encouragement. You leap onto the wagon as the dragon pulls it's tail clear of the last straps and pull yourself onto it's back behind the shoulders. Ilya climbs on behind you and wraps her arms around your waist as you pull the bow over your head and clutch tightly at the dragon, tapping its back to let it know you're ready. It doesn't wait to hear the threats of the bandit as she picks herself off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wings unfurl like sails in the wind and with an almighty whoosh the three of you are airborne  and climbing higher and higher into the night sky.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun is well into the sky by the time the dragon thinks about landing- and not a moment too soon. The dragon lands, back feet hitting the ground first and then running on all fours before coming to a stop to slump onto the ground exhausted from the hours of airtime. You pry Ilya\u2019s hands from around your waist, her knuckles white from clenching tightly and roll off, hitting the soft grass with less force than you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweet and merciful ground, may I never leave you again.\u201d You murmur with closed eyes and grabbing tufts of grass tightly in sweaty palms. The dragon rumbles, chuckling as he turns to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst time flying little one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd by the gods the last. From now on you\u2019re walking from A to B.\u201d That earns another low chuckle from the dragon that infects you and then Ilya. And before you know it you\u2019re all laughing. No idea why- relief, the idea of the dragon attempting to sneak through a city unnoticed. Or maybe tickle dragons just have that air to them. Either way it\u2019s a few minutes at least before you can stop laughing and push yourself to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky is bright and mostly clear with a few wisps of white clouds drifting lazily across the azure vastness. The knee-high grass brushes smoothly against your legs as you make your way around to the other side of the dragon. On this side of him, the grass continues for about twelve feet before ending abruptly with a steep slope of ferns and bracken. Down there is pine forest with a river that snakes through the middle of the valley and continues so far as you can see- a few miles before the valley turns to the left and out of sight. So far as you can tell it\u2019s uninhabited which is probably for the best. The last thing you want is a farm running to the local militia and screaming about a dragon on its way to steal his sheep and burn his crops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite the view you can\u2019t help but notice. And it reminds you that you\u2019re no longer chained up and no longer a prisoner. You\u2019re free. Granted, there\u2019s still the matter of the shackles, but hey, one step at a time right? After all your head\u2019s still spinning from the flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo.\u201d Ilya says as she slips off the dragon behind you and makes her way over to where you stand. \u201cWhat now?\u201d In the light of day and now that she isn\u2019t squeezing the life out of your lungs, you can see the ex-slave girl is quite pretty. Her hair, long and ruffled by the wind cascades over her back and shoulders like a dark waterfall. Her attire, though revealing, is in far better shape than the rags you wear. Her top is scarlet silk- close fitting and sleeveless with a plunging, gold-trimmed neckline that draws wandering eyes down to her cleavage. It covers nothing below her breasts, leaving her slender torso exposed, down to the rune on midriff. Her hips are wrapped with a short skirt, again of scarlet and gold silk, that covers so little that maybe the tailor should simply have moved onto a material that wasn\u2019t rationed. Worn leather sandals care all that remain of her outfit, save for the collar and bangles on her wrists and ankles that somehow weren\u2019t lost during the flight. Had she not been a slave, you\u2019d wager she could have had any man or woman of her choosing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. I guess the dragon and I had a plan before you arrived. But-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a name.\u201d He grumbles indignantly. Oh, right, yeah. Huh- you\u2019d have thought you\u2019d ask something like that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is that oh great, noble and groundeduntilfurthernotice steed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thinks for a second as if wondering how best to put it simply. After a moment or two of thought he does what you assume to be a shrug and gives it to you straight. \u201cYou cannot pronounce it with a human tongue. But the rough translation is Freefall.\u201d The name earns a raised eyebrow from Ilya and barely covered smirk from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFreefall?\u201d You say. \u201cTell me that doesn\u2019t reflect on your flying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. But dragons have a sense of humor that most humans don\u2019t seem to appreciate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo- what does it sound like in dragon tongue?\u201d One unrepeatable noise later and you nod in agreement- human tongues can\u2019t bend like that. You glance across at Ilya who looks equally perplexed. \u201cAll in favor of a new name?\u201d you ask. Two hands in the air beats the one paw on the ground and the two of you start spit balling, recounting the name of every dragon you\u2019ve heard tales of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome he simply shakes his head for, others outright snorts at in disgust which is a shame- he looks like an Eir\u00f3n. Eir\u00f3n would have suited him. Finally, you think it was Ilya who suggested it, he settles upon \u2018Murtagh.\u2019 More of a name for some roguish mercenary you think but, if he thinks it fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what of your name maiden?\u201d Murtagh asks you after rolling it off his tongue a handful of times. \u201cLittle-bare-footed-one does not seem ideal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeyla.\u201d You reply. At least- that\u2019s what you always your parents calling you. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve called yourself up till now. So to change it to something like Rebekah now would be silly. \u201cAnyway as I was saying. Murtagh and I agreed upon something before you arrived.\u201d You continue, turning back to Ilya. \u201cHe lost his parents, but hunters took his brother. Somewhere out there is a tickle dragon named Fenrir and we\u2019re going to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you weren\u2019t part of that agreement. You\u2019re free now and like you said, you\u2019re a slave to no one. Next town we come to we can part ways.\u201d Ilya thinks for a moment, looking between you and the Murtagh. And then, with determination in her eyes she meets your gaze with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like an adventure. I hear that\u2019s what free people do. Travel the world. Adventure.\u201d Well you\u2019ve been free most of your life and that wasn\u2019t adventure. That was struggling to stay alive. But then you didn\u2019t have a dragon at your side back then. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s settled then.\u201d You smile. Feeling as if you need to pose dramatically. You turn back to the slope, one leg in front and to the side of the other, one hand on a bent knee, the other on your hip. \u201cThe three of us are going to go out there. And whatever happens, wherever we go and whoever we meet along the way- we are going to find Fenrir. Even if we have to uproot all of Zenith to find him.\u201d Epic music strikes up in your head as your hair is blown in the wind. Ilya and Murtagh must be giving you looks behind your back, but this is your moment damn it and you\u2019re determined to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut do you mind if we rest first?\u201d Ilya asks as she wraps slender fingers around the skin of your waist and rests her head on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 yeah, sure, I guess.\u201d You grumble, as you feel your moment blow away into the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cResting sounds good.\u201d Murtagh agrees as he looks towards the two of you, eyes seemingly focusing on the exposed skin, of which you both have plenty. \u201cAnd one more thing.\u201d He adds. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Almost as if it were reading your minds, the dragon gave a low growl, almost like a chuckle. \u201cBe at ease, human. Unlike other dragons of our kind, we tickle dragons care little for meat or fauna, for we have a very unique food source.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what might you feed off, o-mighty-and-large-tickle-dragon-whose-name-is-Murtagh?\u201d Letting out a snort at your attempt at humor, the latter only looked at the both of you equally as it gave its answer in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLaughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth ajar at choosing whether or not to believe him, your mind struggled to comprehend how the sound of laughing would feed such a large beast such as Murtagh. So astounded you were, you didn\u2019t notice the fact that Ilya had gotten over her initial surprise, slowly creeping behind you with outstretched and wiggling fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you believe him Ilya? What kind of dragon feeds on lau-teeheehahhaaaa!\u201d Caught off guard by fingers wiggling against your naked sides, you rolled to the ground, your arms wrapping around them by reflex as your companion cheekily started to prod at your skin with her fingers, sending you into another bout of giggles every time. \u201cSince its laughter that he wants, I think yours will suffice quite well. Bon appetit, Mr. Dragon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrinking in the sound of your laughter with a bemused expression on his face, Murtagh continued to watch as he lay down in front of the two of you, resting his head on his front crossed front paws. Laughing as you weakly tried to push Ilya away, the servant girl wore a mock annoyed expression on her face, playfully clicking her tongue at you as her nails skittered across your ribs. \u201cWe have a tickle dragon to feed, so let out those giggles! Or will these fingers have to explore further to get it out of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready a giggling mess, you already knew what would happen if you let your playful companion roam any further to where your underarms were. Grabbing her naked feet, you promptly held them with the crook of one arm as Ilya made an alarmed expression. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to laugh, so are you! Coochie Coo!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparing no expense of her soles, you raked your nails along her surprisingly creamy arches, earning Murtagh another source of laughter other than your own. \u201cPleehehheehheease! Not my feet! I\u2019m too ticklish there! No more-eehehheeheee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both you and the tickle dragon drank in Ilya\u2019s girlish laughter, the momentary pause gave Ilya all the time she needed as she took advantage of your lapse in attention to grab at your foot, one hand holding onto your ankle with an iron grip. With a playful smirk on her face as well, along with the wiggling fingers of her other hand, you already knew you were in for a few laughs. \u201cOh no you wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes I would. Shall we start from the beginning? This little piggy went to the market\u2026\u201d Wiggling your biggest toe with her hand, you fought the urge to giggle aloud, not wanting to give her the victory so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis little piggy stayed at home\u2026\u201d Stroking the base of your second toe, your face grimaced with the effort of holding in your laughter, a wide grin plastered on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis little piggy had roast beef\u2026\u201d Giving your third toe a small lick with her tongue, you let out a small chuckle disguised as a cough, not expecting the unusual tickling instrument on your toes at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis little piggy had none\u2026\u201d One nail slowly scratching the undersides of the fourth toe in, you held in your suspense as Ilya dragged out the words, tormenting you with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this little piggy\u2026 Laughed wee wee all the way home!\u201d Wiggling your smallest toe before running her fingers like a rake along the length of your soles, you finally burst out in laughter, head thrown back with girlish giggles as the digits continued to dance over your foot. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have said that whoever was tickling your foot has had years of experience at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you a much needed break in between laughing your head off, the other girl seemed to have forgotten that you still held her feet in your arms. Grinning as you did the same thing to her what she did to your poor foot, the poor girl letting loose with her laughter, you heard a low rumble coming from your side, the tickle dragon gazing into the darkness of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman, cease your activities at once. We have company.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Escaping with the prisoners, aren\u2019t we?!\u201d As you stopped tickling Ilya, the latter taking the few seconds to suck in sweet air into her lungs again, both you and Murtagh casted your gaze towards a nearby hill, where a lone female bandit stood, her tired horse next to her. You assumed that she must have tired the poor animal out, forcing it to travel the long distance just to chase after the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in only a worn out cloth top which stopped at her ribs and a pair of torn leather pants, the raven-haired bandit had an absolutely livid look on her face as she stalked to where the three of you were camping, Ilya gave a terrified whimper as the bandit drew her dagger, a loop of rope in her other hand. Warily stepping aside for now as she brandished the weapon at you, you exchange a glance with Murtagh, knowing that if she tried anything, the both of you would be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dare to escape from us, slave?! When we get back I\u2019ll be sure to ask leader to give you the special punishment of a whole day in the stocks. We\u2019ll see if you still want to escape after that!\u201d Grabbing a handful of your Ilya\u2019s black hair as the latter let out a frightened shriek, you knew that you had to act now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, not so tough now eh, slave? When I come back with the tickle dragon, the ransom target and our slave, the boss is sure to give me a promo-Hey!\u201d Using the dark of the night to make your movements as inconspicuous as possible, you closed the distance enough to grab the bandit\u2019s wrist, giving it a small twist as she winced, dropping her dagger in the process. Furiously turning her attention to you, you felt her other hand wrap around your neck lifting you up, feeling your breath literally being squeezed out of your windpipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little whore, when we get back I\u2019ll be sure to send you to the stocks as we-\u201d As a loud roar cut off whatever she had to say, you saw Murtagh give what passed for a smug grin for a dragon as the bandit\u2019s horse ran off in the distance, frightened by the rumbling bellow coming from the tickle dragon. Face almost going red with anger, the bandit starred daggers into your eyes as you felt a bead of nervous sweat forming on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust great, now how am I going to go back?! Why don\u2019t you help me convince your friend over there to carry us all? I\u2019m sure that if I threaten to make few scars on your face he\u2019ll comply.\u201d However, as the female bandit was about to retrieve her dagger, she let out a surprised cough as something tackled into her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou again, slave?! Get your filthy hands off me!\u201d Kicking Ilya square in the stomach, even you had to wince as your friend tumbled into the grass. However, letting out a cough as she got back up, proudly displaying a leather boot which suddenly appeared in her hands, you could swear that the bandit\u2019s anger raised a few notches, her now bootless foot exposed to the cold air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you little-HEY! I can\u2019t see!\u201d Wrapping his tail around her eyes, you silently thank the tickle dragon for the much needed aid, slipping out of her grip as you grabbed her other boot as well, giving it a hard tug as it flew off, both her feet now vulnerable and bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally managing to pull the feathery tail off of her head, the bandit let out a snarl as she saw the rope she previously had on her body now appearing in your hands. As both Ilya and you slowly walked towards her with a sly smirk on your faces, a crack appeared in your captor\u2019s mask, the realization that she might be beaten slowly coming to her. \u201cNow now, how about we just go back peacefully, and no one has to get hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we tie you instead with this handy rope you brought?\u201d Grinning as you both dived towards the bandit, the latter didn\u2019t have time to fend off the two of you as she shot her hand out, grabbing the first thing that she could reach. As you felt fingers giving a hard squeeze to your sides, you let out a surprised yelp, covering your mouth quickly. However, a sudden epiphany came to the female woman\u2019s face as she realized what had just happened, a sadistic grin quickly creeping onto her mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ticklish are we? Let me see if I can convince you to come back with me!\u201d Dashing past Ilya with lightning speed, you felt her hands grab at your own as the both of you fell to the ground, wrestling for the advantage. Using her larger body and weight against you, the bandit quickly came out on top, both your hands still locked in hers. Slowly pushing them above your head as she held down both your hands with only one of her own, she menacingly wiggled the digits of her free hand as you gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s see where else are you ticklish, you cheeky girl! Coochie Coo!\u201d Digging her fingers into your hollows, you couldn\u2019t help but let out peals of girlish laughter, the sudden sensation proving too much for you to handle. Kicking and screaming amidst your laughter, the bandit used the larger frame of her body to pin you down, not relenting in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for disobeying us! If you\u2019ve learnt your lesson, let\u2019s-pffffttt!\u201d Letting out what sounded like a strangled cough, you saw through your closed eyelids that Ilya had tackled the larger female off you, the bandit trying to push the other girl away as your companion clung on for dear life, both her hands wrapped around the other\u2019s torso. \u201cHow about you learn a lesson, on what happens to mean a person like you who takes other people away from their homes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her fingers started to claw at the female bandit\u2019s bare sides, you saw a lopsided grin appear on her face as even you could tell that she was trying her hardest not to laugh, her hands still trying to push the other girl away. \u201cGet off me you little bitch! I\u2019m not ticklish, so stop it!\u201d Not missing out on the fact that your dragon companion was trying to help, the bandit grabbed a pouch from her waist before throwing it into the larger creature\u2019s face, the latter growling with displeasure as it tried to remove the powder which burst forth onto his maw with his paws, temporarily blinded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised that your captor would be ticklish, you followed Ilya\u2019s lead, realizing that you were the only one that was physically able to help her. Jumping at the larger woman\u2019s chest, you wrapped your arms and legs around her in a bear hug, blinding her face with your own chest. \u201cS-Stop it! I said get off me! If you think the same trick is going to work, think again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging her fingers into your sides to get you to let go, you did the same as Ilya as you hung onto dear life, laughter pouring freely from your mouth. However, with her task unhindered, your companion grinned as she mischievously squeezed hard on the bandit\u2019s bare sides, giggles and snickers finally escaping from the latter\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few minutes, you felt your adversary starting to visibly weaken, the toll of Ilya\u2019s tickling clearly having an effect on her as you no longer felt digits digging into your sides, leaving you free to return the favor, slipping your hands into the crook of her underarms. Guffawing with laughter, the bandit finally fell to the ground, arms clamped to her sides with hearty laughter as both you and Ilya followed suit, not letting up the tickling for even a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the rope from the grass, you coiled it around her hands before tying a tight knot, pulling her arms above her head even as she cursed and swore in between her laughter. Still prodding and poking her belly, Ilya gave you a smirk as well before bending down in a raspberry, the shrill sound of shrieking laughter already telling you how effective it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on her arms while grabbing one end of the rope binding her hands, you gave your previous captor an evil grin, the fingers of your free hand wiggling menacingly in the air. \u201cIt seems we\u2019re not the only ones ticklish. Why don\u2019t you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s not gonna work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry big guy. I\u2019ve got one arrow and I don\u2019t want to lose it by sticking it in a deer. You\u2019ll have to hunt your own food.\u201d Not that you couldn\u2019t try, but while an arrow might outright kill a rabbit, you\u2019d have to be very lucky to do the same to a deer. And given the track record of your life so far, that\u2019s not likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect him to be dejected, or something like that. Instead his body shakes with a low rumble, which you interpret as a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow.\u201d He says, pushing himself to his feet and walking over to where you and Ilya stand. \u201cWhy would I go out hunting? When I have two tasty morsels right here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart stops and your blood runs cold as the words reverberate through your mind. Beside you Ilya tenses and stares with an equally horrified expression at the feathered dragon as it comes closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, wait! I thought we had a deal! I\u2019d help you find your brother and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurtagh pauses, the smirk on his face wiped and replaced with confusion. \u201cWe- we still do, don\u2019t we?\u201d He asks, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if you eat us we don\u2019t. And that goes for Ilya too.\u201d You reply stepping in front of her as to protect her- like you could protect her from a hungry dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurtagh stares intently at you for a second, as if trying to see what he\u2019s missing here. Then his expression changes so suddenly you swear you can hear the switch click. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not what I meant at all. I don\u2019t eat- You thought I\u2019d- No.\u201d His voice sounds offended, like he could hardly believe that two girls like yourselves with one arrow between you, could seriously think a giant, sharp toothed reptile like him would even think about eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it neither of you know what a tickle dragon feeds on?\u201d He sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, up till now I thought livestock, princesses, knights in shining armor- us.\u201d You reply. \u201cBut I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re about to correct me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurtagh snorts softly and two rings of smoke drift up out of his nostrils. \u201cI suppose you\u2019d be right in thinking that. But tickle dragons don\u2019t require food like most other creatures of this land. We feed off mirth- laughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that explains a lot actually- and there you were thinking the tickling was just a party trick. There\u2019s still a problem though. \u201cI hate to break it to you big guy but we\u2019re not ticklish.\u201d You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot ticklish?\u201d He asks with a skeptical grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot ticklish.\u201d You reply. You guess you could- find someone for him to feed off, but then people might not take kindly to you plucking them up and whisking them away to tickle. Maybe telling a funny joke would-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is cut short and fingernails skitter down your naked sides, dancing along your ribs. On anyone else it would have reduced them to a giggling mess. But you just turn around to Ilya with a blank expression as she looks at you sheepishly. \u201cShe\u2019s not ticklish.\u201d She mutters to Murtagh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m not.\u201d You shoot back as she withdraws her fingers, taking a step back away from you. Almost like she expects a counter- \u201cAre <i>you</i>?\u201d You smile sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t have time to cry out as you leap at her, tackling her to the ground and skittering your fingers  around her ribs. Instantly she screams with ticklish laughter. And just like that, dragon hunger has been eradicated. \u201cAww.\u201d You tease as she tries to push your hands away from her belly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got such a cute giggle.\u201d She tries to retort, cute as it is she tries, but your fingers wandering along her sides are too much for her and she can\u2019t hold back the high-pitched squeals. \u201cHow does that taste Murt?\u201d You ask, turning to the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoft and tender.\u201d Murtagh nods. You half-expected something like a glowing aura around him, but no, same old dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the whole dragon food problem outta the way you guess it\u2019s time to go and find something for you and Ilya to eat but- troll spit, she is really ticklish. A bit longer tickling an insanely ticklish and half naked girl like Ilya couldn\u2019t hurt, right?</span></div></div>",

You should really start figuring out where it is you\u2019re going next, and for that matter where it is you are right now. But troll spit, Ilya is a lot of fun to tickle! She has such a cute, adorable giggle that it makes you want to laugh sympathetically. Her tickle spots are all exposed, and her skin is incredibly smooth. With her taut tummy and firm, smooth legs\u2026 you just can\u2019t help running your fingers all over her. Besides, the big tickle dragon can\u2019t be full yet, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKoochie koochie koo, Ilya!\u201d You tease, grinning down at her as your fingertips spider over her belly. \u201cC\u2019mon, somebody needs to feed Murtagh!\u201d She sputters in protest, but can\u2019t say anything coherent as one of your fingers worms its way in her bellybutton and wiggles playfully. It makes you wonder how often Murtagh needs to \u2018feed,\u2019 and part of you hopes the answer is \u2018often.\u2019 You could get used to this, especially with that excuse. Your fingers dance their way up Ilya\u2019s sides, and right into her exposed underarms. Ilya lets out a gasp and a new stream of giggles, wiggling in your tickly grasp. \u201cOoh, is someone ticklish under here? Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNohohohoho!\u201d Ilya protests, completely unconvincingly, shaking her head and whipping her hair side to side. She tries to turn around and tickle back, reaching up to run her fingertips over your own bare belly. But nothing doing, you just aren\u2019t ticklish, making for one mischievous and evil tickler!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiggle you fingertips even faster under her arms, making her squeak girlishly and try to clamp her arms to her sides, not that it gets your tickling fingers out of there. All the while, Murtagh is off to the side, watching your antics. He doesn\u2019t do anything to stop it, and dragon facial expressions are nigh impossible to read, but if you had to guess the big guy definitely seemed \u2018smug and satisfied\u2019 by the playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep it up for a couple more minutes before finally letting Ilya go, not wanting to push things too far. She lays on the grass next to you for a minute, giggling and slowly catching her breath, her hands trying to rub the lingering ticklish feeling out of her skin. The girl really was wonderfully ticklish. \u201cHehehehe\u2026 ooh, somehow I\u2019m going to get you back for that!\u201d Ilya tell you, giving you a playful shove. She doesn\u2019t seem upset, which is good. \u201cBut come on, we should really figure out how we\u2019ll get food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurtagh rumbles his throat, speaking up. \u201cMmm, thank you for your laughter, Ilya. It was excellent.\u201d Then he turns to you, staring at you with his big eyes. \u201cBut don\u2019t think you are immune to me, should I have need of you\u2026\u201d He says with a slightly suggestive rumble, which you can only blink back at him. You aren\u2019t ticklish at all, never have been. Maybe he does have some funny jokes after all? But Murtagh continues. \u201cSince you two have just given me such a delicious meal, it\u2019s only fair I return the favor. Make a fire, little ones, and I will bring you food.\u201d And with that, the tickle dragon bounds off into the trees, leaving you to look at each other with a shrug, and start to gather sticks and leaves for the fire.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, the area doesn\u2019t seem to have had rain in some time, and dry wood is plentiful. Before long, you have a nice pile of wood, and thankfully you do know how to make a fire. As the evening air starts to cool, the two of you huddle by the warm fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where do we go from here?\u201d You ask Ilya. \u201cI don\u2019t really know any place far from my village, so I honestly have no idea. Are those bandits going to keep coming after us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we probably already have a bounty on both of our heads.\u201d Ilya said, nodding gravely. \u201cI\u2019m an escaped slave, and you stole a slave and a tickle dragon. If they catch us, well\u2026 you\u2019ll be as worse off as me, I think.\u201d You shudder, realizing you\u2019ll have a similar slave mark if those bandits catch up with you. \u201cWe\u2019re in danger anywhere in the northern kingdoms, those bandits roam all over them. Besides, if there were another tickle dragon in the northern lands, those bandits would\u2019ve heard about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, south it is!\u201d You say, realizing at least that much. \u201cDo you\u2026 know what anything is like south of here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool breeze wafts by, and Ilya cozies up next you by the fire. The semi-cuddle by the beautiful girl makes you blush a bit, which hopefully isn\u2019t visible in the firelight. Ilya nods at your question. \u201cYou learn a lot listening to drunken bandits boasting by the fire. Southeast of here is the Kingdom of Coninze. It\u2019s very civilized, and roving bandits don\u2019t dare go there. The royal family is quite popular, and supposedly very benevolent. It might be a good place to go, but I\u2019m not sure how they\u2019d react to a tickle dragon in their midst.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, having at least heard of Coninze. \u201cThey say the Queen is beautiful and kind, but\u2026 that\u2019s all I\u2019ve heard, and who knows if tales are accurate this far away. What else is south of here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya thinks for a moment. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not exactly sure where we are, but I\u2019d know if I saw a roadsign. I think due south of here is the Duchy of Uzien. It\u2019s a major port on the Great Southern Ocean, so we might hear rumors from all over. I\u2019ve also heard there\u2019s a new young duchess there, who has been acting ambitiously. If we could get an audience with any of that Royalty, that might be the best way to hear about Murtagh\u2019s brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about that for a moment. \u201cHow are the two of us going to get to speak to queens and princesses and duchesses? I\u2019m just a peasant, or ex-peasant at least, and you\u2019re an ex-slave. We\u2019re not exactly influential.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya grins in the firelight. \u201cNo, but he is. I bet even royalty might be interesting in meeting a tickle dragon. Those bandits were trying to get Murtagh sold to some kind of noble in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I guess that makes sense. We can at least try. Anyplace else we might go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlya thinks again, and cuddles a little closer to you in the process. \u201cOh, to the southwest is an elven forest. Wood elves live there, and elves are supposed to know a lot about magical creatures like dragons. But\u2026 humans and elves are kind of like oil and water. I doubt they\u2019d want us in their lands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026 but they would accept me!\u201d You hear in a low voice, and the two of you turn and jump to see Murtagh standing behind you. Apparently he can be as quiet as a can when he wants to be. At his feet is some kind of small boar he seems to have caught. Or at least you think it is, you hope he didn\u2019t steal a pig from some farmer. But beggars can\u2019t be choosers, and you have plenty of food for tonight. \u201cElves have always been friendly to my kind, and you saved me. I would vouch for you, if we entered the forest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMurtagh, how long have you been listening to us?\u201d Ilya asks, a little suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon only grins, \u201cI have excellent hearing. All the better to hear your laughter. I cannot sense Fenrir from here, and know little about human ways. I will go in whatever direction you wish, as long as you think it might lead us to him.\u201d Murtagh lifts the boar with his teeth, and manages to gingerly put it on the spit for you, roasting the beast over the fire. You can already start to smell the meat cooking. But the question remains, where to set off to tomorrow?</span></div></div>",

Fenrir\u2019s probably being measured out for golden dragon armor right now. Maybe it\u2019s a case of news traveling slow, but your gut tells you that they\u2019re not the places to start looking. And without a lead there\u2019s only so much ground the three of you can cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves on the other hand- since magic users are the rule, not the exception, there has to be one out there that can cast a spell to track dragons, or knows how to skry far-away places. The main problem with choosing the elves is that is Ilya\u2019s right, and you\u2019ve heard enough stories to think she is, they won\u2019t take too kindly to your intrusion. On the flip-side of that any bandits on your tail won\u2019t be able to follow you once they reach the borders.

The only relief from endless tittillation a resident will get is the short break of being marched to yet another in a series of seemingly infinitely varied torments.

And many more heinous traps await you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen coated in sweat and dirt, groups of succubi or imps hose and ticklishly scrub you down.

Any attempt at resistance will be noted by these fast flying enforcers, and infractions severe enough will require a subject be sent to the ominous \"Tanks\", where the tickle torture is the most concentrated. Each time one enters them a brand new torture is devised suited to tickle them most. You already have spent some time in one, an experience which you would never in your life (er--death) care to repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunatly, the Tanks are the central focus of your escape plan. As they are located in a dark chasm away from much of tickle Hell, you might be able to overpower your guards there. Then you would need to cut through the rest of Tickle Hell to the other side of the realm, perhaps by disguise or subterfuge, to where the Great Gate which serves as an entrance and exit is located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a long shot, but what happens if you fail? Not like you're gonna get much less tickle torture by just standing around. All you'll need to do is piss off an official enough, and you'll be off to the Tanks. You should probably do this during the next station of tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach your new torment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've tried to convince them that it's just a trick of the shadows, or their eyes playing tricks on them after spending too much time at the tavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite your efforts, rumors are starting to spread. Some whisper that the ghost was your predecessor generations ago, and she's not satisfied with your work.

Still more rumors claim that this ghost was locked away deep inside the temple, but the old charms are slowly losing their potency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never been one to believe in ghosts or phantoms, despite taking a religious vocation.

And it serves many of both types, as is usual on warm late evenings like this one. You walk up the steps (like many of the other tropical area's buildings, it is built on short stilts) and walk through the saloon doors cautiously, for as any other place filled with so many people, you never know what mischief may be about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the tavern is choked with people, locals and foreigners, so you push your way through the throngs to reach the flight of stairs in the corner leading up to your room. You dodge a flung pewter mug narrowly, and inch around a tenderly kissing couple, both spidering their fingers in each others' armpits tenderly as they kiss. As you make it to the stairs, a lewd barmaid with her cleavage hanging down elicits a shriek from you as she digs her fingers into your hips playfully from behind. You wriggle out of the ticklish embrace and tiredly walk up the wooden staircase to the quieter hall above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to your room is the furthest one on the left, and you swing it open then lock it behind you. It's sparsely furnished, with a straw-mattress bed, a chair, and a slightly crooked dresser. You fling your knapsack on top of your chair and promptly jump onto the slightly thin but still comfortable straw mat. Tired from studying and thinking all day long, you quickly fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning you wake up to find the barmaid you'd been looking for. Talk of the town was she was the one to go to if one needed information. First, you'd need to locate her. You crack open the door and walk downstairs to see that the tavern is quite a bit less crowded than last night. Only one person sits nearby at the bar, and a single maid hunches over a table with a soapy rag. Most people are probably more interested in breaking their fast at home or from a market stall than inside the bar. You walk up to the bartender, Trevor, who you understand is a trustworthy, if gruff man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me, Trevor,\" you venture, \"Word is you have a wench in your employ who knows who I can hire for...a trip I want to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, knowing it's none of his business knowing where or why you are journeying. \"You'll be looking for Isobel, then.

Her long black hair is stuck to her dress, wet from sloshing around water and soap.

She's pretty well versed in the 'arcane arts and lore' but also one of those uptight scholarly types. Just a warning: she sometimes likes to experiment with spells on other people,\" Isobel adds helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you've got Cara, the town's foremost ranger. I don't like to familiarize myself with her kind,\" the barmaid sniffles, \"she's got a reputation of being greedy and coin-hungry. But that could be used to one's advantage, and if you need a smart, free-thinking, and capable guide, Cara's your girl. By the way, you can probably find them both in the market this time of day.\" Isobel finishes, and goes back to cleaning her tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finger your bag of money, thinking about which companion you want on your journey.</span></div></div>",

Their feet and bent more then the normal man's but when resting its only moderately noticeable due to their lack of clothing, when they are actively perching they are able to use several special muscles and a very odd bone design to curve their feet almost 40* more, making for quite the odd sight. From head to toe they are covered in poofey feathers save for their chest, stomach, and part of their waists. While the wings of the creature are quite weird an even odder feature of the Harpy is that they completely lack genitalia yet in some form or other they all have breasts. This lead to much debate on how the species propagated until a particularly lucky inquisitor discovered what appeared to be a chamber built into a cliff that had signs of summoning and transformation magic, this lead a few scholars to believe that this chamber had been used to summon crudely human creature which a group of mages transformed into the bane of travelers they are known as today. These suspicions were confirmed when it was later found that runes carved into the circle included several marks for the property of feathers, bone alteration, and eye sight sculpting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you think you got a crude image of their form in your mind you begin to strategist. If they manage to surround you then they may have enough power in their wings to lift you into the air where you couldn't effectively struggle free. At the same time they tend to use their wings as a preferred tickle implement, these wings are known to be difficult to grapple with due to the many points where they can turn or rotate combined with their tough frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all this won't be a fair fight, but you were looking for a challenge and this battle will present that a-plenty!</span></div></div>",
