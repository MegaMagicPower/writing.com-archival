            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hi. My name's JJ Juspeczyk, and this is my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the summer I turned 17 when it happened. I lived with my parents, Frank and Amelia; my 14-year-old brother, Frank, Jr.; and my baby sister, Grace, who was 3. Dad was a police detective, and Mom was an architect who worked from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was summer, I was working on my podcast, <i>The J Files</i>. On it, I examined mysteries old and new that had the authorities stumped. My girlfriends, Izzy Kessler and Mina Johnson, helped me with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also had an awesome boyfriend, Nick Connors. During the school year, Nick was the star player on the school basketball team. Any time of year, he had eyes only for me. At least, until that summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to know more about me? Well, I was moderately athletic, with light brown hair and seafoam green eyes. Of course, if you were to look at me now, you'd never suspect that I looked like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatter of fact, if you were to look at me now, you wouldn't even suspect you were looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen people hear that my podcast is about mysteries, sometimes they assume that I'm doing tons of legwork, following up on leads, or even mixing it up with the bad guys. Actually, I prefer to keep a low profile. Usually, I just call people up and ask them questions. Then, Izzy edits the recorded material into a compelling hour, and we put it out onto the internet. Officially, the police chalk the solutions up to good police work and tips from the public. <i>Un</i>officially, Dad thanks us for our help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then, though, I get a tip that leads to me sticking my button nose into things. That's what Dad says when he finds out what I've been up to: \"JJ,\" he says, \"this is police business. Leave it to the police, and keep your button nose out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat my button nose had gotten into this time was a series of burglaries. The targets were always various chemical plants, with a university thrown in here and there. The burglar or burglars would break in, crack the safe open, and look for something. Nobody could figure out what they were after, and it had everyone stumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, somebody called me and suggested I check out the Chem building at the university. So I put on my sneaking-around clothes (dark blue clothes, ski mask, gloves), parked my car far enough away that it wouldn't be connected to anything that might happen, and got to sneaking. I found a way inside and set out to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI checked out five different labs before I got to the odd one. It had cages, but they seemed to be empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was where I spotted the guy. And he spotted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time, the alarm went off. Presumably, the security guard found one of our points of entry and called it in. Whatever the reason, the burglar got panicky, grabbed a beaker from the table, and threw it at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might have been bad, but his aim was good: the beaker hit me on the head and broke, dumping its contents all over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off running. Once I made sure I wasn't bleeding, I decided I had better get going, myself. I slipped out as carefully as I could, assisted by the fact that the burglar was now in police custody. I got back to my car and drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking myself out at home, I found no indication that whatever was in the beaker had done me any damage. So I took a quick shower and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad I hadn't thought to take a selfie, though: it would have been the last picture of me for who knows how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I woke up and took my standard morning shower. I remember thinking something was off, but I didn't know what. Anyway, I certainly seemed to be okay as I showered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my shower over, it was time to brush my teeth. The shower had left the bathroom mirror fogged up, so I grabbed a hand towel and wiped it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I saw it. Or, rather, when I <i>didn't</i> see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at myself, I seemed perfectly normal. But, when I looked into the mirror, I had no reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, looking down at my body, I noticed something else: My right arm was between my body and the light bulb. But it wasn't casting a shadow on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I think I was justified in screaming in terror.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mom came in. \"JJ? Did you... Where are you, JJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that certainly confirmed it. \"I'm right in front of you, Mom. Yes, that was me screaming. You can guess why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed, looking tired. \"JJ,\" she said, as she stepped closer, \"I'm really not in the mood for jokes. Just come out from wherever you're hiding, and... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was as far as she got. Because that was when she put her hand on my breast. \"JJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... How did this happen? How <i>could</i> it happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a hunch. But I don't want to talk about it right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Go get dressed. We'll talk about it later.\" And she left the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished getting ready for the day as best I could (I could brush my teeth, but brushing my hair was more of a challenge), and I walked to my bedroom. I picked out an outfit, took out a bra and panties, and I got dressed. As I did, I looked into my full-length mirror, and I got a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy bra hung visibly in the air as I handled it. Once I had it fastened in place, however, it turned as invisible as I was. The same thing happened when I put on my panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPantyhose, top, cutoffs: All went on, and all became just as invisible as the rest of me. \"This is going to take some getting used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was dressed, if invisibly, I went downstairs. Mom and Dad were sitting in the breakfast nook, along with Frank, Jr., and Grace. No prizes for guessing the topic of conversation. \"I was so embarrassed when I wound up touching her like that,\" Mom said. \"She says she thinks she knows what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certainly looking forward to that,\" Dad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wonder no more,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of them jumped. \"JJ,\" Mom said, \"I thought you were going to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. Once my clothes were on, they turned invisible, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Dad said. \"You're here, and your mother says you know how this happened. So let's hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think the fact that I was invisible helped to keep Dad calm. If he could actually see me, he could glower at me. As it was, all he could do was listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was finished, he said, \"Well, JJ, I always knew your tendency to involve yourself in police matters would get you into trouble. Obviously, this isn't what I thought would happen. I can't decide if this is better or worse than what I had imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped. \"So, what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Mom said, \"we find out if you're still healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we do that,\" Dad asked, \"when we don't dare take her to the ER?\"</span></div></div>",

Don't get me wrong, I was grateful: She had been my doctor for as far back as I could remember. If we had to trust this to someone outside the family, I was glad it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garrett was about 5', 5\", with salt-and-pepper hair. Once she was in the breakfast nook, she said, \"Well, let's have a look at JJ, and find out what it is that she couldn't come into the office for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid the second part is easier to do than the first,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around. \"Where is she hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJ isn't hiding,\" Mom said. \"She's turned invisible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But people just don't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to touch you,\" I said to her. \"You'll feel my fingers on your right hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I touched her, she reacted as if I'd given her an electrical shock. \"How did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like Mom said,\" I replied, pulling out a chair and sitting down. \"I'm invisible now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know why,\" Dad added, \"we just want to know if she's healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of you, into the living room,\" Dr. Garrett said, taking out her equipment. \"Let me find out what I can. And just because you can't see her while I'm examining her, I'm sure she doesn't want you looking, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, and I was dressed again, Dr. Garrett called the family back in. \"JJ's temperature is normal,\" she said. \"Her pulse and blood pressure are within normal limits. And her lungs sound clear. Based on this, I'd say that she seems to be perfectly healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you suggest we do, Doctor?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One possibility,\" she replied, \"is going back to the university. As it's their formula that's behind this, there's a chance that they have the antidote. On the other hand, they developed an invisibility formula for a reason, and finding out that someone is now invisible because of their work might give them ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned to the chair where I was sitting. \"It's up to you, JJ,\" she said. \"Tell us what you want to do about this.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I got the answer to my first question fifteen minutes after Dad left, when Izzy and Mina came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy Kessler, as you will recall, was my number one assistant on <i>The J Files</i>, helping me with editing and content. Mina Johnson didn't help with the podcast, but she was my oldest friend. We grew up together. She learned the fastest how to pronounce Juspeczyk (it's \"yoos-PET-chick\"), which certainly got her points from Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mrs. Juspeczyk,\" Mina said. \"Is JJ busy? We were hoping to get some shopping done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she isn't busy, Mina,\" Mom said. \"But I don't know if she feels like going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fix that,\" Izzy said. She was carrying a metal water bottle: she had had a kidney transplant, and needed to stay hydrated. At that moment, she tossed her bottle aside... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... right into my shin. \"Ouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, JJ,\" Izzy said, turning in my direction. Then, she turned back where she was going, and made it three steps before she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to look in my direction. \"JJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina had seen the whole thing. She came as close as she dared. \"JJ? Are you... there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's left of me,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich caused both of them to freak out, a condition which, in their cases, caused flailing of limbs. When they hit me, they would apologize, then they'd remember why they hit me, which caused them to freak out again. Repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they calmed down enough to start asking questions. Unfortunately, most of these were the same questions I'd been dealing with all morning, so there wasn't much new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I know,\" I said. \"I'm the only one who's ever turned invisible, and I don't know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Are</i> you, though?\" Izzy asked. \"<i>Are</i> you the only one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Izzy?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The podcast,\" Izzy replied. \"Your great-great-aunt, the one who disappeared? What was that really spooky bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>They thought they heard her,</i>\" Mom said, \"<i>but, when they looked, she wasn't there.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They <i>heard</i> her,\" Izzy said, \"they <i>looked.</i> Well, I hear you, JJ, but, when I look,... \" She gestured at the indentation in the couch cushion, the only visual indication that I was present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom clutched Frankie and Grace to her. \"My babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they're fine, Mom,\" I said. \"If Izzy is right, I'm the first in four generations this has happened to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I was pretty sure that Izzy was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, maybe it was wishful thinking, but it fit the facts as well as anything had. And it gave me a frame of reference for what had happened to me: I was invisible because it ran in Mom's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't have known,\" I replied.</span></div></div>",

If two girls want to buy three tickets, that's their business. Likewise, if those same two girls want to buy enough popcorn and sodas for three people, that's also their business. And, if those two girls choose to sit with one empty seat between them, whose business is that? You're catching on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie we went to see was <i>Expecting the Unexpected</i>, a drama about a teenage girl who finds herself pregnant, even though she's never had sex.

Mina went with me, to give me cover, and she kept her back turned to the toilet as I did what had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got back to the car, Mina quipped, \"You should find out what this place charges for repairs.

I could hear him rummaging around for something, before his heavy footfalls announced his return. He was carrying a bulky reel-to-reel that looked like a miniature version of an old fashioned computer from the nineteen fifties. \"What on Earth is that, dad?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a modified reel-to-reel recorder that can speed up or slow down a person's voice in real time, so I can better understand what a person is saying during an interview.\" Calmly, Dad replied. \"Those who are excitable tend to talk very fast. Also, there are those who talk very slow for various reasons, and this speeds it up into normal speech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo Jo wrote, <i>My mom has something similar.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad set up the recorder, then placed the microphone in front of where Jo Jo was sitting, unseen. He then instructed Jo Jo to say 'hello' again and again as he adjusted the dials. At first, nothing seemed to happen but everyone froze when we heard a voice similar to my own say, \"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a winner at 15,000 Hz.\" Smiling, Dad said. \"It's just beyond the normal hearing range of the average human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm talking in such a high pitch, no one can hear me?\" Worry in her voice, Jo Jo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that Jo Jo has not fully crossed over into this world.\" Serious, dad explained. \"She is talking through the barrier, which is causing her voice to be too high-pitched for anyone to pick up, other than animals, who have more acute hearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we can talk instead of writing everything down.\" Calmly, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief.\" sighing, Jo Jo said. \"I was starting to get cramps from all the writing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" Sighing, I replied. \"How do you make yourself intangible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my eyes closed, I could see Jo Jo shrug. \"I was thinking about calm waters, a relaxation technique, and it happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drew a cleansing breath then visualized an open beach near the ocean, my own relaxation technique. As I did, I heard gasps in the room. Opening my eyes, I saw that I could see an outline of myself! I was ghostlike, but visible! Only, just as it had happened, I vanished again. I closed my eyes and turned to Jo Jo, who sadly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured out that I can make myself sort of visible for a short time too.\" Softly, she said. \"Only it's like flexing a rarely used muscle, it tires me out very quickly and leads to cramps later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced, feeling a dull ache falling over my body. \"I see what you mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a way to see or detect both of you.\" Serious, Dad said. \"Perhaps a specific scent, or some form of makeup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried makeup.\" Serious, Jo Jo said. \"It vanishes the second it is on my face.\" She sighed. \"As for a specific scent, it becomes useless once one becomes used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a way.\" Serious, Dad repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only became sort of visible with water on me after a shower.\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad paused then said... \"This might take some time to figure out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad never quits on a case that is handed to him.\" Looking at Jo Jo, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo Jo smiled. \"Neither does my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dad said, \"It might work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What might work?\" Curious, Jo Jo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know, apart from nobody being able to see me. And she promised not to tell anybody about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. And then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends, Izzy and Mina, came over.

What do you do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell my listeners about mysteries that the authorities haven't been able to solve, and hope that they can come up with the missing pieces. My last one was about an ancestor of mine, who disappeared when she was my age. Izzy and I think it might be connected to my invisibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's take a look at that.

But go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my greatest mystery came to me in a state of depression.\" With a slight frown, Joanna continued. \"A simple question; is this all that I am, is there nothing more?\" She sighed. \"I began to look into various 'what ifs', such as making one decision over another, and, well... I ended up studying parallel worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was science fiction,\" I said. I winced as soon as I said it. After all, I was in a parallel world, wasn't I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I.\" Ruefully, Joanna replied. \"I began to fantasize over meeting my true love in a parallel universe, a grand adventure, if you will.\" She giggled. \"Little did I know that by doing so, it actually happened, only because someone was doing the same in this universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when I began searching for you...\" Stunned, I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna nodded. \"Jo Jo began searching for her great, great uncle.\" Softly, she said. \"You and Jo Jo are invisible because you are in between two universes, neither here or there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how are we...\" Surprised, you began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love, my dear.\" Interrupting me, Joanna said. \"I fell in love here, hence I became visible. A new resident of this universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll become visible again?\" Hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna shook her head. \"You also have a fast friendship with Jo Jo.\" Serious, she said. \"I'm still an investigator at heart, I can read notes with a glance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need make a choice or make a balance.\" Serious, Joanna said. \"Forget about me, about Jo Jo, and focus only on your boyfriend, and then you will become visible again; or hold on to me, onto Jo Jo, and become her twin sister in this universe.\" She sighed. \"That is the choice. Now, the balance is to give it all equal attention: then, with time and practice, you can become invisible at will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you be invisible at will?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna shook her head. 'I made the choice to remain here, in this universe, where I found love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way I can return to my own universe?\" Hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of your boyfriend.\" Simply, Joanna replied. \"That is how you get back. He is your beacon of light in the darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes and thought about Nick. His loving smile, his protective nature... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, I was back in my own dining room, where I found my great-great-grandfather standing in the room. I moved a chair to sit down, to which Grandpa smiled. \"Glad to see you made it back, pumpkin.\" Softly, he said. \"How is your great-great-aunt?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once I had adjusted to the change of surroundings caused by teleportation, my heart sank when I saw Izzy and Mina tied up in the thieves' hideout. Dad was right: I had completely failed at this. I didn't even resist as the three of us were tied together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold up just a minute,\" said one of the thieves. \"You promised me that a chunk of the haul from this scheme would be enough for me to retire on. You didn't say anything about kidnapping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't anticipated that they would be up and around in the middle of the night,\" replied the apparent ringleader. \"Besides, think of them as an insurance policy: If all goes well, they can go home once we have what we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do these paintings get us that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringleader rolled his eyes. \"It's simple: These paintings were done by an eccentric millionaire. He hid directions to a sizable amount of his fortune in the paintings. We find the directions, we follow them, the money's ours. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Izzy was right. They were after some code in the artwork. And they had no idea that they were leading the police right here, wherever here was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news gave me my confidence back. \"When I move,\" I whispered to Izzy and Mina, \"you move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crooks lined up the paintings, then lit them with a UV light. \"There's nothing on three of these,\" one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A set-up,\" the ringleader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the windows were lit up from outside. \"<b>This is the police,</b>\" said the familiar voice of my father, over a loudspeaker. \"<b>We have you surrounded. Give yourselves up.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I made my move. I turned invisible and intangible, then followed Izzy and Mina. At least, I did, until the ringleader spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for our insurance policy. We use the devisualizer and the teleporter, then leave those girls holding all the evidence. By the time they get it straightened out, if they ever do, we'll be free and clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, change of plans: Instead of making good my escape, I had to foil their escape. Heading off the crooks, I picked up something heavy and swung at the first machine I reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must have hit the right spot, because it blew up as soon as I hit it.</span></div></div>",

No broken bones, no bleeding. So that was a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI considered closing my eyes again, and they actually fluttered. But then I thought, <i>Maybe I have a concussion. I should wait until I get examined by a doctor.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I woke up more, I began to hear voices calling my name. \"JJ!\" \"JJ?\" I recognized the voices as Dad, Izzy, and Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I am,\" I said, almost pulling myself up. Something about the ground seemed <i>off</i> somehow, but I couldn't place it yet. \"Anybody get the number of that truck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJ?\" Dad said. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's broken or bleeding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave a massive sigh of relief. \"You don't know how scared you had me, JJ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd imagine you were almost as scared as I was. How about the crooks? Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In custody,\" Izzy said. \"One of them already wants to turn state's evidence. Says he was down for stealing, but not kidnapping us, or the plan to frame us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of that for now,\" Dad said. \"Turn visible, JJ, I want to have you checked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking - wait, what? what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, what do I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you ask me to turn visible, when I'm visible now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJ?\" Mina asked. She found something reflective in the rubble and handed it to me. Or, rather, she held it out in the direction she heard my voice coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took it and looked into it, and I saw that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see my hands. Looking down at my body, I saw my body. When I closed my eyes, I saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, when I looked into the reflective surface, I wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I remembered how the ground looked off, and I realized why: I wasn't casting a shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was invisible again, to everyone but me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I had no idea how to come back.</span></div></div>",

Since I didn't have to focus on how to feed myself, I could listen to people again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper, we watched a movie. A pretty funny one. I couldn't stop laughing. Then, I thought of what someone would think of an apparently empty chair laughing, and I laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, if I could go back in time, I might have forgone warning past me about the consequences of getting involved in the Vanishing Artwork case, and concentrated on telling more recent past me to let my family help me feel better. These people aren't my enemies: why did I distance myself from them, even for a few days?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, I was leaving the bathroom, when I heard Grace's little voice calling out, \"Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Mom didn't rush right in, I figured she was doing something important (possibly involving homeschooling me), so I knocked on Grace's open door. \"Mom's a little busy,\" I said. \"Can I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace held up one of her favorite books, <i>The Little Engine that Could</i>. \"Wead,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll read to you. Let's get you tucked in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Grace was tucked in snugly-bugly, as we put it in our family, I began to read. For the self-important trains who wouldn't help the circus, I imitated the voices of some of the men I'd butted heads with in my podcasting career. For the Little Engine herself, I imitated Grace's voice, letting her hear herself as the heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to the end, Grace looked in my direction and said, \"I miss you pwetty.\" Which, I guess, meant she missed seeing my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss it, too, Gracie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mom came in. \"Did I hear you calling, Gracie? Is it time for your story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJ wead it,\" Grace replied. \"You can wead me Saggy Baggy.\" <i>The Saggy Baggy Elephant</i> was her second-favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI patted Mom on the shoulder, to let her know where I was. \"Thank you, JJ,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I replied, \"thank <i>you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I settled in for bed, I wondered, as if for the first time, what taking care of my own children someday would be like. Maybe it would be like me and Grace just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, let's just hope they don't inherit my opacity-challenged status, or I might spend weeks worrying if I diapered the right end.</span></div></div>",

I knew they weren't heavy, but they might be awkward for her. \"Need some help?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it,\" she replied. Then, as she carried the table, I heard her repeat to herself, \"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can,\" just like in the story. I guessed that my idea worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang. Checking the peephole, I saw that it was Izzy and Mina, so I opened the door and let them in. It was time to go over ideas for future installments of <i>The J Files</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, these bull sessions take place around the kitchen table. However, when we walked into the kitchen, Mom and Dad were sitting there. \"What's going on?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi, girls,\" Dad said. \"We've been doing some thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what JJ can do for spending money. It's hard to find a job that doesn't require interacting with the public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is hard to do,\" Mom added, \"when you're invisible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's doing it now,\" Izzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The podcast,\" Izzy explained. \"Already, she conducts interviews over the phone. We haven't had to meet with anyone since we started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you give us $50 a week each,\" Mina added. \"Either you're paying us to hang out with JJ, or we're making bank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The J Files</i> has brought in some money, I'll admit,\" Dad said. \"But it's not quite like you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try accepting sponsors,\" Izzy suggested. \"You know, online security, that app where they send you food so you can make a fresh meal at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could start offering merch,\" Mina suggested. \"A lot of people want to show their support for our channel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Dad said, \"we'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. When Dad said he would think about something, it generally meant yes. \"Okay,\" I said, \"we'll be in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went upstairs, I checked on Grace (she was satisfied with the redecorating, and was celebrating with a tea party), and we sat on my bed. \"Looks like the future of <i>The J Files</i> is set,\" Mina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you tell?\" Izzy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little things,\" she replied. \"Dad taught me to look for the least little things. I saw your folks nodding at each other while we were talking. I'm pretty sure they're on board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say,\" I said, \"the future of <i>The J Files</i> is set, in more ways than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can come and go as I please, with nobody the wiser. Izzy's got some talent for locating me: who knows where it will lead to? And Mina's a natural detective. Put it all together, and we're the team supreme of amateur crimefighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Mina said. \"The last time we tried going hands-on, we were kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were still operating solo,\" I countered. \"I'm talking about really working together, as a team. How about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in,\" Izzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina shrugged. \"Let's give it a shot, see how it goes.\"</span></div></div>",

At least, I had been before I turned invisible. I had no idea how I would be greeted by a dog who could smell me, but see empty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't have to wait long before we found out. Barney walked into the room and took one look in my direction. Then, he ran up to me, hopped up on his hind legs, and began licking my face. \"I guess he missed me,\" I said, turning my face this way and that to keep his tongue out of my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Barney?\" Izzy's mom called out, as she came into the room. \"Is Izzy ho - what in the world?\" Clearly, she was trying to comprehend the sight of the family dog, on his hind legs, licking what looked like air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mom,\" Izzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world is Barney doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's licking my face, Mrs. Kessler,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJ?

Mostly, this involved pulling levers and turning knobs. At one point, it involved tapping the machine at a particular spot with the side of a hammer. Finally, she gave a satisfied grunt and turned to us. \"Too much interdimensional travel can knock the machine out of alignment,\" she said. \"When those crooks started their scheme, they probably threw things off enough to dislodge JJ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're why I turned invisible the first time,\" I realized. \"And why I traveled to Jo Jo's world. And now, she can travel to different dimensions easily. She hit the teleporter instead of the devisualizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time you see her,\" Mrs. Kessler said, \"warn her not to do too much dimension-hopping.

I looked up and nearly screamed again as I found myself in the gentle grip of a fifty foot woman! \"Easy there, I have you.\" Gently, she said. \"You are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me!\" Terrified, I screamed. \"I can't...\" I screamed again as the bright light took me once more. The girl looked all around, startled, as I had vanished from sight. She turned to a policewoman, who could only shrug. \"There are tales of ghosts reliving their last moments here on Old Town Road, Summer.\" Sadly, she said. \"You may have just witnessed one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light dimmed again, I found myself facing Dad, and I immediately embraced him, crying my eyes out. \"Please don't let me vanish again!\" Wailing, I begged. \"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I know you are the real detective!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad returned my embrace, but surprised me upon saying, \"Jay Jay... what happened to turn you into a girl?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, I pushed myself away from Dad, only to find that the man was not my father, as he had Mom's hair and eyes! Terrified, I looked around to find that my friends were now boys. \"Izzy...

He had me there, I won't lie. \"I guess I didn't think about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't. But you'd better start. The consequences of thinking about it now are far less severe than coming up with something on the fly. And while we're on the subject: I'd better ask for your car keys. If I were still in a cruiser, I'd notice a car that seemed to be getting around without a driver, especially if it was obeying the rules of the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother good point. \"I'll get them later.\" Turning to Izzy and Mina, I said, \"Guess I'll be bumming rides from you guys, until we can get me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll all get to the bottom of this, JJ,\" Dad consoled me. \"But it won't be just your show.

I had to wait by every door for someone who was either going in or out, lest someone ask why the doors were opening and closing by themselves. Luckily, a smoker got me in, and my work began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I approached the lab, I began keeping an eye out for any security measures that went above and beyond. I had no idea what the burglar had told anybody, after all, so I didn't know if they knew he wasn't alone in there. So far, though, the only thing out of the ordinary was yours truly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I got to the lab, and I saw that they had installed a keypad entry system. <i>Not a problem,</i> I thought. <i>I'll just wait for someone to come in, and they'll give me the access code for when I come back.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a good while, but a woman finally came to the lab and punched in the code. As I slipped in after her, I committed the code to memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, my eye was drawn to the cages. When I was there before, I had seen the cages, but they had looked empty. Now, each cage held a mouse. When did they get these?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the scientist began checking the cages. \"No change in opacity,\" she sighed, then made a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it hit me: the mice were invisible, just as I was. And, just as I could see myself, the mice were visible to me, now. Taking out my phone, I recorded video of the mice. The image on the screen confirmed that they were invisible. This might be important later, especially as the lab was working on a way to restore their visibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo absorbed was I in my own thoughts, that I almost missed it when the scientist left the lab. But I managed to slip out, and, waiting for other people at the doors again, I slowly made my way back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got to the rendezvous point, Izzy was there, whistling the signal. Even from 50 feet away, I could see her sigh with relief when I returned it.

Honey,... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need evidence.\" Firmly, Dad interrupted. \"A short video is not enough.\" He turned in my direction. \"We need one of those lab mice, so we have something to collaborate any claims when we eventually bring this into the light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best, Daddy.\" softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled. \"That's my brave girl.\" He sighed. \"I've done some digging of my own, called in a few favors from other precincts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find?\" Curious, Frank Jr. asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The novel, <i>The Invisible Man</i>, by H. G. Wells, was based upon the notes of a real person named Dr. Hawley Griffin.\" Darkly, Dad said. \"Some agency had acquired those notes, and started Project Griffin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Named after the man who created the original formula.\" Softly, I said. \"What else did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you had learned the hard way, they had a breakthrough.\" Serious, Dad said. \"Other than that, all the other precincts are just as clueless as we are.\" His face turned dark. \"There is one other matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the novel, Dr. Griffin went completely insane.\" Serious, Dad replied. \"It was a side effect of the formula he took.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Dr. Griffin drank the formula.\" Pointing out, Frank Jr. said. \"JJ was splashed with the stuff, so what does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not certain.\" Sighing, Dad said. \"All I am saying is JJ needs to keep her mental health in mind.\" He turned serious, \"We can't see her, so it will be harder to spot any abnormalities in her behavior. JJ has to come to us if she notices anything out of the ordinary about herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, you're scaring me.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't leave anything to chance, honey.\" Serious, Dad said. \"Honestly, this scares me too, more than you might think.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have ten minutes to conduct your investigation before students start trickling in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten minutes should be more than enough time.\" Nodding, Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard nodded back, and opened the door for Dad.

The guard punched in the code, which I noticed was different from before. <i>They're changing the code each day.</i> Disturbed, I thought. <i>Someone really wants to keep this a secret.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow glad Dad ran cover for me, I slipped through as Dad again \"heard a noise,\" and waited for the door to close and the guard to turn his back. Dad began taking pictures, which was my cue to take one of the mice from the cages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing vinyl gloves, I moved to one of the cages, to find the mouse backing away from me in terror, shaking uncontrollably at the very sight of me. Knowing I couldn't waste time, I moved to the next cage, to get the same reaction. Finally, a mouse came to the door upon seeing me, and I slowly opened the door. The mouse was cute, all white with blue eyes, pink toes and a pink tail. I gently picked it up and slipped it into a hamster pet carrier we purchased on the way to the university, then gently closed the cage door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mission complete.</i> Smiling, I thought. <i>Time to take this little fellow home.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tapped Dad on the shoulder, telling him I was done, and he wrapped up his job of gathering evidence and knocked on the lab door. \"I'm all done here.\" Calmly, he said. \"This should be enough to close my case on my end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are others running an investigation?\" Curious, Don asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad shrugged. \"The feds seem interested.\" Calmly, he said. \"Only that's their issue, My concern is just with the robbery, as the one we caught said he wasn't alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon nodded, then escorted Dad (and me) back to his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get the mouse?\" Once on our way, Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" smiling, I said. \"He's a cute little guy.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is it the fact you're more relaxed, now that you aren't a lab mouse anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured that had to be at least part of it, and decided to try to find ways to relax myself. The first thing I tried was soft music, then sound ambience. Although it did help me to relax, I still couldn't see myself in the mirror.

It gave me hope, since she had said the same thing before buying us the equipment that brought <i>The J Files</i> to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come up to my room, guys,\" I said. \"There's something I've gotta show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were in my room, it didn't take long for the girls to figure out what I wanted to show them. \"Where'd you get the mouse?\" Mina asked. \"And how does this one get along with the invisible one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Peekaboo, right there,\" I replied, taking him out of his cage. \"Turns out, he can make himself visible.\" I put him in Izzy's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeekaboo sniffed, and Izzy screamed. \"Where'd he go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right there,\" I replied, \"in your hands.\" I took one of her fingers, and had her pet him. \"Like I said, he knows how to make himself visible. The folks at the lab just never saw it.\" I collected Peekaboo from Izzy's hand and brought him to Mina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Mina's hands, Peekaboo again became visible. \"How does he do it?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think,\" I replied, \"he makes himself visible when he feels safe and calm, something he never felt at the lab. I don't know why he turned invisible on Izzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Izzy said. \"He smelled my cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So peace of mind might be the key,\" Mina said. \"Have you tried it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried soft music and gentle sounds. No luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things are just for the background,\" Mina said, \"while you do something else.

My next lab shipment will be to East College; they're expanding their science wing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the tip, loyal listener.\" Serious, Dad said. \"You have done your part to put the brakes on corruption and crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a big 10-4, Phantom Detective.\" Serious, the driver said. \"Glad to hear you back on the air. We gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad cut off the mic, then turned in my direction, smiling. \"We now have an idea where they will strike next.\" Softly, he said. \"We need to get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not making me sit this one out?\" surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in too deep for me to push you away now.\" Calmly, Dad said. \"Let's go get the bad guys, and put an end to their stealing spree.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When the maintenance engineer makes his move, we follow the signal, and catch all or most of the gang red-handed. I think we've got this, Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no such thing as a foolproof plan, JJ,\" he replied. \"Anything could go wrong between planning and execution.\" He smiled. \"But it looks like everything we can control is under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we waited. To help us stay frosty, Dad played solitaire, while I went over Mina's notes for the next podcast. There were to be updates on previous cases, as well as a new mystery that a supporter on Patreon had tipped us off on. Now, however, I was adding a personal message, after the one that Dad had given on <i>Ham Radio Mysteries</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the plan went into action. The GPS showed that the dummy shipment was underway, right on schedule. For now, all we could do was watch and wait.</span></div></div>",
