            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two went into the depths of the shop. \"Why do you always have to be like that, Jimmy? He was just trying to be friendly and make a sale. You're always acting like you're twelve and not twenty-three.\" Angela, his twenty-one year old girlfriend asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy grabbed her arm, hard and snarled, \"Listen! I'm not gonna take any shit from some old fart who can't do more than sit on his ass and get his jollies watching the young girls playing dress-up. Now, I said we were gonna do a party this Halloween and we are? You got a problem with that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let go and she whimpered, \"No, I-I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Let's pick out something and get the hell outta here. This place gives me the creeps.\" Angela rubbed her arm as soon as Jimmy turned away from her. In truth, she wanted to leave him, but was terrified of his violent temper. She never knew when he would explode, but he often did and when it happened, she always paid for it, one way or another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wandered around the store for some time, seeing aisles marked as <i>Classic Monsters, Mythological Monsters, Cartoon Characters</i> and <i>Anime Characters</i> before finding a section labeled <i>Couples</i>. \"J-Jimmy?\" He turned and she backed up, fearing a slap. This time, he merely looked at her. She asked, \"Do you want to try down this aisle?\" She pointed, her hand shaking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy smiled. He had this one trained pretty well. She wasn't completely broken yet, but she would be soon and he'd leave her then. It was how he got his rush, making a girl so she couldn't function without him, then leaving them broken by the wayside to wither and die while he moved on to his next challenge. For him, it was all about the challenge of taking some uppity bitch and bringing them down to where they belonged, scraping along in the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe motioned for her to go first and watched her move slowly down the aisle. Maybe he'd take her back here. She'd hate it, having him take her and no where to clean herself afterward. She'd hate him for doing it even while her body enjoyed the rush sex always brought to it. He smiled to himself as she looked at the costumes. Finally, she pulled out two costumes. He chuckled as he looked at her choices. One, his, had to be Popeye. The outfit looked as if it had come right out of the cartoon show. Hers was Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. It even had a tiny stuffed Jeep hanging on one sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are good,\" he said, watching as she breathed a sigh of relief. \"You know, I've always wanted to watch Popeye doing Olive. Let's change and do it here. The old man will never know,\" he added as she looked worriedly toward the front of the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the costumes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" he snapped, watching her cower back, \"People do strange shit in these things all the time. Now, get your ass changed!\" Angela stripped and struggled into her costume. Angela had fairly small breasts, but as she recalled, Olive was totally flat-chested. Finally, she had gotten into the costume. Jimmy was scowling, taking in the too short pants and too big shirt. But, he had to admit, he did like the corncob pipe and the cap. He was looking into a mirror he'd found and noticed the shirt wasn't as big as he'd originally thought. The pants were getting longer, too. He looked over at Angela and saw what little breasts she had had were gone now. She was taller and very skinny. And, the Jeep blinked at him as if it were alive. He closed his eyes and shook his head. This had to be a dream. When he looked again, the doll was just that, a doll sewn onto the arm of a costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay baby, pull that dress up and bend over. I'm gonna give it to you right here and now!\" His voice had changed, becoming rougher and sounding like he'd been chewing gravel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" she said shrilly, sounding like the Olive he remembered from the show. \"It's not right and you can't keep doing this to me, Jimmy. I won't let you do this any more!\" she rebuked him even as her hands went to cover her mouth, her face showing shocked horror at what she'd said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jimmy could do more than draw back his arm, the Jeep sprang from Olive's arm onto his chest. \"W-What?\" he yelped in surprise as the Jeep bit him with amazingly sharp teeth. Jimmy began backpedaling as quickly as he could, trying to get away from the tiny creature. Before he knew what had happened, a black circle had formed under him and he fell into it, the Jeep going with him. Jimmy landed hard, grunting as the air was knocked out of his lungs. By the time he could sit up, he recognized where he was... He was on the Isle of the Goonies. He had to get away. He knew Popeye was supposed to marry the Goonie Princess and if he were caught. He looked up and far away, he could see Angela looking down at him. Even as he watched, the circle grew smaller and smaller, finally disappearing. He had to get away! Not far off, he could hear the shuffle of footsteps as the Goonies came, looking for whoever was on their island. \"No!\" his mind screamed at him. He Had To Get Away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands reached out and took hold of him. He struggled, but was soon overpowered and carried toward the village. He pulled out his can of spinach and gobbled it down. He felt energized and strong again. He broke free and ran toward the shore. Everywhere, Goonies came for him. He ran, fighting through Goonies by the dozens. He ran and still more came for him. And the whole time, all he could think was how he had enjoyed making Angela do things she had hated doing. Now, the roles were reversed and sobbing, he ran for the beach. HE HAD TO GET AWAY!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela walked back up to the front of the shop and handed the old man her costume. \"I don't want this, but the matching Popeye costume is...\" she hesitated, unsure of what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, that does happen sometimes in this shop,\" the old man said soothingly. \"I'll tell you what. You take this coupon and if you decide you'd like a different costume for Halloween, come on back and I'll take twenty percent off the price, but just for you. So, don't come in with a bunch of friends looking for that discount for everyone.\" he smiled and she laughed as she walked out, feeling somehow much better than when the day had started. The old man looked into a small black and white television while Jimmy fought off Goonies. What Jimmy didn't know was Goonies always split into two more Goonies when they were killed. If one died, it was dead; but kill one and you got two goonies. \"Sit on my ass and watch the girls play dress-up? Really Jimmy, I had so hoped for more from you than that.\" He smiled down as he watched Jimmy being dragged back to his wedding with the Goonie Princess.</span></div></div>",

Some in a darkness where there seemed to be moving objects and some allowing him to see in all directions. His head started hurting from all the new visual input. He closed all his eyes and put his hands up to his face to cover his original eyes to find that his nails had grown long, black, and pointed, while attached to hands that were smaller, thinner, and lighter than his hands were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes (all 38 of them) to find his vision was beginning to clear, but he was shocked to find that his new eyes were somehow in a pit of snakes. He panicked when he realized the snakes were on his head and screamed, the scream was a penetrating wail that hurt everyone's ears (except his). He noticed that the scream that came from his lips was a womanly scream and began to realize the horror he had been placed in. He attempted to control one of the snakes on his head to find he could. He moved it to the front of his face to find a woman's face, that wasn't the medusa face he had pictured in his imagination when he purchased the costume. It was actually rather beautiful, but he found that his new fully red eyes were unnerving, and seemed out of place on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought the snakes eyes lower to find a rather busty body attached to his head. His t-shirt and shorts had disappeared, leaving him only in the robe, giving him a rather nice look at his cleavage, his robe hung rather loosely at his shoulders, almost threatening to slip off if he took a wrong step or tilted in the wrong direction. He also notice he felt rather strong, he didn't want to test it out yet, but hoped he could eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lower body was narrower, a small belt hugged the robe tight to his body. Leaving little to the imagination. He also felt the openness between his legs, pausing to linger on the fact of what just happened before one of his snake eyes fell upon Marilyn Monroe, and another set falling on his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a Black Cat costume. I used to worship here when I was a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better get ready for the party tonight,\" Danny said to Tori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You want to see me in this now?\" she said, referring to the Black Cat costume. \"Sure,\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori put her designer sunglasses on as she took her costume into the bathroom. First, Tori took off all of her clothes, excluding her undergarments, then, as she was preparing to put on the catsuit, a manual feel onto the floor. Tori then picked it up and read through it. On one page, it said, \"More comfortable with no clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Tori took off her bra and panties, she then slipped her feet into the legs of the suit, then her arms. Then she slid her hands into the hands of the suit. These \"hands\" were shaped like claws. To finish off the suit, she grabbed the zipper that started at her waist and pulled it up to just below her navel, easily revealing her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she rolled up the legs of her suit to slide on the thigh high boots. These boots had 4 inch tall heels and the boots actually reached up to her mid-thighs. She then rolled down her legs to cover up her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after reading the manual, she attached all of the utilities to the suit in the same fashion as the manual said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided not to put the wig and mask on yet, so she walked out into the living room where Danny still was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sweetheart,\" Tori said to her boyfriend, who then turned around to see this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl::EH::www.superficialdiva.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/sienna-miller-skin-tight-leather-catsuit.jpg&amp;imgrefurl::EH::www.superficialdiva.com/2008/0419/sienna-miller-skin-tight-leather-catsuit-love-it-or-hate-it/&amp;usg=__KmOKEri1PGc44nLnQXos7xKZeZo=&amp;h=503&amp;w=456&amp;sz=63&amp;hl=en&amp;start=0&amp;sig2=DIDH5wwoxhk6bThUyFm0Jw&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnid=-Tk91WXNsS4RDM:&amp;tbnh=126&amp;tbnw=125&amp;ei=OVLGTeWAHNO_tgeIkZyMBA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dcatsuit%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN%26biw%3D1022%26bih%3D539%26tbm%3Disch0%2C105&amp;um=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=124&amp;vpy=65&amp;dur=411&amp;hovh=236&amp;hovw=214&amp;tx=156&amp;ty=104&amp;page=1&amp;ndsp=13&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0&amp;biw=1022&amp;bih=539\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl::EH:...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Danny decided to...</span></div></div>",

She had a cute butt and B cups as well as dirty blond hair that was done in girlish pig-tails. She had her arms around her husband's waist as they approached Babbingtree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings!

One person would be the front with the horse's head and front feet. Another would be the horse's back and would have to bend over, claiming the horse's rear and hide legs. The suit had two zippers for the front and back, for two people it seemed a very tiny fit. Perhaps not for Sarah but maybe for Jon being over six feet. But the costume did intrigue Jon nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That horse costume...\" Jon said,\"Looks interesting, don't you think honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" she said, staring at a witches' pair costumes, \"I guess so...Whatever you want dear.

He could tell that though this was a budding couple, their relationship would not end well. Sarah obeyed her husband's every whim and decision, while Jon remained oblivious to her needs and wants. A good couple would always listen to each others opinions before making a final choice in anything. Instead Jon quickly decided on the horse costume before giving Sarah the chance to see something she wanted.

Halloween was tomorrow and while the children would be busy gathering as much candy as humanly possible, the parents would be doing their best to work off their hangovers from the adult costume parties they attended. Jon was sitting on the couch watching TV while Sarah was busy doing her hair in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,\" He yelled to her. \"We're going to be late! The party starts in an hour and we haven't even tried on the costume yet to make sure it fits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her eyes. \"That's because you've been too busy golfing all week,\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the thing anyway?\" Asked Jon as he stretched on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right where you left it last week, buried under the stack of newspapers on the kitchen table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's her problem...,\" He muttered and he made his way to the horse costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled it from it's tomb of last week's news and held it up to see. Despite having not seen the light of day for a week, it still seemed very clean and soft. He stared into the black horse eyes of the mask, it almost was like he was holding a real horse's head. Sarah came out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dibs on the head part.\" Jon said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear, whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you did your hair if it's just going to get messed up inside of here...You want to go in first? I think the person in the back is supposed to enter the suit before the one in the front does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe costume had come in one of those clear bags, this one was larger than usual so it would hold all the pieces of the horse. The first thing to put on was the pair of hooves meant for the back legs. They looked almost like a pair of fuzzy brown stockings. Jon handed them to Sarah as she removed her pink bath slippers. She sat down and slowly put the first one on. It seemed to fit snugly on her, considering she put it on in no time flat. She motioned for the other one and put that one on very quickly too. She stood up and had to balance herself on the couch's arm. With the horse legs disappearing up her bathrobe she looked almost like a Satyr from Greek legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good...,\" Jon said while blushing slightly. \"What's it like? Are they comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...a little like walking in high heels.\" She responded as she took several baby steps forward. \"These are so fuzzy and comfy though...I might even wear them to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon laughed and took up his own pair of horse legs to wear. He kicked his shoes off into the wall, much to his disapproving wife's dismay, and slowly began to put them on. Unlike Sarah, who's legs were small and delicate, Jon had large clown feet and muscular legs. This of course meant he had a much more difficult time putting on the horse stockings, so much so that Sarah had to come over to give him a hand before he hurt himself. Eventually he too was sporting two satyr like legs and was wobbling around the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are pretty cool!\" He tried wiggling his toes but found them to be wedged between the leg and hoof of the costume. \"What part do we put on next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to the bag...It's the body then the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body was like a large brown bag with three holes in it. One for the head of the horse, and two for the bodies of the wearers. This of course meant Sarah would have to bend over slightly while Jon got to stand upright. Jon entered his hole first, it was very hot and muggy inside the suit but it was also soft and furry like a real horse. He rested the body of the costume on his shoulders while he put his hands to the side to make the costume look convincing. Sarah entered next, she squirmed her way inside the small opening as the hole went up to her horse legs. When Jon looked back she had completely disappeared into the suit. He tapped where she would be only to feel a small slap on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...Honey, are you okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmf Mmmf! (Yeah fine!)\" She mumbled in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you breathe alright in there? I mean we're going to be like this all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmf mmff! Mff Mf Mmmf Mmmme! (Don't worry! I'll be fine honey!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged and reached for the horse mask. It almost looked like someone had decapitated a poor stallion for the costume's head. Jon brought the opening to his nose and smelled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...,\" He expected it to smell like musky sweat. \"Odd...smells just like oats and hay. Well here goes nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the horse head over his own. His vision blacked out slightly until he found the eye holes. He saw a brown and white snout in front of his face and laughed. He turned to face the mirror to see what they looked like. The reflection was that of a very convincing horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear you should see this...I mean, wow. We look great! Just like a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon felt weird all of a sudden. Like someone had turned up the heat in the room. Sarah seemed to feel it as well and wobbling in the back of the suit. Jon tried to reach up and pull the mask off to get some air, but he found that his arms wouldn't respond. He felt really sticky, like he was melting within the costume. Sweat trickled all over his body as he shuffled in place in an attempt to circulate air. Nothing seemed to cool him down, it felt like his arms were caught in the suit. Suddenly, something very hot poked him in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Dear is that you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reply from his wife as whatever it was covered his whole back like hot wax. His whole body was seething in heat but he couldn't lift a finger to take the suit off. It felt like his whole body was melting! Oddly enough though, while he couldn't move his arms at all he could move his legs much better. Balancing became easier as well. Jon decided that whatever was happening, he needed to find help quickly! He took a step forward, thinking he would have to drag his wife to the door, but was surprised when the back legs of the costume moved with the front legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have turned around to see what was happening back there, but a sharp pain in the front of his face caused him to double over. It felt like his nose was on fire and melting away. The last thing he remembered before he blacked out was the feeling that his nose was stretching out to fill the snout of the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes after Jon and Sarah donned the suit, there was a full grown brown and white mare lying in the middle of their living room unconscious. A knock on the door awoken it from its slumber. The person who was physically in control of the horse's movements was...</span></div></div>",

And what the hell happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon opened his eyes and was greeted with the cold hard floor of his living room. He looked around in front of him, looking for any signs of his wife. His painful headache caused him to forget what had just happened less than an hour ago. He spied a clock which read \"7:51\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the heck is Sarah? He continued to think to himself. \"Isn't it almost time for the costume party? We gotta hurry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to move his arms to lift himself up, but instead was greeted with a loud clomp. \"What the..?\" He looked down and saw that where his hands would be were two black hooves. Brown hair was covering his arms. At first he thought it was just the costume, but he couldn't feel his fingers move when he tried to wiggle them. He felt a slap on his butt. Straining his neck turning around, there was a black tail waving around on it's own. The tail was connected to a large mass of brown fur which connected to...him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!?\" He screamed. Instead loud neighing came from his mouth. He suddenly remembered what had happened. The costume had changed Sarah and him into a horse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah!\" He said to himself as he tried to see if she was still in the rear part of the costume. Without arms, the only way to feel back there was using his teeth. He bit into the furry horse butt and felt a sharp pain. Blood began to ooze out from where he had bitten himself. Sarah couldn't be...She couldn't be gone, could she?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another knock on the door. A cold sweat came over Jon as the knob slowly turned. Whoever was knocking decided to come in! What would they think if they saw a live horse in the middle of an apartment! Jon tried to get up and hide but he was not yet accustomed to his new body and could barely even move. The person at the door was...</span></div></div>",

Babbingtree waved his fingers and Jon felt himself rise off the ground, standing shakily on all four feet. Babbingtree then wave is hand and a cup mug from their cabinet flew into his hands. Hot dark brown liquid filled the cup, and Babbingtree sat himself on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jon Spade. I am going to answer your questions as best as I can. Let's start with your first. As you may have guessed, you and your wife have merged into a body of a horse. I did this using the costume you donned mere minutes ago. You are in the body of a mare now. Sarah is still with you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit! She disappeared when we transformed! I don't feel her there anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that brings me to my reason for doing this. You see, from the moment you entered my store I could tell where your relationship would eventually end. And it would not end well, mind you. You could call this predicament...a test of sorts. Your wife is still with you, but you can't hear her. It's no different than how you normally behave around her. So often, she would beg to have a say in things for once. But you would always shut her out, you did what YOU wanted to do. You will only hear her voice again and return to normal when you discover yourself and understand her better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?! A wizard?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wizard? How primitive. I am merely a costume vender with a PhD in Magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon glared at Babbingtree, thinking he was taunting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Mister Spade. You can walk out of this two ways. You can do it my way, and complete this test. Live a long and healthy relationship. Or you I can return you both to normal right now, and you risk everything. I'm not going to force you through this. Lessons are only taught when the student willingly listens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon thought for a moment.</span></div></div>",

You raise an eyebrow and say, \"Right, this wedding dress has to made for a woman that's like triple D or something. There is no way I could fill that\". You say that so Jeff won't get embarrased. He doesn't want the shop keeper to know he'll be the one wearing the dress. \"Babbingtree keeps smiling and says, \"It's actually an F cub and I think that you'll find that when you put it on you will fill it nicely\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jeff and you look at each other and shrug. You head up to pay for the costumes. At the counter Jeff holds the costume up against him as if to wear it. He does this to tease you some but Babbingtree see it and frowns. \"Sir, under no circumstances should you put on your wife's costume. The effect would be hard to reverse\", he says. You have no idea what he means by the effect would be hard to reverse. You don't inquire and finish paying for the costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The whole way home you think about Jeff in that Bride's dress and you as the Groom. You try to remember where you put your strap-on at. You hope Jeff is up to taking it up the ass like a good bride.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tJeff holds up the dress, takes it off the hanger and gets ready to put it on. There is a little thong that came with it. He slips on the thong. It compresses his male anatomy against his body, as the string goes up his crack. Next he slips his massive legs through, and then he pulls the top up. It\u2019s very tight around his muscular abs and gets bigger around the chest. It is so tight he can\u2019t do up the zipper. \u201cHow am I supposed to zip this up?\u201d he whispers to himself. Next he puts on the white stilettos. They are way to small for his large feet. And lastly he puts on the straight blonde wig. Laughing to himself, he looks in the mirror on the living room wall across from him. He looked so funny! The high heels made his calves, thighs, and butt tight, showing his defined muscles. The back of the dress was so short it is showing most of his butt off and the bottom of his balls. The stomach is tight against his abs. Low cut and strapless, the top of the dress goes to the bottom of his nipples, as his chest hair is showing. But since the suit is made for a size F woman it is not tight. You walk into the room as he is standing there. \u201cNice honey! I love it! But aren\u2019t you supposed to be a woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs and positions the wig; a tingle shoots through his body, starting from his head down to his toes. Looking down at his feet that begin growing smaller. The hair on his toes begins to disappear, as does the hair on his legs. His calves shrink, along with his massive thighs. They are slowly growing skinny and small. He feels his penis and testicles begin to change. His pubic hair is disappearing. His abs become lean as his stomach grows skinnier. The hair on his stomach and chest is disappearing. His arms are changing into skinny, but defined. His back is shrinking, as the muscles are growing smaller. His 5 o\u2019clock shadow is sinking into the skin. The wig suddenly feels tight on his head and the hair attaches to his scalp. The transformation is very slow though and is quite painful. After 5 minutes his man legs are now slender and skinny with no hair. His feet fit perfectly into the high heels. You stand there totally interested in this transformation. He is now sitting on the couch. Next his torso shrinks. His rib cage is popping and cracking as it shrinks along with his muscles. His arms are becoming sleek and defined. 8 minutes later he is now extremely skinny. It looks funny though because he still has armpit and chest hair. Now his neck is becoming little, his 5 o\u2019clock shadow is disappearing, and his face is changing. 6 minutes later his whole body is feminine looking. His whiskers are gone, and his eyebrows are perfectly plucked and skinny. Next is the most painful part though. His penis and testicles start changing. He grabs them as heat flows through his groin area. Slowly they ascend upwards into his pelvis. Nothing is there anymore. Now his chest begins to inflate. His pecks grow out, becoming large and full. They grow till the top of the dress is tight against them, squeezing them cause his chest. His butt then inflates also, becoming large and round. After 11 minutes he is fully transformed. The pain and heat is gone. He slowly rises and walks to the mirror. He cant\u2019 believe his eyes! He\u2019s actually a woman! A very hott woman that is; skinny, but with defined muscles, a very nice butt, and a very large chest. \u201cThis is unbelievable!\u201d he exclaims as he runs his hands over his body slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get excited now to put your costume on!   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How do you feel?\" Jeff, still checking his new body out in the mirror, is at a loss for words. Finally he says \"It's.......it's amazing Chris.\" He says with a sensual female voice. \" I feel...kinda horny.\" He ads with a sly smile on his face. \"Aren't you gonna put your costume on?\" You nod and pull out the Tux. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you slip on the boxers, which hung comfortably on your ass but seem a little spacey between your legs. Next is the shirt, you put it on and start buttoning, which goes fairly easy until you get to your breasts. You hold your breath and finish the last buttons. The pants come on fairly easy, but now you notice that pulling the pants over your ass requires some effort. You barely manage to close the zipper and hope you won't rip them before you're done. The shoes are a couple of sizes too big, making you feel like a duck as you try to move around. After you've put on the jacket, you check for a tie and to your relief you discover it's a clip-on. You take one last look at yourself in the mirror before you put on the short black wig. \"Hmm, almost there handsome.\" Jeff winks at her. You can see her biting her new plump sexy lips in anticipation. \"Here I go, gorgeous.\"  You take a deep breath and put your hair in the wig, making sure it's completely covered. As soon as you've got the wig firmly on your scalp, you can feel the change starting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight tingle travels from the top of your head all the way down your spine, lingers in your groin, and then shoots down to your toes. You sit down in anticipation, expecting it to hurt like hell. In fact, you're seated just in time to experience the agonizing cramps as bones in your feet and muscles in your leg start to rearrange and expand. You can feel new layers of muscles forming in your calves and your upper legs, and get goosebumps as your ass contracts and becomes more muscular. You stroke a hand over your legs, tracing the lines of well-defined muscles. Suddenly a powerful itch in your groin comes up. You lay your hand on it and feel a bulge expanding under your fingers. In the meanwhile, your body continues changing upward. Your once soft, smooth belly is replaced by a firm six-pack. Your breasts, who were pressing tightly against the shirt, now make way for two rock-hard pecks and an expanded chest. You flex your shoulders and notice the jacket seems almost tailor made for you. Once the pain from the transformation is receded, you stumble over to the mirror and look at your new reflection. Tracing a hand over your now very masculine jawline you notice tiny black hairs protruding from your skin. You lift your chin to inspect your  neck, and to your satisfaction you even find an adams apple protruding from your throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forget everything though when you feel Jeff's hands stroking your body from behind. \"Ooh Chris. I don't know what's happening to me. I feel so horny...\" You turn around and gaze into her eyes. \"It's ok, babe. I'll take care of you.\" It's funny, although your first thought was to kiss her, you gently take her by the shoulders and move her down on her knees. \"But first show me what you can do with your mouth, little bunny.\" At first she seems a little hesitant. \"But I've never given a blowjob before, Tiger. Where do I start.\" She looks up pleading. You sigh at the drop dead sexy look she is giving you right now, and your pants are almost too small to contain your erection. \"Here, let me help you.\" You unzip your fly and let your pants and underwear drop to your ankles. She gasps as she sees your fully erect member. \"Ohh Chris, you're so big!\" You start jerking it, it was a couple of inches bigger than Jeff's cock used to be. \"Hmmm yeah babe, now tell me you want to suck my cock.\" She looks up at you again and giggle's. \"I want to suck your cock, tiger. I want to taste it soo bad.\" She moans. You firmly grab her by the back of the head and push your member between her lips, which she parts willingly. At first she moves a little clumsy, and more than once you can feel her teeth brushing your shaft. Gradually she starts to get into the rhythm and seems to enjoy sucking your large rod. You can feel an unfamiliar pressure building up in your dick, making your abs spasm involuntary. Finally, you can't hold your load anymore. She anticipates your orgasm and moves her head back, letting your cum spray all over her face and boobs. \"That was amazing, babe.\" You say exhausted but content. She just smiles up at you, happy to see you enjoyed her first blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A young lesbian couple enter the store. But who are they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Cindy and Lauren, two Juniors at the local high school. They're getting ready for their first outing as a couple: the Halloween semi-formal. Cindy is a tall, leggy blonde with brown eyes and a slim figure. She has an independent spirit and likes to bring others out of their shells. Lauren is short and petite, but with an impressive bust size for her frame. She has long black hair and blue eyes, and is normally shy, but retains passionate feelings about certain topics; one of which is her dream to one day be tall enough to become a fashion model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Allison and Kira, two College students. Allison is 22 years old, 5'10\" tall, and has red hair and green eyes. She has C-cup breasts and a vibrant and outgoing personality, and is excessively obsessed with anime and manga. She met Kira back in September at the first meeting of the College's anime club. For her, it was love at first sight. Allison is in her third year studying nursing. Kira is 18 years old, and a freshman at the College, studying Pre-Med. Something of a rare specimen, Kira is an asian girl, 5'7\" tall, with white hair, red eyes, and DD-cup breasts. Kira comes from a strict family, and has a shy, submissive personality as a result. Even though she was able to satisfy her parents' expectations of her, she longed for more. She escaped to fantasy worlds through the manga she read in what little time she was able to cultivate for herself. She fell in love with Allison because being around her gave her hope that one day she could be like her. A free spirit. But for now, she hadn't told her parents about her beloved Ali, or her preference towards the fairer sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Miranda and Natasha, two young women in their prime. Miranda is 28 years old, 5'9\" tall, with black hair, hazel eyes, and a curvy figure. She's been out of law school for a while now, having passed the bar exam and working in a successful firm. All her student loans have been paid off, and she lives in a 2 bedroom apartment in a decent neighbourhood. She puts up a somewhat dominant front to most, but those who get past that exterior often find her quite the opposite. She has a private stash of bondage gear, and she loves to be tied up with it. Natasha is a 24 year old russian girl, 5'8\" tall, with curly red hair and blue eyes. She has a knockout figure, with D-cup breasts, and a toned belly. She had to work as a stripper for two years to re-pay the people that had helped her get to North America, but that was all behind her now. She was still young, beautiful, and ready to live the american dream. She has been living with her roommate Miranda for 13 months now. After a few years speaking english, her accent had mostly faded, but there were still traces of it. She now ran a small dance studio downtown, which ranged from teaching ballet to younger girls, to teaching more exotic dances to women. Miranda and Natasha tease each other a lot, play games that get especially intimate when alcohol is involved, and sometimes wake up in compromising positions, but although they were both what one would call openly bi-sexual, they had yet to realize the depths of their feelings and acknowledge themselves as being a couple.</span></div></div>",

She rounded herself down to two choices. One of which is a sort of maid's dress designed for two, and you may be able to make some adjustments for your differing heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other idea, Cindi would clearly enjoy, is a scarlet dress made for two, but looked much like it would fit a twin pair of Jessica Rabbits.

Her large breasts bulged out, while the top seemed to adhere to her narrow waist. The skirt was just long enough to be cute instead of slutty, and she wore white knee-high stockings with brown school shoes that had been altered to add  a 3\" heel. Allison had taken care to apply her make up perfectly. When she had asked her why she insisted on doing it, the other girl simply replied \"Because you're worth taking care of\". Kira was appreciative of this, just like she appreciated all the things Ali did for her. She loved how Allison made her look.

The Navi costume was simple and elegant. It had light blue 5\" heels, pale blue stockings, a breezy, shimmery, short skirt, a blue bra-shaped top encrusted in ornate blue gems of different colours, a pair of ice blue fairy wings, and a long-haired blue wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" asked Allison</span></div></div>",

Once inside, she closed the door and laid out all the different pieces of her costume. Analyzing each individual piece, she realized there were a couple of pieces that she hadn't been able to see when Allison held up the costume. In addition to everything else, there was a thin, brown leather corset, as well as a choker made of soft brown leather. Face red as a firetruck, Kira began to remove her schoolgirl costume. She cursed Allison for not letting her wear panties or a bra with her schoolgirl costume, since this costume didn't come with any. Once that was done, she unbraided her hair, before pinning it up so she could put the wig on. With the wig firmly in place, she proceeded to wrap the corset around her waist. She pushed through the strain of lacing up and tightening the corset as her waist shrunk inch by inch, causing her already large chest to bulge. Satisfied with the tightness, Kira knotted the laces and collected the next piece: the white tights. She sat down on the pile of clothing on the chair made by her old costume, and slipped her legs into the tights. Standing up so as to pull the tights up the rest of the way, she found that they wouldn't go on properly without riding up into her ass and crotch, giving her a visible came toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope the tunic hides that at least a little bit.' thought Kira with dread, as she would be wearing this in public, but also a hint of excitement, as Allison would see her in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collected the white shirt and slipped into it. Once it was smoothed out, it fit her like a second skin. She could see the lines of the corset showing through, but expected the tunic to cover it. Next up was the boots. Kira sat down and slowly squirmed her feet into the tight leather containers. Upon standing up, she was amazed at how comfortable and well broken-in these boots were, even though they didn't look old or worn. Next came the tunic. She put the green fabric over her head and pulled her blonde hair through the top. She looked in the mirror, and while it showed significantly more cleavage than she would ever show in public of her own volition, it also hid her camel toed crotch, which she was thankful for. Next she closed the slim brown belt around her waist and set her eyes on the last few items. First she tied back her blonde hair so she could apply the costume glue and add the elven ears without incident. While that dried, she opened up the small makeup kit that had come with the costume. On the inside of the lid, there was an image of the recommended makeup application, which showed pink lips, rosy cheeks, and alluring black mascara and eyeliner. There was also a set of blue coloured contacts inside. Once she had applied the makeup as instructed and put in the contacts, the glue was dry, so she let her hair down. She stared in awe at the near stranger that looked back at her in the mirror as she fastened the buckles on the leather gauntlets. So close to finished, she jumped when she heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You almost done?\" came Allison's voice from the other side of the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost.\" replied Kira, as she pulled on Link's green hat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira smiled softly as she opened the door for her girlfriend. The two women stared at each other in awe for a moment. Allison wore the clothing even better than Kira had imagined. The long blue hair fell wildly around her face, giving her a look of primal alien beauty. She had blue painted lips, blue dusted cheeks, blue eye makeup, and her cheeks, cleavage, arms and thighs seemed to be sporadically covered in tiny blue crystals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I- wow.\" said Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira blushed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else do you have to put on?\" asked Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira collected the choker and presented it to the beautiful fairy. Allison stroked the soft leather before gently closing her hair around it. Her eyes met Kira's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira responded by wordlessly turning around and lifting her hair away from her neck. Allison stepped up behind her so close that Kira could feel her breasts against her back. As the leather of the choker brushed against her neck, Kira felt safe. She knew that with Allison beside her, she could do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it too tight?\" asked Allison, as she fastened the choker shut<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't. Allison's loving hands had managed the perfect blend of firmness and comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's perfect. Thank you.\" replied Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

She was laying on a pile of what seemed to be gigantic leaves. She stood up and observed her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This must be one big tree.' she thought to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit her. Where was Kira?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to panic, and ran out the entrance... Into open air. She found herself doing a Wile Coyote pause in mid-air, but soon realized that she wasn't falling. She turned her head to investigate a soft whirring noise behind her. What she found was a pair of wings that were attached to her back flapping like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another look at herself. She was still wearing the Navi costume, but now her skin seemed to glow blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Navi, where art though? Heed the call of the Great Deku Tree'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison realized what was happening. She had literally become Navi, and was playing her role in the Ocarina of Time plot. She quickly zipped off in search of the Great Deku Tree. While the wise, sentient tree spoke to her, all Allison could think about was how absolutely tiny she was currently when compared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Dost thou understand, Navi?'</b> asked the Great Deku Tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, Great Deku Tree, sir.\" replied Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Then go. Go find the girl without a fairy.'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison didn't need to be told twice. She flew to Kokiri Village as fast as her wings would carry her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kira found herself standing in a field at night. There was a castle and drawbridge in front of her with a great expanse of field behind her. Looking at herself, she realized she wasn't 18 anymore. She had de-aged 7 years, and as a result had less outstanding features. From what she could tell, she was shorter by more than a foot. The outfit she was wearing had changed as well. She was now wearing only a tunic, belt, hat and boots. The tunic fit her smaller chest and fell a few inches short of her knees at the hem. Her self analysis was cut short when a white horse nearly trampled her. The horse had two passengers. A silver haired woman and a young blonde girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira realized where she was. She turned around and came face to face with Ganondorf, riding his black steed. The villainous wizard raised a hand and energy gathered in it. Just as he threw it at her, she heard a voice call for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'KIRA!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and found herself staring at a wooden ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God, you're okay.\" came Allison's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked around the room for her girlfriend, but couldn't see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm over here.\" said Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention to the weight pressing down on her boobs. She found Allison, but she was 3 inches tall and glowing blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison? You're so... small.\" said Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could say the same about you, little miss hero.\" replied Allison with a smirk, as she pinched the exposed skin on one of Kira's boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira just blushed in response. She sat up, and Allison took to the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we've both played this game before, but we probably can't rely on that knowledge. At least not completely. On the other hand though, we aren't limited by game parameters, so we can have some serious fun.\" said Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem very... calm about all this.\" noted Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this is amazing! To say this is a once in a lifetime opportunity doesn't do it justice.\" said Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do have a point.\" said Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to have an amazing adventure then?\" asked Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they left the treehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing out, they saw a familiar face running towards them, waving. Kira waved back, and started to climb down the ladder. Allison watched as Saria stood at the base of the ladder, staring up as Kira descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh, wouldn't have pegged Saria for a perv. This will come in useful later.' thought Allison with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Link, it's so good to see you?\" asked Saria<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it is.\" replied Allison, snickering<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria looked up and saw Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Link, you got a fairy! That's wonderful. I knew this day would come.\" said Saria<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is A-, I mean, this is Navi.\" said Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lovely to meet you, Navi. Congratulations, Link. I have some chores to do, but I'll see you around.\" said Saria before running off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like someone has an admirer.\" commented Allison as they walked up the hill towards the hiding place of the Kokiri sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saria, really?\" asked Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yupp. She just stood there looking up your tunic while you climbed down the ladder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira's cheeks flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This gives me an idea though.\" said Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked at the fairy girl curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call it Link's Lesbian Harem Plan. Or LLHP for short.\" she proclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira facepalmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it.\" said Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the small tunnel, and Kira got on her knees to crawl inside. But not before Allison flew down her shirt and settled in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" hissed Kira as she crawled forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying activities with my girlfriend befitting the body of a three inch tall sprite.\" replied Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira evaded the slow rolling boulder and easily collected the Kokiri sword. She strapped the blade to her back and made her way back to Kokiri Village. It only took 15 minutes to gather enough rupees to purchase the Deku Shield on sale at the shop. Then it was time to face Mido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I wanted to let you pass, you'd die without a sword and shield... which you have. I still don't want to let you through.\" said Mido<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complaint noted, now move.\" ordered Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMido grumbled his little narcissistic mutterings to himself as he walked out of the way. With smiles on their faces, Kira and Allison continued. With singular strokes of<br>\r\nher sword, Kira cut down the deku babas on the path to the Deku Tree. The Deku Tree told them about how he was dying, and they needed to kill the parasites inhabiting him. Honestly they just tuned him out for the most part, until he opened his mouth and they were able to get to work. Kira crossed the room and climbed the vines to reach the second floor. Unlike the game Navi, Allison stayed quiet to let Kira focus. Kira collected the dungeon map and took out the deku scrub with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you fall from a high ledge, you can roll to avoid fall damage. But it won't work if the ledge is really high.\" advised the scrub, before disappearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira entered the next room, which contained a floating platform and a chest on a far ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, drop down and climb up the vines.\" advised Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you can use the platform to get back to the door.\" said Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... actually a good idea.\" said Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collected the Slingshot from the chest and used the platform to cross the gap as it crumbled beneath her feet. Once she had killed the skulltulas on the vine wall, she was able to reach the third floor. Deciding not to bother getting the compass, she killed one of the skulltulas guarding the ledge and jumped off. She broke through the webbing that covered the whole in the 1st floor and fell into the water in the basement. Several predictably challenging rooms later, and she found herself standing at the door to the Boss chambers. Inside, the giant arachnid Queen Gohma dropped from the ceiling. Kira quickly caught her in the eye with a deku nut, stunning her, and proceeded to slash her in the eye. Gohma regained her senses after a few slashes and attempted to retreat to the ceiling. But a slingshot round to the eye dropped her back down to the floor, where Kira finished her off. A heart container appeared, and when she picked it up, Kira felt a surge of energy fill her. She stepped into the column of light that appeared, and they were transported back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Deku Tree told them all the things they already knew about the upcoming darkness. So they took the Kokiri Emerald and set out for Hyrule castle. They ignored Mido and kept walking. They reached the bridge, and found Saria waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I always knew this day would come. Please, take this Ocarina. And remember, I would do absolutely anything for you. Anything.\" said Saria, before running back into the forest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I get the feeling that she really meant ANYTHING?\" asked Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because she would. Just wait until we're older again. She can be the kinky one in LLHP.\" said Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this again.\" moaned Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the entrance to Hyrule Field, they encountered the most annoying owl in existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, young traveller-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira shot him with the slingshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira shot him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'm leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it weird that I was a little turned on by that?\" asked Allison<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira rolled her eyes and started walking. They moved quickly enough that they got past the drawbridge before sunset. They didn't bother with the marketplace; they just headed straight for Hyrule Castle. Kira already knew they wouldn't be able to get through the front gate, so instead they approached the vine wall. There was a ginger farm girl standing next to the vine wall singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, are you going into Hyrule Castle?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are, actually.\" replied Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful news. My name is Malon. My dad runs the Lon Lon Ranch near the castle. He went into the castle to deliver a shipment of milk, but he hasn't returned.\" she explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find him for you.\" said Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much. I don't have much I can give you in return, but I do have this Cucco egg and incubator.\" she replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was expecting the glass container with an egg in it. Instead she received a leather dome with three straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" asked Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an energy efficient egg incubator. I used to need a tiny flame in a jar to keep the egg warm and happy, but then I had an idea. If you just use your body heat, it's not only easier, but faster too. Just like a mommy with her baby.\" explained Malon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison just kept on laughing at Kira's predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can return home now, knowing I've left this task in good hands. Goodnight.\" said Malon, before skipping off back into town</span></div></div>",

Kira stripped out of her tunic, leaving her effectively naked out in the open. She picked up the incubator and raised it to her belly. Using the nearby rock face to hold it in place, she brought the two side straps around her waist and fastened them tight. Then she brought the bottom strap up between her legs and secured it to the other straps. At least it wasn't going to fall and make this embarrassment all for nothing. She then collected her tunic from the ground and set about putting it back on. The incubator made it really tight, but she decided to tough it out and get this over with. After all, the incubator made her look 9 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, Allison.\" said Kira, and she began climbing the vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found that the castle guards were just as inattentive as they were in the game, especially at night. It was easy to get to where Talon was sleeping. Just as they got near, the sun rose and the Cucco hatched, making a loud crowing sound that woke Talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What- where- what time is it? I must 'ave dozed off. I gotta get back to the ranch.\" he exclaimed before rushing off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira took off the incubator and released the Cucco. She then quickly plucked Allison out of the air and put her into the incubator before putting it back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Payback's a bitch.\" said Kira<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her tunic back on and moved the milk crates so she could get inside. The guards inside were no more difficult than the ones outside, and so Kira found herself face to face with Princess Zelda.</span></div></div>",

Before Natasha arrived, Miranda noticed that the empty lot across the street was no longer empty. There was a sign above it that read 'Babbingtree's Costumes'. When Natasha arrived, Miranda pointed it out to her. They both agreed to check it out together. After all, today was Halloween, and they had both been too busy to find costumes before today. So once they had finished their coffees, they linked arms and crossed the street. Once they stepped inside, they were awestruck by the variety and sheer volume of costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tash, why don't we make this a little more fun.\" suggested Miranda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\" asked Natasha<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we each get to pick three unbreakable rules to impose on each other.\" said Miranda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm in.

After a few minutes, the door swung open and Miranda gazed upon Natasha in full costumed glory. She was a sexy policewoman. She wore a tight blue crop top with a low cut and a shiny badge, a short skirt with stockings and black pumps. A police hat sat atop her head and a pair of sunglasses rested on her nose. If that weren't enough, a pair of handcuffs hung from her belt in plain view. Miranda instantly felt herself become wet. She remembered that she had told Natasha about the time when she was 18, a busty policewoman had arrested her and her friends for drunken disorderly conduct. She had already been wet from staring at the officer's cleavage, but when she had gotten irritated and bent her over the hood of the cruiser with her hands cuffed behind her back, Miranda came harder than she ever had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like?\" asked Natasha, striking a pose<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda just nodded dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now it's your turn.\" said Natasha<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stopped as she realized that the rules only left her with two options.</span></div></div>",

It looked comfortable enough, maybe a little old fashioned for her tastes but what the hey, it was a costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stripped down to her underwear and pulled the nylons over her legs.The orange shorts were next. They were a little wide, and kinda crumpled up in her crotch, but sitting quite comfy over her hips. Finally she put on the top, and examined the results in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>'oh my god, I'm old'</i> The 35 year old Greta sighed in front of the mirror. She stretched her neck, trying to make the tiny wrinkles disappear. She was wearing the wrong kind of make-up, and her hair really was a tad too short to pull off the 'hooters girl' look. Maybe she could try a wig...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she decided to do a quick retouch on her make-up, wiping off her business-like face-paint, and going for more subtle touches, accentuating her natural looks. A little foundation to cover up her blemishes, a touch of mascara to accentuate her eyes and some subtle red lipstick to make her smile sparkle. Looking in the mirror she already felt 10 years younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down about 8 degrees, to the two crumpled up mounds tucked away in her top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-'how am I supposed to fix that' she thought 'maybe stuff em up with something?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she heard the oven beep, signalling the pizza's were ready. Well, she'd just have to worry about her raisins later. She got up, a little quicker than she was used to, making her chair fall backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-'<i>Ok, Greta, you work too hard'</i> She said to herself. Placing the chair upright, she gave herself one last look in the mirror, when she noticed her legs. Those weren't hers... they were, well, lean, desirable, fit. The kind of legs you'd expect under an athletic 20-something. Her legs had always been slanky, meager stilts... hadn't they? Her mind was getting a little fuzzy as she tried to recall what her legs had looked like. She recalled cellulite, and a little surplus fat on her thighs. She stroked a hand over the suntan hose, not a trace of aging to be found. Wondering how nimble her legs were, she kicked up with one leg, and could easily touch her nose without having to arch her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>'Ok, weird but cool.'</i> She concluded. Then she forgot what had weirded her out in the first place, her old legs a quickly fading shadow of a memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to try a toe-touch, when John called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Honey, pizza's getting cold!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Coming!\" She yelled back, and practically danced back to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had put her pizza on the counter, and was taking his own back to the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ooh looking good hun.\" John said appreciatively as she sashayed into the kitchen. His eyebrows rose at the sight of her opulent legs. \"You've been working out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What? No!\" She laughed at the compliment, thinking he joked. \"But thanks. This costume is pretty tight.\" She made a swirl, showing off her moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Your're not fooling anybody, dear. But I'm not complaining...\" John said, grinning while he disappeared into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey usually ate separately. Greta usually took her work home, spending nearly every dinner alone behind her laptop. She picked up the plate and went over to the small corner of the bedroom they had furnished as a work space. She sat down, preparing to file the crap out of her pointy haired boss' variation on TPS-reports. As she munched down on the pizza she stared at the screen, not really able to focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Man, what the hell am I doing. This stuff is boring as fuck.'</i> She closed the documents, opened up a Robin Thicke playlist and leaned back. What was she thinking? Working at home? Without being payed? That's just bunk. She continued chilling, humming along to 'Blurred lines', occasionally taking a bite from her pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she hadn't been too preoccupied by pizza, she probably would have noticed some of the other changes she had gone through. Her age had regressed to roughly 21, and her blonde hair had grown to shoulder-level. Along with her legs, her butt had firmed up considerably, now stretching out her orange shorts like a pair of tangerines. The creases in her crotch had disappeared, and the small amount of excess fat from her belly had melted away, leaving a subtle washboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was distracted from her humming when she felt a distressing pressure building up on her chest. Looking down, she was greeted by two quickly developing knockers, rapidly overflowing her now way too small bra. She yelped, pulled off her top and bra, and jumped to the mirror. She was just in time to see the growing halt at a firm 34J cup-size. Her mind fogged over again. and for a few seconds she really didn't recognize the girl standing in the mirror. It wasn't just the breasts, it was everything about her. She was supposed to look older, wasn't she? She cupped her breasts and her expression slowly changed from shock to delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<i>'OMFG, what did I do to deserve these puppies...'</i> She traced a nail over one of her nipples, and it instantly hardened, sending shivers over her skin. She experimentally bounced them a few times. They were pretty firm, so for now she could probably manage without a bra. She pulled the hooters top back over her head, and inspected herself again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. This was her. 21 year old Greta Anderson. Complete bombshell with measurements to die for. Living together with John, happily so for... 5 years? She frowned. That didn't make sense... And why was she wearing her work uniform again? Confused, she walked over to the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? Something's not right...\" </span></div></div>",

He entered the room and found she was already wearing the costume. She was sitting in front of the mirror deftly applying make up. This surprised him a little, she wasn't the person who would usually put great care in her make-up unless they were actually going out, and even then she only did the bare necessities. He shrugged it off as 'trying to look the part'. \"Whoah, that costume is amazing,\" he exclaimed. \"how does it fit?\" She put away the lipstick and gave him a lustful stare he wasn't really accustomed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shopkeeper was right. It fits like a glove, honey\" She said while getting up. Now he could get a good look of her. The costume wasn't so much revealing as it was clinging to her curves, almost making him wonder how she got it on in the first place. It had to have some padding too, as he didn't remember her hips and breasts being this big compared to her waist, or was it her waist that had gotten smaller? Either way she looked stunning, with the purple glitter tube dress, silk stockings and high heels. She looked utterly stunning. \"Yeah and you know what's funny? I could swear my breasts have gotten bigger, see?\" She arched her back and looked at herself sideways in the mirror. When she looked back and saw his perplexed expression. \"Wait, you mean that's not padded?\" She giggled \"No! Can you believe it? I can't wait to wear it to the party next weekend.\"  She did a few poses, displaying her flexibility in the dress. Lifting one leg so that it pointed to the ceiling, while balancing on the other. He could have sworn she wasn't this flexible last night... \"You look amazing, babe. And, euhh, the make-up?\" She waved a hand apologetically \"I don't know, I finished putting on the dress and I guess I got carried away. You have to admit I am pretty good at it, though.\" He looked at her a little doubtful. The make-up was done by an expert, a stripper couldn't have done a better job herself. Either she had some hidden talent for it or she had learned to apply make-up like a showgirl overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still didn't believe the way she looked right now, something seemed very strange about the costume. But she seemed completely happy about it, and to be honest, so was he. He walked over to her and kissed her. \"I'd love to see the faces of our friends when they see you in this.\" He smiled down at her. \"Anyway, I'm getting hungry. What do you say you change back and I whip us up something to eat?\" She nodded and gave him another kiss. \"Sounds good, I'll be right down.\" He left her and got started on making dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm going to take some painkillers before it sets through.\" She quickly got up and went for the bathroom. A minute later she got back, but something looked different about her. \"You OK?\" He asked her. She seemed to look down on him with a sort of passiveness in her eyes, as if she was going through a routine. She sauntered over to him, pushing back his chair with her foot, and knelt down between his legs. Stroking her hands along his crotch, she licked her lips. Every move she made was fluent and gracious, calculated to perfection. She loosened his pants, and unbuttoned her own blouse,letting her massive breasts fall into his lap. The lap dance that followed was the best sexual experience he had ever had, sending him all the way to bliss and beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, he was laying on the bed, panting. She was sitting next to him, lighting a cigarette. \"That was awesome, babe.\" She gave him a fake contended stare. \"I'm so happy it was good for you honey.\" She took another drag. \"Since when did you take up smoking again? I thought you quit.\" She rolled her eyes at him. \"Whatever, look, is there anything else I can do for you? I've gotta be at Jack's in about an hour. So if you want to, you know, try something else. There's still time...\" He contemplated this, a little taken aback by her nonchalant demeanor. He couldn't quite see her in the half-light of the bedroom, but somehow she seemed different. Her voice was a little more breathy, her way of talking made it seem like she was bored with the world in general.\"You have to go? But it's practically nighttime... What do you mean 'try something else'?'\" She sighed. \"I don't know, 69, anal, face-fucking... whatever knocks your socks of, stud.\" He sighed a happy sigh. \"Thanks babe, I'm completely spent. Anal does sound nice though.\" She looked at him with new found interest. \"You know it's gonna cost ya extra, right?\" She walked over to where he had thrown his jacked, fished for his wallet, and took out a couple of bills she pocketed. As soon as she put away the money, her demeanor changed again, bending over on the side of the bed, looking at him seductively. She rummaged through a small purse, and handed him a small flask of lube. \"Here, you better use this.\" She smiled a seducing smile and arched her back. He didn't know what was going on but being the man that he is, he found it hard to say no to some anal sex. Usually she didn't want anything to do with it, so this was kinda like a unique opportunity. He got behind her and gladly went to work on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the anal session, he was even more thoroughly spent than before. The last thing he remembered was collapsing on the bed and falling in a deep, peaceful sleep. When he woke up, hours later ...</span></div></div>",

Rising up from the bed he realize she's gone with the door wide open. Quickly thinking back to last night he goes over what could have happened only for a rather scary realization to hit him. His girlfriend wasn't just acting like a stripper she had become one and now she's left him alone. moving quickly he gathers a pair of shorts from the ground and a slightly used shirt from on top of the drawers and made his way out of his just to stop dead in his tracks when he noticed a piece of the strippers outfit on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlooking around he noticed a small trail of items that belong to the costume leading away from the bedroom to the living room. when he got there he took a breath of relief at see his girlfriend asleep but naked. Carefully taking a seat next to her without waking her he tried to think about what really happened last night and why his girlfriend had turned into a really stripper. The most rational solution he could come up with was that the costume had some kind of magic that turned people into what they wore for a time if not longer and if that was the case the owner most likely knew about it. So it seemed that you had a few options available to you one you could go back to the store and see what the owner could tell you about the magic costumes. Two you could wait for your girlfriend to wake up and see what she remembers from last night to get a better picture of what your dealing with. finally three and possibly the most risky would be to try to  wear it yourself and experiment with the effects of the magic as you didn't really want to risk losing your girlfriend to the costume again.</span></div></div>",

Soon they came to a junction that was dominated by a large sign. In one direction were costumes of magical things of all kinds and in the other were various animal costumes. Babbingtree lead his customer swiftly down the animal section before stopping and peering at a small index to his right. After a moment he slammed his fist against the side of the shelves and a small platform emerged from the bottom. He stepped on the platform and pressed a small button on the index and the panel was propelled upwards at great speed before stopping abruptly six metres up. He then returned with an extremely detailed cow suit.<br>\r\n\"This'll fit any adult.\" he stated \"it costs ten dollars per day to rent and thirty dollars to buy.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll just rent it thanks.\" Steve said quickly.<br>\r\n\"Ok then.\" the shopkeeper answered and too a tag gun out of his pocket and putting a tag through the ear of the costume.<br>\r\n\"What's that for?\" Steve asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Tracking, so you can't make off with it.\" With that, they returned to the register.

But I'm...I'm not exactly sure what to get her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that the boy was sincere (shy and geeky; yes, but sincere all the same) and that this outfit was not for him, Babbingtree was rather relieved, happy to have a genuine customer with a genuine problem to assist (rather than endlessly watching a parade of sexually confused, yet curious young men perusing the female only costumes with no intention to actually buy), this being the kind of thing that he lived for. \"Well don't you worry about that, son, Dr. Babbingtree is here to help. First thing's first though, you'll have to tell me a little about this girlfriend of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs shy as he was, the boy found himself strangely enough opening up to the wizened old man behind the counter, answering as soon as the question was asked. \"Uh, okay. Her name is Vicky and well, she's kind of like me,\" he said, \"Into comics and movies and computer games and stuff....except, y'know, she's a girl.\" This much seemed obvious enough to Babbingtree, the likelihood of her being a cheerleader or prom queen or anything being pretty slim to nil, seeing as this young man didn't exactly seem all that high up on the social ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that doesn't give me a lot to go on...\" the store owner replied, scratching at his long gray beard, waiting for the young man's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Reece, Reece Taylor,\" the teen quickly answered, the words continuing to just spew out of his mouth, as if outwith his control. \"We haven't actually been going out very long, only for like three months. And she's my first girlfriend so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want to choose badly and mess things up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as I said, don't worry, I'll help you find the perfect costume,\" the old man once again smiled, stepping out from behind the counter and placing a reassuring hand on Reece's shoulder, \"And all for a low, low price. Now come, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as he was told, Babbingtree then led Reece towards the back of the store where the majority of the costumes were located; all sectioned off into various categories in the many different racks, and all of them covered by a thin plastic sleeve (presumably to keep them from getting dirty or damaged). \"Wow...\" Reece muttered under his breath, having never seen so many costumes before, and especially not inside a store that had looked so tiny on the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as Babbingtree searched through the many racks, pulling out the occasional giant bunny or witches costume, before shaking his head disparagingly and putting them back, he eventually turned to his young customer and said, \"Now, I'll level with you here Reece, I could just give fob you off with some fuzzy cat costume or something and tell you that your girlfriend would love it and think that you're the most awesome boyfriend ever or whatnot...but you and I know that just wouldn't be truth. You see, this to me appears like some sort of test; a test by your girlfriend to find out exactly what kind of boyfriend you really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis however seemed a little far fetched to Reece, and he responded somewhat skeptically, \"<i>Really?</i>...You think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Why else would she get you to choose her Halloween costume?\" Babbingtree asked, grabbing Reece once again by the shoulder and giving him a playful little shake, \"Take it from me, son, there always doing this kind of thing; <i>women</i>. You won't believe the amount of young guys that come in here in this exact same situation as you are right now, with no idea what costume to get or why. And you know what I tell them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell them that the best thing to do is to stop trying to guess what this 'Vicky' of yours wants and start thinking instead about what <i>you want</i>. What kind of costume would Reece like to see his little lady all dressed up in for Halloween? That there is the best place to start.\" Although he had been somewhat skeptical at first, thinking that perhaps this old man was just having some fun (which he clearly was, the store being very much a magical and mischievous place that changed the lives of all who entered, though usually in a good way), Reece was gradually being taken in by his words, believing more and more of what was being said, much to Babbingtree's delight. One night of dressing up in a silly costume and going to some ridiculous party every year may seem like fun to most, but not to him, not when he could use his knowledge and his powers to benefit his customers even more, in a way perhaps that even they didn't quite expect. \"Take this sexy nurse outfit for example,\" he continued, suddenly pulling out another costume from somewhere nearby and holding it up, \"Do you think you'd like to see Vicky dressed up in something like this? Something that'll please you a lot more than it'll please her...<i>if you know what I mean?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReece of course knew exactly what he meant, but that didn't stop him from feeling a little shocked at the suggestion as he pictured his cute and geeky (and in others mind's no doubt, slightly plain) girlfriend dressed up in an outfit like that. \"I, uh....I don't know about that...\" he nervously muttered, not entirely sure what kind of reaction that would provoke. Not that this mattered to Babbingtree of course, knowing all to well that as shy and as unassuming as he appeared, and as worried as he was about not upsetting or angering his girlfriend, Reece was still just like any other teenage boy and sex was definitely almost always on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reece, my boy, Halloween, playing make believe and dressing up is all about fantasy...\" Babbingtree assured him, putting the nurse's costume back and directing him towards a variety of similarly themed outfits, \"...and about <i>desires</i>. If you want to get anywhere with that little girlfriend of yours then you've got to stop all this worrying and learn to explore these desires.\" Then, as if suddenly reaching into his very head and picking out his thoughts, the old man continued, \"Now you may not have been going out for very long and things may not be proceeding quite as quickly in the physical department as you may like, but believe you me, you pick her out a sexy little costume for Halloween like she's clearly wanting you to, and I assure you, you'll have yourself a night you won't long forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was music to Reece's ears, Babbingtree basically saying exactly what he wanted to hear, having long wished he and Vicky could progress past the kissing and cuddling stage of their relationship, but being to shy and nervous to take things any further himself.. \"You...you really think so?\" he said, being almost wholeheartedly ready to believe that a mere Halloween costume could do all this for him, as if there was also some sort of magic here at work...which of course there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashing the young man a big, satisfied grin, happy that his plan was working, Babbingtree then replied, \"<i>I know so</i>,\" before indicating to the various costumes before them and asking, \"Now tell me, Reece, what's <i>your</i> fantasy?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't give me that. I know you might like to come across as the shy and retiring type who has the utmost respect for girls, Vicky especially, but believe you me when I say, I really have heard it all before. I may be an old codger but I know what young guys like yourself are into; all big boobs and skimpy outfits, loose morals and a total lack of inhibitions when it comes to sex, and I know that deep down you're just the same.\" Though he didn't like to admit it, for fear of being labeled a pervert or something, Babbingtree was right, these were exactly the kind of things Reece did fantasize about <i>a lot</i>; what with being a 17 year old virgin with a very active imagination and a lot of time spent alone in front of his computer. \"Now c'mon, there's no need to be embarrassed, tell old Babbingtree who your fantasy women is,\" he continued, flashing Reece a warm and trusting smile, \"who you'd really like Vicky to be given half the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving won him over again, the old man's words being almost hypnotic in their delivery, Reece found himself once again revealing things he'd never revealed to any other living being, grinning and blushing a little as he did. \"Well I guess I do have this one kind of dream girl in my head. Her name is Shawna, she's a cheerleader who goes to the same school as me and Vicky, and she's like super hot with huge big boobies and the most incredible ass ever,\" he said, becoming rather animated in his description as he pictured the girl in question, \"The way it jiggles around under that tight little skirt of hers is...is <i>unbelievable</i>!\" Giggling a little at his own enthusiasm, and becoming slightly embarrassed again, he then added a little more calmly, \"That is, I mean...I guess sometimes I kinda wish that Vicky could look like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you, this girl sounds like a real firecracker!\" Babbingtree happily replied, giving Reece a hard slap on the back, before moving towards one of the many costume racks in front of them, \"And luckily for you I think I have just the costume in here somewhere. Sounds to me like you want the '<i>Busty Cheerleader</i>'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Busty Cheerleader'?...they actually make that costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They make pretty much every costume, my boy. And when I say 'they', I actually mean 'me',\" the old man giggled as he continued rifling through various plastic covered outfits, before pulling one out and showing it to his young customer. \"Now here we go, one 'Busty Cheerleader'....Is this the kind of thing you were meaning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the outfit in Babbingtree's hand; a very tight, very revealing looking green and yellow v neck, crop top with the word 'Cheer' printed across the front in bold white lettering, complete with matching pleated skirt, white knee length socks, white sneakers and a pair of yellow pom poms, it was everything Reece had imagined and more, being perhaps a different color to his schools, but far, <i>far</i> skimpier and more revealing. \"Wow, yeah!\" Reece grinned, a little blown away by the outfit, though at the same time realizing that as hot as it looked it still wouldn't quite be the same as in his fantasies, his girlfriend having rather a skinny, flat chested physique, much different from Shawna's, \"I'm just not sure how Vicky will look in it though, she's not exactly the curvy type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, it's got it's own built in curves,\" Babbingtree informed him, though this not really making a whole lot of sense to Reece (it looking pretty much like any ordinary cheerleading outfit with no sign of padding at all), \"Once she puts this little baby on, she'll look like an entirely different person...and <i>feel</i> like one too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" the teenager inquired, this added little tidbit of information leaving him doubly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well 'Busty Cheerleader' is also 'Horny Cheerleader'...\" the store owner teased, shooting Reece a little wink as he began to chuckle, \"or haven't you seen any of those stupid teen flicks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that he was just joking, Reece half-sort -of-laughed, \"Ha! Oh yeah...right,\" though at the same time still partly wondering if that was really all that the old man had meant, there certainly being more going on inside this strange store with all these amazing costumes than met the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking him from this thought, Babbingtree then asked, \"So do you want it or not?\", heading back towards the counter as he did with the costume still in tow, as if he'd already made the decision for him. Even with the rather persuasive owner pushing him, deep down Reece really did want to buy it himself, still having the odd underlying sense of doubt over whether Vicky would like it or not, but that being mainly pushed to the side now by the rather arousing thought of actually seeing her in it. Vicky was a cute girl certainly, but she was no Shawna; her taste in clothes being mostly thick sweaters and hoodies that covered her thin frame, as well as baggy jeans and long skirts that completely obscured her legs. Seeing her dressed in something like this would certainly be an eye opener, especially if it did indeed have padding inside as Babbingtree had alluded to (even pretend big boobs on his girlfriend being a heck of a lot better than practically no boobs at all).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I'll take it,\" Reece said, following the old man to the counter, \"I just hope she likes as much as I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Reece, <i>she will</i>,\" Babbingtree smiled, sounding rather certain about that as he placed the costume onto the counter and pressed a few buttons on his rather old fashioned looking till. \"Now here you go, that'll be $9.99, a special discount price just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks,\" Reece smiled, not believing his luck as he reached for his wallet, having expected it to be much more expensive that that. That was when it suddenly occurred to him, noticing the rather petite size of the outfit, \"Uh, wait. Is this the right size? Will it fit Vicky?\" (his girlfriend being thin sure, but clothes were still clothes, and not every size fits everybody).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One size fits all,\" came Babbingtree's almost instantaneous reply, as if predicting the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer unfortunately didn't quite add up to Reece, there clearly being a pair of white sneakers with the costume, and even if the rest of it was super stretchy, they certainly couldn't be, and scratching at his head, he asked, \"Oh, how...how does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Magic!</i>,\" Babbingtree smiled, his eyes almost lighting up as he said it. The next thing Reece knew, the old man then plucked a ten dollar note from his wallet and quickly carried out the rest of the transaction himself, bagging up the cheerleader outfit and placing his receipt and his penny change into the bag with it, before sending him on his way, instructing him to have fun, as well as a \"Halloween he wouldn't soon forget\". And that was that, Reece once again found himself standing outside in the street, this time with a bag in hand and a strange feeling like he'd just been manipulated like some sort of puppet on a string, Babbingtree being one hell of a good salesman, as well as, clearly, a whole lot more than he seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging this feeling off however, being fairly happy with his purchase as well as rather excited to see Vicky actually wearing it come Halloween night, Reece, gave the strange old costume store one last glance, before heading on his way, the next stop on his journey being home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several bus journey's later and a rather uncomfortable confrontation with a crazy old drunk man looking for his shoes (Reece living in the quieter, leafier suburbs of town, a good half hour away from the center where the costume store had been located), he finally trundled into the living room of his house and shouted, \"Mom, I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReece currently lived alone in a modest two bedroom house with his 42 year old mother, Samantha, who worked as a receptionist in the city, his father having been kicked out several years ago after she'd caught him having an affair with one of his female co-workers. It was of course kind of hard at first for the two of them after he'd left, but gradually, over the years, they had got used to living without him and to each others company; his mom often remarking that they were a lot better off, as well as much closer now without him here than they had been with him. Thankfully, even though it was just him and his mother, she was relatively easy to get along with, being a pleasant and caring woman who loved her son dearly and did her best to provide for him, often acting at times more like a counselor than his mom; helping him with his shyness and trying to get him out into the world as much as humanly possible. It was after all, down to her that he had finally worked up the courage to ask out Vicky, having sat right next to her in chemistry and had feelings for her for well over a year without doing anything about it; being so concerned with rejection and her laughing at him that he'd all but given up on the notion of any sort of relationship. Samantha however, having met Vicky on the odd occasion she'd come over to study (the two of them having frequently been partnered together in class) and seeing what a nice, pleasant girl she was, and how good it would be for Reece to finally have a girlfriend, managed to convince him to just go for it and ask her out, being delighted when she had said yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that having his mom's approval of his relationship was all peaches and roses, what with her still being his mom and it being embarrassing as hell every time she'd continually question them both about what they were doing, when why and with who, as well as insisting that when Vicky was over that Reece keep his bedroom door open, being somewhat old fashioned when it came to the thought of anything 'inappropriate', as she called it, going on under her roof, believing that when it came to sex, it was best left to responsible adults well over the age of 18. This of course was another reason why Reece had been so afraid to make any kind of move on Vicky, being <i>A.</i> afraid his mom might catch them in the act, and <i>B.</i> worried that she might go crazy if she did, being nice and pleasant and all most of the time, but no less strict and quick to anger when the situation called for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully that would all change come Halloween, he thought to himself, looking down at the bag in his hand and smiling, having the strangest feeling that there was indeed something magical about the costume and that his dreams may soon come true, just as the old store owner had said, especially seeing as his mom would be out of the way for once at her own works party, leaving ample opportunity for him to be alone with Vicky in that sexy little cheerleader outfit. Placing the bag down on the couch, he then headed into the kitchen for a drink, hearing no reply from his mom and remembering that she was still at work and probably wouldn't be back till later this afternoon, having managed to find a costume and return home much earlier than he'd assumed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a soda from the fridge, he heard his cellphone begin to ring, and scrambling around in his pocket for a moment, he pulled it out and saw on the display that it was Vicky calling. \"Hey, what's up?\" he asked on answering, smiling away happily to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey yourself!\" Vicky replied, giggling cutely as she often did, \"I'm just at the mall looking for your Halloween costume. What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's funny, I just got home after buying yours,\" Reece replied, finding the coincidence rather amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis came as something of a surprise to Vicky, clearly having expected her rather indecisive boyfriend to hum and haw over what to buy her for days, and certainly having not expected him to beat her to it. \"Oh wow, <i>really?</i> You got it already? That was fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well I uh, I found this cool place near the mall,\" he told her, stuttering a little as he said it, not really wanting to give too much away about the place, \"It had loads of costumes and stuff inside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Vicky's next question was of course,\"Where abouts? I haven't found anything that I like for you yet. The ones in the mall all seem to be the same old boring generic thing that everyone else is gonna be wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking himself inside for telling her that, worrying that if she went into the exact same store then she might figure out what he'd bought her and why (not wanting to risk her disapproval), Reece then made a conscious decision not to reveal anything else, and instead try to divert the conversation elsewhere. Unfortunately this was easier said than done, and once again, just as had happened earlier in the store, he found the words once again escaping from his mouth of their own accord, informing Vicky that the store was, \"Pretty much across from the main mall entrance, down a narrow alleyway and to the right. It's kind of an old looking place called 'The Costume Store', but the guy behind the counter is really friendly, and helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I'll have to check it out,\" Vicky chirped, almost before he'd even realized what he'd just said, moving quickly onto the more important matters, as she then asked, \"So, uh...what did you get me anyway? Will I totally geek out when I see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the excitement and enthusiasm in her voice and having absentmindedly revealed the location of the store, Reece was almost tempted now to just come out and tell her, figuring that he'd practically given them game away already. Fortunately his better judgment quickly took hold and figuring that even is she did find the store, Babbingtree didn't seem the type to reveal his purchase, and he instead replied, \"I'm not telling you that. It's supposed to be a <i>surprise</i>, remember?\", calling his girlfriend out for her rather unsubtle little ploy, \"It was your idea; Neither one of us gets to know until October 31st when we have to put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. You can't blame a girl for trying though. This Halloween's gonna be so awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it sure is,\" Reece agreed, grabbing his soda and heading back into the living room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Distracted by Vicky as the conversation then turned away from Halloween and onto other things, Reece completely forgot about the bag with the 'Busty Cheerleader' costume that was still sitting on the couch where he'd left it minutes before, and instead continued straight on up the stairs towards his bedroom. It was at this point that his mother, Samantha Taylor suddenly walked through the door, having received half the day off due to her boss, Mr. Johnston, feeling particularly generous after having just closed a major deal and making the company an awful lot of money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, what a day!\" Samantha said as she sat her handbag down on the coffee table and slumped on to of the couch, having been pretty much on her feet all morning, running around like a headless chicken before Mr. Johnston's big deal had finally come through. Kicking off her heels and stretching her legs out, she then noticed the plastic bag seated next to her and looked over to see exactly what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that..is that a Halloween costume?\" she thought to herself as she peeked into the bag, spotting something green and yellow wrapped in plastic and pulling out what looked to be a receipt for a place called \"The Costume Store'. At first she had assumed that it perhaps belonged to her son, aware that he had actually gone into town today to pick himself up something for Halloween, but on further inspection, recognizing the crop top and pom poms of a cheerleader uniform (having a long time ago been a cheerleader herself), she realized this couldn't be the case; her son (as far as she was aware) not being the type to dress up in a costume meant for a girl. Add to that the fact that she'd only just spoken to Reece about an hour ago when he was just heading in, and knowing how long it took him to make any kind of decision (especially if it meant impressing his girlfriend Vicky), there was no way he'd be back home by now, and he certainly wasn't currently anywhere to be seen. No, this wasn't Reece's, she thought to herself, realizing there had to be only one other explanation; this costume was for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, what on earth has she bought me?\" Samantha tutted, shaking her head as she pulled the outfit from the bag and held it up, assuming that this was for the Halloween party that was being thrown by her boss at work. While usually parties and large social gatherings weren't really her thing (feeling a little awkward and out of place at them ever since her good-for-nothing husband had left), one of her closest friends and work colleagues, Angela, had finally talked her into attending, promising that she'd have a blast and even going so far as offering to buy them both matching costumes to wear so that she wouldn't feel quite so alone amongst all the various couples. Seeing as she wasn't at work today, having had to attend a meeting out of town, she'd obviously stopped by the house before hand to drop off the costume she'd bought, presumably leaving it with Reece who had forgotten to mention it before he'd gone out and had instead just dumped it on the couch. At least that was the only reasonable explanation she could come up with, little realizing that it <i>was</i> in fact her son who had bought it, and that he was currently upstairs right now, chatting away to the very person he'd bought it for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the full thing; the tiny little halter top, skirt, socks, sneakers and pom poms encased within the plastic cover, the outfit looking like it was made more for some skinny little porn starlet than a 42 year old divorcee and mother of a teenage son, Samantha was absolutely mortified, not quite believing what her friend had picked out for her to wear and gasping to herself in shock, \"She's got to be joking. Does she seriously expect me to wear <i>this</i>?\" It was clear however, that either Angela was having some sort of joke or there been a mix up at the store, Samantha leaning more heavily towards the former, knowing how her friend could be, having been pushing her for quite some time to let her hair down and have what she called \"a little fun\", frequently teasing her about one of her male colleagues at the office, George, who she was convinced had a crush on her. \"C'mon girl, just loosen up a little and maybe wear something that shows a little more skin,\" she would often laugh, desperate to fix the two of them up, \"then trust me, he'll be like a big ball of putty in your hands.\" Well If this was another dig at her choice of clothes, then Samantha certainly wasn't amused, not really seeing anything wrong with the way she dressed; smart, yet conservative, seeing no reason at all to flaunt her aging body and attract anymore attention than was warranted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the costume back into the bag and picking herself up off the couch, continuing to mumble away to herself as she did. \"I really can't believe that woman sometimes. She always has to take things way to far. I'm <i>a mother</i> for God sake, not some cheap floozy running around begging for sex!\" For a moment Samantha half considered phoning her friend up right now to give her a piece of her mind, but thought better of it, realizing that she'd either still be at her meeting or that it'd only add more fuel to the fire, not being in the mood right now to put up with more of Angela's racy innuendos. She was a good friend certainly, but in this respect the two of them couldn't really be anymore different. So deciding just to leave it for now and buy herself a more suitable costume for the party sometime tomorrow, Samantha grabbed her shoes off the floor and decided to go get changed out of her work clothes. Rather than just head straight up however, Samantha found herself picking the cheerleader outfit up off the couch, rationalizing this action by saying, \"I'd better take this too. I don't want Reece getting the wrong idea,\" before making her way up the stairs, sans heels, and across the hall into her room, where completely unbeknownst to her Reece was still busy chatting away to Vicky, little realizing himself (due in no small part to her silent footsteps) that his mother was now home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading into her bedroom and throwing the bag onto the bed, Samantha went about her usual changing ritual, peeling off her jacket and blouse, then slipping out of her knee length skirt, before rolling her pantyhose down her legs. This time however, instead of heading directly over to her cupboard where the rest of her clothes lay, she found herself for some odd reason glancing back at the plastic bag behind her on the bed, finding that its contents now had some strange sort of pull over her as a rather ridiculous idea began forming in her head. \"Okay, now I'm going crazy,\" she laughed to herself, shaking the though of actually trying on the costume right out of her head, not entirely sure where such an idea had suddenly come from. As much as she tried to fight it though, the thought stayed firmly there, almost as if the costume was willing itself to be worn, if such a thing were possible (which in this case, it was), as she said, \"I've been hanging out with Angela <i>way too long!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping away from the bed, feeling rather embarrassed for even thinking about trying on something that just minutes she'd been horrified had even found its way into her house, Samantha instead turned to face the full length mirror she kept propped up in the corner of the room, and told herself, quite firmly and matter-of-factly that, \"I'm 42 years old. I'm well past my prime. I have a 17 year old son who I won't even let in the same room as his girlfriend without keeping the door open, and here I am thinking about putting on a ridiculous fancy dress costume that even she'd struggle to fit into. What is wrong with me?\" As she said this however, and examined her underwear clad body in the mirror, she realized that perhaps all of what she'd said wasn't entirely true; being 42 years old with a teenage son certainly, but perhaps not exactly past her prime. While Samantha had never been the supermodel type or anything, she had been told she was quite pretty in her youth, and although with age she had gained a few pounds and a few wrinkles here and there, and although she had long ago convinced herself she was no longer desirable to men after her husband had cheated on her, the evidence before her now suggested something quite to the contrary. She was still reasonably attractive, now that she thought about it, having a full head of long blond hair, a curvy, somewhat hourglass shaped body (with only a slight hint of tummy), a nice big pair of breasts (which admittedly had been affected by both breastfeeding and gravity) and legs that really weren't all that bad either (being at least a 7 on the scale). If she really wanted to she supposed, and if she did as Angela suggested, perhaps she <i>could</i> get George interested in her...he was rather attractive after all, and she hadn't been with a man in quite a few years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what the hell!\" she proclaimed, looking back round at the costume and deciding to throw caution to the wind and try it on after all, if only out of curiosity and for a bit of fun, telling herself that, \"Reece hopefully won't be back for a while and it'll be interesting to see if I can still carry off the outfit from back in my cheerleading days.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind made up, giggling to herself like some over excited teenager, realizing what she was doing was utterly ridiculous but deciding to go through with it anyway, Samantha then fished the outfit from the bag and lined the various pieces out on the bed, little suspecting that there was magic at work, magic that had been meant for Reece's girlfriend...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grabbing the skirt first, Samantha stepped into it and pulled it up her legs, finding that unlike the uniform she had worn back when she was in high school, this one was much, much shorter, barely covering even the upper portion of her thighs. \"Oh my God, this is going to look so ridiculous,\" she said to herself, realizing now just how badly this tight little excuse for a costume was going to fit her older, more mature body; it having clearly been designed for much younger, skinnier girls, \"I don't know how Angela seriously ever thought the two of us would be able to go out in public in this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head and letting out another little giggle, she then moved onto the next item, pulling on the two white knee length socks then slipping the sneakers onto her feet (finding them to be an exact fit). Lastly she moved onto the tiny little crop top, examining it in her hands for a moment, again having never worn anything quite this small when she was cheerleading, realizing just how much of her belly was going to be on display and worrying that it would even fit over her large chest. \"Only one way to find out,\" she thought, slipping it up over her head and pulling it down, finding that it did indeed manage to miraculously stretch just enough to cover her boobs, though only just, the material of the top ending just below her rib cage, emphasizing, just as she had predicted, her fleshy little tummy, as well as showing a fair amount of cleavage through the neck hole. This of course only succeeded in making her laugh further, not quite believing she had actually dressed herself up like this, probably showing more skin now than she had since she was 18, and a lot more wild and carefree. One thing was for sure though, she didn't exactly feel all that sexy wearing it; the tightness and revealing nature of the clothing actually making her slightly uncomfortable, as if she was dressed up like a piece of meat hanging up on display (even if she was currently alone in the house...or at least thought she was). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, guess I'd better see what I look like,\" she said, picking up the yellow pom poms and heading back over to the mirror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection that greeted her elicited another loud giggle, but this time instead of being one of enthusiasm and frivolity, it was more nervous and embarrassed, Samantha suddenly feeling rather foolish now faced with her own image.  \"Oh God, what a state...\" she mumbled, loosing all of her previous joy as she stared rather unimpressed at the silly, middle aged woman stuffed inside a skimpy little Halloween costume, looking far more ridiculous than even she had first imagined, somewhat depressingly so. There was nothing sexy about this, nothing alluring and fun about seeing her excess flab being squeezed in and and out of various bits of clothing and all in different directions, like she was some a big, unattractive sausage bursting out of it's own skin. If thinking about trying the costume on had started her feeling a whole lot more confident about her body and appearance, then actually putting it on and seeing herself in the tiny little green and yellow slips of material had set her straight back to square one, wondering what the hell she had even been thinking, knowing full well that a skimpy outfit like this was definitely not for her....and God forbid, if George had actually seen her in; he wouldn't be able to keep from laughing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Samantha was feeling all this however, as she stood there in her bedroom, a hangdog expression painted across her face, and her body hunched in disgust at the sight that was reflecting back, somewhere across town inside a little costume store, Babbingtree was sitting behind his counter, smiling away to himself, aware that one of his costumes had just been put on, and that the magic, that was hand weaved into every thread and fiber, was just about to begin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Samantha, this really was another bright idea of yours,\" Samantha sighed, throwing down the pom poms and taking one last look at herself in the mirror, before heading back toward the bed to get changed, feeling more than a little depressed. This was when something suddenly began to happen, something that she couldn't quite explain or put into words, as if a warm, tingly sort of feeling had suddenly been injected into her body and was quickly and steadily growing, becoming more and more intense and causing her to let out a loud gasp. \"Oh my...<i>oh my God!</i>\" she squeaked, not entirely sure what was going on, but aware that something very strange was happening beneath her clothes, feeling them suddenly tighten dramatically around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started in her chest, almost as if she could feel it swelling up beneath, pressing harder against the stretchy material of the top. Not only that, but she could feel her nipples starting to tingle and harden too (and not because of the temperature of the room either). \"What..what's happening? What's going on?\" she cried out in a panic as her hands automatically went to her swollen chest, turning back towards the mirror again to see that yes, somehow they did seem slightly bigger, as if they were indeed growing! Watching them steadily swell, and her hands get further and further away from her body, Samantha's jaw dropped and her eyes went as wide as saucers, well aware that such a thing was impossible, but being unable to explain what she was seeing before her or how this was happening; <i>how her breasts were steadily getting bigger!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs shocking and horrifying a sight as watching her once substantial E cup breasts expanding past an F and into a G, Samantha then noticed an entirely different sensation going on beneath, feeling her bulging tummy being suddenly sucked in, as if it were shrinking. This elicited another loud gasp as her hands left her growing bosom and dropped to her bare stomach, feeling the once soft, pliant flesh disappearing beneath her fingers, becoming firmer and more toned. \"This is impossible!\" she went to cry, only managing to get the first word out as she then felt something happening between her legs. She was getting moist...and not only that, but rather excited too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh Jesus...</i>\" she moaned, this time not in horror, but instead in arousal, feeling an intense pleasure growing within her long neglected sex and spreading out over every inch of her expanding and changing form, that was now positively buzzing with delight. Although she was usually somewhat restrained when it came to indulging in the pleasures of the flesh (having not been with a man for a long time and having a young, impressionable teenage son in the house), now she found it almost impossible to resist, as a hand left her slimming belly and made it's way down between her legs, reaching under the tiny skirt and coming into contact with the now wet material of her panties. Gasping again as her fingers began to stroke at her incredibly aroused vagina, her free hand then moved back towards one of her now melon sized breasts and grabbed at a hard, throbbing nipple, poking noticeably out of the top, pinching and twisting at it with erotic abandon as her entire body continued to magically transform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the most obvious and most dramatic changes were occurring withing her chest and stomach, examining her reflection while her hands continued probing at her body, Samantha could see that they weren't the only ones; watching as much of the excess weight she'd put on over the years began to shift and shrink, causing her shape to change from that of a curvy, voluptuous woman, to a much more lithe, slim, athletic figure (with the addition of the two giant mounds sticking out from her chest). It was almost as if she was suddenly getting younger; her muscles toning beneath her skin and all the little wrinkles and age lines appearing to just vanish before her very eyes, taking almost ten to fifteen years off her age. Realizing this, no longer feeling any terror or shock over what was happening, having succumbed completely to how incredible the feeling was as her body continued to pulse and tingle with her transformation, Samantha joyfully yelped, \"This is so incredible! I look <i>totally amazing!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the changes finally ended, leaving Samantha standing there staring at an image of herself she never imagined she'd ever see; her body now looking like some sort of incredible fantasy version of herself. No longer did she feel embarrassed or foolish about how the costume fitted, her gorgeous, slim, slightly bronzed, toned body looking unbelievable within the tight little slivers of material, while her truly epic, giant breasts (that each had to be about big as her own head, if not bigger) pushed out majestically from her chest, stretching the tiny little crop top to it's very limits and displaying about half a foot of cleavage now through the straining neck hole. She was definitely no middle aged, past her prime, pudgy mother who couldn't get a man anymore; she was now <i>a busty Goddess</i>...and she was as delighted and as horny as hell!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the beak seems to be by itself, with the rest of the costume seemingly somewhere else or unavailable.</span></div></div>",

I find that you can often learn a great deal about someone from careful examination of his hands.  There is no better indication of what a man wants than how he chooses to spend his time, and everything a man does is recorded in his hands.  It has become popular of late to describe the eyes as 'the windows to the soul,' but a good liar can twist his face to say whatever he wishes. No, if you truly wish to know a man, look to his hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, I guess,\" said Eliot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I ramble!\" said Babbingtree.  \"You seek a costume, not a lecture!  I apologize; I sometimes get carried away when discussing my craft.  Come, what you seek is this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining the fantasy 'section'\u2014though 'wing' might be a more appropriate term, given the size of the store\u2014Eliot found no shortage of suitable outfits.  All the costumes were of exceptionally high quality\u2014all the fabrics were thick, rich and authentic with none of the unnatural sheen that too often spoiled otherwise fine sets.  No, every piece of clothing here looked like it came straight from the set of a high-budget movie.  The selection of pseudo-medieval armor was particularly striking\u2014full sets of shining steel armor that looked every bit as authentic as genuine museum pieces.  Not only the armors were impressive\u2014the attention to detail was such that any one of these costumes would surely be the talk of G-con.  After nearly an hour spent admiring the incredible workmanship in all the costumes, Eliot found one that he simply had to have.  It was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, an important part of a successful costume was body shape, and Eliot simply wasn't a warrior.  Fortunately, there's not a great deal of physical difference between a powerful sorcerer who spends his days studying ancient mystical tomes and a socially awkward college student who spends his days reading cheesy soft-cover fantasy novels.  With this reassurance and a half a semester of acting classes under his belt, Eliot selected the flowing white robes confident that he could easily pull off the role.  Technically, the robes came from the section labeled \"Clerics, Druids and members of priestly orders,\" but he figured it hardly mattered.  A fantasy-style robe was a fantasy-style robe, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slipping the robes over his shoulders and admiring the fit, Eliot was suddenly struck by just how big this store really was.  He hadn't really noticed as he'd been guided through the winding shelves by the talkative owner, but now faced with navigating the twisting racks himself Eliot realized he had no idea how to get back to the front of the store.  However, upon consideration Eliot found he could make out the faint sound of voices several racks over.  At first Eliot was surprised, but then berated himself for his silliness.  Of course there were other people in the store\u2014there was no way an operation this large survived by serving one customer at a time, after all!  Making his way toward the source of the noise, Eliot considered the least embarrassing way to ask for directions.  Should he simply say he'd gotten 'turned around' or should he open with some kind of casual remark on the confusing layout of the store?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eliot rounded the final corner, though, the question became entirely academic.  At the other end of the isle was not a couple looking for costumes, but landscape.  Instead of more rows of costumes, the hallway emptied onto a wide vista of rolling hills and a tiny village visible in the distance.  Now, Babbingtree's was a big store, but even this place couldn't contain several square miles of open countryside.  Whatever this was, it was something far outside the ordinary.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In general, Eliot was what others might describe as 'a cautious fellow.' He didn't like the unexpected, and would, if pressed, rather forgo jam on his morning toast than risk ruining it with spread from an unfamiliar label.  He didn't drink milk that was fewer than three days away from the expiry date, he didn't sit for an exam with fewer than six auxiliary #2 pencils, and he always came to a full and complete stop at marked intersections.   So when Eliot gathered his courage and took a flying leap into an unfamiliar and impossible world, it would have been perfectly reasonable to take a moment to congratulate himself on a moment of profound personal growth.  Of course, Eliot refrained from such frivolity\u2014mostly because he'd fainted before he hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, hidden effortlessly within the store that was his masterwork, Babbingtree chuckled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good show, my boy!\" he smiled.  \"I knew you weren't as timid as you appeared!  You have a brave heart, lad, I saw it; you were merely wanting for the right kind of adventure. Well, you'll have it now, and unless I miss my guess both you and those you meet will be better for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabbingtree chuckled softly at Eliot's unconscious form sprawled across the grass just beyond the gateway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only you knew how many of the truly great began as meekly. Though I do imagine that when you awake you'll be wishing you'd paid a little more heed to my careful labeling.  I make up those cards for a reason, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final wistful sigh, Babbingtree waved his hands and sealed the gateway between worlds with as much ceremony as a tired commuter closing the front door of his apartment after a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Eliot learned from his adventure was that, no matter what cartoons and romance movies say, fainting is not at all like falling asleep.  When he awoke, it was not with a flutter of eyelashes and a soft-spoken query as to what had befallen him.  Instead, Eliot shot upright with a violent, heaving gasp more commonly associated with the nearly drowned than the recently awakened.  Eyes wide and heart racing, Eliot glanced fearfully about with enough adrenaline coursing through his veins to wake the dead.  Indeed, by the time pure, animalistic survival instinct had given enough ground to reason for the formation of coherent thoughts, this was one of his first considerations\u2014was he dead?  He had, after all, leapt through a doorway of light into an idyllic, peaceful meadow; the idea that this might be some kind of classical afterlife was not entirely absurd.  However, the presence of a few decidedly un-heavenly sensations quickly dissolved such notions.  For one thing, his head throbbed with pain from his fall; for another, the entire valley smelled of manure.  Either heaven was depressingly mundane or he had in fact landed in an actual meadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, further musings on the status of his immortal soul were cut short by a less ultimately significant but more immediately alarming matter: the status of his physical self.  Preoccupied as he was with matters of life and death, the first hint Eliot received that something wasn't quite right was, of all things, his nose.  Eliot had always had a larger-than average nose.  It wasn't ugly, exactly, but it was what could tactfully be called 'prominent.'  Prominent enough, at least, that it usually entered the periphery of his vision.  It wasn't something that bothered him\u2014like the rhythmic ticking of a bedroom clock, it usually went unnoticed unless he was actively looking for it\u2014but it was always there.  And, like a clock's tick, the sudden absence was far more noticeable than the presence had ever been.  Of course, his first response to this absence was to cast his eyes downward, which in turn revealed a whole host of body-image dissonance issues\u2014the most immediate of which protruded a full 5 inches from his ribcage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was still mentally a sexually frustrated nineteen year-old male, he groped, kneaded and massaged his new assets quite a bit more than was strictly necessary to confirm their authenticity, but before long panic overtook lechery and he started looking for clues as to what in the world had happened.  Fortunately, this wasn't a difficult task seeing as the clue he sought was safety-pinned to the sleeve of his robe\u2014a rectangle of hand-lettered cardstock, which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">Dr. Charles Babbingtree's Costume Emporium<br>\r\nUnit No. 33487-S (Priestess of the Solstice\u2014Initiate's Robes)<br>\r\nSize info. B34DD/W22/H36<br>\r\nPrice:  $149.99 ($179.99 w/ hood)</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Eliot had neither the expertise nor the tools to confirm the theory by checking to see if the measurements matched, he didn't have any trouble coming up with the obvious explanation for his current situation\u2014that when he'd entered the doorway of light, he'd been reshaped into the image represented by the costume.  He did, however, have trouble accepting that explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he said softly. \"No, this isn't possible.  I'm\u2026 I'm still unconscious.  That's got to be it\u2014this is all a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he knew in his heart that it wasn't.  No dream was this real, this\u2014tactile.   Eliot could feel the cool country air rush down his throat with every breath, the tickle of every wisp of hair that played across his neck,  the faint throbbing of his pulse reverberating deep within his ears.  In that minute, he was more aware\u2014more awake\u2014than he'd ever been before.  Whatever this was, it was no dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with a world gone mad, the frightening idea that nothing he thought he knew about the nature of reality seemed to apply, Eliot did what he did best: he took stock.  He was very good at this; Eliot had an excellent memory.  Others called it \"photographic\" sometimes, but it wasn't like that, not really.  He didn't replay his childhood like videos in his head; he didn't store memories like snapshots, to be called upon and studied at will.  He had to learn things, to pay attention to details just like everyone else.  If he didn't notice something when walking into a room, he was no more able than his peers to remember it later.  However, having once taken note of a fact, he was very unlikely to forget it, and this was where he shined.  To be honest, he couldn't really understand why others forgot things, not really.  It just didn't make sense to him the way others claimed to spontaneously 'unlearn' things they'd been taught, or to forget where they themselves had put something.  When, in the eighth grade, his class had been challenged to memorize as many digits of 'pi' as they could, he was baffled by the contest.  Surely the teachers meant to CALCULATE as many digits of pi as they could, didn't they?  But they did not, and so he recited the first thousand digits and been awarded a prize as though it were somehow a remarkable achievement rather than just reading a boring string of numbers and repeating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now all his facts, all his memories, were suddenly worthless.  Everything he'd learned about the world, about what was possible\u2014even what he knew about his own body!\u2014had become instantly obsolete.   So he began again.  Starting with himself, he took note of every detail.  His hair, now a shining Venetian blonde, fell about his shoulders in bouncing curls.  He already knew the horizontal shape of his figure form the card, but judging from the way the robes swept the ground when he walked, he was  also at least a couple of inches shorter than he'd been as a man.  His legs and arms were smooth and hairless; he wasn't quite sure what to make of that.  He knew humans normally had the same number of follicles as their ape cousins\u2014nearly 50 million\u2014just much smaller, thinner hairs.  Apparently even basic facts of human anatomy had been turned topsy-turvy going through that door.  Speaking of 'human anatomy,' Eliot turned his attention to his other\u2026 new parts.  Unfortunately, there wasn't much he could determine.  Thanks to his lanky frame, large nose and geeky inclinations, he hadn't exactly gathered a large body of comparative experience in that area.  Everything seemed 'normal' enough apart from the complete lack of hair, but he didn't really feel comfortable dwelling on the subject.  All of his knowledge on the subject came from biology diagrams anyway, so he wasn't confident he'd be able to identify even if something were out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he turned his attention at last to his surroundings.  The hill upon which he stood was covered in long, wild grass and some small plants he couldn't identify, but a few hills over smoke curled from the chimneys of a small hamlet.  The buildings clearly weren't modern, not unless thatch roofing was some new environmentalist statement, but at least it was civilization of a sort.   In the distance, rolling forests backed up against snow capped mountains and thin dirt roadways snaked between the hills.  The landscape looked\u2014well, to be perfectly honest it looked like one of those paintings so often chosen as the cover of cheesy fantasy novels without the budget to commission a unique scene to match the book's setting.  All that was missing was a party of\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when Eliot noticed the three figures walking purposefully across the hills in his direction.  A trio, varied in garb and carrying large packs and formidable weaponry, that looked like nothing so much as a party of adventurers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confirmed it.  He'd had his suspicions, but the adventurers were just too much to ignore.  He knew not how, nor why, nor for how long; but somehow\u2014impossibly\u2014he was in a land of fantasy.  A world, as Babbingtree had put it, of magic, swordplay and high adventure.  That these adventurers were passing by just this place at just this moment was likely no coincidence; he suspected that, should he choose to try, he'd find them all too willing to accept his companionship for one reason or another.  But did he want that?  Did he want to stick to the rails of this twisted game, or should he take control, head off in a direction of his own choosing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat, Eliot wondered, should he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, it could still be worth trying to go out and not be like the others. Hell, he or someone else could make his costumes if he could and just go there just for fun. It might not even matter if everyone is different than him. All that matters is enjoying the time and having a fun experience.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't supermodel great, or smokin' hot great, but it was a hot body, 5'7\" with C-cup breasts and a great mid-line. Her only problem was that her ass was a little flat. As she was unhitching her bra strap she looked at Steve. \"Aren't you going to change?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve had been looking down at the dress, cursing his luck that he hadn't even begun to try to get Alexis into the dress. \"Yeah, sure.\" He finished getting out of his clothes about 2 minutes after Alexis; who was starting to get very impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, hurry up and put it on.\" She said as she reached for the boss costume. Steve reluctantly started with the underwear. \"Why is underwear even included in this?\" He wondered as he slid up the very small panties. Amazingly, they seemed to fit perfectly. Steve had figured they would have snapped around his knees, but they slid up and sat comfortably around his hips, he then put on the garters, amazed that they too didn't break. He continued to be surprized with every bit of the costume that he put on. Finally, the last piece was the apron. Alexis had already finished with her costume, but was waiting for him to put on the apron before she put on the hat lying next to her. He put the apron on and tied the strap around his back, and Alexis put the hat on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, Alexis seemed to be getting bigger to him, and losing some of her curves, but soon all thoughts were wiped from his mind as pain erupted all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if a large man had suddenly started punching him from the inside. The pain on his chest was almost unbearable, each punch-like pain seemed to actually push his chest out just a little bit more, when he realized that it actually was! The space in the top where a set of breasts had been absent, was filling up with the two mounds of flesh that were attached to his body and still growing. As soon as the pain in his chest was gone, a new, even worse pain set in. It felt as if a 2 ton weight was being repeatedly slammed down on top of him, he watched as the room slowly started to get bigger, when he finally realized that he was getting smaller. Once again after that pain stopped a new one began, this one being worse than the last two combined. It felt as if someone had thrown a lasso around his penis and was pulling it inside his body along with his family jewels. He put his hand down on top of his crotch to find that there was nothing there, but as the tugging pain continued he could feel a small slit beginning to form. Soon the small slit had turned into a full vagina, but the tugging pain continued as his testicles were pulled up and turned into his new ovaries. The last part of the transformation was nearly a relief, as all it was was a itching at the scalp as long black hair replaced his old brown hair, and a tingling sensation in his arms and legs as they lost their hair and his rough skin turned into soft, delicate skin. Finally over, he slumped in a chair, hoping never to relive that experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at his girlfriend, who'd turned into a handsome man. \"Wow, this is so exciting.\" Alexis exclaimed. \"Aww... You're so cute in that outfit!\" She cooed as she took in Steve's new body. \"Are you ready to be my maid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve found himself in disgust. He was now a french maid, and his girlfriend had tricked him into becoming one. \"You could have just told me this would happen!\" He screamed, slightly taken aback at his new high-pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then you wouldn't have done it.\" She mocked him. \"Now are you ready to serve me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve opened his mouth to say \"No, change me back...\"</span></div></div>",

Pulling the rest of the costume on you notice that you have changed to fit the outfit and you are now a double of the picture of the costume model. Even your hair had changed even though there was no wig. Walking out you take the toy axe as you are ready to model the costume for your sis. Looking at yourself in the mirror one last time you miss the new sinister grin which has crept on to your face and walk out the room unaware that the costume is making its effect on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh katie you have to let me take a photo of this\" She shouted in pure delight and you posed as she took the pictures. \"My god you have even got the sinister look of chucy down already\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her you wonder what she is talking about and you decide it's time for you to take to costume off. Excusing yourself to the bathroom you try to take the costume off but it won't budge.

I want you to take that axe of yours and kill your sister with it\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to move you look at the reflection and shake your head thinking it only as a dream, not realising that you were now changing slighty into a murderer.

As you raise the axe your will starts to fight back \"Megan run, the costume is taking over it will kill you, go to Babbingtree get hel......pul lease my god im coming for you Megan\". Megan noticing the change in atmosphere heeds the warnings of her sister and runs. Fast. Running out the door she jumps into her car and starts to drive away, but Katie or chucky which ever, has now jumped onto the car and started banging on the window. Looking helplessy at Katie she decides to brake heavily and this causes her to come off the front of the car adn runs over her sister. Stopping she looks in her mirror and realises that she has just stood up and has yelled \"You can run but you can't hide\".</span></div></div>",

She picked up the underwear first. She found the bra and panties to be a perfect fit and very comfortable. She pulled on the socks and smoothed them out before putting on the shoes. The skirt came next. It was longer than she had thought. She had not expected it to fall nearly to her knees. She then collected the hair elastics and put her long hair into two long pigtails. She picked up the shirt and heard a clinking sound but ignored it. She buttoned up the shirt and looked herself over in the mirror. She liked the nice modest schoolgirl look. She then looked down and saw that the sound she had heard was a silver chain with a cross on it falling to the floor. She picked it up and undid the clasp. But when she locked it around her neck and let the cross fall to her chest, it started to glow. Suddenly the costume began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes began at her feet and worked their way up. The once flat heeled black shoes became a pair of sleek black pumps with a 7\" heel. Then the warm knee length socks became thin thigh high stockings. The skirt hemmed shorter until it just barely concealed her ass and pussy. The bra and panties vanished without a trace. The blouse tightened to fit her form. The long sleeves rolled up to appear short and the shirt tied off to display her midriff. Her nails and lips turned a bright firetruck red, and her eyes gained a thick amount of mascara and other eye makeup. Her two long pigtails braided and fell in front of her shoulders. She looked herself over in the mirror and could feel herself getting horny. Her nipples went hard so she could see them through her shirt, and she could feel a wet trickle running down the inside of her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started panicking and ran out of the changing room. She passed Dr. Babbingtree on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That costume is $45.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled a 50 out of her purse and slammed it down on the counter before running out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did she go?</span></div></div>",

When she looked in the mirror she found, to her horror, that the changes hadn't stopped when she ran out of the costume store. Her hair was now bleach blonde and her eyes blue. Her breasts had grown and her waist had shrunk. The cross now hung from a black leather choker wound snugly around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried taking the costume off, but no part of it would budge. She eventually gave up trying.

She had to go back to the costume store. She didn't want to walk looking like she did, so she got in her car and drove, even though the store wasn't far. She entered the store to find Dr. Babbingtree waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness you came back. You ran out of here so fast.\" said Babbingtree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put on one of the Dangerously Dominating Costumes.

I thought it was a joke.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you it is no joke. Right now I don't have enough power to remove it. That Catholic Whore costume will push you to have as much sexual intercourse as it can. It feeds on sexual energy, so the more sex you have in that costume, the more powerful it grows. And if it gets powerful enough, it can take you over permanently. Fortunately in order to do that, it would have to drive you to be fucked to exhaustion in all three holes by three different magic costume wearers, and I'm the only magic costume salesman in town.\" said Babbingtree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good... I think.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabbingtree reached under the counter and pulled out a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this box is everything you need to keep yourself safe.\" said Babbingtree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collected the box and hurried back home. By the time she got home she could no longer resist. She walked from her car to her house with one hand holding the box, and the other hand up her skirt. She put the box down to unlock the door, then carried it inside. She managed with great effort to stop fingering herself so she could open the box. Inside she found two sets of ankle cuffs, two sets of handcuffs, a ballgag with a lock, and a chastity belt and bra, along with a key for each. She put on a determined face and carried the box into her bedroom. First she took out the chastity belt and bra. Her pussy went haywire trying to distract her, but she powered through and locked both articles on her body. She threw the key for it across the room before she could change her mind. Now that stimulation by breasts, pussy and ass were out of reach, she set to the others. Next she put the ballgag in her mouth and lifted her hair so she could close the strap. Once it was locked, she set about the rest. She needed to free herself in the morning, so she froze the cuff and gag keys in a block of ice with the end of a thin chain, then hung the other end of the chain high above her bed so the keys would fall on her in the morning. With her escape safely planned, she lay on the bed. She cuffed an ankle to each bed post at the foot of the bed, and a wrist to each post of the headboard. Once she was safely locked in she finally stopped fighting and started writhing with pleasure against her restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost concept of time. She lay there in orgasmic agony for an eternity. Until she heard voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trick-orTreat!\" called a male voice from her front door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" demanded a female voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Megan, the door wasn't even locked.\" said a second male voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, we could get in trouble.\" said Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mason is right.\" said a second female voice, which was quite obviously more confident<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ashley.\" said Mason<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group talked, Miranda, the protagonist of our story, reached a realization through the haze of orgasmic bliss. She had forgotten to lock her front door, and now a group of adolescent trick-or-treaters were inside her house. She was completely helpless. She moaned unexpectedly as the image of being found tied up in a slutty costume turned her on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that?\" asked the as yet unnamed male<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't screw with me, Steven.\" said Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. I just heard something.\" said Steven</span></div></div>",

Next was another boy dressed as a policeman. Third was a girl in a sexy Snow White costume. Last was another girl in a sexy Bo Peep. They all appeared to be in their last year of high school.

The leotard also became fur, but also the tail came alive and she found her pussy and ass unobstructed. The wristbands fused and became fur, but started spreading. The fur started fading out past the elbow, and her hands became claws. The neckband changed into a tight leather collar. The ears fused into her head and replaced her human ears.

Not knowing what else to do with it, she tied it around her neck with another pretty pink bow at her throat. When the last knot was tied, the costume glowed and started to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were not significant, nor were they particularly obvious. Her skin became paler, her face was suddenly done in tasteful but attractive makeup, her figure slimmed and became more hourglass-shaped, The leotard became tighter, and if she checked under the tutu she would find that it was giving her camel toe, but she didn't. Her hair re-did itself into a tight bun at the back of her head. She tried to go on ballerina toe-point, and found it as easy as though she had been dancing her whole life. She skipped and jumped and twirled her way to the check out counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be $45.\" said Babbingtree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a 50 on the counter before leaving the store.

It was as if she could feel the camera's and electronics around the store. In fact, if she focused on any of the cameras, she could easily retrieve the feed. She watched herself walk up to the counter, where a clerk had been slouching. Now doing his best to look notable because he had to serve a rather attractive lady.<i>He is probably unfamiliar with the concept of androids, or any cybernetic organism for that matter</i> She thought to herself in between a billion little details she took in from her surroundings.Her mental capacity had increased to superhuman levels and as her proficiency with this body grew, she only became brighter. \"How much for the replenishment of propellant?\" she asked him without so much as a blink. \"Refill? that'll be 65 bucks please, miss.\" She interfaced with her bank account, looked up the gas station's IBAN and transferred the money before he even finished his sentence.  \"Thanks, David Voichick.\" She simply stated. Not waiting for a reply from the clerk, she turned around and walked away. \"How did you..\" He shot at her. She turned around \"Your name was on the duty-roster for today.\" A smile grew on her face \"Oh, your supervisor knows about the missing register money. If I were you I would spend some time on formulating a good excuse. Or find a new profession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving away she had to accept the simple truth; she wasn't a regular woman anymore.

She was suddenly regretting not wearing any underwear or socks, but she picked up the scrubs despite her blush. She put on the pants first, then the shirt. They were thin and baggy, and if she closed her eyes it felt like she wasn't wearing anything. It felt kind of nice. She sat down on the bench and put the shoes on her feet. Finally, there was the hairband. She ran her hands through her long hair and drew it all into a ponytail. She put on the hair elastic to keep it in place and stood up to look at herself in the mirror. Then the costume started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was that the scrubs seemed to fuse together and start to tighten. The white shoes turned firetruck red and morphed into 6\" pumps. The pants divided halfway down her thighs. The bottom half extended into the shoes and became white stockings. The upper part changed into a short, tight skirt. The top receded and became a tight, sleeveless, low-cut dress top with a red + on the left breast. The dress turned pure white and continued to tighten as her body changed. Her waist narrowed and her breasts grew from C to full DD. Her hips widened and her ass became full and firm. The hair elastic moved up on top of her head and became a white nurse's head dress with the red + in the middle. Her lips turned red to match her high heels, and her cheeks turned rosy as well as her eyelashes becoming longer. Her eyes turned blue, and her hair grew even longer and became blonde and wavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

She stripped down before the mirror so that when she was finished, she stood completely nude, and her clothing made a pile on the floor. She picked up the bodysuit first and slipped into it. It covered her from neck to wrists to ankles, and had the iconic 'i' insignia on the chest. She smoothed out the creases and found the suit fit her perfectly, conforming to every curve. She sat down on the bench next and slid her feet into the boots. She pulled the boots so that they came as far up her legs as they were meant to. They stopped halfway up her thighs. Next was the gloves. They went on easily and smoothed out to fit her arms just as well as the suit fit her body and the boots fit her legs. She stood up and strutted a couple steps, admiring herself in the mirror. Then she realized that something was missing. She spotted the mask on the ledge and picked it up. Holding it in both hands, she moved it towards her face. As it made contact with her eyes and the bridge of her nose, it seemed to liquefy for a split second; just long enough to mould to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got strange as a tingling sensation flowed through her body. The heels of the boots became more elevated. Her entire body slimmed down and lengthened in a way that any supermodel would kill for. She looked down at her waist, and when she tried to put her hands around it, her middle fingers and thumbs were just able to touch. Her hair changed to match Mrs. Incredible's hair. While her waist remained the same, her waist began to broaden and her ass filled out. She slapped an ass cheek experimentally and gasped as a wave of pleasure washed through her. She cupped it and found it to be nice and firm. Her breasts filled out to a large C cup. Her bust measurement would still be smaller than her hips, but not by much. She tried reaching with her arm, and it stretched and extended. She turned her attention back to the mirror, and found that her face had changed to that of Mrs.Incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was strange.\" she said to herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now had Mrs. Incredible's voice. Her eyes glazed over for a moment while a dull pain coalesced in her head. Then suddenly it stopped. She blinked and looked around the room. She looked through the pile of clothes on the floor. She opened the purse and fished out a drivers license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda Sheppard. Her clothes are here, but where is she?\" she asked herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Mrs. Incredible resolved to find the 'missing' woman. She left the changing room and looked around. To her left, there was a vertically split pair of sliding metal doors. To her right was aisles of costumes leading to the entrance to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way does she go?</span></div></div>",

Twi'lek women were highly regarded as the best sex slaves money could buy, and this suit looked the part, with solid gold bra and panties, and a solid gold collar with a long thick gold chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she decide?</span></div></div>",

She hung it from the coat hook before she started stripping. Her clothing quickly formed a pile on the floor and she stood naked before the full length mirror. She then collected the costume and unzipped the back. She found that the metal looking articles attached to the costume were actually a flimsy foam. She opened the zipper all the way and began stepping into the costume. Once she was entirely encased, she zipped the costume back up and relished the sight of the gorgeous alien sex slave she had become. Her eyes fluttered shut as she sensually ran her hands all over her new body. She felt her skin become more sensitive, but didn't pay it much attention. However she did notice when her collar, chain, bra and bikini became real heavy metal, which felt a little cold against her skin. She stopped what she was doing and groped around her back for a zipper but there was none to be found. She looked at the ground, but were her clothes still there?</span></div></div>",

The entire ride home she compulsively checked her bag looking at her Venom costume. The sleek latex suit and terrifying mask, she couldn't take her eyes off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy stopped her car in front of Emily's house. \"So I'll see you at party this weekend.\" Wendy said waving goodbye<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later.\" Emily replied hugging Wendy before she exited the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily threw the costume on her bed and went about her day, but every now and then she felt drawn to the costume. \"Well maybe I'll just try it on now.\" Emily said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped into the bodysuit, it was a tight fit but she loved the way it looked on her. She admired her reflection in the bedroom mirror. She ran her hands down the side of the glossy black material it felt right. She picked up the mask, the last piece of the costume, and lowered it over her head. Suddenly the cold material began to warm up quickly, and it somehow felt even tighter. She glanced in the mirror again and the bodysuit had become fluid, alive even. It squirmed over her body constricting and exploring. The mask seemed to melt into the bodysuit the seam between them vanished. The mask had obstructed her vision and breathing but now it was as if she weren't wearing a mask. She felt the snake like tongue slither in her mouth. The costume finally settled, it couldn't tighten anymore, it looked like she had painted her skin. Her hands and feet had become clawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhh This is amazing.\" Emily moaned. \"I feel so powerful.\" She flexed her now amazonian physique. She reached her arm out and instinctively a black tendril launched from her wrist like a web. Emily smiled and opened her window, Wendy had dragged her to one of the spiderman movies and she remembered the web swinging looked fun. Reaching out again she launched another web and swung off into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was midnight before she stopped. She landed gracefully and the tendril retracting back into her skin. She smiled with her fanged maw, she wasn't tired in the slightest from the hours of exertion. \"This is the best thing ev.. what do we have here?\" A window display filled with expensive jewelry caught her eye. She placed her talon like hand against the glass.  She'd never thought about stealing before but something was different inside her. She stood silently for a moment then spoke.</span></div></div>",

She slammed her fist through the window. The impact sent shards of glass exploding outward with enough force to impale the walls.  An alarm rang but she paid it no mind and leapt though the new hole. She calmly began emptying the displays of their jewelry even taking time to try on several of them. With the storefront ransacked, Emily kicked through the door to the employee area. After little searching she came found what she was looking for the store's safe. It was a massive. solid construct, reinforced and firmly secured to the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Emily scratched her chin wondering just how strong she was now. She sank her claws into the tiny gap between the door and frame. Her talons pierced through the cold steel like it was paper, and with little effort the three inch thick door was torn from its hinge. Emily giggled at how easy it all was. Inside the vault, stacks of cash and the most precious of the store's jewelry sat waiting for her to plunder them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move.\" A man shouted from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily turned around and gave the officer a grin that showed off her large jagged fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop let out a terrified gasp and instinctualy  jumped a few feet back. \"D.. Don't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what, you'll piss yourself.\" Emily laughed mockingly. She took a step forward to emphasize her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop fired off a round, hitting her center mass. The bullet bounced off of her sculpted abs and landed on the floor completely flattened from the impact. It felt a punch to the chest but the pain faded so quickly it was more an annoyance than a real threat. Emily growled in rage and punched the cop in retaliation, it hit sent him flying into the wall shattering the drywall.  Emily towered over the cop laughing and he managed to lift his gun at her.  Emily  quickly grabbed his arm, disarmed him and flipped him over her head dislocating his arm and breaking several of his bones in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.\" he screamed in pain, \"Please please just don't kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily chuckled evilly and left him on the floor. She collected her loot and swung away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her bedroom, Emily lay on her bed her ill gotten riches clutched in her arms. The mask retracted away from her head showing her real face for the first time since she put it on. She showered the loot over her body. Her hands skimmed over her body rubbing her gems and jewelry against her. In one night she acquired a level of wealth that would take years of work. \"I'll never deny my desires again.\" Emily thought  \"And the power I had over that cop. I could of killed him if I wanted. This world is mine if I want it.\" Thoughts raced in her head of all the things that would be hers, and how shed take them. Each one turning her on as she imagined the world powerless to stop her. Her claws inched to her crotch and she pleasured herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhhh all this thanks to Wendy's costume idea.\" Emily cooed. \"Mhh Wendy.\" Emily had a crush on Wendy for years, but was never brave enough to tell her. However things were different now, she was different now and she would have Wendy. Emily left once again this time heading to Wendy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Emily crawled up the side of Wendy's house and crept into her window.  \"Wendy.\" Emily whispered shaking her gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily? How did you get in here.\" Wendy said groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I let myself in through the window, but that's not important I want to show you something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you wearing your costume?\" Wendy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just watch.\"Emily smiled. Emily lifted her arm and tendrils sprouted off the costume and grabbed objects in Wendy's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Wendy jumped up, fully awake now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just that either, I'm super strong, I can crawl on walls maybe more, and it's all thanks to this costume. and just look at what it did to my body.\" Emily flexed showing her amazonian muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing!\" Wendy's eyes lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. Put on your costume and see for yourself.\" Emily suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god do you think it will work.\" Wendy didn't even wait for a response she tore off her sleeping clothes and ran into her closet. She came out shortly after dressed as Wonder Woman, the tiara in her hand. She lowered the tiara on to her head, and the change hit her immediately. Her hair straightened and turned jet black, her muscles bulged and grew rivaling Emily's, even the lasso at her hip seemed to glow faintly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Wendy gasped her voice now commanding and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See.\" Emily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\" Wendy smiled excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know the half of it.\" Emily said coyly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Wendy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was busy before I came here.\" Emily opened her hand out to Wendy, it was filled with some of the stolen riches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just a taste of what we can achieve. Think about it with the two of us together we could do anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No this isn't like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is now Wendy, with this suit the world is mine for the taking and I want you to be their at my side, we could rule it together.\" Emily stepped forward, bringing the two mere inches apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily I..\" Wendy blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had feeling for you for a long time Wendy, join me please.\" Wendy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel it to but. but this isn't like you. It's that suit!\" Wendy gasped. \"If mine made me Wonder Woman than yours must be corrupting you like it did to spider man. You have to get rid of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Never!\" Emily shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm sorry but this is for your own good.\" Wendy said sadly before she threw a punch at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily hissed and the Venom mask slithered back over her head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two super powered women roamed the halls, slinging costumes over their shoulders as they went. They wandered for what felt like hours the store seemed to be impossibly large on the inside. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason with how the costumes were stored, with princesses, slutty nurses, and video game characters all near each other. This only infuriated the girls they were here to steal only the most powerful of costumes. After only finding a suitable handful they stumbled across a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that there before?\" Emily hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These costumes are magic, I'd be surprised if the store wasn't also.\" Wendy replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe would be villainesses were drawn in to the door and found themselves climbing down the stairs.

A whirlwind whips through the storage room. Emily screams in panic, the tempest pulled her off the ground and was pulling her into the mirror. Wendy dropped the trinket and leaped toward Emily grabbing her hand. Even with both their combined strength the women were overcome by the wind and fell into the mirror. Once they hit the glass they sunk into it. The surface of the mirror rippled like water then went calm and the winds died down.

What she saw shocked her even more than traveling through dimensions. Emily wasn't there just a blob of symbiote roughly in human shape.

He had made a character from the Wolf Clan of the North. \"Oh no.\" Philip breathed into Kenny's thick hand covering his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny dragged him (or her, now) over to the bathroom, he was ready to catch Jeff as he walked out. Jeff came out and was instantly grabbed by Kenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Phil, you scared me!\" He said as he was about to turn around. Kenny whispered in his ear to tell him to say that it was Karen's turn. He complied and soon Karen's footsteps could be heard down the hallway. The bathroom door could be heard closing, and Karen verbally wondering \"Where did they go, and why even bother putting this on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened Next?</span></div></div>",

She watched dumbfounded as Jeff began to grow to about 7'4\", his nose began to flatten and extend away from his face as his chin followed. A coat of silver-grey fur began to cover his body, his arms were about as thick as telephone poles and were growing the same silver hair. His mouth was open in shock, and she could see his teeth becoming pointed. His feet had been bare so she could see his toenails become pitch-black claws on furry, 4-toed, humanoid feet. His fingernails underwent the same changes, and a tail seemed to be coming out of a gap in his platearmor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren missed the last of the transformations as she was undergoing her own. He body was becoming slimmer, and better toned. She lost every ounce of fat she had on her as it was replaced with lean muscle. Her blonde hair became black, and a scar appeared over her right eye (She had taken a glancing blow by an axe-wielding orc to her face, or at least she had in the game.). She could feel her senses heighten, and she could now notice about everything around her. Her skin grew to a very light shade of purple, almost as if someone airbrushed a light coat of lavender on her skin. Her ears also grew elongated a pointed. Her other changes were minor and didn't distract her from watching Jeff's final change as his eyes turned from there normal green to a silver-blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Who is ready to go into the game world?\" Kenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck did you do to us, Kenny?\" Came a growl from the behemoth that was Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned of Dr. Babbingtree's store about 2 weeks ago when, you and Karen went to Philip's football game.\" (Kenny had had a bad case of the flu that week and stayed home) \"I browsed the internet for local stores that had stuff that could enhance role playing games and found his store, with costumes that could turn you into anyone. I also got this!\" He produced a small box from under the table and set it on the table. He opened it and pulled out a small device that looked like a sundial. \"This will make a world for us to do anything in, and after talking to Mr. Babbingtree it's set to an exact replica of our game, Towns, Dungeons, even to the slightest hill. It's completely perfect, and we're going to go questing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about here though? Won't people notice if we're gone, or look completely different?\" Philip said motioning to his new curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time pauses out here in this world. We can stay in the world until we need a break from it, or until you die in it. That's what I asked Dr. Babbingtree, what would happen if we died in the other world. You heard his reply, we show up here with the costume in hand, and probably frozen until the rest of us come out.\" Kenny explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still skeptical\" said Wolf-man Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad... here we go!\" Kenny exclaimed as he hit the button in the center of the dial before anyone else could make an objection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat part of their world do they wind up in?</span></div></div>",

One throws a handful of explosives, much like flashbangs, at the guards, stunning and dazing them.

It was at least five times bigger than the small bed he had in his apartment, had at least two dozen pillows, and had several layers of fancy sheets and blankets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis character, Phyllis (He was never the most creative namer), was known throughout the land as the \"Tomboy Princess\". She would rather be out making adventure instead of meeting officials, signing documents, and being treated as if a simple pebble could break her neck, and she had secretly been studying with the King's mage and cleric, learning the ways of the mage's magic and the prayer's of the cleric (though she was clearly better at calling on the gods help rather than twisting the elements), she would liked to have learned to swordfight, but none of the King's fighters would waste their time for someone who would never use the craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip got out of the bed to find himself (now herself), not in the cleric robes she had changed in, but in a gold lined nightgown with precious jewels embroidered into the seams. Philip felt humiliated for wearing the gown and even more humiliated by being in the body of a woman, and the new foreign feelings that came with it. She sighed, and began to sit on the bed, but as soon as she was sitting, a group of girls (presumably her new maids) came in and told her that she was going to be late, for the meeting with \"her hero\" (Knowing who \"her hero\" was, Philip would rather strangle \"her hero\" instead of graciously dining beside him during the Hero's Feast.). Soon Philip ---||Note: I'm going to refer to \"he\" as \"she\", when he is Phyllis(It's just getting too confusing)||---  found herself out of her nightgown and being prepped for a dress, that was so big Philip thought she would suffocate in. The maids quickly put Philip in a extremely tight corset (forget the dress, she was going to suffocate now!). The maids worked so fast that Philip barely could keep up with their movements, and soon he was in a beautiful dress (though Philip thought it must have been spawned in Hell for how tight it was.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was then sent downstairs, waiting for Kenny to arrive. (He hadn't played the day that Phyllis was kidnapped due to a elongated football practice, and the whole kidnapping story was Kenny's idea, and he had completely forgot about the kidnapping.) After what seemed like an enternity to her, her hero Kenny, finally showed up. Just as Philip was about to make the comment \"What the hell took you so long?\" The windows shattered around her, and she soon found a violent arm wrapped around her and dragging her off. Philip began to use every swear word she knew. The bandit, slightly surprised that a princess would use such language, produced a small pill and shoved it down Philip's throat, although he got a nice imprint of her teeth on his hand, and soon the princess was out cold.</span></div></div>",

Where am I?\" She started to get up, but then realized the she was still a girl. \"Crap, it's not a dream.\" She looked down to find she was still wearing the dress, but it was now dirty and torn. She wandered over to the window and found herself at the top room of a gigantic tower. There was no castle, just a giant tower jutting out of the ground. Philip figured it must be at least 70 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud knock at the door. \"Wakey, wakey princess, time for your food. Can't have ya dieing of starvation before we sacrifice ya.\" The guard chuckled and tossed what looked to be a rat (a very charred, burnt rat) inside, the smell of the still smouldering hair almost make Philip vomit. She decided she would wait a bit before even considering eating it. The food slit slammed shut an the guard's footsteps could be heard moving away from the door down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenny, I'm going to slit your throat when I see you next.\" Philip thought to herself. She'd finally remembered the first quest that Kenny made: Save her from a grisly sacrificial death. Hopefully they would save her before the last minute (as it had unfolded in their tabletop game). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and noticed her chest rise and fall. It was the first time she really \"noticed\" the new changes. Sure she felt them when they first occurred, but then Kenny had sent them into this damned world, and then she'd been kidnapped about 30 minutes afterwards, not ever having a break to get accustomed to this body. It was a new feeling, the weight of her breasts (she might have been OK if they were smaller, but these weren't small by any stretch.), not to mention the openness she now felt between her legs. It was an unnerving sensation, and she didn't want to think any more on the matter. So, she went back to the small rotting cot that was now her bed and laid down. \"Hurry up, Kenny or I'll make killing you five times worse.\" She thought before drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Or at least that's what she thought it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she woke up again, she met the leader of the bandits, he was actually somewhat polite to her. He was only about 3 inches taller than her and kind of scrawny, with short blonde hair and crystal blue eyes. He was not exactly the stereotypical bandit leader, but Philip soon found out why he was leader. He had let her come downstairs for an hour for a meal (which was far better than a charcoal rat), when one of the other bandits, obviously drunk tried to take her to his room, but as soon as he started to drag her toward the stairs, the leader had put a knife in his throat before Philip had even seen him move. The other bandit was dead before he even hit the ground. He politely apologized and escorted her back to his room where she could rest and recuperate from the ordeal. As soon as she was inside the room he left, locking the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the bed she had woken up in when she first entered this world, but it was definitely better than the rotting cot, and even better than the beds at \"his\" college dorm. She momentarily thought back to the real world, where \"she\" was a \"he\", and \"he\" was a big, muscular tight end, but that was in that world. But on the other hand she had gotten more used to this body, although she still wasn't ready to actually look at herself in the mirror again quite yet, let alone actually touch the two fleshy mounds on her chest. It was as if ignoring them would make her turn back to the way \"he\" was before. She then realized she hadn't used the restroom since she had been here. She'd been dreading this moment, she had no idea how to take off the dress, work the elaborate undergarments, or even HOW to use the restroom, but the thought of it brought on the urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found that a fairly lavish bathroom was attached to the bedroom she was in and moved over to it. She fumbled with the dress trying to get it off, or at least in a decent position. The dress was still tight, despite the fact it was ripped in multiple places. She finally managed to find a catch in the back, which was obviously meant for someone other than the wearer to access. The top of the dress relaxed and allowed her to get it off. The undergarments, which had taken her chambermaids about 5 minutes to put on, turned out to be mainly support for her chest, which she was trying to avoid looking at. The panties were the same as \"his\" boxers (or at least in the means of removal, his boxers didn't hug his hips, end right under the crotch, nor were they pink, frilly or made of silk) She slid them down, still trying to avoid looking at her feminine parts. She found it annoying, after having all lived all her life with control of the stream, to have to adjust herself to keep it in the bowl. After what seemed like an eternity, he finally slipped the panties back up. She was relieved she had managed to avoid looking at her privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling about 30 minutes to slip the dress back on, she went back to the bedroom, and instantly crawled on the bed, and once again planned revenge against Kenny before drifting to sleep, although this time it was less about killing him, and more about torturing him by making him the girl when they returned to the real world.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Erik saw her trembling and tryed to confort her. \"Don't worry, my other brother won't be coming until the sacrifice, but you won't meet him, which is good. He's much worse.\" He shifted a bit as if trying to think of something nice to do. \"You can stay in my room until the date of the sacrifice, and I brought you some better clothes while you were sleeping, so you don't have to worry getting in and out of that damned dress.\"</span></div></div>",

He looked around the camp, taking in the smoldering remains of a campfire and a male wolf warrior and a female, sleeping holding a dagger. He wondered where Karen was. Then, he looked down at himself. Feeling something on his head, he reached up to find long, golden hair on his head and pointed ears. Looking down at himself for the first time, he saw that he was dressed in travelling clothes and next to him lay a staff. He pressed on his chest to confirm the existence of his breasts and contemplated if this was even possible. Before he could think on this further, one of his companions stirred.

Almost like an electric shock, something makes Tina's mind think this is not what she wants to be, having to deal with sick people and doctors cutting people open.  It's so skimpy as well and those doctor's would be ogling and pawing and embarrassing her. She felt she would be their plaything which is not anything she wanted.  Plus the baby blue color makes her wince with disgust thinking that's for little kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back at Lisa who is playing with the red wig trying to figure out how to get it on correctly over her long blonde hair.  Then she looks at the devil costume she's holding in her other hand next to the blue nurse's dress.  It seems to be shining with a warm, inviting glow.  Something draws her attention to it, and she brings it up against her and looks down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fascination mounts with a growing feeling of confidence and power, so different than her shy, mousy self.  She could be in control and wouldn't be pushed around or have to hide from or avoid people or situations.  Also, the red color is her secret favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina shakes her head as if to get the strange attraction of the devil costume out of her head, but maybe it's really to say no to her agreement to switch with Lisa and try the nurse's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tina turns and holds her arm and costume out to Lisa and says ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you'd like to try it on, there's a dressing room behind this rack,\"  pointing off to his right.  \"However, if you try it on and don't take it, I will have to charge you a cleaning fee so the next customer has a perfect outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina is clutching the costume with both arms to her, partly just to keep from dropping anything, but mostly, from deep down inside, there's an immense desire to take this and, wearing the mask so no one knows who she is, to be something so different from herself and know what it feels like to not be a shadow and stepping back from every situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe material of the costume and the hair of the wig where she holds them and they touch her hands and arms feel so good,  like magic.

Just take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabbingtree and Lisa have been waiting patiently for Tina's answer.  Lisa is dumbfounded at this sudden change in her friend and has this amazed look on her face.

She first takes the wig and tries putting it on fumbling a bit until she gets her own shoulder length hair properly tasseled up into it.  It still doesn't fit right until she moves it around a bit and has it properly aligned.  He new long red curls dangle down over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina walks over to the he mirror and sees the first transformation.  She is actually amazed how good she looks with a thick head of long hair dropping several inches below her shoulders.  She's always had at most shoulder length hair even when she was little and in pig tails.  She also notices some little bumps just under the hairline in front.  When she feels them, she notices they are little horns!  Oh, of course, she's suppose to be a devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes back and next picks up the thong.  It is very silky.  She's never worn real silk before.  Usually her plain cotton undies and a couple times those synthetic, imitation silk things, and never a thong.  She ponders it a minute getting very self conscious, but as she keeps feeling the material, she unconsciously starts putting it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silk is extremely smooth and the material seems to caress her legs with warm oil as she pulls it up them.  It slides gently between her legs and cheeks and tightly against her little bushy mound in front.  It continues to emit a warmth that soaks into her.  Without knowing she makes a slight smile and sighs contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she takes the bra which is way too big and hold it up.  Then she notices something else in the box, a set of falsies.  Putting the bra down she holds them up and notices how soft and natural they feel and look with the large dark nipples that are almost flat.  The back is indented just right to fit up against her own breasts and she holds them up against her.  Surprisingly, they actually stay in place as she lets go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns and looks back at the mirror again and sees a very sexy looking woman in a red thong and nice sized and perky breasts looking back at her.  She does a couple posses turning side to side, the reaches for the bra and watches herself put it on.  It is fairly low cut and exposes the top half of the falsies but you can't tell unless you look very close.  It latches in the front so it appears seamless.  It all feels very natural.  She is again delighted with the way she looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the bed, she holds up the costume that is one complete piece of fishnet stocking and black mesh torso.  Her legs slide easily into the stockings and it feels like velvet on them.  She pulls the body up putting her arms through the large openings for them and pulls the several inches of material that goes next to her neck and down her back but leaves her arms and shoulders bare.  The back is easily pushed together and attaches itself like Velcro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it is time for the long black gloves that pull on and make a latticework of laces almost to her shoulders.  Finally she pulls on the black leather four inch spike heeled boots that also have lattice laces up to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a small red leather purse with a note that it fits over the shoulder or as a belt around her waist.  Inside is the mask.  It is shiny black with red and dark blue sequins.  Also inside is some red lipstick and some long black eyelashes.  Tina takes the lashes into the bathroom.  They go on amazingly easy, and she flutters them in the mirror and giggles.  What comes out is not so much a giggle as a haunting sadistic chuckle, but she doesn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina uses the lipstick to make thick dark red, luscious lips, then she puts the mask back up to her face and removes her hand.  It stays put as she looks into the mirror.  She sees someone else even though she knows it is her.  A rush of confidence takes over, and she smiles or rather an evil smirk appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dee, dee, dum, doo, dee, dee, dee, dee, dum, dum, doo.\"  Tina picks up the phone seeing that it's Lisa and says, \"Almost ready, honey.\" which comes out in a deep seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina?  Tina, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it's me,\" sounding slightly more like herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, OK.  I'm on my way.  Time to play.\" click<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got that right,\" Tina says as she tosses the phone on the bed and heads downstairs.  She stops at the hall closet and pulls out her mum's black hooded ankle-length cape and throws it around her.  All apprehension of going to the party in this costume is now gone.  All she can think about is what mischief she can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks to the door, ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So the drive to the party was silent, with Liza staring awkwardly ahead and Tina smiling evilly. When they finally arrived at the party, they walked through the door. Most of the people who saw the two girls walk in had their eyes glued on Tina, especially the boys. Tina continued to grin wickedly, her eyes flashing. She decided to look around the room for potential victims to go flirt with. She only half noticed that she would normally think of them as 'potential dates' rather than 'potential victims'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief glance around the room Tina decided on: </span></div></div>",

She typically went to parties and flirted with about half the guys there, having fun with teasing them before picking one or two guys to spend the night with... sometimes more. Of course, Tina could have figured this out just by looking at her, but that seemed irrelevant. Tina walked seductively across the room, smiling at the girl she had chosen.

But more importantly their are my psi sisters.  When people are tested for psionic potential they are done so in groups of three.  Those who test positive have an unbreakable mental bond and are known as your psi brothers or psi sisters.  When Marie, Olesya and I were tested we all tested positive and such are forever connected.  As for what Babbingtree did, about a week ago the three of us came in here.  I don't even remember why now.  He gave us each a costume.  Marie had a elf costume and Olesya had a devil.  Mine was a farmer.  They had put theirs on while I was still working on mine.  They gave shouts as they transformed.  Babbingtree  tree rushed in, his thoughts were so loud we didn't even need to try and read them.  He planned for the mental changes to make us our outfits.  But our minds were to strong, and they resisted the mental change.  He imprisoned them somewhere while I escaped and have lived up here ever since.\"<br>\r\n\"But what did he plan to do to you?\" Tina asked.<br>\r\nSomewhere in the shop is a portal.  If you go through it you end up in a new world with a new life, built around whatever your costume made you into.  But it doesn't work if your mind is free.  As for why he does this, your guess is as good mine.  But I do know that he must be stopped.\"<br>\r\n\"But if that's true then, Liza and Heather!  He'll send them through!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Liza already thinks she's a nurse and the power of the cave girl costume are slowly eating at Heather's mind.  But there is still some time.  He tends to keep people for a few days before they go through.  We can still save them.\"<br>\r\n\"Will you help me?
