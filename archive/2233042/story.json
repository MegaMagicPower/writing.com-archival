She's very sweet and kind, but secret wishes to dominate those around her. Due to her height, she is somewhat shy, but that would change if she suddenly became bigger and stronger than everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Amy<br>\r\nAmy is a popular girl. Standing at 5'9\", she is on the taller side. Her father is a scientist so she is also rich. She is very snooty and gets everything handed to her. If Amy wants something, it's going to be hers even if she puts no work into getting it. </span></div></div>",

Amy knows nothing else, of course and is highly snooty because of it. Amy is also the most popular and pretty girl in school. Many boys want to be with her, but she tends to turn them down because they're below her in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after coming home she looked for her father in his lab, but couldn't find her. She proceeded to look around at his things out of curiosity. There was nothing that interested her until she found a vial. It was labeled 'unstable'. Amy had no idea what it was and just looked at it for awhile. She was curious and felt like drinking it. Nothing her father works with is deadly so she figured it would be fine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy's curiosity got the better of her. She drank a small sip of the vial. For a bit nothing happened and so she put it back, shrugged, and went upstairs to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on her phone, ignoring her school work, and proceeded to chat up a few boys she was never going to date. That's when she felt an odd feeling come over her. She put her phone down and felt her forehead. She was burning up. That's when she closed her eyes for a moment and felt a surge. Amy suddenly felt better... not just better, but the best she's ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked around her room. She could've sworn everything got smaller. Amy decided she wanted some food, maybe that was the cause of the quick fever. She tried to leave her room, but fell back as she bonked her head on the door frame. That's when she realized she was taller now because of the vial. She quickly ducked under the door frame and found a tape measure. She was 6'6\", almost a full foot taller than she originally was. Her clothes still fit her, but they were all skin tight or revealing now. Amy didn't mind that one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of devious ideas went through her head. She felt so much stronger and bigger now that she was taller than everyone else.</span></div></div>",

My dad isn't home and I don't think he will be home for awhile.\" She asked. \"Uh, sure. I'll be there soon!\" Brad expressed with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad rang the doorbell and parked outside. Amy answered the door. Brad expected her to he eye level, but had to quickly look up. He stands at 5'7\", which is a little short for a man, but Amy's new spark of dominance wants a shorter man. \"Hey, Amy!\" Brad said in shock. Amy pulled him inside, Brad being almost powerless to stop her. \"H-how did this happen? We were eye level this morning?\" Brad asked confused. \"My dad's a scientist and he likes to make sure I feel like a princess, but his most recent invention makes me feel more like a queen.\" Amy told him as she picked him up and pinned him to the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Amy what is this?\" Brad asked a little scared. \"Don't you want a girlfriend?\" Amy asked biting her lip. \"Y-you like me?\" Brad asked. \"Of course I do, Brad. I think we'd make a great couple.\" Amy told him. Brad leaned in for a kiss, and Amy kissed him back. She felt wonderful. Her lips were much bigger than his. Amy pushed her body up against his. Brad felt great, but Amy felt so much better. Brad was so powerless against her. The heat from his body was pleasuring her so much. This newfound height of hers made her want... no crave power. </span></div></div>",
