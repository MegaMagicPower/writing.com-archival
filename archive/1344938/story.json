Like the proverbial lost walking around in circles, the girls had stumbled blindly in the darkness of the previous night in search of their village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding themselves in a clearing with fences and signposts that spurted from the ground like weeds, a feeling of deja-vu hovered over them like a thick fog until they realized, they had passed upon this place before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis clearing, devoid of citizens, livestock and houses (including similar dwellings such as dog houses and chicken coops) was all that remained of the girls' bustling community.  Where homes once stood, a patchwork of flat geometric patterns of every size and deformation meandered across the landscape.  This image seemingly projected an optical illusion that refused to go away by casually altering one's perception with a blink or a shift in the stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazzoos, a teenage boy who had grown up alongside the girls, had fallen asleep outdoors, still unaware that the world around him had changed.  Leanna found him slumbering on top of a pile of dry crinkly leaves hidden beneath an old oak's voluminous shade.  Gently, she tapped his shoulder and beseechingly whispered his name until he opened a pair of crusty eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Coona picked out the clear spot where her nuptial home to be would have been had the wedding celebrations concluded as expected.  Shaken by the lack of resistance that her mind and body half expected, the unconsummated bride walked through areas where brick walls once stood and fell to the ground heaving and wailing.  Drawn by her unrelenting cries, Fashi -- a large black dog -- approached to whimper her sympathy.</span></div></div>",

So accustomed to walking along the roads and pathways, he willed himself to take a step into the square where his brother's home once lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no words to describe his feelings as he criss crossed the hole in the ground, only more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagly, his favorite dog, strode up to his side.  She didn't seem to mind the empty vastness that he found so disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rubbed her face into his thigh, it occurred to him that she was begging for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, girl, but I don't have anything to give you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two girls nodded in agreement. They all rumaged around the farmland and found tidbits of crops, and Hagly was lucky enough to find a dead chicken in the coop for them all to share. Although the portions were small, they didn`t complain, nor did they speak about anything at all the whole meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards they decided to...</span></div></div>",

Come on, let's go!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stroked the top of her head and cupped her jowls.  Hagly pulled her head away from the uncomfortable embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The prey is waiting.

We were lost in the woods until morning.  Don't you think we should let them return before lighting a fire for them.\"  To make the shrine holy, the builders would have to leave the site once the pyre was lit.

He could see the vast wasteland that resulted from Imra's foul magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Very, very bad,' he thought to himself.  It was too late to report to his master.  There was nothing he or the other Gods could do now.  So Flandris sat, anxiously, to see what might happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, the young man called Hazzoos was talking to his dog.  Two of the girls were building a small holy shrine.  At the outskirts of the village border, a pack of dogs howled for lost companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlandris' slight figure trembled as a breeze blew past his leaf.  Like a shadowy laugh, the sound echoed across the leaves, sending goosebumps up and down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvisible but not undetectable, Flandris fled.  With a leap to the nearest slip wind, he glided to a nearby tree.</span></div></div>",
