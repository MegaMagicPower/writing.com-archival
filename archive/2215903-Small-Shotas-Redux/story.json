The shota might have even accidentally destroyed the experiment that leaves him permanently shrunken in his house full of female relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExposure to Virus, Sickness, or Chemical: The shota, along with the rest of his boy daycare classmates his age, is affected by an unknown agent. Whether a virus, sickness, or chemical, the exposure leaves him and his classmates an inch tall with no one to rely on but the female daycare staff and/or their female relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysical Genetic Disorder: The shota is born with a reversal pituitary gland which shrinks his physical body as he grows older, including his muscles, organs, and skeleton. At the age of seven, the shota stands as tall as an adult pinkie finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly Puberty: The shota is born with a genetic disorder which causes him to shrink by five inches permanently when he is aroused.

For you, six-year-old Tony Sawyer, there is nothing better than seeing what your scientist neighbor has come up with now. You are a frequent visitor to Dr. Leonhardt\u2019s basement laboratory, where she shows off her latest inventions, and sometimes even gives you samples to use at home. This is what you are hoping for today as she holds the bottle before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u201d, she says triumphantly, \u201cis the world\u2019s most powerful shrinking formula. A few spoonfuls can render anyone a few inches tall. Not only that, but while shrunk, the drinker becomes incredibly durable. They can withstand enormous pressure that would kill them at regular size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this mean\u201d, you ask, \u201cthat they can\u2019t feel pain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly\u201d, Dr. Leonhardt replies. \u201cThey won\u2019t die, but that doesn\u2019t mean things don\u2019t hurt. When I was testing this out the first time, a bowling ball fell on me. I wasn\u2019t permanently damaged, but the pain made me wish I was dead.\u201d She sees the gleam in your eyes, and knows what you\u2019re going to ask next. \u201cI\u2019ll let you have this bottle if you promise to be careful with it. And don\u2019t use it just yet. The antidote takes a long time to finish, and it won\u2019t be ready for a few days.\u201d She hands the bottle to you, and you excitedly thank her before hurrying home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk back to your house, you contemplate how you are going to use your new tonic. You are on the small side for your age, and this has become rather annoying, especially at home, given that your mom and your sister loom large over you. You always resented not being blessed with their height, as the size discrepancy has made for many awkward moments...like the typical greeting you are about to receive as you walk through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon setting foot in the hallway, a pink flash with curly red hair shoots out in front of you, and you are tackled by your eight-year-old sister Megan. The two of you rarely fight; in fact, Megan often tries to act like a second mom to you. You just get tired of the constant babying and urging you to play dolls with her. You squirm out of her grip, exasperated. If you wanted to be welcomed home this way every day, you\u2019d convince your mom to get you a dog. At least it wouldn\u2019t nearly strangle you so tight, and it would probably be more intelligent. You start on your way, but Megan\u2019s voice cuts through the air, and you brace for an even more uncomfortable receipt of affection:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMO-OM! TONY\u2019S HOME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rumbles slightly, and you look up to see your mother, Betty Ann, stampeding towards you with her arms outstretched. When not charging at you full-speed, your mother is ordinarily quite a pretty woman, with short brown hair, and deep blue eyes. Aside from being decidedly beautiful, *almost* everything about her was big. Big eyes, big lips, big hands, big feet, big bosom, big hips, big butt, big heart...and tiny brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s Mommy\u2019s little boy!\u201d she exclaims as she scoops you up and stuffs your face into her ample chest. \u201cHow was your day today, honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmmph! Grrrrgle!</i> was all you could manage as you struggle to escape. She finally pulls you out to give you a series of big, wet kisses before opening her arms and practically dropping you on the floor. You get to your feet, dizzy, dripping with sweat and gasping for breath. What your mom lacks in intelligence, she more than makes up for in affection. She loves spending time with you and your sister, and never hesitates to join Megan in playing with her dolls or you with your action figures (and sometimes you find her playing with them herself when she thinks nobody is watching). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trudge upstairs to your room, and set the vial of shrinking potion on your nightstand. You decide that you will make yourself the big one in the house for once. As much as you love your family, you\u2019ve had it with girly games and suffocating hugs. You decide to wait until Dr. Leonhardt can give you the antidote in case anything goes wrong. You want to shrink your family temporarily to be in charge for a while, but also want to make sure no real harm comes to them either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, while watching TV, you start to feel a slight unease. As time wears on, it grows worse and you gradually feel sicker, before you nearly collapse on the floor, your strength completely sapped. Your mother notices this, and comes over to you, a look of concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you poor baby,\u201d she says as she feels your forehead. \u201cYou must have caught the flu. It\u2019s straight into bed with you.\u201d Your mom carries you to your room where she tucks you into bed, then leaves to grab some medicine from the bathroom. A few minutes later, she comes back with a small blue bottle. \u201cHere,\u201d she says, \u201cThis will help you feel better.\u201d She gives you a few spoonfuls before placing the bottle on the nightstand. \u201cI\u2019ll give you more tomorrow. For now, try to get some sleep.\u201d She gives you a kiss on your cheek before turning out the light and leaving the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you wake up, still a little weak, but feeling much better. Your door opens, and your mother comes in, a warm, concerned smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, sweetie,\u201d she calls out. \u201cHow\u2019s my little angel feeling?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little better today, Mom,\u201d you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she declares. \u201cIt must have been a 24-hour bug. Still, you should probably have a bit more medicine just to be sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Megan comes bounding into your room. \u201cHey, little bro,\u201d she says, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lot better today,\u201d your mom replies. \u201cMegan, honey, can you hand me the medicine bottle? It\u2019s over there on the nightstand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Mom.\u201d Megan reaches back and pulls a bottle off the nightstand behind her and hands it to your mom, before skipping back out of the room. Your mom pours the liquid into a spoon, which she sticks into your mouth. She gives you a few more spoonfuls before replacing the cap. \u201cThere now,\u201d she says. \u201cYou should be feeling much better now. I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes to check on you.\u201d She kisses your cheek before leaving to return the bottle to the medicine cabinet. You turn around and freeze in horror as your eyes rest on the label of the unused bottle sitting on the nightstand: COLD AND FLU MEDICINE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat means...the bottle Megan grabbed...the stuff your mom poured down your throat...that was.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling rapidly stretches upwards, and you turn around to see your now gigantic pillow. You see your action figures on a nearby shelf, and judge yourself to be about a head shorter. You must be about the size of one of Megan\u2019s doll children. Suddenly, your bed shakes with the rhythmic vibration of thundering footsteps. Just like those Godzilla movies you enjoy, an enormous creature rapidly approaches. But instead of a terrifying, monstrous giant lizard, you are now facing down a terrifying, monstrous giant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother walks across the room, oblivious to the earthquake she is causing you to feel. \ud83c\udfb5 \u201cMommy\u2019s here!\u201d\ud83c\udfb5 she sings cheerfully. \u201cYoo-hoo! Tony? Where are you?\u201d She reaches your bed and looks down for her son.</span></div></div>",

Her D cup-sized breasts and her assets large enough to fit inside a large salad bowl jiggled with every click of her black heels. Her bulging belly stretched her lingerie to her buttons. Her great, pink lips parted as her mouth opened wide to let out a roaring yawn. She flipped her dark, pitch-black hair over her shoulder, the bangs cut across where her eyebrows should have been. It was a hell of a night, Angela figured, and she made plenty of money for a pole dance and a few lap dances. Those rolls of cash in her purse was evident enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela was a stripper who worked at the XXX Bombshells Strip Club in the back streets of the city. She had a reputation for living up to the strip club\u2019s name because she was an absolute bombshell of a woman for her age and figure. At the same time, she also had a reputation for being welcoming, motherly, and arousing. She was pretty much the great leader of the other girls in the club even though her manager was the one calling the shots. If there was one thing that any girl wanting to strip off their clothes and dance around the pole would want, it was to be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Angela passed the bus stop, she heard the wailing of a baby. She stopped and tracked the noise where it came from, case in point, inside a little box. Angela carefully uncovered the box and gasped, seeing both the tiny baby Benny and the note that came with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou poor baby, come here,\u201d Angela cooed as she gently scooped up the box and cupped it to her breasts. She gently shushed the baby, rocking the box back and forth and bobbing in place to soothe little Benny\u2019s cries. \u201cThere there, it\u2019s okay, little one. There\u2019s no reason to be afraid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby eventually stopped crying. Benny opened up one eye, and the first thing he saw was a mature giantess looking down at him with a wide smile. The baby happily gurgled and giggled, reaching up towards the giantess. Angela responded by reaching down a giant finger, big enough for Benny to grasp both hands on the ridged edge of her finger alone. Feeling tired and fatigued after being left by his real mommy and being acquainted with his new mommy, Benny yawned and fell into a warm sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt melted Angela\u2019s heart to see the baby sleep so peacefully in the box carried in both her hands. \u201cPoor baby, he shouldn\u2019t even be here,\u201d Angela determined. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta get you out of here. Whoever put you here obviously hasn\u2019t realized we\u2019re next to a bad neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand parting her enormous cleavage, Angela gently placed the box containing the tiny baby Benny in between her gentle breasts. After a few squeezes and adjustments, the box was safely contained in Angela\u2019s cleavage, holding it and the young occupant inside firmly. Then Angela strode right away to her apartment complex a few blocks down, her boobs rocking the baby to sleep with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After setting her purse down, Angela reached in and gently plucked the box from between her breasts. Her movement thankfully hadn\u2019t woken up her new baby occupant. She couldn\u2019t help but swoon over Benny with how he looked with that slightest tuft it black hair on his hair, how cute he was sleeping in her palm, how innocent he was in a cruel and merciless world where he was left by what could have been a good mother, but was left to starve and die in the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou poor baby. I can\u2019t believe anyone would do that to you, to leave you out in the streets in the middle of the night to leave you to starve or catch your death of cold,\u201d Angela cooed the baby. After spending so much time using her sultry ASMR voice to patrons in the club, she figured her voice would soothe the baby to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, baby, because Mama Angie will take care of you,\u201d Angela vowed to Benny. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a good mama to you than your real mama. I\u2019m gonna raise you into a fine little man, and I\u2019m gonna make sure no one hurts you. I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela gently brought Benny up to her enormous face and lowered her puckered lips. She gave the thumb-sized boy a quick, loving peck on his entire head. The baby stirred but didn\u2019t waken. Angela carries the boy to her bedroom and placed him on her nightstand. After freshening herself up for the evening, Angela gave one more kiss to her new tiny son and fell into a quick sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She was at a crossroads earlier, debating whether or not to bring Benny to XXX Bombshells seeing as how he was a baby and a minor. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t trust anyone in her apartment to look after him, not even her landlady. So she resorted to risk breaking the law by bringing the tiny boy along and explaining the situation to the girls and her manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered through the rear entrance where it was an easier access to the dressing room. When she entered the dressing room, five of her \u201cgirls\u201d -all young women who were younger than 35 that she personally taught and trained in stripping and dancing- were all getting ready for their graveyard shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong them was Tierra, a 32 year-old African American woman with chocolate skin, long, wavy black hair, an hourglass figure, and thick, jiggling boobs and glutes; Sofia, a 28 year-old Latina woman with a beautiful face, a slightly thick figure with C cup breasts; Emily, a 25 year-old cute redhead who lacked the curves of her fellow dancers but more than made up for in her flexibility and hypnotic dance moves; Julia, a beautiful and sexy 27 year-old brunette whose hair, boobs, and glutes were second to Tierra\u2019s; and Mary, a sexy 35 year-old blonde who was ditzy and sometimes oblivious, but not when it came to strip dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook who decided to show up an hour early,\u201d greeted Tierra, watching her mentor enter the room through the mirror while applying her mascara. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mama?

Girls, could you come around, please? I need to show you all something.\u201d The other five strippers gathered around Angela as she gently fished the little object from her cleavage. She held out the little box in the palm of her hand and showed the tiny baby inside, who yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaaawwwwww!\u201d The strippers all exclaimed, their hearts melted by his cuteness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s so adorable!\u201d Emily observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Benny. That\u2019s what it said on the note, anyway,\u201d Angela answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you get him from?\u201d Mary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found him in that box lying in the street,\u201d Angela explained. \u201cThere was no one else to come to his rescue, so I took him home with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean he was abandoned?\u201d asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you poor thing,\u201d Sofia cooed sadly, gently rubbing his face with her finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry because your new Mama is gonna take care of you. And we\u2019ll help take of you too, isn\u2019t that right, girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other girls agreed on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if we can,\u201d a concerned Angela said. \u201cThis is why I have to take this up with Meryl and see if she is onboard with me taking care of Benny. This isn\u2019t exactly an appropriate environment for children like him, you know, and I can\u2019t ask anyone in my apartment to watch over him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what if one of us take care of him for you?\u201d Emily suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, or we can all pitch in and take turns bringing him to our own home,\u201d Mary pitched in her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if the strip club is no place to raise a tiny child like Benny, we can still find a way to raise him like our own,\u201d Tierra stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, girls, I appreciate you all trying to help, but...\u201d Angela looked down at the tiny boy resting in her palm, \u201c...he\u2019s already seen me as his Mama, and I promised to take care of him. If I don\u2019t do something to help him, then I don\u2019t know what to do next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door knocked, and in walked a woman older than Angela herself. She was a sexy 60 year-old GILF whose slightly complexion and slim figure had not been altered by time or medical science. Her short hair was pixie cut and parted towards the right side of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlaces, girls, this is gonna be a busy night,\u201d Meryl, the manager and owner of the strip coin said before finally noticing the newer arrival. \u201cOh, Angela, you\u2019re here early. Is there something I can help you with...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeryl\u2019s eyes widened at the sight of the tiny baby boy sleeping in the soft palms of her oldest employee. She couldn\u2019t help but gasp and cover her mouth in shock as she took a step back. \u201cWhat is that..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeryl, you and I need to discuss something,\u201d Angela said with urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Eric never questioned their love because he would never be here, but not to say for her absence from his life since he was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric\u2019s dad told him Athena had to leave because they were in love and conceived him, but the customs from where she came from were too demanding to the point where they would take legal action against him and his newborn son. So Athena reluctantly had to leave her beloved and her son behind to return home, leaving him to raise little Eric on his own. It was a tough road, but he did by with a paying job that ensured his son\u2019s future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew up to resemble his father when he was younger, with a short head of black hair, but he inherited his mother\u2019s silver eyes and wisdom which got him through school. He was also a wiz at playing strategy games like Checkers and Risk. He was surrounded by good friends and he stuck by them no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day after school, everything drastically changed when Eric was getting out of school when he noticed a shadow fall over him and his school. He stood in frozen terror as a rally of giant armored feminine figures, around fifty feet in size, descended over him and his school, surrounding the entire building, and entrapping the other panicked students and faculty with their imposing sizes and their intimidating eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the armored giantesses landed, another giantess taller and older than the others by twenty feet, descended, but this one was robed with a maternal air around her. Her large eyes fell onto the frightened Eric and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you must be the boy,\u201d the giantess said. \u201cYou definitely have your mother\u2019s bearing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou know my mommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. How can I not see my sister\u2019s flesh and blood within you?\u201d The giantess crouched to a squat and cupped her hand on both sides of the boy. \u201cNow come, we must leave. There is too much to do in such a short time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what are you...!?\u201d Before Eric could finish, the giantess swept her cupped hand underneath his body and lifted him up, curling her fingers around him so he couldn\u2019t jump or fall off. \u201cWait! What are you doing!? Where are you taking me!? Let me go!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will explain everything on the way, child, but we cannot linger much longer,\u201d the giantess hurriedly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t wanna go with you, I wanna see my daddy!\u201d Eric cried, thrashing, struggling to escape the giantess\u2019s clutches and run back home. \u201cPlease, stop, I don\u2019t wanna go with you! Please stop it! Stop it!! Didn\u2019t you hear me!?!? I said <b>STOP IT!!!! LET ME OFF RIGHT NOW!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, his entire tone of voice rang out like a dark echo and the giantess froze in her spot. She among the other giantesses stiffened hope like they were suddenly afraid, and it showed on the expression on their faces. Suddenly, the captor giantess turned and gently lowered the boy back to the ground, releasing her grip and slightly elevating them to let the boy back onto the green grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she, plus all the giantesses did something that shocked him and everyone witnessing these events: they went down on one knee and bowed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, my young king.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else, the staff and the students all gasped when they addressed him as their king. Even Eric couldn\u2019t believe what was happening to him. First he was almost kidnapped by a giant woman, then he ordered them to put him down and they instantly obeyed, and now he was being addressed like he was their ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat... how... I... I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Eric stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller giantess sighed with discontent. \u201cPerhaps we should explain everything now... and perhaps we should have <i>him</i> join us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and everyone else trapped in the school was still reeling back from the shocking revelation. Everyone knew Eric grew up without a mother, but none of them even thought that she was some kind of queen in a race of giant women. And Eric knew that his future was in jeopardy as he was thrust from being an ordinary elementary school student to becoming the sole ruler of a race of giant...</span></div></div>",

Their skin was made of an array of smooth blue-indigo-violet scales, but the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet was as soft as any Earthling flesh. Their hair had a certain coloration, with three different colors from their roots to the edge of those strands, making them appear they were wearing an aurora borealis veil on their heads. The irises of their eyes shone a similar spectrum with their hair, but sparkling like the stars in the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach soldier wore armor that was reminiscent of the mythical Amazons, but in a cyberpunk style. Their outer armor, which included their helms and breastplates, their gauntlets and tassets, and greaves were white and composed of an invincible adamant metal, embedded with glowing orbs which powered their protection against explosions and most laser blasts. Underneath, their dark padded armor was thick enough to repel any physical attack or bullets. Each soldier carried a trident made of a gold-like material with a more metallic sheen, equipped at the base of each prong with a smaller red glowing orb inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess that nearly kidnapped him was a sky blue giantess who stood taller than all the other soldiers by twenty feet, whose hair was an aurora of yellow, lime green, and shamrock green. A pure white bar levitated over her shoulders, draping her body and her arms with a light blue mantle which reached to her feet, clad in transparent open toed wedge shoes. Her pinkie toe alone was a head taller than the average adult height. A gleaming golden hem decorated the end of her sleeves, around her collar, and around the bottom of her robe. Distinct white markings decorated the sides of the robe around the body and sleeves, and the front of her robe had a certain pattern to it no one else would understand except for the giantess and her royal family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir technology surpassed any of that of Earths technology by a landslide. Their spacecraft was anything beyond the stereotypical flying saucer. In fact, the only spacecraft the giantesses arrived in resembled a top like the one in Inception. This was only scratching the surface of what the M\u2019Zahnian race was capable of.</span></div></div>",

It would involve a boy who actually visits or lives depending on what you wanna do, on an island filled with giant monster sized girls, specifically lolis but can include more older fellas, and those giantesses have kaiju like powers. Who knows what their world is or what they do, but all we know for certain is that boy is like a bug to the many giantesses before him. How could this play out, well its all up to you. Can involve furries, but would like to do some human giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternative Reality: You wake up in an alternative reality where women ruled the entire world. They run the governments and have control of all major aspects of life, men are seen as lesser than equals and are usually slaves or even worse. All women are of various heights, but are always bigger than the guys. How do you view this new world is up to you just like with the kaiju island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what you wanna do?</span></div></div>",

The island has massive trees, lush lakes and rivers along with many breathtaking mountain views. There is so much to this island that it would be simple to say it is a paradise, and a paradise it is. However, there is one massive catch, a catch that no one would ever expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the forest lies massive sized girls, specifically younger girls that stand around depending on age and height around 100-300ft tall. These girls were massive in height and scale, and there is even more to them as well. These girls often wear just swimsuits or bra-panties combo, and they also have powers as well. Some breath fire, some have laser eyes, but a few things are common, is that they all can breath underwater, roar like monsters, and are immune to any weapon man can throw at them. Rumor has it that the government was creating them, but that story can be something that can be explained later, but what is true is that they live on this island. What these girls do, well that is a mystery, but they are government watched and of course they were aided by the government. Rumor has it they are making a theme park for the girls, but for now the girls roam the island monster sized with their lives there. More on details of that later, but the concept here is simple. You are an 11 year old boy name Kei, and you have ended up on this island one way or another. Kei Tatoi has bluish black hair almost like Max from Pokemon, and is seen wearing various outfits (not girly outfits in case anyone ask now), but for his body, he is attractive for a guy his age. Good muscles, very athletic, and is attractive with his green eyes. Many girls will surely want the tiny guy. He is roughly 5ft tall, on average for an 11 year old boy. He does get along all the girls great, some more than others, but he loves giant monsters like Godzilla and what not, so perhaps someone would like to be his Godzilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, in addition, they are also other types of giant girls, like furies and hell even robots, though most are human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is the first scenario on how he ends up on this island. He ends up inheriting this island somehow and lives with the giant monster sized girls, so he is used to being around them. Wanna do that?</span></div></div>",

There he was told that his father died and in his will left him this strange island along with all of the riches on it.

But in terms of monsters, it So happens to be.... giant girls, mostly young girls. They tower buildings and are the size of kaijus, Immune to many weapons, etc. Kei and his mom were in shock and was afraid at first, but eventually they decided to settle in on the island and take the inheritance. And well, let\u2019s just say that Kei\u201ds life got interesting from that point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kei was releasing, he suddenly feels the ground emit a little thud. Kei smiled as he was used to this by now, and he felt it got stronger a few more times as the ground shook. A giantess was approaching, and it emitted a very girly but monstrous roar. The trees also shook and various birds were seen flying into the air. Soon, a shadow was cast above the little boy, with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the mysterious girl?

He recognized their spears, their swords, and their glorious shields. Timmy\u2019s mommy told him bedtime stories about the legends of the Greek Amazons, their home island on Themyscira, and their queen, Hippolyta. He was elated to hear that the island was the home of their princess, Diana, the world-renowned superheroine, Wonder Woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy always wanted to visit Themyscira and meet the Amazons himself, but the island/country of Themyscira had a strict rule about men setting foot on the island. This rule also stemmed down to little boys, too. Personally, he had every right to be frightened about this than he was now. First of all, the Amazons were strict and absolute. They followed their duty down to a T. Anyone with an XY chromosome (except for a few exceptions) would either be captured, kept prisoner, or be brought back to the World of Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reason is that Timmy was so small, the giantesses didn\u2019t even see him on the ground. The lead soldier, a black woman unknowingly marched towards Timmy\u2019s position, trailed by a few others. Her sandaled foot raised in the air to take another step, right on top of Timmy. The boy screamed as he rolled away before the sandaled foot fell on that spot, watching the deep foot-shaped impression pressed into the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Timmy looked back and did the same thing with the oncoming giant feet, rolling away and yelping while avoiding from being flattened under the soles of the giant Amazonian warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a waste of our time,\u201d addressed the redheaded giantess, Artemis of the Bana-Mighdall. \u201cWhoever the man Menalippe spoke of to our queen would not dare wish to remain on the island without invoking the Amazon\u2019s wrath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leading armored black woman and turned to the impatient Amazon. \u201cBe still your tongue and your impatience, Artemis,\u201d General Phillipus ordered firmly. \u201cMenalippe has never led us astray with her clairvoyance. She spoke of a son of Man\u2019s World would wash upon the shores of Themiscyra, so our orders are to find this son and report him to the queen without prejudice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis scoffed. \u201cFine. So if this son of Man\u2019s World is here, then where has he ended up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps he has wandered off into the forest?\u201d Phillipus guessed. \u201cAny son from Man\u2019s World would be curious... or foolish enough to enter the forest without knowing what creatures lurk within the trees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he did, then we would see fresh tracks leading into the woods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Amazons debated the skepticism of the predictions of their fellow Amazonian oracle, unbeknownst to them at their feet, Timmy watched and listened to it all. He didn\u2019t understand what an oracle was, or why they were looking for him. Maybe it was because he washed up on shore. As he was an eight year-old boy, Timmy first figured that him being there meant he would be subjected to the Amazons\u2019 harsh treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his size, the Amazons wouldn\u2019t even try to treat him badly! Maybe they\u2019d squish him underneath their feet, swallow him hole, or do whatever torturous methods ran through his thoughts. At that point, Timmy knew what he had to do. </span></div></div>",

So the boy reached the sandal-clad foot of one of Themyscira\u2019s most formidable warriors. Her sole emanated a certain fruity, coconut-y scent. She must take special care of her feet while in the shower, Timmy figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis timing couldn\u2019t be any more impeccable because as soon as he reached Artemis\u2019s left foot, Philippus up above ordered her troops to move. Timmy barely had time to hold on tight when Artemis\u2019s left foot rose up and fell in a march. Each rise and fall was as scary as the last. It was like holding on the side of a roller coaster: a dangerous, adrenaline-pumping experience which made Timmy scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one certain turn to the right, Artemis unknowingly flung the one-inch boy with her foot. The fling sent Timmy at a maximum height of nearly ten stories, which was like up to the knees Amazons. Timmy screamed the whole way as he flew a great distance into nowhere. All of a sudden, he landed on something soft. The softness cushioned his fall, but he didn\u2019t know where he landed.

Timmy yelped when he saw and immediately jumped out of the way of a blonde Amazons\u2019 sandaled foot. The foot landed just as the tiny eight year-old landed headfirst in a small pile of sand. He managed to shake his way out of the sand, but for a split second, he completely forgot to take into account the giantess whose sandal he hitched onto was literally a step behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Timmy heard one of her footsteps from behind him, he and the pile of sand was suddenly scooped up by a flat, leathery surface. Timmy felt like he was on a slide for just a split surface just before he felt a soft but immense amount of pressure on his back, wedging him between two giant feminine digits. With it, Timmy was held tight between two of Artemis\u2019s goes and forcibly, unknowingly, and unwillingly carried along for the rough ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of that fruity and coconut-y was stronger here. The power of Artemis\u2019s toes clenched the boy between the big toe and the index toe. Timmy screamed as he was subjected to an intensely scary front row seat to the rise and fall of Artemis\u2019s foot without anything else to safely strap himself in. The toes loosened slightly with every rise and then they clenched tightly with every fall. The impact knocked Timmy around a little, enough to disorient him and give him a dizzying headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Timmy wasn\u2019t the only one who felt he was knocking around with each footfall. Not long after her debate with Phillipus, Artemis was only several steps into the March when she felt something irritating her left foot. With each step, she felt something in between two of her clenching toes and opted to do something about it. She decided to wriggle her toes, manipulate her digits to push away the tiny obstruction between her foot and her sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, she made a one-inch young boy suffer through it all. The tiny eight year old screamed as suddenly, midway throughout the walk from hell, the giantess wriggled her toes on top of him. The two toes that trapped him smothered Timmy\u2019s tiny body underneath the powerful digits. The five titanic toes squished him against the sandal\u2019s flat. With each little wriggle, Timmy ended up getting squishing him further and further down and deeper underneath the soft and scented sole. Out of desperation, the crying tiny boy beat against the skin of the foot and hit right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis suddenly grunted at the sharp pain underneath her foot. Perhaps she accidentally picked up a biting ant in her sandal? She wriggled the ball of her foot and pressed it harder against the obstruction in her sandal. It was really wriggling underneath her foot. It felt rather nice, if Artemis was being honest with herself, but it was getting in the way of her march. She stopped her march to loosen up her foot from her sandal and tapped the toe section to force the little bug out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending her discomfort, Philippus halted her company and turned to the high-ranking red-haired Amazon foolishly staying behind just to adjust her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere had better be a reason for you to be falling out of rank, Artemis,\u201d the general addressed her, to which Artemis replied...</span></div></div>",

I need to check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fierce and suspicious Artemis lifted her foot up and held it sideways. By squeezing the leather sandal, Artemis was able to create an opening between the flat and the underside of her foot so the little bug that bit her would roll out and into her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy, on the other hand, recently experienced neck-breaking vertigo when Artemis tapped her toe section, trying to force him out from under her foot. Thanks to the soft yet firm hold of Artemis\u2019s foot skin, the tiny eight year-old was kept from being thrown out into the sand and possibly stomped on by the giantess. In the midst of being battered, bruised, and disoriented by the ignorant giantess\u2019s feet, Timmy felt the urge to puke from the intense dizziness. Even that didn\u2019t stop him from feeling everything rise up and turn on its side. All of a sudden, the squeezing pressure between her foot and the sandal suddenly gaped open as Timmy felt himself sliding backwards then rolling from underneath the ball, the overbearing toes, and then into the soft, calloused hand of the giantess who unknowingly tormented him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy coughed and sputtered as the palm he crouched on was lifted to the level of the stern green eyes of the fierce Amazonian warrior. As soon as the tiny boy looked into those giant, seemingly hostile eyes, the boy screamed and curled in a fetal position, turning away from Artemis\u2019s gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d Timmy cried as the other gigantic Amazonian soldiers marched up to him and Artemis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArtemis, what is that in your hand?\u201d Philippus demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently, I found the fabled son of Man\u2019s World, but he is nothing more now than a bug that found its way into my shoe,\u201d Artemis answered, holding the scared one-inch boy out to Philippus and the other Amazons to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is an unusual development,\u201d the blonde Amazon, Persephone said. \u201cAll children shouldn\u2019t be so small, they\u2019d have to fit inside an Amazon\u2019s shoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he truly is the son of Man\u2019s World, then we must report him to the queen at once,\u201d Philippus reminded her troops about the mission. She then extended her palm to the red-haired Amazon. \u201cArtemis, please give him to me so we can ensure him safe escort. Being trapped under your foot seems to have scared him to death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis didn\u2019t hesitate to answer. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d she said, dumping the suddenly surprised boy into Philippus\u2019s awaiting hand, \u201cbut only because I don\u2019t want him biting any part of my body again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy tumbled around the darker giantess\u2019s palm, barely having any time to get up as she gently curled her fingers and trapped him in her fist. \u201cForgive me, child, but the queen has ordered us to take you to her personally,\u201d Philippus said, reaching for a small drawstring sack on her belt, \u201cand this is the only way for me to safely escort you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippus moves the boy between her fingers, pinched his shirt between three of her fingers and her thumb, and dangled him over the opening of the sack. Timmy screamed and wriggled in the grip as the giant chocolate digits held him over the yawning abyss of the sack\u2019s opening; he was terrified of the dark. The screams got louder as Philippus powered him down into the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOO!!! Please don\u2019t put in there! I\u2019ll be good, I promise, just don\u2019t put me in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Philippus didn\u2019t listen. She gently inserted the tiny screaming boy into the sack, and by loosening her fingers, she felt the boy fall to the bottom. She then drew the drawstring close and tight, leaving the opening slightly ajar to let in air for her bite-sized prisoner. With a simple command, Philippus and her troops marched for the queen\u2019s palace in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the sack on Philippus\u2019s thigh, Timmy was once again subjected to motions of a giantess\u2019s march. It wasn\u2019t as bad as getting trapped underneath Artemis\u2019s scented feet in her sandal, but he was still getting motion sickness from this experience. What\u2019s worse is that now that he was discovered, he\u2019d be taken to the queen. She would probably keep him for a slave or a toy for torment! She\u2019d lock him in a cage somewhere dark and damp with very little light to reach him. At the very least, she\u2019d send him back to Man\u2019s World with nothing and no one to look after him. Whatever the queen decided, it would change his very life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Timmy decided to stay in the sack and await his fate. The opening of the drawstring sack was too high and too steep to reach, and the movements of his gigantic captor was making staying in one place difficult. Even if he did attempt an escape, Timmy would most likely be spotted by the giant Amazons and quickly be recaptured. As best as he could, he curled up in the bottom of the savor and felt the motions of Philippus\u2019s thigh rock him gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last, after his giant captor finally stopped did Timmy feel a primal fear lodge in his throat. The small legion of giantesses finally made it into the palace. Timmy could only curl up and listen as the dark-skinned addressed the high royalty outside the sack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy queen, we have found and brought the son of Man\u2019s World to you, as you ordered,\u201d Philippus reported to Queen Hippolyta, ruler of the Amazons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have brought me news of your capture, general, yet I do not see him with you,\u201d Queen Hippolyta observed. \u201cTell me, where have you taken the son of Man\u2019s World when I have specifically ordered you to bring him to me directly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Queen, there has been an... unexpected development.\u201d Timmy flinched as daylight broke into the bag the same instance the drawstring was loosened. He barely had time to adjust to the brightness, but from the light, a giant ebony hand with five imposing fingers curled up around him, enveloping him all around in soft flesh. Then he felt the hand lift him out of the confines of the sack, turn him over onto her palm, and felt the fingers loosen and spread out, revealing him to the outside world... to the regal, brunette giantess staring down at him from the throne with a bewildered look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is indeed unexpected,\u201d Hippolyta concurred. \u201cI would never expect a child from Man\u2019s World to be small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was like this when we found him, highness,\u201d Philippus reported. \u201cHe was like this battered and terrified after he endured much torment when he slipped inside of Artemis\u2019s shoe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilippus turned her gaze to Artemis, who stood at attention and bowed her head. \u201cI beg your forgiveness, your highness. I nearly mistook him for a bug under my foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no need to apologize for what you have done, Artemis. I, too, would not have known this child from a bug if it had slipped into my shoe,\u201d Hippolyta said as she descended from her throne, turning to the tiny eight year-old shuddering in the palm of her general. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now for the matter at hand, so to speak,\u201d Hippolyta addressed, approaching the fearful boy. You are a lost child, are you not? You are lost and terrified because the cruel hand of fate has shrunken you, hasn\u2019t it? There is no reason for you to fear because I promise no harm may come to youwhile  under my charge. Do you understand, child?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy nodded, whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now then, can you please tell me your name?\u201d Hippolyta asked as though she was addressing her daughter when she was the boy\u2019s age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Timmy, your majesty. T-Timmy Walker,\u201d the bite-sized boy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Timmy Walker. I am Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons and ruler of Themyscira,\u201d the queen introduced herself.  Hippolyta held her hand out, and Philippus gently ramped her hand to nudge Timmy to walk onto the awaiting palm. \u201cCan you tell me where you are from and how you came to be this way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled and stifled the urge to cry. \u201cI-I\u2019m from Florida, your majesty. I-I was flying with my family over the ocean to Italy when... when... when a scary storm hit the plane! I don\u2019t know what happened, but I shrunk to this size and I was sucked out of the plane! I fell into the water and I tried to swim but I was so tired, I couldn\u2019t swim anymore! Then I woke up on the beach all alone and... and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy couldn\u2019t hold back the urge to cry as he buried his face in his hands. \u201cThey\u2019re gone! They\u2019re gone and I can never see them again! I\u2019ll never see my big brothers again! I\u2019ll never see my daddy again! I\u2019ll never see my mommy again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Timmy wept in the queen\u2019s hand, keeling over letting tears flow from his eyes, Hippolyta couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for the poor boy. With her other hand, she gently stroked Timmy\u2019s back like a lost bird trapped in the rain and in need of shelter. \u201cI am sorry, little one. This is a fate you did not deserve to suffer from. I can never imagine the pain of your loss and the terror of being so small compared to the rest of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled and choked. \u201cI miss them so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty,\u201d Philippus spoke up. \u201cI do not wish to sound insensitive, but what are we supposed to do with the boy? You know as well as anyone else that our sacred law dictates that no man may set foot onto the shores of Themyscira, and despite being a child, he is nonetheless the son of man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta had taken this to consideration when Menalippe, the oracle, foresaw Timmy\u2019s arrival. However, since she discovered that Timmy is shrunken and devastated in the palm of her hand, things have changed in the snap of the finger. After careful consideration, Hippolyta gave a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have made my decision...\u201d she stated...</span></div></div>",

They, and the tiny boy in her palm turned to her with collected shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your highness, you cannot possibly mean this!\u201d Philippus immediately protested. \u201cThis is a direct violation of Aphrodite\u2019s Law! If you allow the son of man to walk on the same ground as the Amazons, then you will bring the wrath of the gods down upon us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but any man who dares sets foot on this island is to be confined and imprisoned immediately under the watchful eye of the Amazons,\u201d Hippolyta explained, holding out Timmy sitting in her cupped palms. \u201cThis child may be a son of man, but he poses no threat for his age and size. Therefore, with no one else to watch over him, we Amazons must perform our duties to nurture and encourage the growth of our children, whether they grow up to be a man or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut your majesty...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is enough, Philippus,\u201d Hippolyta interjected, raising her hand. \u201cI have made my decision. I will be in my chambers to accommodate this child personally teach him the ways of our people. You have served me well in bringing the boy here to me, though under abnormal circumstances. You may return to your duties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, your majesty,\u201d Philippus said, bowing her head. She and her fellow Amazonian soldiers marched out of the throne room, Artemis being the last one to stay behind and give Timmy a sideways glare. Timmy sucked behind the queen\u2019s monolithic fingers, but he was immediately comforted by another set of giant fingers resting on top of his back. With it, Artemis turned and marched out of the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s scary,\u201d Timmy said meekly, making a Hippolyta chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is natural that she is intimidating. After all, she\u2019s the fiercest warrior among us now,\u201d she said, gently stroking her new charge\u2019s back as she walked back to her chambers. \u201cNow, Timmy, I want you to understand that as long as you are here, you are to become my personal servant and pet bound to me by law. I cannot guarantee that the tasks before you will be easy, but you must prove you are worthy of being under my charge to my sisters. Otherwise, by law, you will be forced off the island by way of the sea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very thought of drifting back in that dangerous, turbulent sea made Timmy\u2019s blood freeze. \u201cNo! I\u2019ll be good, your majesty! I\u2019ll do my best to do whatever you want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Hippolyta acknowledged as she entered her chambers, \u201cbecause your basic training is about to begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta settled into her bed, a small table standing next to it with a bowl full of fruit, mostly grapes. \u201cNow then, Timmy, for your first task...\u201d she said, guiding the little boy in her hands...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To Timmy, the queen\u2019s imposing size made her look like a goddess, like the one he\u2019s seen statues of on the way. Like them, she stood tall like a monolith, dressed in a long, fuchsia-colored toga. Slipping from that elegant toga was a pair of giant, beautifully-maintained feet clad in leather sandals. She gently lowered them before her new young charge, but to Timmy, he could feel the tremor as she daintily slapped them on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy felt a certain overwhelming fear as he was presented his first task of massaging the queen\u2019s feet. The toes alone were just as big as him, almost a little bigger, but they were still threatening. He couldn\u2019t erase the traumatic moment when he was kicked around and crushed under Artemis\u2019s feet from his mind. Just being next to a giant foot gave him certain pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand your reluctance to carry out the task, little one,\u201d Hippolyta said, \u201cbut please know you will be seeing this a lot during your stay here at Themyscira. This is part of your training as my personal servant, so you must learn to face your fears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... but I\u2019m scared of going inside your sandal,\u201d Timmy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere. Allow me to make it easier for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lifted one leg up, unstrapped her sandal, and set it back down to the floor bare. She then proceeded to the same thing with the other foot. With both feet bare and touching the cool textile floor, Hippolyta lifted both feet up by the heel, scrunching her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere. This should make things easier to perform your tasks,\u201d the Queen of the Amazons said, setting her feet fully flat to the floor, \u201cbut remember this, little one: someday, you will have to unstrap my sandals yourself, but it will only happen if you are willing to continue your training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll try my hardest, your majesty,\u201d Timmy answered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I expect from you, my young charge,\u201d acknowledged Hippolyta, \u201cand speaking of expectations, I am still waiting for that massage I ordered a little while ago.\u201d Hippolyta slid her feet forwards towards Timmy, her toes slightly wriggling with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Timmy bent down and started to rub his hands on Hippolyta\u2019s giant toes, starting with the big toe. The giantess\u2019s digits wriggled at the ticklish sensation, making the tiny boy recoil a bit. Nevertheless, he had a moral obligation to fulfill his first duty and he had to do it. Bending gown into a squat, Timmy pressed his hands into the skin of the toe and gently squeezed into the soft, smooth flesh. He worked his squeezing grip around the smooth skin of the foot like he was kneading dough for bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, for this particular knead, Timmy wasn\u2019t making bread, though Hippolyta\u2019s feet smelled similar to bread. Gently, he maneuvered his massage around the perimeter of the big toe, not missing a single inch of skin to thoroughly massage it before he moved it lower to the underside of the giantess\u2019s digit. Sensing this, Hippolyta lifted up her toes, which allowed Timmy to easily reach the underside of her foot. The skin was softer and malleable than the rest of the foot. Timmy figured that this was where he was given a chance to show his skill as someone who watched his father give his mother a foot massage after a stressful day of work. He pressed his hands hard into the supple skin and squeezed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Hippolyta three her head back and sighed in blissful content. She didn\u2019t want to admit it, but despite the boy\u2019s tiny size and young age, his massages felt like Elysium. While the sensations tickled a little, she could feel her muscles in her feet relax around the areas she didn\u2019t realize where slightly stiff until Timmy worked his way around them. In her mind, she made the right choice in taking in the tiny boy as her own personal servant, technically confined to her by law, and encouraging him to fulfill his duties to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hippolyta enjoyed the feeling of her tiny charge work his way in between her toes, then eventually moving on to rubbing slow circles on the ball of her foot...</span></div></div>",

She already loved this kid and his innocence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can only imagine! The feet of my best warrior is more frightening than the warrior herself!\u201d she chuckled, suddenly finding herself clearing her throat and regaining her composure. \u201cBut to all seriousness, child, I can\u2019t imagine how terrible it must have been when you were trapped in her shoe. Since you have faced your fear of giant feet, perhaps you can share what it was like under Artemis \u2018s feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny bite-sized boy swallowed a lump, nervous from even thinking about that traumatic experience. Eventually, he found his voice and the words that came out. \u201cIt was tight... and it was very ouchie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it was tight and painful. Please, do go on,\u201d Hippolyta insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe giant lady\u2019s foot squashed me against her sandal,\u201d Timmy continued. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move, I couldn\u2019t even breathe, and it felt like I was riding a really scary and really bumpy ride at the fair. I got dizzy and I felt like I was gonna throw up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, child, I\u2019m deeply sorry for your suffering,\u201d Hippolyta gave her sincerest condolence. \u201cNo child should have to suffer like this, especially on my own island. You are indeed brave if you went through such a horrible experience and live to tell the tale of your own plight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy looked away, downcast. \u201cI know...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no reason to fret over this now,\u201d the giant queen assured the tiny boy at her feet. \u201cYou are in safe, capable hands now. I won\u2019t let anyone willingly take advantage of your size so long as I watch over you the same way I watched over my daughter, Diana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-Thank you, your majesty,\u201d Timmy said, getting back to rubbing the ball of Hippolyta\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am curious, though, seeing as how you don\u2019t appear to be physically hurt,\u201d Hippolyta astutely observed from her throne, \u201cyou were suffering under the feet of Artemis, and I know for a fact that Artemis has the most powerful footsteps in Themyscira, yet when I look at you, I see no bruises nor bleeding. Tell me, what was Artemis\u2019s feet like to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy\u2019s face suddenly went beet red and turned his head away from embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Timmy, you can tell me anything that\u2019s on your mind,\u201d his giantess guardian said. \u201cI won\u2019t be offended if you tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inch-high boy felt like he could sweat bullets from his forehead. As embarrassing as it was to think about it, his mom always told him to be honest with his feelings, no matter how much he didn\u2019t want to say it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... when I was stuck in the scary lady\u2019s shoe, her feet was... was... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">soft.\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was it that you said?\u201d Hippolyta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said it was... soft...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoft? Ahhh, so Artemis keeps her feet soft, I see,\u201d the giantess said, sporting a playful grin as she bent forwards and supported her chin on her palms, listening intently. \u201cPlease, tell me more about her feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy\u2019s face went so red, he was practically steaming. \u201cThey were soft and... and they smelled like... fruit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta raised an eyebrow. \u201cFruit, you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes. Fruit and... and coconut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the giant queen turned her eyes to the side, noting the tiny boy\u2019s astute sense of smell and the type of lotion Artemis rubs on her feet, \u201cand what does my feet smell like to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy stopped for a moment, collecting the sweet scent emanating from the giant foot flesh smothered with a certain lotion that almost smelled like the flavor of yogurt his mom bought from the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt smells like... vanilla.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...\u201d Hippolyta felt her tiny adopted son reach her heel, reaching every nook and cranny her foot had to offer. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve rubbed every spot on this foot, little one,\u201d she said, slapping her foot down and raising the other up by her heel. \u201cIt\u2019s time you started on this foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy immediately went to work with the other foot, starting with the toes, gently and thoroughly rubbing his tiny hands between the giant digits, during which time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow then, Timmy, for your first task,\u201d Hippolyta said, guiding the little boy in her hands onto the nightstand, \u201cI want you to feed me the fruit in that bowl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta lowered the boy with cupped hands to the nightstand, tilting them to prompt Timmy to hop off and land on the surface of the small stand level to Hippolyta\u2019s chest. The tiny boy watched as Hippolyta bent towards to be at eye level with her new charge, getting a better look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hippolyta, the tiny boy was so young, innocent, and adorable, but so helpless at his size. One more wrong step and he would become a stain on the bottom of an Amazon\u2019s shoe. To Timmy, Hippolyta was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, admittedly even more beautiful than his mom. She had the face of a caring mother about her and a lovely voice that could only be viewed as both motherly and commanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis task is quite simple,\u201d Hippolyta explained. \u201cYou will bring forward a grape for me to eat only one at a time, but be sure to not drop them anywhere except for my mouth. Given your size, I do not wish for you to strain yourself bringing two or more grapes for me. When you have finished feeding me the last grape and not drop one on the ground, you will have succeeded in your task, understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, your highness,\u201d Timmy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Hippolyta slumped down in her bed in her fullest graceful splendor, her head inclined on the bed\u2019s soft pillows. She placed her hands on her breasts, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy took a quick moment to observe the titanic Amazonian queen lying down in her bed, the way she folded her hands over her breasts, the posture she chose... he couldn\u2019t exactly describe the beauty behind it all. She looked like a true goddess, standing as tall as the stairs of said goddesses that Timmy noticed the statues of in the palace on the way. A goddess in need of an insignificant bug to serve on hand and foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? I am waiting, my young charge,\u201d Hippolyta said, snapping him out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh..! S-Sorry!\u201d Timmy squeaked as he ran to the fruit bowl, picking out a grape, holding with both hands like a giant beach ball, and returning to the edge of the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy grabbed the grape so he could toss it into Hippolyta\u2019s mouth. As he approached the edge, however, he found himself pausing before a curious, yet dangerous sight. He ended up staring directly into the open maw of Queen Hippolyta herself. The inside of her open mouth looked like a deep, fleshy pit, framed by her lips, her ivory teeth, and her wriggling tongue lined with moist, spongy texture. Timmy looked deeper inside the giantess\u2019s maw and saw the back of her throat, the gateway to her esophagus, a dark squelching tunnel that led to the inside of her stomach, marked overhead by her bobbing uvula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy felt a shiver run through his body; he was old enough to know what happened when food was eaten and ends up in his stomach. Remembering his task, Timmy tossed down the first grape onto Hippolyta\u2019s tongue. The instant the grape hit her taste buds, Hippolyta quickly sealed her lips shut, bringing the grape to her molars and compressing it with a crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy watched with fascination as the giantess\u2019s jaws made quick work of the grape. He could hear every juicy crunch with each motion of her jaws, and her deep, nasally breathing to accompany the music of her mastication. After a few seconds, the giantess swallowed, her neck bobbing inward to send the crushed remains of the grape down to her stomach while her mouth opened for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next several grapes, Timmy repeated this routine, sending the fruit into Hippolyta\u2019s mouth to be chewed, swallowed, and digested without ever dropping one by accident. With a few more grapes left in the bunch, Timmy plucked another one to feed the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens then?</span></div></div>",

He carried it over to the edge of the nightstand and looked over to aim the grape into the giantess\u2019s yawning maw. In that moment, Hippolyta breathed a deep sigh, sending hot breath in the boy\u2019s face that would eventually prove to be a major mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breath not only make Timmy grimace, but because the nightstand was made of smooth, polished marble, any hot breath would turn into moisture. The edge of the nightstand was moistened, making Timmy\u2019s footing unstable. He slipped on the edge, and he went screaming into the dark, fleshy pit, hurtling past the gaping lips, through two rows of white ivory teeth, and over the gargantuan tongue. His fall abruptly stopped when he was lodged into Queen Hippolyta\u2019s esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hippolyta\u2019s windpipe was clogged up like a cork in a bottle. She threw herself into a sitting position as she choked and gagged on the wriggling tiny boy in the back of her throat. The gagging was so loud, it echoed out of the chambers and immediately drew attention from her guard. Philippus and her troop stormed into the chamber, watching with fright as their queen grasped her throat, turning blue in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness!\u201d Philippus exclaimed as she ran to the queen\u2019s side. \u201cQuick! Someone get her some water!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone instantly ran to fetch a jug of water and a glass for the choking queen. Philippus quickly went from behind and grabbed Hippolyta around the abdomen. She quickly constricted her arms in spurts to dislodge the obstruction suffocating her from the inside. Hippolyta\u2019s face was starting to turn purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, my queen! We\u2019ll get whatever\u2019s choking you out!\u201d Philippus tried to assure the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy stuck inside the back Hippolyta\u2019s throat wasn\u2019t faring much better. His legs were stuck inside the epiglottis where the flap separated the esophagus from the lungs. Hippolyta\u2019s vocal chords were so close in proximity, her constant coughing and gagging seemed like explosions in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaws continuously jolted along with bright flickers of light pouring in from the opening of the mouth. The tongue was too moist and slippery for Timmy to grab ahold to pull himself up. His panicking overwhelmed him as he tried to claw out of the throat, but that only made it worse. The more he wriggled, the deeper he was pushed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, your majesty, don\u2019t eat me!\u201d Timmy begged for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt tiny bursts of air pushing him from deep inside the throat, pushing a little further up the tongue. Someone was giving her the Heimlich maneuver. They were trying to force him out of her windpipe. Timmy whimpered as he reached for the back of the tongue and tried to pull himself out of the epiglottis. Then after a few squeezes and a few pushes of the Heimlich...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The more times Hippolyta was given the Heimlich maneuver, the more times it took for Timmy to be dislodged from the giantess\u2019s windpipe. It was working because Hippolyta was beginning to breathe inward again, though less than outward. Her faithful general of her armies kept pushing on her lungs to rescue the boy from an unfortunate digestive fate. After this was over, Hippolyta knew that this was an unfortunate circumstance, but nonetheless, she had to administer her punishment to the boy because this counted as an automatic failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few pushes from Philippus, Timmy was pushed out of the epiglottis and launched onto the back of the tongue. Timmy laid flat on the rear bumps along the edge of Hippolyta\u2019s tongue, crying at the horrific trauma he endured. He got himself up to crawl over the tongue and out the mouth when his head his something moist from up above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the world inside of Hippolyta\u2019s mouth and throat as her gag reflex kicked in. Timmy\u2019s entire world jolted around him as the tongue suddenly bucked him to the back of the throat and a sudden booming gag blasted behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Hippolyta began to choke once more, frightening her guard. The tiny boy hit his head on his uvula, triggering her reflex which caused her tongue to buck the obstruction back into her throat. She held her hands to her throat to slow Timmy\u2019s accidental descent down her esophagus. No matter how much she tried, Hippolyta couldn\u2019t resist her reflex as they threatened to pull him down into her digestive tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy queen!? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re choking again!?\u201d Philippus assumed, turning to Persephone. \u201cQuick, give her the water now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d the blonde Amazon acknowledged, quickly bringing a glass of water over to Hippolyta. \u201cQuickly, my queen, you must drink or you will choke to death!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone took Hippolyta\u2019s chin and quickly poured the water into her mouth. The water relaxed the constricting throat muscles, allowing it entry into her throat. With so much regret, Hippolyta could no longer resist the drink flowing down her throat, and so she swallowed. Hippolyta grimaced as her esophagus squeezed the water and the wriggling bulk inside, feeling him descend to plop into her stomach. Hippolyta quickly jumped on her feet and breathed normally, holding her belly with a shocked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness, are you alright?\u201d Philippus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m not,\u201d Hippolyta answered, her shock never leaving her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis felt something was off. She looked around the room with her signature stern stare. \u201cWait. Something is not right. Where is the boy, your majesty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I swallowed him,\u201d Hippolyta answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the guards\u2019 faces dropped in the same state of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou what!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Timmy had lived one of the worst experiences of his newly tiny life. He was so close to being coughed out of Hippolyta\u2019s throat when he accidentally caused her to choke again. The tongue sent him over the edge of her throat and his entire body was stuck inside. He felt the gentle, protective hands of the giantess trying to hold him from being swallowed down until he was struck in the face by a torrent of water, enabling him to be sent deep inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a painful five seconds down the esophagus, Timmy was squeezed into the stomach, filled up with water, acid, and a single tiny boy. After splashing in that hot, shallow pool at the bottom of the fleshy cavern, the size of the inside of a minivan, Timmy began to panic. He quickly swam up to the stomach walls, screamed, and began to beat his fists against the malleable wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, your majesty, let me out!\u201d Timmy screamed. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be digested!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta felt the tiny beats in her stomach. She covered her belly with her hands while the other Amazon guards huddled around her to get a good listen. They could faintly hear the tiny screams of the boy coming from inside her belly. It sounded muffled, but it confirmed without a doubt that it was his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s true,\u201d Artemis said. \u201cYou swallowed the son of man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could this happen?\u201d Persephone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe fell into my mouth while feeding me grapes as part of his own test,\u201d Hippolyta explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen he has failed the test,\u201d Artemis finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would seem so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo keep him there,\u201d the redhead suggested. \u201cHe should not have failed at such an easy task, and yet, there he resides in the belly of our queen. Surely this is a mercy for arriving at these shores as small as a bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I would rather have the boy alive and unspoiled than to suffer a fate worse than death,\u201d Philippus argued with the fierce Amazon. \u201cThe boy may be the son of man, but he is still a child. You would personally forsake the life of a young one for nutrition in our queen\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he can endure torture at our feet, what\u2019s makes you think he can\u2019t endure torture in our own bellies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Hippolyta said, turning her attention to the crying minuscule boy in her stomach. \u201cTimmy, it is I, Hippolyta. Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Timmy yelled from inside the Hippolyta\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou just swallowed me, and it was so tight, I couldn\u2019t breath. Now I\u2019m stuck in your tummy and I can\u2019t climb out. It\u2019s dark and it\u2019s gross and it\u2019s stinky and it\u2019s wet and... and... I want my mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTimmy? Timmy, listen to my voice. Focus on my voice,\u201d Hippolyta said calmly. \u201cI need you to calm down. Panicking will only lead to disaster. I want you speak to me as calmly as you can. Are you hurt? Do you feel at least the slightest burn anywhere in your body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy sniffled. \u201cN-No. I\u2019m... I\u2019m just scared! Please, your majesty, I\u2019m sorry for falling into your mouth! I\u2019m sorry I almost choked you to death! Please let me out! I don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour majesty, please, you must allow the boy to take his punishment in your belly,\u201d Artemis insisted. \u201cHe has set foot on the shores of Themyscira, failed at a simple task of serving you, and nearly killed you by lodging himself in your throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he is only a child,\u201d Philippus countered. \u201cChildren his age make mistakes, but we would never want a child to die. Though he has failed in a simple task, your highness, allow us to give him the appropriate punishment that does not involve digestion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippolyta stopped and thought this dilemma through. The boy in her stomach had indeed breached Themyscira, but he was a lonely survivor of a fatal plane crash the size of a bug. Even if he did fail to carry out her test to the end, she would not want him to suffer a grim fate inside her body... but then again, he survived Artemis\u2019s toes and doesn\u2019t feel pain of digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have made my decision,\u201d Hippolyta said, turning to her stomach and rubbing it gently in circles. \u201cTimmy, I have made up my decision...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Even though it was an accident that you nearly choked me, you nevertheless failed your training and you are now facing the consequences for your actions. Think of your time in my stomach as a gentle reminder of those actions. With each failure in your training, your time inside my body will be extended, or I will administer a more appropriate punishment. As Philippus said, you are young, so use your time in my stomach wisely to reflect on your mistakes and how you can better avoid the consequences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I... I...\u201d Timmy felt all Hope slip away as he slipped against Hippolyta\u2019s stomach wall into a slump, feeling a new wave of tears leak from his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean for you to choke because of me! I promise I\u2019ll do better! I promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you will, Timmy. I believe you.\u201d Hippolyta rubbed her belly in circles, gently massaging the inch-high boy slumping against the inside walls of her stomach. \u201cIn the meantime, you\u2019ll have to remain inside my stomach until tomorrow morning. If you need anything, just tap on the walls or holler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Will I have to stay in here during supper time?\u201d Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d the giant queen of the Amazons ruefully answered. \u201cThis is part of the punishment. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be sure to take special care to provide you food so it does not appear physically repulsive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d Timmy shuffled in his slump so he was laying against the stomach walls like he would in a bathtub, filled with digestive acids that didn\u2019t sting or tingle his body, previously masticated food, and whatever else the giantess consumed. He felt the stomach jostle as Hippolyta rose up from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be taking my horse out for a stroll. I will be back soon,\u201d Hippolyta addressed her guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the entire stomach jiggled and swayed with the rhythm of her footsteps, with Timmy being swished from left to right and back. It was difficult for the tiny eight year-old boy to lie down in the same position when Hippolyta continued to walk outside. This was Timmy\u2019s new life now: servant or slave to the queen of the Amazons who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to step on him like a bug or swallow him whole as part of her punishment. The entire stomach he was caged in was so dirty, moist, and rancid, Timmy felt like he could throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how much he wanted it, Timmy couldn\u2019t get out of here until the next morning.</span></div></div>",
