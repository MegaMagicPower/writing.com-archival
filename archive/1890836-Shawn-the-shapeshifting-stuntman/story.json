Shawn stared up to the ceiling of his small one room apart in LA and thought to himself what he was doing with his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn had moved to LA just over a year ago to pursue his dream of being a big time Hollywood stuntman.  There was nothing he loved more in life than to feel the rush of adrenaline as he would light himself on fire, or jump from the top of a building, or fighting off a wave of ninja warriors.  He\u2019d loved the idea of it since he was a child and knew he had the capabilities of doing it.  Heck he had advantages that nobody else in the world had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, when Shawn was in high school he discovered he had the ability to shapeshift.  The only limit was his imagination.  He used the powers to do the usual things a teenager would do, buff himself up without the workout, make himself just a few inches taller, sneak into the girls locker room under a variety of different personas.  But after he got all of that out of his system he realized he could actually do things that could make his dreams come true.  So after he graduated from college, he moved to LA where the first thing he did was make contact with his cousin Rebecca.  He\u2019d heard tales from his family about the \u2018black sheep\u2019 of the family who moved to LA and became a big time Hollywood producer.  Unfortunately this was not the case.  Rebecca was just a lowly intern at a casting company and she saw no signs of a promotion coming her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know a golden goose was about to fall into her lap when her cousin Shawn came into her apartment one day and turned himself into an exact copy of her.  After Shawn calmed her down and explained his powers to her she saw a plan for the future and quit immediately and started the Perry Casting Agency with her one and only client who just happened to be just whatever a casting agent needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this happened over year ago, and outside of a few bit roles as random henchmen on some kids tv shows, a skydiving buxom brunette for a commercial for a crummy website, and even on one occasion a curling playing dog for a straight to dvd movie that didn\u2019t even get released.  Nothing was happening for Shawn, he barely had enough to pay for ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was beginning (and not for the first time) contemplate just moving back home and taking over the family business, when all of the sudden his cell phone rang.  Picking up the phone and seeing it was Rebecca he slowly answered, \u201cYour favorite unemployed client speaking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for long you\u2019re not,\u201d  Rebecca said excitedly, \u201cI just got you your first major gig!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you said with the curling dog fiasco.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget about that, I got you your first major stunt role and a real life, honest to God, actually getting released in theaters film!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!\u201d Shawn said suddenly awake,  \u201cWhat is it!  Who will I be doing work for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re being hired to be the stunt double for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rebecca obviously heard, \"I take it you like this news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how glad I am to here you say that, it's a really nice relief that I don't have to spend an extended amount of time as a girl or a dog or something.  I get to be a guy and do what I love.  This is the sort of thing I pictured happening when I came out here, thanks a ton Becca.  You're a saint.\"  Shawn praised to a now silent other end of the phone line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time as a girl or a dog or something?\"  Rebecca repeated sounding more and more agitated, \"So being a girl is just as bad as being a four legged animal or some other unspeakable horror?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No!  Of course not!  It's just that I prefer being a guy you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So being a guy is so much better than being a girl!\"  Rebecca said with a little bit of a shriek to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you're just being irrational.\"  Shawn knew he shouldn't have said that the second it had left his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irrational am I!?  Well, I was being courteous to you by offering you a job as a male stuntman, but I have other offers for other roles that I thought would be beneath or degrading to you, but I think I'll call them up and sign you up for something.  Enjoy the next shoot in heels, or maybe a nice leash.\"  With that Rebecca slammed the phone down (which was particularly effective as you don't need to do that with a smart phone like she has).  Shawn immediately dialed his cousin back hoping to convince her to come to her senses and not sign him up for something that he was going to be miserable doing.  Finally after calling her back for about a eighth time she picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please please tell me you didn't sign me up for me to be a a...stunt stripper or something.  I'm really sorry for what I said.  It was stupid and poorly worded.\"  Shawn anxiously waited to here his cousin's response.</span></div></div>",

He was on the edge of his seat waiting for a response when he managed to make out Rebecca saying between cackles, \"I was <i>haha</i> just screwing with you.  <i>heehee</i> I never called any studio.  <i>Oh</i> I wish I could see the look on your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So so I'm still doing stunts for a leading man?\"  Shawn said softly as his heart beating hard in his chest hoping she wasn't just playing with him further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of coarse you are silly.  What kind of psycho would I have to be to turn down a leading man stunt double role for you just for the pettiest of petty revenges.  Do you have any idea how much money and reputation building I'd be throwing away?  I'd never do that to you...at least not yet\"  Rebecca ended the sentence with some more evil laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I admit it Becca, you got me, you scared the hell out of me.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to try to sleep off that heart attack you just gave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you forgetting about something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The job!\"  Shawn said, in all the panic he had forgotten about the real reason Rebecca had called in the first place.  \"Please tell me it's something cool, after what you just did to me it had better be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll be stunting for the lead who is playing the part of...\"</span></div></div>",

That's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shawn, you DO know that this is likely to be a big hit at the box office, right? They're not doing the campy 1950's version, they're doing the Greg Rucka and J.H Williams III <i>Batwoman</i>. It's quality stuff, Shawn.

I'll be there at this first meeting but after that you're off to go practice stunts and shoot the film and you'll be on your own for the most part.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When's the first meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today at 5 PM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TODAY! Jesus Becca, you could have given me two days notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't <i>have</i> two days notice. Shooting begins next week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.

He brushed his teeth and with an unusual vigor as he just stared down at his phone until finally it gave off a chime meaning he'd gotten the text. He finished gargling some mouthwash and picked up his phone to take a look at the form he'd have to base a body off of.</span></div></div>",

Sex sells and of course this movie will become a blockbuster, just because of her!\u201d Shawn said aloud, which is always funny while is all alone in his small apartment\u2026<br>\r\nAnyhow he needs a strong black coffee and some croissant left over from yesterday. This was his breakfast and afterwards he starts preparation and shape shifting. Normally he will do this one day before, especially when he will need to spend some time as a woman. This is important for him to get used to the new body and gender, but for this job he had only some hours, before the first meeting and public appearance\u2026<br>\r\nhe went to his bedroom, where he had a large full body size mirror, which he needs for fine tuning. Taking a final breath, then he starts to concentrate on his target body shape of a very attractive blonde woman, long hair, perfect body shape, nice face with crystal blue eyes\u2026.<br>\r\nClosing his eyes for the initial shape change into the opposite gender makes it always a little bit more easy for Shawn, it is not needed, but helps. So he did close his eyes and felt the changes rushing through his body. His height was the first trait to be altered.  The girl in the picture seemed to be about 5'2, Shawn didn't want to be that short so he tinkered with his height a bit and finally settled on about 5'4\".<br>\r\nNext step in the transformation process was the hair. The color and the length. It is always funny when hair grows in a fast speed, from very short to long, but also the other way around, so Shawn will never need a hair dresser, but this is not important now.<br>\r\nThe important part of the change comes now, since the girl, who will be Batwoman, has quite a bust. But Shawn is always trying to cheat one cup size, so today he ends up as C.<br>\r\nHe had not changed his wardrobe yet, so there were now two nice boobs under his male muscle shirt, he was sleeping in.<br>\r\nThe next change was also bringing his night wardrobe a little bit out of fitting him/her.<br>\r\nThe butt changes into a round female form and his proud male member vanished\u2026<br>\r\nLegs also changed and now Shawn is perfect hot blonde woman\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looks in his closet for his spare sets of women's clothing, and pulls out a simple T-Shirt with the design of a famous jazz musician on it and some yoga pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the gym, he spends a good three hours there working on cardio and lifting weights. There are an equal mix of men and women with him at the gym, but Shawn has other things on his mind besides trying to get dates(such as trying to pay the bills). At the end of his routine, Shawn gets a message on his cell from Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shawn, the audition schedule has been bumped to 4:00 P.M! Stop by the studio office right away. I'm already there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great\" said Shawn to himself. He looked at the time. It was 3:30 P.M. How was he going to do this with running a red light?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I guess I'll just have to risk it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn ran out the gym doors, jumped into his car, and sped down the congested streets as fast as his car could. Making use of side streets, he barely managed to get there five minutes before the meeting. His heart was pumping, he was sweaty, and he looked like a hot mess. How was he going to impress these bigwigs now?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, he went inside of the huge building of glass and went up to the secretary in the lobby and before he could even say anything the secretary bluntly asked, \"You the stunt girl for the 5:00 meeting?\". A little thrown off by the harshness. Shawn simply nodded his head. \"Through the elevator doors, go to the 8th floor to room 802. They're waiting on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to keep them waiting any longer Shawn followed the no nonsense secretary's orders and after receiving some more directions from a very friendly (and probably horny) janitor, he made his way to the meeting room. The first thing Shawn felt upon entering the room was under-dressed. In the room was a youngish(Shawn guessed maybe a year or two older than him) attractive Mexican man in a dapper suit behind a table, and in front of the table were two chairs, one of which was occupied by Rebecca. The man stood up and extended his hand to Shawn, \"Ms. Dowe, I'm the director Alexi Salazar . I'd like to thank you for agreeing to be a part of our film.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem whatsoever.\" Shawn says assuming that he was the Ms. Dowe. Looking to Rebecca he saw her flash a message on her phone when Alexi was sitting down that simply said 'Shelly Dowe'. Well, it's nice to know this body's name, Shawn thought as he sat down. \"Now, Ms. Dowe, you were given this interview because your agent here assured us that you would be able to perform whatever stunts we require without question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct sir.\" Shawn said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic, now if you could please show me your stunt reel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Shawn said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stunt reel, you didn't expect me to just hand you a contract without seeing a stunt reel. I mean you do have the look but I can't just hire you based on look alone, we're going to have some dangerous stunts going on with realistic weapons and real fire. I have to know you won't be a liability. Now if you could show me your stunt reel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not told this. We need time to prepare one.\" Rebecca said clearly flustered at this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some sort of joke Ms. Perry? I was giving your client this chance partially as a favor and you don't even have the basic knowledge of what you're doing? What kind of scam are you running?\" Alexi said to Rebecca practically dressing her down verbally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not...\" Rebecca was so shaken she could hardly speak. Seeing his cousin in trouble Shawn stood up and walked to the door. \"Excuse me Ms. Dowe. Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Shawn said angrily, he walked down the hall and grabbed the mop the janitor was using and walked back into the meeting. Before Artie could ask what he was doing with the mop Shawn broke the mop over his knee and then proceeded to do a minute long choreographed fight scene that with his body really looked like a beautifully dangerous dance. He ended the 'scene' by throwing each end of the mop right by each of the director's ears. Shawn just stood there calmly while his heart raced hoping he'd taken the right approach. The director gulped and meekly said, \"You're hired.\" As he pushed the final contract to Rebecca and Shawn's end of the table.  \"You start next week, you'll be learning the stunts for a week before we start filming the scenes you are stunting for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much Mr. Fowler.\" Shawn said as he signed Shelly Dowe on the dotted line and made his way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Rebecca's \"office\" later on(8:00 PM):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn and Rebecca eat pizza while going over the finer points of the job the former just signed up for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who is this chick I'm stunting for anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Phoebe Pfister\" answered Rebecca.  \"She's been in a few well regarded indie movies as well as some theater, and now she wants to spread her wings by trying out a big budget film.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old is she, about 19?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she's the same age as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've never heard of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have the money to see a lot of movies, <i>Shelly</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for all of this, Becca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. So what do you want to do afterwards? Go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm bored. You think of something, and I'll tag along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a celebratory drink for your first major job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Specifically for his line of work Shawn could make his body whatever he wanted to get a job.  Unfortunately each of those bodies had to create their own bank account that would take direct deposit since most movie studio's didn't deal in straight cash.  So every few months Shawn as whoever his new body was would create a new account, a few weeks later close it and withdraw all the cash, and then eventually deposit most of the money in his normal Shawn account.  It was a pain in the butt, but it Shawn figured it was worth it.  So with the sun setting 'Shelly Dowe' created an account at First National Bank of Hollywood and left.  But as he and Rebecca were leaving and the bank was getting ready to close, he noticed three men in hoodies hiding their face rudely shove Rebecca on their way into the bank.  Shawn turned to have words with the jerks but when he turned he saw the three had drawn guns on the workers of the bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\"  Shawn said causing Rebecca to turn around and see the robbery beginning.  \"Come on Shawn, let's get out of here, I'll call the cops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca tried to drag her cousin off but Shawn wasn't budging, \"We've gotta do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what the cops are for, now let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By then it could be too late!

No!  Oh no!\"  Rebecca ran after her cousin who had already begun shapeshfting in the back of the ally.  'Shelly's white skin was darkening and becoming leathery.  Shawn smiled at Rebecca showing perfect sparkling teeth were becoming more fang like.  The white's of Shawn's eyes became black and two ears pointed high atop his head.  The hands that already had some nice and prominant nails became razor sharp claws.  And to top it all off between Shawn's shoulder blades emerged two giant leathery wings that became more like a cape when relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm ready to stop those robbers.\"  Shawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is madness Shawn, you shouldn't do this.\"  Rebecca said standing between the Batwoman Shawn and the exit to the ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me one good reason.\"  Shawn said, \"Besides it being dangerous, I don't care, you'll have to do better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  Rebecca took a few seconds to think of a good enough reason Shawn might listen to.  \"your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn looked confused, \"What about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still wearing Shelly clothes, so if you go to the bank in that the footage will be review any the cops will connect the dots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\"  Shawn shrugged as he began stripping.  \"Are you serious!\"  Rebecca said angerly.  \"Deadly.\"  Shawn said as he removed his bra exposing his firm leathery bat breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't go in there naked!  That's just wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not naked, I'm wearing panties...but I can see your point.\"  Shawn said grabbing his breasts for a beat before shifting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?  You're not doing anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did,\"  Said Shawn, \"I got rid of my bat nipples.  Some people are very offended by that.  For multiple reasons.  You got any other reasons why I shouldn't go save the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, fine.  Just because you turned into a bat doesn't mean you aren't bulletproof, those robbers have guns!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point but I can change that...I think.\"  Shawn said as he focused on shapeshifting and hardened his leathery skin.  \"There, I'm bulletproof I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think isn't good enough Shawn.\"  \"It'll have to be for me now <b><i>move</i></b>.\"  Shawn said as he shifted his vocal chords a bit and moved past his cousin.  The cops hadn't arrived at the bank yet making getting in easily to get in with minimal hassle.

The dress of a medieval princess she was wearing on the picture showed off her large cleavage, or at least her cleavage looks large but very inviting and attractive.<br>\r\nLooking at the pic caused also a very normal reaction with Shawn, he got a hard one! Maybe in normal life he would belong to the target audience of such a movie, but now he will be an important part of the production!<br>\r\nSince Rebecca did not have a scrap book or plot description of this movie there was very much space for Shawn\u2019s imaginations and phantasy. He mostly and still sees himself as maybe a price or a knight in shining armor, who will save the princess from evils or so\u2026 The fact, that he will be the stunt double of the princess very soon is still far away\u2026.<br>\r\nAfter a while of dreaming and just looking of the picture of the actress, who is called Maria Solana, Shawn got hungry and while preparing a hot and strong coffee he thinks about the whole issue. As far as he understood Rebecca this movie will be made with all new and unknown actors, but having a little bit knowledge about film industry the name of the director \u201cMichael Cormac Newell\u201d reminds him about Prince of Persia, so here you got it, same genre, but low budget\u2026.<br>\r\nAt least they do stunts by real people and not computer animated, which is good for Shawn and secures his income\u2026<br>\r\nSo another hour later Shawn was ready with his breakfast, which were actually some croissants and 2 cups of black coffee\u2026<br>\r\nNow not having plans before the meeting at 5 he thinks about preparation: The shape shifting and transformation itself only takes some minutes, but especially when he needs to be a woman or a female he thinks it will be better to spend some hours ahead as a woman, just to get used to different body shape etc. Also some exercises would be good, because even Shawn regardless of which body form he has is very sportive and has all what he needs to be a stuntman or woman in that case, it helps him also to get used to things like longer hair, boobs, smaller height and so on!<br>\r\nSo with mixed emotions Shawn went into his bedroom, where he had a large full body sized mirror, where he could transform. He took his mobile with the mms pic of the girl and set down on his bed to concentrate and think\u2026<br>\r\nit was a warm summer day, like mostly in Hollywood and California, so Shawn was only wearing some short pants and a white muscle shirt, which showed is male muscles and body frame. This was always a moment, where he was not liking his gift of shape shifting. At this moment it was more a curse, because normally it was not his intension to become a female, but then he needs to tell himself that this is a job and remembers what Rebecca told earlier, after his payment he might have cable TV again and other nice things\u2026.<br>\r\n\u201cOK here we go bye bye Shawn!\u201d he said allowed and concentrated on starting the transformation:<br>\r\nSince he has influence on speed and also of course on result how he will look like he thinks to start with the minor parts first and keep his male tool until the end. Even when this is not rational he always does it that way when becoming a female:<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath and closing his eyes it starts with the hair, which first changed its color from his normal average brown to the blond like the target person has\u2026. Also adjustments in length and hairstyle follow\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He kept going back to the picture and the actress' measurements (which Rebecca had sent soon after the picture) to make himself look as much like the actress as possible.  Shawn spent a hour going over each and every section of his body bit by bit crafting it to look like the actress he was stunting for, Maria Solana.  Finally after molding the rest of his body he finally took care of his manhood.  It was always the part he looked least forward to when it came to shapeshifting into a woman, but he knew that it was also a big detail that he couldn't just overlook.  So, reluctantly, Shawn closed his eyes and shifted his male genitals into a female vagina.  He was still wearing his muscle shirt and short pants (which were now hanging very loosely off of him now) so he didn't see this change, but he sure didn't need to see it to know what was going on under those pants.  After turning and looking at his reshaped body from all the angles in the mirror Shawn said to nobody in particular, \"Okay, time to put on my own personal touches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he was sure the studio would love the idea of Maria's stunt double looking exactly like her, Shawn knew that if he showed up as her clone it would get really weird.  And maybe even a little suspicious although perhaps that was just paranoia sneaking in.  So he cranked up his height 2 inches to a nice 5'9\".  He also added some muscle tone, especially to his arms and stomach.  Shawn smiled at this, it was one of his favorite perks of this ability, all the workout results without any of the work.  Shawn spent another few minutes posing in front of the full length mirror deciding on what he wanted to do next.  Shawn decided to do some work on his face and moved his cheekbones a little higher up and shrunk his ears a little.  Looking at the picture of Maria again he noticed that her lips were probably injected with collagen and the breasts seemed to have been enhanced a bit, so deciding he wasn't that kind of girl shrunk each of them down a little making his lips nice and thin and his breasts went from a large D to a still sizable C.  Then decided he could still do a little bit more to differentiate himself from Maria, Shawn also added a little beauty mark just below his left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is some of my best work yet.\"  Shawn said doing some more poses into the mirror and blew a kiss to himself before he walked away to find some workout clothes so he can practice moving around and working up a sweat in this body.</span></div></div>",

He did some running, weight lifting, and gave himself a little treat by joining in on a women's yoga class.  And after showering at the gym with some of his yoga friends he came back home to get ready for his meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn opened up his closet and groaned at his wardrobe.  After going through everything he owned, including the few women's outfits he owned, he came to the realization that he didn't own anything that fit.  \"Looks like I'm going to have to go shopping after the meeting.\"  Shawn said to himself while thinking of his poor credit card and the hit it was about to take.  After searching and trying on a lot of clothes for an hour he finally found a pair of his old black khakis from when he was younger that would work with a tight belt and a white blouse that he owned when he was a woman, although with his current woman's body the blouse was too small but it actually showed off his body nicely so he decided to grin and bear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a look at himself in the mirror, and while the clothes made him look passably professional his face and hair was a different story.  Thankfully his previous experiences as a female had given him some experience with basic makeup and hair styling, although he looked at his clock and saw it was already 4:30 so he could only do some basic things like a touch of makeup for color and a scrunchy so he could keep his blonde locks out of his eyes.  Grabbing his wallet and an apple for the road Shawn left for the meeting where he'd hopefully get his first big stunt job set in stone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shawn sped his vehicle all the way down to the office where Rebecca had told him the meeting was taking place.  He went inside of the huge building of glass and went up to the secretary in the lobby and before he could even say anything the secretary bluntly asked, \"You the stunt girl for the 5:00 meeting.\"  A little thrown off by the harshness Shawn simply nodded his head.  \"Through the elevator doors, go to the 8th floor to room 802.  They're waiting on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to keep them waiting any longer Shawn followed the no nonsense secretary's orders and after receiving some more directions from a very friendly (and probably horny) janitor, he made his way to the meeting room.  The first thing Shawn felt upon entering the room was under-dressed.  In the room was a large bald man in a suit behind a table, and in front of the table were two chairs, one of which was occupied by Rebecca.  The bald man stood up and extended his hand to Shawn, \"Ms. Dowe, I'm the director Artie Fowler. I'd like to thank you for agreeing to be a part of our film.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem whatsoever.\"  Shawn says assuming that he was the Ms. Dowe.  Looking to Rebecca he saw her flash a message on her phone when Artie was sitting down that simply said 'Shelly Dowe'.  <i>Well, it's nice to know this body's name,</i> Shawn thought as he sat down.  \"Now, Ms. Dowe, you were given this interview because your agent here assured us that you would be able to perform whatever stunts we require without question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct sir.\"  Shawn said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic, now if you could please show me your stunt reel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"  Shawn said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stunt reel, you didn't expect me to just hand you a contract without seeing a stunt reel.  I mean you do have the look but I can't just hire you based on look alone, we're going to have some dangerous stunts going on with realistic weapons and real fire.  I have to know you won't be a liability.  Now if you could show me your stunt reel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not told this.  We need time to prepare one.\"  Rebecca said clearly flustered at this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some sort of joke Ms. Perry?  I was giving your client this chance partially as a favor and you don't even have the basic knowledge of what you're doing?  What kind of scam are you running?\"  Artie said to Rebecca practically dressing her down verbally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not...\" Rebecca was so shaken she could hardly speak.  Seeing his cousin in trouble Shawn stood up and walked to the door.  \"Excuse me Ms. Dowe.  Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\"  Shawn said angrily, he walked down the hall and grabbed the mop the janitor was using and walked back into the meeting.  Before Artie could ask what he was doing with the mop Shawn broke the mop over his knee and then proceeded to do a minute long choreographed fight scene that with his body really looked like a beautifully dangerous dance.  He ended the 'scene' by throwing each end of the mop right by each of the director's ears.  Shawn just stood there calmly while his heart raced hoping he'd taken the right approach.  The director gulped and meekly said, \"You're hired.\"  As he pushed the final contract to Rebecca and Shawn's end of the table.  \"You start next week, you'll be learning the stunts for a week before we start filming the scenes you are stunting for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much Mr. Fowler.\"  Shawn said as he signed <i>Shelly Dowe</i> on the dotted line and made his way to the door before he remembered an important detail.  \"So, where exactly do I go for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\"  Artie said, \"Well Shelly we'll be doing the filming in...\"</span></div></div>",

So see you in one week in New Zeeland. Just don\u2019t forget to take the instruction package from my secretary. There is the plot of the film and some details where and when you have to be present. Good trip, Ms. Dowe.\u201d Said the director and Shawn and Rebecca realized that this was the moment where they were expected to leave his office.<br>\r\nThey did so and even when Shawn wished that this could be avoided they had to go to this incompetent and awful secretary again to get the instruction package\u2026<br>\r\nIn her professional attitude, the same she showed before the meeting she handed some package to Shawn and also wished a good trip, but this was not meant honest..<br>\r\nRebecca and Shawn didn\u2019t care about her any longer, they had no time, since the flight will be very soon\u2026<br>\r\nLeaving the studio building Rebecca said: \u201cWe could discuss our plan while having a dinner, I know some nice and not to expensive restaurant nearby. You like Chinese, Shawn\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\nOf course he liked Chinese, Rebecca knows that, but currently he has mixed emotions and thoughts running through his now pretty female head\u2026<br>\r\nBut at the end not only the stunt reel caused a feeling of hunger with Shawn and he agreed to go there with her adding: \u201cI assume you are paying?\u201d. Rebecca nodded, because that was only a small favor what she could do for her cousin.<br>\r\nThey walked down the road and entered the nice small Chinese restaurant with the name \u201cGolden duck\u201d. They were greeted by a friendly Chinese girl and guided to her seats. At this time the restaurant started to fill and they were lucky to get one of the last empty tables.<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you come with me?\u201d said Shawn after a while of absolute silence.<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could, but the tickets and hotel are only paid for you, or for Shelly Dowe\u2026\u201d she answered sadly, because she also thought about joining her cousin on that trip\u2026<br>\r\nSuddenly Shawn had an idea: \u201dThat guy you pay for creating some fake passports for me from time to time, maybe he can also fake a flight ticket?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More than I could afford.  Apparently they're really tricky on short notice and I suspect he thought he could take advantage of the situation.  So I'm sorry Shawn, you're going to have to be on your own.  Think you can handle it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm a big boy I can handle it.\"  Shawn said, although he was really disappointed that Rebecca wouldn't be joining him.  \"Besides, it probably would have looked suspicious if my agent came with me on a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Rebecca said, \"Oh well, we can make up for our time apart with our girl's day out tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...wait what?\"  Shawn said, he had been about to go to his bathroom to change from Shelly to Shawn when these words had stopped him in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.

You're going to need a few full on outfits.  And we should also get you a nice dress or two with some heels.  There's a chance that Shelly will get invited to some formal events while on the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Becca, I can just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you 'Oh come on Becca' me.  I've been in this business alot longer than you have, you're going to need some nice clothes.  So, you get to sleep now and I'll be here bright and early so we can hit as many places as possible.

Shawn was still not very amused.  \"Oh come on, you weren't even smiling.\" Becca said going back to the pictures before pausing.  \"Shawn...why do you have a naked picture of youself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn grabbed the camera from Rebecca, \"It's for reference for when I transform back into this form, I need to get all the details right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all of those poses were just...reference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Shawn while his face turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure they are.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next 24 hours were a blur for Shawn.  He tried to get right to be but as much as he tried to sleep he could never get himself comfortable.  It was weird for him, as many times as he'd been a different person, he'd never gone to sleep as a woman before.  After hours and hours of tossing and turning Shawn finally found a comfortable postion and managed to shut his eyes for a nice long sleep.  At least that's what he'd hoped for, Shawn's alarm went off on hour later to wake him up for his busy day shopping.  As soon as he woke up he went downstairs in his zombie like state and was dragged from store to store for hours on end trying on skirts, dresses, and blouses.  And once that was done Rebecca took Shawn to even more stores to get some fitted bras, new panties, and even a swimsuit for 'Shelly'.  To top it all off Rebecca got a set of matching luggage that looked 'so adorable' and the two packed up all of the cloths they just purchased for 'Shelly' and soon they were off to the airport.  Shawn really wanted to complain but really just felt too tired to and just nodded and grumbled a bit whenever Rebecca talked to him.  The next thing he knew Rebecca giving him a hug and practically pushing him onto his plane where the nice flight attendant led him to his seat where he finally found the sweet embrace of dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long trip and many bad on flight movies later Shawn woke up and looked out the window to see a land of green below him.  Shawn was about to wake up a fellow passenger and ask questions when the pilot announced over the intercom, \"<i>We are now making our final decent, please fasten your seat belts and place your food trays in the upright and locked position.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sheesh, how long was I out?</i> Shawn thought to himself, but he shrugged it off and just sat back and enjoyed the decent into the beautiful country.  As soon as they'd landed, Shawn grabbed his two carry on bags and went to the luggage carousel to grab his 2 large suitcases of clothes.  He eventually grabbed them and managed to lug all of his stuff to the outside where he could hail down a cab, but before he could he noticed a sign that had his, (well Shelly's) name on it.  \"Are you here for me?\"  Shawn asked the pretty lady holding the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my name's Kia Libbi.  I'm here to take you to the crew meeting.  Here, let me help you with those.\"  Kia said reaching out to put Shawn luggage into a van.  Kia was a very attractive 5'7\" olive skinned and black haired woman who had a nice curvy figure.  \"Thanks,\" Shawn said after subtly checking out Kia and opening up the end of the vehicle.  It was full of a lot of very nice looking fabrics which Shawn made sure to be careful with as he put in his stuff up.  Getting into the van Shawn asked, \"So what do you do with the production?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm one of the seamstresses on the crew.  I needed to go out and get some materials today and I was volunteered to pick you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry about that.  I could have gotten a cab or my own rental car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't let you do that, besides...</span></div></div>",

Wasn't it in your packet?  It was in mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...actually haven't gotten a chance to read it, I only got it yesterday,\"  Shawn said kind of sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you might want to read that, we've got a couple of hours on the road from the airport to the meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat there in silence for the next half hour while Shawn poured over his information packet.  It was mostly stuff that he'd expected, standard contract information, tax forms, and finally a small booklet with a few rules and bits of info.  Including the information about Kia being his roommate.  Shawn was just kicking himself mad about his situation.  He was really looking forward to finally having time alone so he could have some 'Shawn time'.  But now with a roommate finding time to just be himself just got more complicated.  Kia seemed to have noticed Shawn's annoyance at the situation, \"I'm sorry about this, but unless you want to pay for your own room you're stuck with me.  Sorry that I'm in your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that, it's just that I wasn't expecting it and that's my fault.  I was just looking forward to having room to work out and stuff.\"  Seeing that Kia still seemed to have hurt feelings Shawn continued, \"I'm really looking forward to having you as a roomie.  We'll have fun,\" Shawn said with as sincere a smile as he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia looked at Shawn and gave a much more sincere looking smile of her own, \"It's okay, I'm sorry, I overreacted to what you said.  I can get a little over emotion sometimes, you know how it is.\"  Shawn didn't know how it is but nodded in agreement, \"You're right, we'll have a lot of fun on the job.  Hey, I've got an idea!  How about we work out together.  You're in such great shape and you could help me out.  That is if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\"  Shawn faked enthusiastically, \"Just great.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shawn spent the rest of the ride to the hotel reading through the script with it's production notes.  Shawn was very happy to see that it seemed he would only be needed for two scenes, the big fight scene at the end and a scene where Princess Aida (Maria's character) was burned at the steak for an evil sacrifice but eventually saved by a spell from a wizard.  Shawn wasn't looking forward to burning in a dress but this was all good news.  The shoot was supposedly for 3 weeks and these two scenes would take two, three, maybe four days tops.  If he was lucky he could get his full pay and be back in LA in a week.  It was with this happy mindset that Shawn entered his production meeting with Kia at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting was in a large rounded room with about 100 people sitting and chatting about until the the director showed up to tell everybody what the agenda was.  Everyone was there, actors, technicians, and everything in between.  Shawn sat next to Kia near the back so they could get a head start on traffic after the meeting was done.  After a few minutes of smalltalk mostly involving Shawn telling Kia about his life with a few minor modifications, the director burst into the room in a coat of flop sweat.  At this the room fell dead silent, after all when the boss enters the room looking like that it's just about always a bad sign.  Breathing a little heavily Mr. Fowler stood in front of the room and said, \"There's no need to worry, no need to panic.  Everything is fine.  Everything is perfectly on schedule.\"  Nobody believed this for a minute as everyone awaited for the other shoe to drop.  \"But I just got off the phone with Ms. Solana has been delayed on the shoot of another movie and won't be here for at least a week possibly two.\"  A wave of panicked whispered took over the room.  A voice shouted out, \"Can't we just delay shooting for two weeks.\"  But another voice shouted angerly in reply, \"No way in hell, that would cost millions unless they chose not to pay us and that sure as hell isn't happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please please!  Everyone please calm down!\"  Artie Fowler shouted at the top of his lungs finally getting the attention of the room again.  \"Now, I've spent the last few hours going over the script shot by shot and I think there is a way we can work around this.  Maria's stunt double looks remarkably like her, and I think with some trick photography and a little bit of paid overtime by out special effects department, she could stand in for Maria in a few scenes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news seemed to calm everyone in the room down at least a little except for one former man who simply raised his long nailed hand and said, \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Ms. Dowe you're here.  Ladies and gentlemen this is Shelly Dowe who will be a savior to this production.\"  A round of applause and handshakes set upon Shawn who tried to muster a protest against this idea.  It would mean he'd probably have to be in New Zealand for the full 3 weeks and would probably be stuck as 'Shelly' most of, if not all of, the time.  \"I see you are a little flustered at having this thrust upon you, but I assure you that your salary will be tripled at the very least for your troubles.  So will you accept?  This entire production, and a lot of jobs including your own are dependent on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn sat in stunned silence, he was outraged that he was practically being blackmailed into this position.  \"I guess I don't really have a choice,\" Shawn said a bit bitterly, \"I'll do it.\"  Everyone breathed a sigh of relief knowing the production would continue.  \"That's the spirit Ms. Down!  Let's have a round of applause for Shelly,\" the director said leading the crowd.  Shawn smiled and gave a polite wave to everyone which lasted a minute before Mr. Fowler quieted it down.  \"Now this has all put us on a very tight schedule.  Kia!  Since you will be spending a good deal of time with Shelly away from the set, I'm assigning you to her costume fitting in 30 minutes, we have to make sure she can fit into all of Maria's costumes before shooting begins tomorrow.  Now everybody, let's all stay positive and all do good work,\"  Artie said dismissing everyone.  It took all of his self control to stop Shawn from punching him out for putting him in this situation.</span></div></div>",

The film company had rented the complete hotel, so there indeed will be no time for Shawn around here, because there are only film people here. Of course he could pretend to be one technicians or so, but this will be difficult or dangerous, so for the moment he was not thinking about this, but concentrating on his job.

Shawn was about to reach out for a really nice looking piece of chain mail before Kia said, \"You are going to look so beautiful in these.\"  For a split second Shawn excitedly thought she was talking about the armor but when he turned he was disappointed to see that Kia was enraptured with a very lacy white dress.  A bit crestfallen Shawn headed over to the dress section of the room where Kia stood beside a rack with three dresses.  \"Now we don't have your complete measurements on file, so if you could please strip down.\"  Shawn looked a little confused and a little unbelieving Kia added, \"We can't fit you for your dresses unless you strip down.  No need to be embarrassed, it's just us girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, us girls.\"  Shawn said as he removed his sweatshirt and yoga pants he'd worn to the meeting.  For the next 10 minutes Kia became about as intimate and familiar with Shelly's body than Shawn had ever been with he costuming measuring tape poking at every single part of Shawn making him blush on more than one occasion.  Seeing this Kia said comfortingly, \"You really have a beautiful body, I wish mine was as nice as yours.\"  Shawn immediately and honestly replied, \"Oh please, you're one of the most beautiful girl's I've ever met, any guy would be lucky to have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be nice if the guys I knew felt that way.\"  As she started to probe her tape around Shawn's thighs Kia suddenly asked, \"So how about you, you have a boyfriend,\"  Shawn gave a bit of a guffaw at this.  \"I have had a boyfriend in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be possible.  Really?  Never?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing how weird that must sound Shawn backtracked a little, \"Well, I've never really been in a really real relationship.  I've always been focused on my dream of being a stunt...woman since high school and everything else didn't seem important.\"  It startled Shawn a bit how true this was.  Neither in high school nor college did Shawn even have anything close to something you would call a serious girlfriend.  He never really found it weird until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good for you.\"  Kia said sounding a little off put, \"You're chasing your dream that's what's important.  Now if you would please try on the brown dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn took a brown dress made of a nice strong fabric and put it on in the bathroom even though Kia said he didn't have to.  In his times in his life he'd made himself a woman, he had worn a handful of dresses, but never anything this complicated.  There were layers of fabric misleading him on what was supposed to go where, he thought about calling Kia for help but didn't want to humiliate himself any further in front of her.  Finally after what seemed a small lifetime, Shawn was in the dress.  As much trouble it took him to get into the dress, Shawn was surprised by how easy it was to move in it.  He was able to move and lift his legs freely which would make for easy kicks but the fabric didn't seem to fall too far.  After testing his kicking theory out with a few minor exercises, Shawn emerged from the bathroom.  \"You look great!  You are going to kick so much ass in that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so this is what I'm fighting in?  Doesn't it look too fancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if it was for a real fight, but this is for the movies silly,\" Kia giggled, \"This was meant to be yours from the very beginning to do the stunts in, they got me your picture and I made the modifications to it based on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made this based on a picture alone?  That's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kia said giving a mini curtsy, \"Now that was the easy one, we've still got two more and these were meant for Maria so the measurements will be completely different for you.  Plus they're much more complicated so I'm going to need to help you put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kia helped Shawn maneuver out of the brown dress and handed him a silky and delicate pink dress with even more layers of fabric.  Knowing how much effort Kia had put into these Shawn felt a little guilty about how carelessly he'd thrown on the first dress and really let Kia lead the way with this one.  In the back of his head Shawn thought about how nice it felt to have Kia delicately placing her hands all over him, but quickly pushed that thought out of his head, after all it's time to be a professional.  Besides, he was Shelly for now, the last thing he wanted to do was make Kia uncomfortable with Shelly.  This dress obviously didn't fit nearly as well as the first which had practically been form fitted.  This one was a little short and was loose in the chest, Shawn knew that would be the case going in due to the modifications he made when originally constructing this body.  \"I'm going to have to get more fabric to layer in some extensions to the bottom, two inches worth should do it.\"  As she went for a piece of paper to jot down some notes there was a knock on the door and Artie's voice came through saying, \"Is everyone decent?\"  Not waiting for a reply he simply came in and found the two.  Artie gave Shawn a full look over examining every aspect of Shelly's body in the dress.  Shawn felt extremely uncomfortably about it especially the end of the inspection where Artie just unapologetically stared at Shawn's cleavage.  Decided he'd had enough Shawn said, \"I'm up here.\"  Not moving and inch Artie simply said, \"I know.\"  Before turning to Kia and saying, \"The bust needs to be bigger, more pronounced for the camera.  The computer people will be able to make the adjustments to the face without a problem but the chest can't be fixed like that.  Me her bigger.\"  Artie said as he turned to leave the room and threw back, \"Good work girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn just stood mouth agape,  \"Did that just happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia gave a sad and knowing smile, \"Yes it did, and the worst part is he's right.\"  With that Kia put two foam like pads into the top of the dress and stood back to get a better look.  \"It's not bad, but it needs something else.  I think for this dress and the next one you'll need a corset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need a what?\"</span></div></div>",

He was thinking about transforming him into his normal shape, but this was too risky, a maid or some hotel stuff could come in or even Kia, you can never know\u2026<br>\r\nSo after the shower and some news on American TV, they had here, it was time to meet Kia for lunch.<br>\r\nThey had a quick lunch, not exchanging to much words, Kia was in her working mode and Shawn lost in his thoughts\u2026<br>\r\nSo at 1 p.m. they are in the dressing room again and this time Kia had adjusted all clothing needed for the first day, including the already announced corset!<br>\r\n\u201cIs it really needed?\u201d asked Shawn and Kia nodded, but also adds that she will help with putting it on.<br>\r\nAs much as Shawn appreciated this, he also remembered yesterday, when Kia was very close to him and now she will be again. It was hard to concentrate for Shawn to keep his masquerade up and running.<br>\r\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t so tight like I was fearing\u201d Shawn said when he had on the corset.<br>\r\n\u201cSilly one, I haven\u2019t adjusted the straps yet!\u201d replied Kia smiling and dragged them. This was the moment when Shawn felt it, he nearly collapsed by the sudden squeeze\u2026<br>\r\nKia had her fun and after some seconds Shawn was used to this very tight piece of wardrobe. A look in the wardrobe showed the desired result of giving her a much more prominent cleavage.<br>\r\nNow the rest of the wardrobe and then they could meet the photographer.<br>\r\nShawn knows that they make now some photos before the real filming starts, for presentations, film posters, internet presence and so on\u2026.<br>\r\nThey went into another room to wait for the photographer. Suddenly the door opened and Dean Kant came in. Shawn knows him from some earlier projects. He does real good shots and pics, but he is also a womanizer.<br>\r\nDamn it, it will be hard to work together with this guy, because Shawn will definitely not do the expected extra shots in his room during the nights\u2026<br>\r\nKia realized that you seem to have an issue with him, but kept all in a professional way.

Dean directed Shawn to stand in front of a green screen in a make shift photography studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first few photos Shawn just did standard poses of looking far off into the distance and looking into the camera with different level's of 'intensity' as Dean put it.  Shawn didn't see the point of this as his face would be Photoshopped out but just went along with it.  But Shawn did his best and even had a little bit of fun with it.  After a few minutes of taking pictures without incident Dean announced that he was ready for the next set.  Shawn glad that he was done left to go to Kia to help him out of this deathtrap known only as a corset but was stopped by Dean.  \"Oh no, that was just the first set of pictures, we've got many more to do with all sorts of fun little themes.\"  Dean had a smile on his face that Shawn didn't like.  \"Bring in the fan!\"  Dean yelled at some random techie who immediately ran off and rolled in a giant circular fan to the side of the green screen.  \"Ok Shelly, breaks over.  Let's get back to work.\"  Shawn groaned and turned back to the green screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next set was not as much fun as the last.  Dean had the fan turned up for wind effects.  As he took the pictures he kept saying it looked great but Shawn didn't feel great at all.  His blonde hair was blowing in his face practically non stop causing him to choke on hair every now and then.  And then there was the dress.  The dress was nice, pretty, and flowing, and while Dean said that it looked 'great', Shawn just suspected that he was enjoying the view of Shawn's legs and thighs which kept getting flashed towards Dean while he took his pictures.  Finally Dean announced that this set was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting really annoyed Shawn walked straight over to Kia who was waiting with a brush and a kind word.  \"You're doing great, you look amazing, you're almost done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that damn photographer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can vent to me later, I promise.\"  Kia whispered before going back to the louder, \"Doing great girlfriend.  We're so lucky to have you.\"  As she continued to brush Shawn's hair back into a presentable form after the fan incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last set people!\"  Dean said pulling Shawn away and bringing him to a table, \"For this set I want you to take each of these and make magic.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn looked at the table and saw a wide variety of medieval times looking weapons including a sword, staff, lance, mace, and a long bow.  Shawn obliged and stood back in front of the green screen for the last set of pictures.  This time Shawn was not in a good mood.  Especially when Dean told him to hold the weapons in more and more provocative positions.  Shawn just gritted his teeth (literally) and did as he was told, Dean didn't take well tot his but Shawn pointed out they would edit out his face later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we're done!\"  Dean said, he seemed to have cut this session short but obviously knew he couldn't get that Shelly girl to do what he wanted and he didn't really have a good reason for it.  But before he left he walked up to Shawn one last time and handed him his card, \"Here's my number in case you want to get some...work done.  You've got the face and body for my line of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks alot.\"  Shawn said as he tore up the card as soon as Dean turned his back, \"Ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia walked up to her roommate and said, \"Come on, we're done for the day, let's go back to the hotel to relax.  Tomorrows you're first full day of shooting and it's going to be a long day.\"</span></div></div>",

Shawn was a little confused by what Kia could be referring to but just decided to let it go.  So Kia left and for the first time in too long a time Shawn had an extended period of time to himself.  As soon as Kia was gone, Shawn hung the 'do not disturb' sign, turned every lock on the door, made sure the curtains were closed up tight and stripped down to his white undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope I still remember what I look like.\"  Shawn joked to himself as he started to shift himself around.  Soon in a matter of seconds Shawn Rowe was standing in Kia and Shelly's room.  First thing he did was go to the closet full body mirror and double check to make sure he got everything right.  \"All right,\"  Shawn said as he removed the bra he forgot to take off.  \"Let's see I've got an hour or two to kill...now what.\"  Shawn knew that it could be a problem if he ended up going out as he might have a problem finding a good place to change back, especially if Kia beat him back to the room.  \"Then again it could be worth the risk,\"  Shawn said as he thought about actually going out and stretching his actual legs.  \"Maybe I could even introduce Kia to the real.\"  That was a thought that had been running through his mind for a while now and this was his first chance to do that.  \"But the risks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to think about just staying in the hotel for a while.

But after digging through it the only thing that would be even close to fitting him was a tank top and a pair of yoga pants that wouldn't really be decent for Shawn to wear in public.  Sighing Shawn said to himself, \"Looks like at some point Shelly is going to have to go get her buddy in LA Shawn some clothes.\"  Shawn was a little down, he really wanted to go out and run into Kia and work his own brand of charm.  So with the realization that there was no chance he was leaving this room for now, Shawn decided he wanted to just sit back and relax.  He called up room service (with Shelly's voice) with instructions to leave the food outside the door and while he waited took a shower.  This body may not be as sensitive as his last one, taking a shower was still a very nice for different reasons with one of the biggest ones being he didn't have to was what felt like half a ton of blonde hair, all he had to do was just run his now short again hair under the hot water with a dollop of shampoo and he was done.  \"I do love being a guy.\"  Shawn said as he dried off and put his panties back on before he quickly pulled in his room service of a steak and some ice cream.  He took his food to his bed, grabbed the remote, and enjoyed himself some of the finest programing New Zealand had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours of watching some programing that left Shawn mesmerized, Shawn suddenly jerked out of his tv starring haze when he heard the door to the room open.  <i>Crap!  Must have forgotten to lock the door back up when I got my food!</i>  As fast as he could Shawn covered himself up with bedsheets and started his shift back into Shelly Dowe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly, I'm back!  Come see what I've got for us.\"  Kia said as she entered the room with the two beds.  \"Come on Shelly, get up.  It's only 7, you don't need to be asleep now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn shifted his voice back to Shelly and just stubbornly said, \"Just a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Shelly, get up.\"  Kia said as she reached for the bedsheets and pulled the sheets back, the only question is, did Shawn complete his shift in time?</span></div></div>",

Breasts?  Check.  Hair?  Check.  Beauty mark?  Check.  Vagina?  Check.  Trying to keep calm while he continued his mental checklist he asked, \"Something wrong Kia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a beat that lasted a lifetime Kia stumbled a little saying, \"Nothing, I just wasn't expecting to see you half naked, I didn't mean to interrupt. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interrupt?\"  Shawn was confused for a second before realizing what Kia might have meant, \"Oh no no no.  I wasn't doing <i>that</i>.  I was just...taking a post meal nap.\"  Shawn said as soon as he saw the empty plate and bowl on his bedside table.  Shawn kept rambling, \"You see, I was hungry so I ordered some food.  And I felt like relaxing after a tough day and when I relax I like...to go topless.\"  Shawn realized how stupid this must sound but he couldn't stop himself.  He wanted to just make up some excuse to make Kia not judge him but he just thought it was getting worse the more he talked.  He couldn't believe how much Kia was rattling him by just being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Kia simply said, she seemed to buy what Shawn was selling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo break up the now awkward silence Shawn decided to change the subject, \"So...what did you get at the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to go with the subject change Kia excitedly went for the multitude of bags she had.  Kia showed Shawn the fruits of her shopping labors that included a bunch of dvds including a bunch that were filming in New Zealand, some snacks that the two could binge on, and finally some booze.  This seemed to be the surprise that Kia was eluding to.  She'd purchased enough wine to definitely last them through their time in New Zealand and even a bottle of tequila for what Kia said was for 'emergencies'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn helped Kia put up all of the stuff she got (after putting on a bra) the two friends did what they said would be a normal routine and did an hour of yoga.  \"Why don't you put on one of the dvds while I go take my shower.\"  \"Sure\"  Shawn said while the image of Kia taking a shower danced in his head.  Feeling kind of like a jerk Shawn tried to shake that image as he put the first Lord of the Rings movie in the dvd player, but every time he thought the picture was gone, he just pictured Kia there again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Focus Shawn, she's your roommate.  That's it.  You're not normal, nothing could ever work out with her.  So just stop picturing her naked.</i>  Shawn thought as he went back to his bed to watch it.  Then all of the sudden Shawn received one of the biggest shocks of his life.  Kia emerged from the bathroom wearing a pair of pink panties and nothing else.  Her freshly washed breasts seemed to glisten in the poorly lit rooms light.  Shawn's jaw dropped and stayed that way as Kia walked over to his bed and sat down next to him.  \"We're even now.  Okay?  No need to feel uncomfortable with each other.  We're friends after all.\"  Kia said as she got up from the bed and went over to the refrigerator, \"Chocolate ice cream sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\"  Shawn said not thinking of ice cream at all.</span></div></div>",

Then when he basically got blackmailed into working everyday as a woman he thought he was going to go nuts at the situation he'd been put in.  But he found solace in his roommate Kia who made the whole experience not only tolerable, but kind of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first week of work Shawn would have to wake up early, spend up to two hours in a trailer getting his hair and clothing set to perfection.  Then he'd spend a few hours on some mountaintop or in some castle window for far away shots taken by from a helicopter, and then he'd spend a few more hours standing in the background of group shots just trying to ignore the occasional stagehand looking at his corset enhanced breasts.  This should have been just a horrible and dragging experience, but Kia was always on the set with him to make a joke with him in between takes and she'd always be there back at their room for a movie, some wine, and good company.  It was probably one of the most fun weeks Shawn had had in years.  The only downside was he wasn't himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than anything Shawn wanted to hang out with Kia as himself, let her know the real Shawn as opposed to Shelly.  But there was never a chance.  The one time he got a chance to go out on his own he had to use that time to go shopping just to get clothes for when he was Shawn in the future, but that opportunity had not arisen.  At least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of another long day of standing around looking pretty, Shawn opened up the door to his and Kia's room only for some fabric to fly in his face.  \"Get dressed up girlfriend!  We've been cooped up here too long, we're going out to the bar and let some guys buy us drinks til we puke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn took a look at what had been tossed to him and gave a little groan.  It was a fairly short skirt and a revealing top that Shawn recognized as one of the outfits that Rebecca had gotten him when he was too tired to protest.  \"Do we have too?  Can't we just do the usual and watch a movie and eat ice cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we do have to.  I saw you out there today, you looked like you were about to die of boredom.  Ice cream and movies works for a lot of things but not that.  You need to find some fun and excitement on the dance floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't know if I feel up to that Kia.\"  Shawn saw how disappointed Kia looked, \"But don't let me hold you back, you can go out and have a good time.  Besides I think I'm just going to hold you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Shelly, I'm going to that club a few blocks down, I expect you to be dressed up and down there in 20 minutes.\"  And with that Kia left Shawn to himself in the room to think about what he was going to do.  Shawn smiled, because he was definitely going to go party with Kia, his only question was whether he was going to go as Shawn or Shelly.  He wanted to go as Shawn, but there in could lie some problems with finding a way to transform back.  Plus Shawn could screw up, get shot down, and end up watching Kia leave with some other guy.  But if he was Shelly he could keep a close eye on her without getting a weird look and save Kia meeting Shawn for another day.</span></div></div>",

He's been looking for an excuse to let loose and this looser punk was very close to giving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what sugarti...?\"  The pervert couldn't even get his 'compliment' out before being punched full on in the face by Shawn.  But this was no ordinary punch, in the split second it took Shawn's fist to reach the pervert's face, Shawn had turned his 'Shelly' arm into that of someone who would run for Mr. Universe.  The punch easily caused multiple fractures and sent the man flying about 5 feet in the air away from Shawn.  By the time the people around him had realized what must have happened Shawn had already shifted his arm back into Shelly's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly?!

You'll have to teach me how to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn let out a sigh of relief that Kia wasn't angry with him, \"Sounds like a plan,\"  Shawn said as the two friends made their way back to the hotel where things stayed fairly status quo for another week until...</span></div></div>",

Down down he fell to the safety pad in his stuntwoman's dress.  As he fell Shawn thought back to the last week.  Maria Solana, the actress Shawn had been standing in for, finally showed up letting Shawn get back to doing what he was hired to do, perform stunts.  So over the last week Shawn had filmed all of the fight and fire related scenes very well and now was performing his last stunt of the shoot.  Shawn didn't know when he was getting his plane ticket and going home, but Shawn knew it would be soon.  And every day Shawn delayed telling Kia the truth about himself.  Shawn knew he wanted to tell her, but it had to be perfect where he could be at his most charming and the time just never seemed right.  <i>I'm going to do it tonight.  I'm going to bounce off of this landing pad, go straight to the hotel, and confess everything,</i> Shawn thought to himself as he plummeted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he might have done just that if the production crew hadn't moved the pad a few feet to the left without telling Shawn.  So as he hit the mat instead of bouncing on it, he practically glanced it and rolled off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK!\"  Shawn shouted out as he hit the ground.  Everyone on the staff rushed up to him, cameras and microphones included, to see how bad he'd been hurt.  Shawn looked down and lifted up his dress and everyone gasped upon seeing his left leg broken below the knee.  Shawn saw this, and felt the intense pain of it, but quickly shifted some nerves around so the pain was practically non-existent.  Then putting on his best acting face cringed and said, \"It's not that bad, it may look broken but it feels good, it's probably just the light.\"  Shawn just needed to prevent people from getting a close look at it so he could shift everything back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, that's defiantly broken,\" one of the cameramen said.  \"See, I got it right here,\" he said as he showed a grotesque still shot of Shawn's definitely broken leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well isn't that great,</i> Shawn thought to himself knowing there was no way he could fix his leg until at least the shoot was over and maybe not even until he was back in LA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get her to the hospital.\"  Artie said then showing how much he cared added, \"We're done with her anyway, that was her last shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic.\"  Shawn said as he was helped into an ambulance where he'd be taken to the hospital.</span></div></div>",

He is after all on a airplane and a hot chick like he is now was no doubt noticed by a few. If she was suddenly replaced by a guy it would be noticed. He decides to attempt instead to heal his leg the rest of the way. He looks down at his leg and concentrates on healing it the rest of the way. Nothing happenes. He then tries harder putting everything he has into it. Slowely the swelling starts to go down and the bruise fades. Several minutes later it's healed, but it was way harder than it should have been. The strain has taken it's toll. Shawn is exhausted and covered in sweat. It feels as if he's just ran a marathon. He knows right away that if it took that much effort to heal something simple as some sweeling and a bruise there is no way he can change back.</span></div></div>",

You won't have the same abilities, they will be different to accommodate both the pregnancy and the breast feeding!\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" gasped Shelly. \"Well, the babies will be born faster than a traditional human birth. They will need to be breastfed for approximately 24 months. You can expect a third breast to develop for multiple births, more if there will be more than three children. You will always have milk, so you will need to eat more to maintain your body weight. You won't be able to transform into a man until you stop breastfeeding. Even after that, your default form will be that of Shelly Rowe. You will no longer be able to change into a non-human being. But you will develop transformative and duplicative abilities!\" she revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you explain that a little further? I...I'm freaking a little. Transformative and Duplicative?\" squealed Shelly. Kia nodded, squeezing Shelly's hand again in a comforting manner. \"You can make copies of yourself to do jobs. They will be under the belief that they are the original Shawn. They can't exist without you. And you can delete them at any time. If they die, you will feel pain. As for transformative, you can turn any sentient being without shapeshifter abilites into anything. But you will be limited in the amount of times you can do these things.\" she discussed with Shelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you give an example please, babe? I....I still don't get transformative.\" replied Shelly. Kia beamed at being called babe, making Shelly smile in return. \"Well if you wanted to, you could say turn Rebecca into a dog and she would stay that way until you undid it!\" she responded. \"Wait, what?\" demanded Rebecca, less than happy about this. \"The problem is, that if you did, Rebecca would be a dog for a while. It would take a lot of energy to return her to human form!\" continued Kia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly grinned malevolently at Rebecca, remembering that horrible assignment that Rebecca had got her. It almost severed their relationship as Becky had been less than ethical during the time, using it to get a little payback for Shawn's less than professional manner at that time. Fortunately they got their relationship back on track. \"So I could theoretically picture Rebecca turning into a poodle and...\" But Shelly never got to finish that sentence as Rebecca began changing in front of their eyes. \"Shawn, stop it!\" screamed Rebecca.</span></div></div>",

Becky's long ears and black nose disappeared and she returned to herself. \"What happened?\" cried Becky, angrily. \"I don't know, Bec! One minute I was daydreaming about you being a poodle....\" Shelly screamed as the transformations returned. \"I don't want Becky to be a poodle! Go back to Rebecca Perry! Go back!\" she cried, focused on her cousin's body. Kia looked as shocked as Shelly as Becky continued her changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly thought being a pregnant woman was scary. Watching her cousin Becky transform into a poodle more than topped it. She tried desperately to stop it, looking at an equally shocked Kia for advice. But it didn't change the little white poodle from barking at them when it was over. Kia put her hand over Shelly's mouth to keep her from screaming. \"Babe, calm down! We need to get Rebecca to Doctor Borg, our OBGYN and GP, right away!\" she explained. Shelly nodded as Kia slowly removed her hand. \"H-How did...did I do that?\" she whimpered. \"I don't know, Shelly! You weren't supposed to be able to do that until you had the babies! We need to head to Doctor Borg's practice immediately!\" she declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky kept barking, looking around aimlessly as if so freaked she could do nothing else. \"Becky, I'm sorry! Please....please calm down!\" whimpered Shelly. \u201cBecky, its Kia! Stop barking if you can understand us!\u201d requested Kia. Becky kept barking, worrying the two shapeshifters before stopping. \u201cWhat\u2026what do we do, Kia? I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m trying to focus on turning her back\u2026but it\u2019s not working!\u201d stammered Shelly. \"Becky, if you bark twice, we will know that you are still there mentally. Anything else and we have to assume that you are a poodle in full. That means the vet!\" commanded Kia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo quick barks came from Becky who leapt into Kia's arms. \"Okay, that settles it! She is still Rebecca Perry inside! But we need to take her to Dr Borg. Dr Borg might know how to return her to womanhood!\" remarked Kia. Before Shelly could answer, she heard a familiar ringtone. She reached for Becky's phone and was relieved to answer it in her cousin's voice. \"Yes, this is Rebecca Perry. How can I assist you? You need a poodle for a dog food commercial. Is a female poodle ok? Just a minute, please!\" Shelly stopped to turn to Kia, keeping her hand on the phone. \"Then need a poodle!\" she revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia whispered \"Sorry Becky, we need Shelly to be you until we figure out how to turn you back!\" Kia took the phone and changed into Becky. \"We have the perfect poodle for you. We just need confirmation as to the conditions you have for one of our top poodles, Becky. Yes, my girlfriend Shelly convinced the owner to name her after me! She is highly intelligent and well trained. She is a sensitive, little dog around 2 years old. No kennels, no breeding and she needs to be returned to her owner after each shoot. Excellent, I will send you the pics, could I get an email address and phone number? Perfect, we will call you back with the arrangements!\" declared Kia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put down the phone, looking at the poodle. \"Becky, you need to do this job, while we are working on turning you back! Shelly and I will take care of things for now, but we need to continue to make money. Shelly, I will see what I can do about keeping your talent business going. We may need to expand it to include my work as a fashion designer. But before we do anything else, I have to call Dr Borg and get an appointment for you and Becky!\" she revealed. Shelly/Shawn agreed, holding a less than happy poodle. \"We will figure this out, Becky! I am so sorry about this!\" she declared. Becky just whined a little. Kia came back, looking unhappy. \"Dr Borg said we can meet him in  a month. He is sending over a nurse who specialises in shape-shifting care and midwifery. He suggests talking to the nurse about Becky. He apologises for this!\" she exclaimed, bitterly. \"Becky has to stay a poodle for a month? And I don't get to see the doctor about being a pregnant man? What the hell is wrong with this doctor?\" cried Shawn/Shelly angrily. \"He is a jerk for doing this! But he is the only doctor who I know that understands shape-shifters!\" she replied, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should talk to Mark, he is a doctor!\" suggested Shelly. \"Is Mark aware of shape-shifters? Has he actually provided medical care to them?\" Kia sought confirmation. \"Well he knows about them, because we told him when I fell pregnant.\" explained Shelly. Kia paused before reaching for the phone again. \"What are you doing?\" asked Shelly/Shawn. \"Where does Mark live?\" she responded, looking nervous. \"W-Why?\" stammered the pregnant shape-shifter. \"Because he is in danger!\" she revealed. \"Why would he be in danger?\" squealed Shelly. \"Where does he live, darling?\" she repeated. \u201cI think\u202643rd Second Street!\u201d nervously answered Shelly/Shawn. \u201cHello Directory? This is Kia890b678! I need information about a\u2026 What is his last name?\u201d Kia whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr Mark Sheppard!\u201d she replied. \u201cI need information about a Dr Mark Sheppard of 43rd Second Street, it\u2019s a\u2026. Yes, I see. Thank you!\u201d she replied. Kia was pale when she turned to Shelly and the poodle Becky. \u201cBecky, Shelly\u2026.we won\u2019t be seeing Mark for a while. He\u2026he just got picked up by people who don\u2019t want our kind exposed. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d stammered Kia. Becky began whining, running up and down the bed, terrified. Shelly looked shocked. Kia squeezed her hand. \u201cThanks for the phone message.\u201d She chirped, tried to lighten the situation. \u201cWhen is the nurse coming?\u201d Shelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr Borg said she would...\" The apartment buzzer went off.

Shawn had to just sit back and wait for xray results that he knew the results to down to the exact minor cracks, he should know, he shifted them there.  On the way to the hospital Shawn made it so that his leg was broken but not nearly to the extent that it initially was.  With alot of very careful and precise shifting around he'd made it so the break wasn't as bad as it looked and would heal up completely in just a few weeks, although as soon as Shawn got back to America that healing time would be a matter of seconds.  But he knew that while he kept up the appearance of Shelly he'd have to keep a broken leg wrapped up in a pink cast that Kia so kindly picked out for him while he was doped up on pain medications.  As a matter of fact Shawn was still a little loopy on pain meds.  So much so that he wasn't exactly being careful with his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I could have just gotten up and walked out of there without the wheelchair.\"  Shawn said looking up to Kia not bothering to wipe the hair off of his covered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you could have.  You can be one tough bitch.\"  Kia said amused at her loopy friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia had a laugh, \"You know, it really sucks that this had to happen on your last day of work.  I mean you have to take that plane ride back to LA all by yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come with me if you want,\" the drugged up stuntman said as he examined and shifted around the lines in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't offer that, I just might take you up on it.  I have been thinking of making a move to LA and I'm done with this production tomorrow morning so I actually could.\"  As Kia helped her roommate into bed she added, \"As soon as you come down from those pain pills we can talk about it if you're up to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no I want you to come and hang out with me and stay at my place and...stuff.\"  Shawn said picturing walks on the beach, trips to the zoo, and making pizza. <i>Man I want pizza</i>  Shawn's drug addled brain thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia laughed some more, \"Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow.  But I gotta say it would be nice if we were roommates a bit longer.  I know we've only known each other a few weeks but you are already one of the best friends I've ever had.  I really trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Shawn should be thinking about telling Kia either the truth or trying to break off this arrangement before someone got hurt.  That would be the right thing to do.  But right now Shawn was not thinking straight and just blurted out...</span></div></div>",

Kia turned bemused by her very wacked out friend and was stunned to see a copy of herself where Shelly had been sitting before.  Kia just stared at Shawn for a minute wondering what she was watching.  After taking everything in, Kia with a very shaken voice said, \"Shelly?  What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn sat back and with Kia's voice replied, \"Well, I'm a shapeshifter and I just turned into you.  I thought you'd like it,\" and then after an awkward silence the Shawn form of Kia slapped her head and said, \"Oh yeah, I forgot.  I haven't told you yet.  Well Kia, I'm a shapeshifter.  Neato huh?\"  Shawn looks at Kia with dopey eyes as if waiting for Kia to say she was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia wasn't as freaked out.  She had suspected that Shelly had a secrets about her but she had never suspected this.  Then thinking about that for a second Kia asked a follow up question.  \"So Shelly, I have to ask, are you really...you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn just looked confused before realizing what Kia had meant.  \"I'm really me but I'm not Shelly.  I'm me.  Shawn.\"  And with that finally said Shawn shifts from Kia into his normal form.  A few seconds later Shawn was himself and said to Kia, \"I wanted to tell you earlier but I thought you'd get mad and I really really like you and I don't want you mad at me.  I didn't want to make you uncomfortable or sad or angry.  I love you.\"  Shawn said in a rambling fashion to Kia his words now starting to slur from the medications in his system.  \"Nite nite.\"  Shawn said as he shifted back into Shelly and curled up on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia was floored.  She rushed over to Shawn on the bed and shook him while practically shouting, \"But why now?  What are you saying?  Please tell me why you're doing this!\"  But Shawn could not respond, he was passed out with little hope of him waking for hours.  Kia stepped back realizing that waking him was futile, even if she did manage to wake him he would be in no state to answer questions.  \"Figures, a guy finally tells me he loves me and he turns out to be my best girl friend roommate who's really a shapeshifting guy.\"  Kia sat on her own bed just looking at 'Shelly'.  Kia was filled with so many feelings ranging from the betrayal of her best friend to embarrassment at having gotten dressed frequently in front of a guy, to curiosity at having such a fascinating friend, and even a little bit of flattery at having someone confess their love for her.  \"I need to think about this.\"  Kia told herself as she crawled into bed.<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Shawn woke up to the worst headache of his life.  He would try to shift things around in his mind to make the pain go away, but that was the one thing he never wanted to attempt to mess with, the brain was to delicate a thing to tamper with.  Shawn tried to think back at how he got back to the room, but he really couldn't remember anything after being given the pain medications back in the emergency room.  Shawn got up to walk to the bathroom, but stopped after taking a step with his still broken leg.  \"Damn it.\"  Shawn said to himself knowing he couldn't fix this so long as Kia was still around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image from last night flashed in his head.  He didn't know what it meant, but it was Kia and she looked...confused.  Shawn tried his best to think back as to what happened last night worried that he may have said something to her that could get him in trouble.  Nervously he turned tot he shower where Kia was just emerging, but instead of being wrapped in a towel like she normally would be, she was very fully dressed.  Shawn noticed this but had other things on his mind to ask her about, \"Hey Kia, my memory from last night is a little bit fuzzy, did something happen that I need to know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia looked surprised at the person she now knew was Shawn and thought about her responce.  She could just pretent nothing happened.  Just let Shawn walk away and head out on the airplane back to LA without confronting him.  She'd go back to her normal life and he'd probably go back to whatever was normal for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could confront him.  Learn everything she can about who he is and why he's done what he's done.  And she could even ask him what he meant by 'I love you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Shawn Kia made a split second decision and decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So it happened.  Shawn had screwed up last night and revealed himself.  Although there was one positive he could try to take out of it.  Shawn did what he'd been wanting to do for weeks but didn't have the courage to do until he was forced to.  He shifted back into his normal male self, which Shawn noticed didn't even cause Kia to blink an eye.  And he told Kia everything.  Everything about his powers and how he first discovered having them in school, to his job and the agency he started with his cousin.  He did his best to try to paint himself in a nice light, but the way Kia was holding herself with her arms folded across her chest made Shawn very nervous.  Finally after rambling uninterrupted for about 15 minutes Shawn finally finished his tale from start to finish.  \"Well, that's it,\"  the two roommates stood there in silence.  Desperately Shawn said his voice shaking fearing what was coming, \"Please just say something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia stood there stiff as a statue before putting on a smile and saying, \"I can't believe I let you see me naked with you buying me a drink first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused yet relieved by this reaction Shawn retorted, \"Hey!  It was only topless.  And you saw me first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed at this but Shawn still felt as if there was some tension in the air.  \"So...are we...ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia seemed to have to think about it before saying, \"Yeah, I think we are.  Now come here.\"  Shawn obliged and walked up to Kia only to receive a slap in the face.  \"That's for lying to me.\"  Shawn was about to open his mouth to protest but as soon as he did Kia's lips met his. Shawn was flying high on cloud nine.  Every bit of anger, annoyance, and aggravation about not telling Kia everything melted away into pure euphoria.  After a few wonderful and glorious second Kia separated and added, \"And that's for being a good friend the last few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why?\"  Was all that Shawn could get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit when I first found out last night I was really mad, but I spent just about all night thinking about it and how hard it must have been for you.  And I thought back at everything we did together and I figured that if it had been a guy I was doing it with the least he should get would be a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The least?\"  Shawn said noticing the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't exactly do more now. Shelly has to go.  Her ticket to America leaves in a few hours and she really has to go soon.  I'll take her to the airport and drop her off there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then will she, I mean, will I ever see you again?\"  Shawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia gave Shawn another kiss before breaking it apart and saying...</span></div></div>",

That's great.  That's amazing.  That's fantast...\"  Shawn was interrupted by another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have time to ramble, you've got to get packed for your trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\"  Shawn said as he reluctantly separated himself from who Shawn was pretty sure was his new girlfriend.  \"So, is it safe to say you're my girlfriend now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a little Kia said, \"I think it is safe to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

Packing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it.\"  Shawn said getting back to throwing all of his Shelly stuff into the suitcases with a whole new spring to his step.  He'd come to New Zealand for a cool experience and a big paycheck and is walking away with those things plus a girlfriend.  Things were really coming up roses for Shawn.  After packing everything up Shawn grabbed his bags and headed for the door.  \"All right, let's head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you forgetting something <i>Shelly</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops.\"  Shawn said as he quickly shifted back into his Shelly Dowe body.  \"Now I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\"  Kia said unfolding the wheelchair that had been set in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it.\"  Shawn said forgetting that uncomfortable part of the ruse as he reluctantly sat back down in the wheelchair for Kia to roll him out to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Sha-elly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since Shawn had gotten back from New Zealand, he had put the majority of his time and money into his apartment investing his money in paying a years worth of rent in advance, some new appliances including a washer and dryer, and lots of cleaning supplies.  Rebecca had been telling him that she was proud of him for really putting himself together and acting like an adult.  The part she didn't know about was that he was acting like an adult who wanted to impress his girlfriend who was coming over for the first time.  After putting on and smoothing out his newly purchased fine Egyptian cotton bedsheets that he kind of hoped would have a beautiful girl in them sooner rather than later Shawn stood back and observed the fruits of his labor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was satisfied with how clean the place was after spending the week with either a vacuum or mop in hand (and in one case when Shawn was really bored a feather duster while wearing an old maid costume from Halloween a year ago) and moved over to the dining area.  Here Shawn brought out all the stops with a bunch of roses, candles, and a bottle of wine on the dinner table with a pot roast slow roasting in his new oven that would be ready by the time Kia got there in 32 minutes.  Kia had told Shawn that she'd be there promptly at 6 PM.  Shawn really wanted to return the favor she did with him in New Zealand but refused the offer insisting that he let her find him and his apartment herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing everything seemed to be in order Shawn decided to do some touch ups to himself in his newly retiled bathroom.  As Shawn flossed and brushed his teeth nervously for the 5 time that day Shawn thought back to what he'd done this week and all the money he'd gone through.  Somehow in just a week he'd already blown through almost all of his money from the New Zealand job.  Granted it was spent on some very reasonable and responsible things, but he knew that pretty soon he'd have to look for another stunt job soon, but for now he pushed that thought out of his mind as it went back to Kia.  The girl who had stolen his heart was the only thing on his mind.  Sometimes at night when he wasn't thinking about it he found himself starting to shift into her.  But as tempted as he was to...enjoy himself in her body Shawn chose (reluctantly) to play the gentleman and respect her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his clean up Shawn was startled by the sound of a knocking on his front door.  Anxiously Shawn looked at the clock on the shelf sitting beside Shelly's cast and a picture of Kia that he'd kept as keepsakes.  \"She's 8 minutes early!\"  Shawn said excitedly as he double checked himself in the mirror to make sure he was himself and rushed to the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shawn opened up the door to see Kia standing there with two suitcases at her side.  Before words could even be exchanged Kia dropped her bags and wrapped her arms around Shawn who was only too happy to return the embrace along with a passionate kiss.  Finally breaking the kiss for air Shawn said, \"You want to come on in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you'd never ask.\"  Kia said bringing her things into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn shut the door and approached Kia for another kiss but before he could the oven buzzer went off.  Cursing his luck Shawn directed Kia over to the kitchen for a candlelit meal where they talked about what they had each done over the last month.  Kia told Shawn all about a job interview she had at a clothing company to design work.  She got really into it, but Shawn could barely follow along as he didn't understand half of the things she was talking about concerning the fashion world.  While Shawn on the other hand instead of telling her that he'd spent all his time and money on getting his place cleaned up for her sake, just told her that he'd spent the week job hunting but with no real success.  After the meal Shawn stood up and lead Kia into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to give you the grand tour.\"  Shawn said, \"That room over there is the kitchen/laundry room as you saw.  You are currently standing in the living room area featuring the couch and tv.  And that door over there leads to the bedroom,\"  Shawn said feeling his face flush up a little bit at the last sentence.  <i>Is Kia really making me this nervous?  What am I?  12?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKia seemed to notice Shawn blushing and giggled a bit before saying, \"Oh, so you only have one bedroom?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.  But this is still really nice for a one bedroom apartment, you're not going to get much better than this.\"  Shawn said making sure she knew he was in good shape financially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.  So will I be staying on the couch?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"  Shawn said confused, \"Of course not!  No way you're sleeping on the couch!  You're staying in the bedroom in the bed,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where will you be staying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Well, I had kind of assumed that we would be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be...what?\"  Kia said obviously enjoying seeing Shawn being a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of thought that we were at the point of the relationship where we'd share a bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at Shawn Kia gave him a kiss on the cheek before telling him...</span></div></div>",

The two would only break their lip lock long enough to remove their cloths but where soon at each other once again on the bed soon afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later the two lovers were gasping for air on the bed after their passionate love making session.  Each of them although exhausted and a little achy, they each had two of the biggest grins either had ever worn in their lives.

So what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a second Shawn said, \"Well, with you moved in you can take a few days or weeks to get used to the city.  I can show you around, I've got enough saved to last a little while.  Then I can help you look for a job and I find more work and we try for the whole 'Happily ever after' thing.  Or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Shawn a look with a raised eyebrow Kia said, \"I was thinking more along the lines of do you want to order a pizza or some Thai food,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed Shawn just said, \"Oh...well.  Thai, definitely Thai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Shawn, I like your idea too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>6 months had passed since that fateful day when Kia moved in with Shawn.  And for the most part it had been 6 months of bliss for Shawn.  Of course the couple would have the occasional argument (the first involved a shifted Shawn borrowing Kia's clothes for a job interview without asking), but for the most part the two lived together in paradise.  In the months after Shawn's New Zealand job was done he'd had trouble getting big jobs, but Rebecca had gotten him little jobs in commercials and such here and there.  But Shawn finally got a fairly big break with being hired as a stuntman for a live action team superhero show as one of the main stuntmen, and best of all he actually got to be himself for once.  The pay was good enough so that he wasn't staved for work and got to sit back and spend his off time with Kia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, (and fortunately for her), Kia was starting to make a name for herself in the faction world.  A few celebrities had been seen wearing her dresses to premiers and that was all it took for Kia to get a pretty big fation show dedicated just to her work.  Sadly for Shawn this seemed to be keeping Kia's attention about 12 hours a day 7 days a week.  Shawn tried to spend time backstage with Kia, but even though he was the boyfriend the security wouldn't let him in back with Kia due to stupid security reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he wasn't working (which was most of the time) Shawn was now spending most of his days just sitting back and watching tv while turning into what he saw on tv to keep himself entertained.  Shawn heard the door slam open and shut so shifted from a basketball player into himself and called out, \"Something wrong Kia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  Everything is perfect, everything and everyone is freaking perfect!\"   Kia yelled out.  Shawn walked into the kitchen where Kia had her head buried in her rolodex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kia?\"  Shawn said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Shawn.  I-I'm just flustered.  I've got the big runway show tomorrow and three of my model's just up and quit after getting 'discovered.'  I hope they enjoy whatever b movie they have to strip down in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm trying to find at least one model who I can find at the last minute to replace three who happen to be the perfect sizes for the cloths.  So unless you can find them you can't help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn just stood a little dumbfounded for a moment before becoming bemused, \"Uh, Kia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Shawn?\"  Kia said looking up and seeing a face from the past staring at her.  \"Why are you Shelly right now.  You know I'm not in the mood for that kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn gave it Kia a minute to stop being so flustered and think straight.  After a few seconds of silence Kia suddenly stopped looking through her notebooks and looked at Shawn with wide eyes.  \"You'd do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really have to ask?\"  Shawn said before being feeling Kia's tongue being shoved in his mouth.  Kia separated and said, \"You know what, all of the sudden I am in the mood for 'that'.\"</span></div></div>",

He had been too respectful to explore the bodies, he had become. But now, the possibility existed of a different kind of exploration. He blushed when he consider how much he wanted that.

She was petite, probably no more than 5' 2\", short black hair in a pixie cut and 'modest' breasts. \"Not exactly what I had in mind\" he then sighed, feeling just a tad disappointed. But then again he didn't want to lug a heavy pair of 'knockers' all over the damn place, so he let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished getting ready to go out, Shaun figured he may as well shift his form now and get used to being a chick again. He stood in front of the mirror and concentrated as normal, and it never got old to see himself change. He smiled even as his facial features shifted into a 'cute', feminine configuration, similar but not identical to the leadeing lady, and his hair followed suit, morphing into a pixie cut. \"Woah!\" he gasped as he shrank down to just 5' 2 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the main transformation was done, he also changed his clothing into a plain summer dress and a pair of espadrilles, with white lace panties underneath. \"All done\" he commented, checking himself over. The memories of the time he doubled for the busty brunette came flooding back. Shaun then had a little fun, staring down at his chest...he made his breasts inflate several cup sizes until they were a DD cup. \"Nah, no good on a body this small\" he shook his head in disapproval before whittling them back down to a B-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get moving!\" he then told himself, glancing at the clock on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way out of the house he decided to give himself the name...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

About a year ago Shawn used to be really nervous about this kind of thing, but he'd done it a few times by now so he knew the drill.  He walked up the front desk and told the security, \"I'm Chloe Reilly.  I'm the 3:00.\"  With the Shawn was waved into the office just like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shawn entered the room he noticed all of the posters on the wall of movies he'd seen before and saw a bunch of awards on the shelves.  <i>Good job Becca, looks like you got me a job with somebody legit,</i>  Shawn thought to himself.  He was motioned to sit down by a formidable woman behind the desk.  Shawn saw her nameplate on the desk and knew the name instantly.  It was Beatrix Hoff, she was nicknamed the 'Queen of the B movie' but her latest indie darling flick that got her a directing nomination had given her enough credibility to get a major picture.  Shawn saw that she was about 45 years old with greying hair pulled back in a very tight bun that seemed to stretch out the skin on her face.  Shawn was a little weirded out by the site, but remembered this woman was his ticket to a big paycheck so he just sat down and looked polite.  Beatrix watched Shawn closely as he sat down, never before had he been judged by the way he moved so closely.  After watching Shawn sit down and taking down some notes she simply said, \"Very good.  I believe you will fit the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn blinked, \"Just like that?  I mean, thank you very much mam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You handle yourself with grace under the situation, that is exactly what I need.  I can tell by the way you move you have a graceful confidence that is required of this job.  As a fellow woman I must say that you are very brave for what you'll be doing.  Here is the contract, you'll begin on Sunday for a costume fitting and filming begins Monday and it should only take about 6 days for the various scenes with a chance for a few more in pick up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn couldn't help but blush as he signed the contract, \"You're too kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrix took the contract and handed Shawn a folder, \"Thank you for what you're willing to put out there for the world to see, here is the script, the parts you'll be needed for are highlighted.  Have a nice day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn gladly took the folder and left, when he got to his car he called Rebecca to tell her the good news.  \"Hey cuz, I got the job!\"  Shawn said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's great news!  I must you sound a lot more excited than I thought you'd be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"  Shawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that I thought you wouldn't exactly be happy with the conditions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn froze, \"What conditions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca let out an audible sigh, \"Oh Shawn, please tell me you actually read the contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn gulped, \"What was on the contract?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca said in an overly calming manner, \"Oh, it's nothing.  Not that big a deal it's just...\"</span></div></div>",

There's a big difference.\"  Rebecca corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen enough movies to know that if a woman gets naked there is a good chance she's having sex with a dude.  Let me check the script right here, I'm sure it's in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother looking,\"  Rebecca said taking a long pause, \"There is a sex scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Rebecca!  If I wanted to use my powers to be a porn star I would have done it the second I moved here.  And it would have been as a guy!\"  Shawn threw in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew ew, please just stop, I really don't want the image of my cousin giving himself a large penis.\"  Rebecca sounded like she was about to throw up, \"Anyways it's not a sex scene.  Siobhan Reynolds has a no nudity clause in her contract so they needed a body double, I told them I had a girl who looked like her who would do it.  All you have to do is some stripping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stripping?  Is that all Becca?\"  Shawn said a bit skeptical, he could tell Rebecca wasn't telling him everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there will be...other things, just simple stuff like...rustling bedsheets and...naked hugging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn could only stare at his phone, \"Did you really just say, 'naked hugging'?\"  Shawn couldn't help it, he let out a chuckle, although his body made it more of a cute giggle, \"That's the dumbest thing you've ever said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca also laughed, \"Yeah, it was a bit silly.  But that really is what it will be.  You'll be naked, a naked guy will be there and they do some fancy camerawork, put Siobhan's face on you with computer graphics and it'll be done.  Simple as that.\"  Shawn was a little relived until she added,  \"I promise you won't be penetrated, I made sure that was in your contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, please don't talk about...penetrating.  Not cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I owed you one for the porn star crack...but seriously, I put that in your contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...thanks.  So let me get this straight, for this movie I'm not even really a stuntman erm well stuntwoman.  I'm a naked body double.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think there is a fight scene or two, but the main reason you got hired was the nudity thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"  Shawn said sarcastically, \"Well, I'm going to do something manly for now to make up for being a small naked woman next week.  Later.\"  Shawn hung up the phone, drove to his apartment, and shifted back into being himself...with a little more muscles and other male enhancements to overcompensate for what he was going to do next week.</span></div></div>",

He was back in his 'Chloe' form and was casually dressed in a grey t-shirt, a pair of denim shorts, socks and hi-tip sneakers. He had forgone wearing a dress that morning because he knew he'd be spending enough time in period costumes because of the nature of the film he'd be starring in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mediaeval fantasy? What the hell does that mean anyway?\"</i> he thought, grimacing a little as his mind ticked over. <i>\"There gonna be Hobbits and Orcs and an old guy in a grey robe running around?\"</i> he chuckled away to himself. \"Mind you...I wouldn't say no to a night in bed with one of those elves\" he smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman's voice suddenly snapped Shaun out of his trance; \"Miss Reilly, if you please!\" He glanced right slightly to see a stern looking Beatrix Hoff standing at the front gate waving him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh er...good morning!\" Shaun called out, before making his way over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late!\" Beatrix scolded him upon entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun frowned as he glanced at the ladie's gold watch on his slender wrist. \"Only a couple of minutes\" he countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure if you spent less time daydreaming you would be on time for your appointments young lady\" Beatrix said as she locked the gate. \"Now go into that building over there and let Sarah know you're here. She's the costume designer for the film.\" she directed Shaun towards a structure on the right. \"She'll make sure all your costumes fit properly\"..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun kept the statement he had in his head to himself; <i>\"From what I hear I won't be wearing many costumes.\"</i> Instead he just smiled at Beatrix and gently shook her hand, thanking her for her 'help'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah will accompany you back to see me when you're done\" the 'Hoff' then nodded firmly, because striding off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Somebody's got a stick up her ass!\" Shaun mumbled, pulling a face before heading over to his destination, the 'Wardrobe Department'. \"Hello?\" he called out in his female voice after knocking on the door and wandering in. He didn't see anyone, and so he decided to have a poke around. The strong smell of fabric and dust filled his nostrils as he made his way through the room, which was packed with mannequins, some dressed...some not. \"HELLO?\" he called out again, this time louder. Still there was no answer. Then he caught sight of a corset on one of the mannequins, and his faced contorted as he imagined being squeezed into it. \"Oh please no!\" he mumbled. And on the next mannequin over was a long, elegant dress, low-cut and crimson red with a gold floral pattern. To Shaun's eye it looked as uncomfortable as the corset, despite its beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly someone appeared behind Shaun and tapped him on the shoulder, making his squeal in a very girly fashion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Get out of here and leave the poor girl alone so I can get my measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just on my way out, I'll see you at the shoot tomorrow Chloe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see you then.\"  Shawn said.  He was kinda confused, at first he thought Tom was just hitting on him, but maybe he was just being a nice guy and he came off a little strong, <i>Am I just being paranoid about that?  Maybe I should talk to Rebecca about it.</i>  Shawn thought as Sarah snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Chloe.  I know you're in lala land after meeting the big movie star, but I need you to strip down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to your underwear, I need as accurate a measurement as I can get.\"  Shawn began to strip behind a screen, \"Come on Chloe, I'm going to see you without the cloths anyway, it's not like you're saving yourself for Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Somebody's a little catty.</i>  Shawn thought as he stripped down and thought about the conversation he'd just had while Sarah practically tied him up with measuring tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the director has a good eye for bodies, you're a perfect match for Siobhan measurements.

She had long blonde hair and was clad in a tank top, a long skirt, and perhaps a bit too much makeup. That aside, Shawn considered her quite attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are,\" Tom said at the sight of her. \"This cute little thing's here to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who are you calling a thing?</i> Shawn thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" the woman said, shaking Shawn's hand. \"I'm Sarah, and you are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe Reilly,\" Shawn replied.

So... how do you like the lead?\" she asked in a little too suggestive a tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thinks he's God's gift to women, doesn't he?\" Shawn said, glaring in the direction Tom had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah laughed. \"Well, I wouldn't disagree with him!

I wish I could do your job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd trade with you in a heartbeat, I assure you,\" Shawn flatly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sarah asked, raising an eyebrow. \"If you're that shy, why did you take this role?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was desperate,\" Shawn sighed. It was true enough; he'd have accepted the job even if he'd known what he was getting into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're not getting any pity from me, sister!\" Sarah said as she approached a rack of clothing and began to rummage through it.  \"You're gonna solve your money problems and all you have to do is rub up against a hot guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Great,\" Shawn grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax. It doesn't have to mean anything, you know. Anyway, we're here about the parts where you have clothes on.\" Sarah turned her head back and examined Shawn with an unsettling stare. \"Let's see... are those B-cups you've got there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yes?\" Shawn replied, suddenly not as sure about it as he'd been before, as it occurred to him he hadn't checked their exact size. He raised an arm halfway to his chest before stopping himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't you sound confident. It's important to know, you know. Well, we'll figure it out.\" Sarah kneeled down to peruse an assortment of shoes on the floor, most of which Shawn didn't fancy wearing. \"Hey, think you can run in heels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was glad Sarah couldn't see his eyes widen. \"Umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a no. It'd be nice if you could, but don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shawn considered what she was implying, he turned his gaze back to the red dress on display and made a connection. \"So I have to do action scenes in a dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you looked at the script?\" Sarah chided him. \"It's sort of required reading for an actress, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least tell me I don't have to wear this,\" Shawn said, motioning to the corset.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Only so you can take it off!\" Sarah laughed, prompting a groan from Shawn. She stood up, having set aside a few dresses and pairs of shoes, and picked up a roll of measuring tape before approaching Shawn. \"Okay, take your shirt off and let me measure you.\" Seeing him jump a little, she pointedly added, \"You can't possibly object.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right...\" Shawn muttered. He pulled his shirt over his head and dumped it on a nearby chair. Sarah promptly wrapped the measuring tape around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got nothing to worry about, you know,\" she said. \"We're all professionals here.\" Shawn couldn't reply, as his focus was spent stifling his reaction to Sarah's touch on his smooth skin as she continued to measure various parts of his body. He certainly didn't have to worry about feeling anything for Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Sarah finished her task and pulled away from Shawn. \"Close!\" she remarked. \"You certainly are a good double.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks?\" Shawn replied, appreciating the unwitting compliment on his abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank your parents!\" Sarah joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Shawn found himself wondering, for the thousandth time, where his powers had come from. Of course, he had no more answers than he had the previous nine hundred and ninety-nine times. But what he really wished he could know was whether there were others like him in the world. For all he knew he could have met one. Or several.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was in thought, Sarah returned to rack of clothes and picked out a dress which, as far as Shawn could tell, was identical to the one displayed on the mannequin. \"Alright, try this on,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot bothering to remove his shorts, Shawn took the dress and easily slipped into it, but couldn't quite get it to stay in place around his chest. \"Hmm, a little loose at the top,\" Sarah noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, uh, hang on a second...\" Shawn turned away from Sarah and pretended to fiddle with the dress as he subtly morphed his bust to better fill it. \"There we go,\" he said, turning back with the dress now fitting snugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Sarah breathed. A muted reaction, but enough to make Shawn realise that what he just did wasn't exactly wise. He mentally chided himself for acting on his impatience to get this over with. Still, he seemed to have gotten away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more costume fittings (and a demonstration that he could barely even <i>walk</i> in high heels - he'd need to practice that), Shawn and Sarah prepared to leave the Wardrobe Department.</span></div></div>",

The actress then gave Shaun a glance and her eyes widened. \"Oh my god! My double I take it?\" she smiled, reaching out to shake Shaun's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either that or just a remarkable lookalike\" Shaun joked, smiling nervously back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah immediately stepped in. \"Siobhan, this is Chloe Reilly, we've just finished fitting her for costumes. There's a little issue regarding heels, but apart from that we shouldn't have a problem\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problem?\" Siobhan frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...I have trouble walking in heels, much less running in them\" Shaun interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, well...I can give you lessons if you like. Its all about the balance, the way you walk, there's a knack to it honey\" Siobhan chuckled. \"In fact that's what we should do. And we can get to know each other a little too. Sarah, will you tell 'the Hoff' that I'm giving Chloe some lessons please\" she then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ha!

He wiggled his toes and smirked a little before looking back up as Siobhan returned to him carrying two pairs of her shoes. \"Okay, we'll start off easy okay, here!\" she said to Shaun, thrusting a pair of 1-inch 'kitten-heel'  pumps towards him. He took hold of them and let out a sigh, he was <u><i>not</i></u> looking forward to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then providing you can master those, we step it up\" Siobhan then giggled, as she held up a pair of her black &amp; red, 4-inch heel, louboutin pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun's eyes widened at the sight of the sky-high heels. \"Huh...yeah, 911 on standby!\" he chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiobhan dismissed his quip with a wave of her hand. \"You'll be fine! We're the same build, and if I can walk in these things then so can you\" she said. \"Besides, its nice to have a little extra height when you're stood next to the guys\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose!\" Shaun nodded, as he sat down and removed his socks, revealing his slender feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't paint?\" Siobhan inquired, and for a moment Shaun wondered what the hell she was talking about. Then he realized she was referring to his toe-nails, which were void of any nail polish whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...no, not my thing!\" Shaun answered with a disapproving shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun frowned as he slipped his feet into the kitten-heel pumps, which were just a shade too tight for him, but as before...he subtly shrank his feet ever so slightly until they fit snug in the shoes. \"Perfect fit!\" he said to Siobhan, who was stood over him. He then outstretched his feminine legs and put his feet together, studying his temporary new footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, on your feet honey\" Siobhan 'ordered' him, gesturing with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as he was told, Shaun stood up and began pacing the room slowly. After an initial stumble, he seemed to handle the kitten heels fairly well. But it was his walk that Siobhan seemed to pay attention to the most. \"You walk like a guy!\" she told him bluntly, before smirking a little. \"I mean...not a big, butch 'I'm gonna kick your ass' kinda guy, but you've definitely got a bit of a swagger going on\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun just shrugged and smiled, unsure what to say. If only she knew the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed over the next 20 minutes was a pain-staking, repetative routine of walking back and fourth, learning to walk like a 'lady'. But the more feminine Shaun's walk got...the easier he found it to walk in the 1-inch kitten heeled pumps. And Siobhan was delighted to see her teaching was paying off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The woman on the image was no actress, she was a female bodybuilder, three times Ms Olympia Champion, Olga Dubrovsky. The picture Becca had sent was of her on stage at the 2010 finals in Las Vegas, flexing powerful biceps, her bronzed body of taut, bulging muscle and sinew gleaming beneath a thick layer of oil. She wore a scrap of a thong and a bikini top that looked out of place on her non-existent breasts. She had a square jaw, a broad nose that seemed to take up most of her face, and drab, blonde hair that hung in limp coils around her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the statistics that captioned the image, she stood at 6'2.5 and was in the heavyweight category. He could believe that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's built like a brick bomb shelter, surely she can do her own stunts,\" Shawn wondered. Still, never look a gift horse in the mouth. Already he was unconsciously shifting to match her physique. His spine stretched inch by inch, and his hips widened. Muscles grew beneath his skin, and his face began to slowly resemble her blunt features. He ran his fingers through his hair and the strands lightened from brown to bleached blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to commit to the sex change aspect, the phone buzzed in his hand. It was a message from Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Hey soz that photo I sent was an old one. They've just given me the costume shots, passing them on to you!!! xxx</span>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalting the transformation, Shawn opened up the new attachment.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shawn snorted with laughter. The new photograph had been taken in what looked to be the costume department, and showed Olga Dubrovsky posing in front of racks of clothes. She was slathered in green paint from head to foot, with only One Million Years B.C.-style loincloth and tattered bra to cover her modesty. Evidently she'd undergone breast augmentation since quitting professional bodybuilding and her large, spherical, fake-looking boobs stood out from her chest like two melons glued to a washboard. A pair of tusks jutted from her jaw. All in all, she looked absurd, but something about the way she posed - crouched, snarling and reaching for camera with bestial menace - suggested that she was treating her role with absolute seriousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn wandered through into his bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. He shifted his gaze back and forth between the phone and his reflection as he gradually shifted his body and face to match Olga's. Normally he shifted into an identical copy of the actor or actress he would be doubling for then tweaked it, just enough to look different, but close enough to bear a remarkable resemblance. Half-way through the transformation, as his spine stretched and his shoulders broadened, he realised he was at risk of tearing his shirt. He paused the changes long enough to squirm out of his now-tight clothing, and continued morphing in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlga was not a pretty woman by any stretch of the imagination. It wasn't that Shawn didn't like muscular girls - working in the stunt business, he knew and had personally lusted after numerous women who were into their bodybuilding - but Olga had an ugliness that seemed to come from within. He suspected that the only reason she'd got the part was on the back of her recent reality TV show, <i>Russian About USA</i>, a program (from what little Shawn had seen of it) where Olga traveled across America attempting to start up her own chain of gyms, verbally and violently bullying seemingly everybody under her employ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breasts inflated like balloons. \"At least I may as well keep you,\" Shawn said to his penis. Certainly nobody would be surprised to find he was packing with a body like this. He examined himself. Happy that he matched Ms Dubrovsky exactly, he began to add little changes - a thinner nose, lower eyebrows, resculpted chin. He darkened the skin tone a little - it would hardly matter since they'd both be painted green - and shook out the bleached yellow of the hair to a more natural shade, since he'd mostly likely be wearing the same shaggy, black wig as her. He eased up a little on the musculature, though concerned that it made him look too feminine (actresses never liked it when their stunt doubles were prettier than themselves) he added extra droop to his boobs and buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding the final touches, he rang Becca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Shawn. Did you get those pictures I sent you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. Just finished changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Listen, this is short notice, but I've managed to arrange a meeting with the casting director and Olga. Do you think you can come round to mine in an hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, maybe. If I can something that'll fit,\" Shawn muttered, throwing open his wardrobe. It contained hundreds of pieces of clothing for all sorts of body types, men, women, fat, thin, even a selection of pet collars, but nothing that would fit his current physique that wasn't intended for a man. \"I don't suppose you have anything in extra extra extra... extra large, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shawn, don't say that, she's not <i>that</i> big,\" Becca chided him sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. She looks like a pig in a wig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shawn! Just because a woman has a little extra muscle doesn't make her ugly! Besides we can't all be like you - most of us don't have the luxury of being able to change their body shape every five minutes. If that's the way God made her then there's nothing wrong with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it was God that made her look the way she does,\" Shawn replied. \"More like a big syringe of testosterone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca sighed down the phone. \"Just don't say any of this stuff at the meeting, okay? She's probably a really, really nice person.\"</span></div></div>",

Can you believe how much I am in heaven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm hmm!\" the waitress chirruped without really hearing the words, her eyes darting around the restaurant for help as she squirmed uncomfortably on Olga's knee. The bodybuilder's hands were all over her, roaming up and down her legs, sliding up inside her skirt, roughly pinching her bottom. \"Actually I really should be see to the other tables. It's been lovely meeting- eep!\" She had attempted to stand, but Olga pulled her back down into her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not understand. I show you. You come to my gym and I show you what like to cum all over body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay!\" the waitress said, valiantly maintaining a rictus grin. \"I, uh, I have a boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vat is boyfriend to do with anything? I am much more man than your boyfriend. Here, feel my bicep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry Greenberg, casting director, fiddled with the cutlery as he sat beside them at the table. He wished Olga would let the poor woman go already, so that she could bring him his drinks, but he dared not say anything, for fear of angering the Russian woman, partly because she was perhaps the biggest name attached to the low-budget, schlocky fantasy film so far, partly because she towered over him. His face lit up as the restaurant door swung open and Rebecca Perry, the casting agent, stepped into the restaurant with Shawn behind her, stooping to get under the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Perry, it is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance,\" he beamed, shaking her hand enthusiastically. \"We've spoken on the phone so often, it's remarkable seeing you in person, And <i>this</i> must be our stunt Orc. My, that's a firm grip,\" he exclaimed, as Shawn's ham-fist wrapped around his own in a handshake. \"Well stand up, stand up! Let me have a look at you!\" Shawn stood, spinning around for the diminutive casting director, who clapped his hands excitedly. \"That is absolutely superb. She is the absolute spitting image.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zees woman does not look at all like me,\" Olga interrupted bluntly, her expression souring as she glowered at Shawn. \"She ees ugly, ugly woman. And vat is with zees muscles. There ees nothing there. Does she even pump?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ugly\"?! You're no oil painting yourself, you jumped-up D-lister!</i> Shawn thought angrily. He met Becca's gaze, silently begging her to let him retort, but she met his expression with one both sympathetic and stern, which conveyed '<i>yeah, okay, you were right, she's a jerk, but we really need this job.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... well...\" Greenberg faltered, not wishing to upset his star. \"Obviously she isn't perfect - what stunt double is! But we'll be obscuring the face and we'll be using mostly fast cuts for the action scenes, I'm sure the audience won't notice. Other than that, fantastic work, Miss Perry. Very well done indeed! I think this calls for drinks, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress took her chance to escape, scrambling away from Olga's grip and scurrying away towards the bar, red-faced and rearranging her ruffled clothing. Olga glared after her. She hit Shawn with an accusatory look, then her lustful gaze fell on Becca. Shawn felt his blood begin to boil as the bodybuilder's eyes wandered brazenly over his cousin's body, undressing her with her eyes. Becca didn't notice, or if she did she didn't say anything. She and Greenberg were busy discussing contracts, credentials, accident and injury insurance, schedules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Drinks! Finally!\" Greenberg cried in relief, as the waitress returned, sticking the side of the table furthest away from Olga as she placed their drinks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she tilted her head back to drink, Olga didn't take her eyes from Becca and Shawn didn't take his eyes from Olga. While the conversation continued, the actress shifted in her seat, her hands slipping beneath the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway if we can arrange a costume fitting before the YAAAH!\" Becca shrieked, jumping out of her seat as Olga's hand slid up her thigh. Shawn stood too, his hands balled into fists, staring the actress down. Becca recovered admirably, seizing Shawn by the arm and pulling him away before he could launch himself across the table. \"Mr Greenberg, you-you have my details. If you just want to fax me the paperwork. An-anyway, must dash. It's been a pleasure meeting you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand tightened on Shawn's arm. Reluctantly he allowed himself to be led away. As Becca turned, Olga moved, her open palm swinging around towards Rebecca's skirted bottom. A ringing slap echoed around the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a b!-\" Shawn yelled as Becca wrenched his arm, physically dragging him away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really need this job!\" she squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I'm going to kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare!\" Becca hissed, her face burned. \"It doesn't matter as long as we got the job, let's just leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just let her get away with that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can and will.\" She forced him through the restaurant door, out onto the heat of Hollywood Boulevard. \"Just drop it!\"</span></div></div>",

Just please please don't turn into a tiger and eat her or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn reluctantly gave another grunt this time signaling he heard what his cousin was saying, \"Besides,\"  Becca continued, \"she probably would just give you indigestion.\"  The two cousins laughed as they went their separate ways for the day.  After the encounter at with Olga, Shawn decided to go find some clothes for his massive female body.  Rebecca normally encouraged him to go with skirts and dresses for when he did stuntwork for women, but if ever there was a woman who would wear pants and button up shirts, it would be this one.  Satisfied with a few pieces of clothing Shawn went home, shifted back to normal and got ready for the coming work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few more days before the studio had begun shooting the movie and less than a week later they were ready for some stunts to be filmed.   To Shawn's immense surprise, Olga's orc was actually one of the good guys of the film and was supposed to be likable.  \"Hope Olga's a better actress than a person.\"  Shawn said to himself as he went off to wardrobe.  There he was provided with a strapless bra and a pair of panties, both the orc green color to match his skin which was about to get painted.  So Shawn said goodbye to his button up shirt and pants he'd worn into work and put on the matching undergarments and went to a tent area where they were painting all the orcs.  Shawn was pleasantly surprised that the cheap production actually seemed to have invested in some decent makeup and costume people.  There were only 4 other orcs getting ready, but each of them had a small army of people getting them ready with body paint, prosthetics, and then costumes.  There was only one spot ready for him so he reluctantly took the spot beside Olga who seemed to be finishing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she saw Shawn step up for his makeup Olga snorted, \"It von't take too long to get her ready, er puny muscles von't take long to cover up.\"  Shawn gave a grunt that seemed to becoming very fitting and regular for this new form and responed by simply flexing (and shifting a little bit to enhance his muscles a little bit) to try to shut up Olga and it seemed to work as all she could say was a dismissive, \"Pathetic.\"  Although Shawn could tell he had gotten to her a little.  Just a few minutes later as Shawn's body painting was almost done, Olga finished putting on her animal skin bra and loincloth and left without saying another word.  Shawn smiled as the makeup crew began putting on his tusks and other prosthetics, Olga's spot in the orc makeup line was taken by a 6'6\" black man who looked like he could have been Mr. Universe.  He looked at Shawn and with a smile said, \"That's the quietest Olga's been all week, whatever you did, keep it up.  I'm Rydell by the way.\"  Shawn smiled and gave another grunt of acknowledgement as he shook Rydell's hand, not because he didn't want to talk, but because he currently was getting fangs put in his mouth.  Shawn was very happy to see that Olga's coworkers had the good sense to hate Olga as much as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Shawn had finished filming his first stunt scene, it was a simple little fight scene where Olga's character had to fight off 5 human bounty hunters.  As Shawn did the fight over and over again he could hear Olga over and over talk about how she could do it better than him and could fight off 10 men on her own.  Shawn had finally had enough and after the scene was film Shawn pulled Olga off to the side and said, \"I'm sure you could fight and kill or whatever you claim, but this is a movie and these are stunts with real people doing real jobs who don't want to get hurt by an oaf of a muscle headed woman.  That's why I'm hear, because you may have the muscles but you don't know how to use them responsible.\"  Shawn backed off a little bit to await Olga's response, and it came quickly as Olga stepped right up to Shawn.  \"You dare say zat to me?\"  Olga said.</span></div></div>",

He had half a mind to storm right back in there and beat seven shades of shit out of the \"actress\" that had manhandled his cousin, yet he could see that Becca was desperate for this job. Using his stunt training and his superhuman control over his body, he lowered his heart rate, flushed the testosterone and adrenaline out of his system, and his rage slowly ebbed, his angry feelings reducing down to more cunning thoughts. He took a long, deep breath. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I'm dropping it. But only for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Shawn,\" Becca sighed, releasing her grip on his arm. \"For a moment there I thought you were actually going to punch her.\" She forced a weak smile. \"Guess you were right after all. What was it you called her, a pig in a wig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like a chauvinist pig in a wig,\" Shawn muttered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh. What a creep. Still, the important thing is we secured the job. Want to share a cab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn shook his head. \"It's okay, I think I'm going to walk home. Work off some of my anger, you know.\" He glanced up at the dark clouds gathering over the hot, humid city. \"Looks like it could rain though. Mind if I borrow your coat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca shrugged her coat from her shoulders and handed it to him, before turning to hail a cab. Shawn watched her go, making sure that her cab had rounded a corner and vanished from sight before he turned and walked back down the boulevard towards the restaurant. Still in his Olga-esque form, the pedestrians gave him odd looks and a wide berth as they passed. Just before he reached the restaurant, he turned and ducked down an alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never shapeshifted into his cousin before, but he had known her so long that visualizing and adopting her form was easy. His bulky form shrank away, his bulbous breasts becoming Becca's more modest B-cups, his blunt features softening into her pretty, girl-next-door good looks. In less than a minute, he had become her perfectly, in form and voice at least. The clothes were another matter. He tightened the trousers as much as possible around his shrunken hips and rolled up the excess fabric bunched around his ankles. Pulling Becca's coat over his shoulders, he buttoned it up to the top, concealing the baggy shirt beneath. He took a moment to practice her professional bearing and style of speaking, then strode out of the alley and into the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreenberg was just in the process of paying the bill as he walked up the table. Olga ogled him lustfully as he seated himself at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Perry! I wasn't expecting you back,\" Mr Greenberg blinked in surprise. \"Did you forget something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I did,\" Shawn replied with a sweet smile. \"There is a second stunt woman that I wanted to show you - ah, now, I <i>say</i> stunt woman. In actual fact she considers herself more of an actress but she <i>is</i> stunt trained, and she does all her own stunts. She's not quite such the match for Ms Dubrovsky as my previous client, but she's just been <i>begging</i> me to introduce her to you. That's if you have time, of course!\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreenberg swirled his highball cocktail glass, considered the remains of his drink, and said, \"I believe I have a few minutes. Is she here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just pulling up outside now. If you'll excuse me, I just need to go powder my nose,\" Shawn said, rising from his seat. His heart was pounding again - there was no way this plan was going to work. The ladies toilets was empty. Grateful for that, he dived into one of the cubicles, quickly stripping out of his clothes. He had only a few minutes of Greenberg's attention to do this, better make it quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis spine crackled like popcorn as his height expanded once again up to 6'1'. Mass changes were a tiring business and all this yo-yoing between weights and heights was exhausting him. He leaned for a moment against the cubicle, panting a little, before continuing. In his mind, he was formulating a new body, one balanced perfectly between strong and sexy, muscular but feminine, combining the best aspects of both. Into this design he poured his own fantasies of an ideal woman. A vision of an amazon beauty formed in his head, sweeping out to alter the rest of his body to match. His muscles returned, though far less pronounced and swollen than in his Olga-esque form, softened by a layer of fat. His hips and shoulders widened, while his abdominals tightened, forming an hourglass figure. Becca's girl-next-door features sharpened into a face that was somewhat aloof and haughty, with thin, arched brows, yet still pretty with pouty lips. His hair flowed out behind, full and thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing his ear against the cubicle door, he made sure the coast was clear before slipping out into the bathroom. Standing proudly in front of the mirror, he admired his creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4tr5uzWqh1r9o02yo1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4tr5u...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA broad grin split his face. Olga Dubrovsky didn't stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis teeth made quick work of his clothing once he grew them into knife-sharp incisors, shredding through the fabric with ease. He tore into the trousers until they resembled a garment so scanty that could hardly even be called hot-pants, and the shirt barely covered his breasts once he was done with it, exposing his taut abs. The ragged edges looked a little untidy, but he figured they'd probably pass as a fashion statement. Carefully he smoothed the fabric down over his curves. If he played this right, he could have Olga's role in the film before the day was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... show time.\"</span></div></div>",

As his eyes fell on Shawn, he gave a quiet \"Urk!\" as the ice lodged in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Greenberg, hi,\" Shawn crooned, as the casting director thumped his chest and made choking noises. Shawn leaned across the table, flashing both smile and cleavage. His erect nipples jutted through the shirt, nearly poking the diminutive man's eyes' out. \"You've no idea how long I've wanted to meet you. Were... were you just leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not at all!\" he squeaked weakly. \"I was just about to order another, but I'm, uh, afraid you have me at something of a disadvantage, Mrs-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Miss</i> Shauna Rowe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Rowe, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,\" he bubbled, stretching out a rather sweaty hand for Shawn to shake. \"Let me just say that you have exactly the sort of body I ha - uh, <i>we</i> have been looking for! For the film!\" His beady eyes roved lustfully up and down Shawn's body behind his spectacles. As did Olga's, though her's was all suspicion and distaste. \"Your agent tells me you're an... actress, yes?\" Greenberg queried eagerly. \"For that matter, where has Miss Perry gotten to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stomach upset,\" Shawn smiled, patting his stomach, and Greenberg nodded understandingly. \"And yes, I do <i>so</i> want to act.\" He affected confusion. \"But I was told this was stunt work only?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this girl!\" Olga barked, thumping the table with her fist. \"Who is she! She is not my double, she looks nothing like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should hope not,\" Shawn muttered under his breath, loud enough for her to hear. Olga's face turned beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreenberg waved his hand dismissively. \"Pah! Stuntwork! A waste of your talents, my dear,\" he said, his eyes fixed on Shawn's breasts. \"Tell me, how would you like to play female Orc warrioress #3? Perhaps even- and I hope you understand that I'll be upsetting a great many people with this casting change - Orc warrioress #2?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fantastic!\" Shawn squealed, excitedly gripping the guy's hand. \"Though are you sure there isn't anything a little more center stage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreenberg shook his head. \"I'm afraid not. The only other role that I can think f has already been taken, by Miss Dubrovsky here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn had spent enough time around actors and actresses to know how to rile them, and he tilted his head in her direction as if struggling to place her face, asking dizzily, \"Sorry, do I know you? Are you famous? I don't think I've ever seen you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little girl, I am Ola Dubrovsky!\" Olga roared, furious. \"I am the lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reeeally? They cast <i>you</i>?\" Shawn shared a glance with a guilty looking Greenberg, who shrugged apologetically and silently mouthed \"the executives\" behind his hand. Shawn patted Olga's meaty clenched fist sympathetically. \"Well... that's so nice for you. It's so good to see Hollywood finally employing some transsexual actors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bellow and a shower of cutlery, Olga flipped the table and swung at Shawn. Shawn allowed his martial arts training to take over and was pleasantly surprised to find his new body was faster and stronger than his baseline form, dodging the blow with ease. As Olga's fist passed his face, he grabbed her arm, using her momentum to lift her vast body up over his head. He held her there for a moment - Greenberg staring on in awe - before slamming her down into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been nice meeting you,\" Shawn said, stepping lightly over the downed bodybuilder to shake the stunned man's hand. He couldn't help smiling as he walked out the restaurant, confident that he'd made an impression that Greenberg would not forget in a hurry. And he hadn't even had to sleep with him!</span></div></div>",

The hardest part was <i>choosing</i>, but eventually Shawn settled on a filth-encrusted strip club, and slipped into a cubicle in the men's toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart Two - swap clothes. He stripped out of his male clothes, donning a collection of items he had purchased minutes ago from a thrift shop - a short, leopard-print skirt, stained, white panties that might once have been white, cheap plastic heels, and a man-ish denim shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart Three - shapeshift Olga Dubrovsky's form (with modifications). The cubicle and the clothes seemed to contract around him as he swelled into Olga's stature, adopting her flat ugly face, her straggly hair. Then he added the modifications. A dark coating of stubble sprouted from his heavy jaw, while a very distinct bulge formed in the front of the skirt as he replaced her female equipment with a large, thick penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart Four - perfume. He opened a bottle of cheap vodka, dousing himself liberally in it. He bundled his male clothes into the bag and hid them behind the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart Five - strut your stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeads turned as Shawn emerged like a transsexual troll from the men's bathroom and wobbled drunkenly on his heels across the strip club floor and out the door. Walking down the boulevard, boobs and bulge swaying, people stopped and stared. It wasn't more than five minutes before the paparazzi descended like flies. Cars screeched up and photographers scrambles out, cameras already clicking. They buzzed about, heckling him, bulbs flashing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much have you been drinking today, Miss Dubrovsky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you last shave, Miss Dubrovsky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say to these rumours that you're a man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn barged his way through the growing number of photographers. \"Get out of my way! I am working!\" He gave a drunken swipe at one of them, intentionally missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly is your job, Miss Dubrovsky? Care to explain to our readers what you're doing on Hollywood Boulevard dressed like a hooker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was working perfectly. He reached into the shirt pocket, pulling out a small plastic bag of sugar. He dabbed some on his gums, snorted some up his nose. The cameras flashed faster as they jostled each other to capture the best angle of this very public, celebrity meltdown. Shawn gave an angry roar, wrenching the nearest camera out of the grip of its owner and slamming it into the ground, smashing it into a thousand plastic pieces. Then he turned and ran, back towards the strip club. He managed to slip past the bouncers, who closed together to block the crowd of excited paparazzi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to come out some time, Olga!\" one of them yelled after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's what you think</i>, Shawn chuckled to himself. He returned to the toilet cubicle and shifted back into his male body and clothes. The photographers were still clustered on the sidewalk outside, but paid him no mind this time as he pushed his way through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Becca says I can't act,\" he muttered smugly, as he walked home.</span></div></div>",

Almost the whole thing was given over to \"Olga's\" meltdown, her drink and drug addiction, the revelation that she was a pre-op transsexual, her violent tendencies. The guy whose camera Shawn had broken was considering suing. Dirt had been dug up on her past, revealing a history of assault and several people were already coming forward with stories of sexual harassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe icing on the cake was the true Olga's reaction to all this. The paparazzi had tracked her down later in the day and shown her the footage. The bodybuilder had gone ballistic, punching out several reporters and breaking a guy's nose. \"Zat ees not me! Zat does not even look like me! I yam a woman! Why you people not leave me alone!\" the footage showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A statement released by her agent later in the day maintains that Dubrovsky is not a man, but apologises for her conduct and has agreed to admit herself into a clinic to be treated for anger management and drug rehabilitation, casting doubt over whether she will be able to meet her commitment for filming in the upcoming Swords and Sorcery movie, Dragon Horde. Filming is expected to be delayed while Olga undergoes treatment, though with such a big budget blockbuster, this could prove costly for the studio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang. Grinning for ear to ear, Shawn answered it. It was Becca. He couldn't quite figure out if her voice was super-excited or super-pissed-off, but he suspected it was both. \"Shawn, do you mind telling me why I have the casting director of Dragon Horde on the phone asking for the actress Miss Shauna Rowe? He wants to arrange a costume fitting as soon as possible... for the role of Orc Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. Fancy that,\" Shawn chortled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, I <i>knew</i> that was you on TV. I can't believe you went and did this, after I specifically told you not to interfere. Damnit, Shawn, what are we going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think I'm going to star in a blockbuster film, we're both going to get rich, and the agency will get the break it always needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, but this is a lot of attention, a lot more than stuntwork. If you actually go through with this, suddenly everybody is going to be wanting to know who this Shauna Rowe is. I'm going to have to find fake papers or... something. Not to mention the Screen Actors Guild will literally kill me when they find out one of their members has been replaced with an non-unioned actress. Literally kill me. What a mess. I don't even know where to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have complete faith that you'll sort everything out,\" Shawn replied, the bright lights of stardom buzzing round his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare hang up on me. I've half a mind to cancel this -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnding the call, Shawn lay back on the couch with a sigh. He was going to be famous!</span></div></div>",

He spent the afternoon slipping in and out of his amazonian body, sampling the form that he would be assuming routinely for the next few months, having a fun time strutting naked through his small apartment, striking heroic fantasy poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afternoon, Becca texted him, commanding him to meet for coffee and that he come \"in character\". He found what clothes would fit, was pleasantly surprised to find that even his male clothes looked fabulous stretched over his new form, and set out, relishing the attention he got from passers-by as he walked through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found her in the most secluded part of the loudest coffee bar she could find, drinking it black and in large quantities, slumped low over her cup with bleary red eyes. Only when he sat at the table did she recognise him, glaring at him moodily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look tired,\" Shawn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> tired,\" she growled. \"I haven't slept.

You're not Clark Kent; if people figure out that my star is one letter away from my cousin, they're going to put two and two together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll figure out that I'm a shapeshifter from that?!\" Shawn said dubiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but they might start thinking Shawn and Shauna are the same person, that you're some sort of transsexual, especially with a body built like that. The media'll start prying, and there goes your privacy. You'll have to be very careful shapeshifting from then on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn shrugged. \"Relax, I've got an exit strategy. See I'm pretty sure I can move my heart around my chest, and mask my pulse. Whenever we're done with \"Shauna\", we buy some cocaine, rent a hotel room, and fake an overdose. Hey, maybe Marilyn Monroe was a shapeshifter too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca ground her teeth. \"I've already risked my neck buying forged papers, Shawn, I'm not helping you score cocaine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a star. Getting cocaine is like half your job now,\" Shawn teased her. \"Hey, do you think I'll need an entourage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said bluntly. She snapped open her purse, pulling out two empty beer bottles and handing them across the table. \"Hold these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're a young, attractive, single woman in LA. That means you need facebook, twitter, instagram, and all the other shit, and a literal mountain of selfies of you drinking cocktails and draping yourself over all the other young, attractive people. I have a lifetime of social media to forge for you, so hold the glasses, and try to look happy and drunk.\" Shawn obliged, and she took a series of photographs, before reaching under the table and digging out a bulging plastic bag. A few stiletto heels jutted out of the stretched plastic, and she pulled a slinky black scrap of a dress from the bag. \"Go change in the bathroom,\" she commanded, pushing the skimpy garment into his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have to fake at least a dozen nights out for you in one evening to make this believable,\" she explained exasperated. \"And you're not telling me you wore <i>that</i> same outfit to every single one,\" she said, gesturing to his male attire in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... right...\"</span></div></div>",

It's also great sleep in. His twin bed feels like a king size bed. He can stretch out and move around without boobs or balls getting in the way. Shawn walks into the bathroom and is reminded of the one drawback of this body. He can't even reach the medicine cabinet. He briefly morphs himself taller, gets what he needs out of the cabinet and return to his 4' 8\" hieght. After brushing his teeth he hops in the shower. He smiles as this body has less surface area to wash. He saves money on soap and water. \"More curves though could be fun\", he muses while washing his demunitive breasts.</span></div></div>",

They might as well be double D's as small as his petite Asian hands are. \"Oh yeh, love those oversized Asian nipples\", he mutters while playing with them. He then starts playing with his clit. He knows its a little perverted, but another benifit of being a woman is that the orgasms are out of this world. He morphs the fingers on his one hand into a 10\" cock. He then slowely works it into his slit. \"Aw Shawn, me love you long time\", he says. He's played this masturbation scene out before. It's pathetic that the only piece he can get without fail is his own. \"Ahhhhh\", he screams out as he climaxes. He sits in the shower panting for a few minutes as his body is racked with wave after wave of pleasure. He then withdraws his cock hand from his vagina, cleans up and, gets out of the shower. After drying off he stands in front of the mirror for a while just staring at himself or rather herself. He feels as if he's loosing it. Nothing has worked out like he planned since coming to this town. He survives in this town using a collection of different personas. He doesn't even know who he is anymore. He's started having some gender identity issues as well. Heck he's started having some doubts that he's even human. If this latest gig doesn't work out he's decided he will just go home. He sighs and just shakes head knowing that, that won't solve his problems either. Even his default form of Shawn Rowe is just a collection of borrowed features he's been putting together since his ability first manifested when he was 13. It's hard to say what he would really look like if he didn't have this ability. He looks over at his photo album. It contains all the people he's ever become. He keeps it for reference in case he has to become them again. \"Is the real Shawn Rowe somewhere in there\", he wonders?</span></div></div>",

She is a very attractive 5'7, olive skinned and black haired woman who had a nice curvy figure. Currently the 'girlfriend' is holding Nadia's hand as they run together. The looks they were giving each other makes the nature of their relationship clear. \"Amy! Hi there! I want you to me Kia Liddy, my girlfriend!\" declares Nadia, her beautiful voice as enthralling as her. \"Hi Amy, lovely to meet you!\" exclaims Kia, saucily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral thoughts filled Shawn's mind, a threeway heavily featured. But the thought of lesbian sex was still a turn off. Having it, rather than watching it, that is. \"So will you join us....for a run?\" asked Nadia, holding Kia in her right arm. \"Sounds great!\" agreed Shawn/Amy. \"They are inviting me to a possible threeway! Guys dream about that! But I would still have to be a girl to get it!\" he thought. Nevertheless he took up the challenge. Even with his shapeshifting, Kia and Nadia were proving to be quite the challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exhausting his mental energy to maintain the muscles to keep up with them. Finally, he stopped, taking a moment to breathe. \"Are you ok, hon?\" asked Kia, squeezing her hand. \"Can we help?\" offered Nadia, her eyes brimming with lust. Shawn reminded himself how weird lesbian sex would be for him. However Nadia and Kia make a convincing case when they engaged her in a three way kiss. It felt amazing! She kissed back eagerly, before she felt very adventurous fingers engaging in highly illegal, public acts. \"Come home with us!\" proposed Nadia. Shawn knew she shouldn't, but Kia's gentle massage was making a compelling argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like things were happening faster than she expected. In no time, she was naked on a bed, waiting for the two girls kissing each other to disrobe. They turned, beaming at her. They stripped fast, hands squeezing before they flipped Shawn/Amy on her side. Then the two girls tongues got involved. All negative impressions of experiencing sapphic sexual experiences left when two tongues explored the crevices of her tender openings. Her orgasm was so swift, that Shawn barely had time to think before a second wave of multiple climaxes assaulted her tiny Asian body. She was so weary, that she was on the verge of passing out until a few well placed belly tickles awoke her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for more, pretty princess!\" declared Kia as she repositioned Amy/Shawn for....</span></div></div>",

The freaky finger thing she did was one thing. But this was gay, gay! And she wasn't into that! Before she could say something, Kia slid underneath her, making her gasp when the rod made contact with her twitching womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to take her!\" sang Kia as both girls moved in. Amy/Shawn roared with delight as each girl took their time. Orgasms as a girl were truly fantastic! The gay aspect was forgotten as the two girls got to work. Nadia pumped her slowly, entering her backside with precision while balancing herself with her right hand. Her left was busy rolling back Amy's right breast. Kia helped by maintaining Nadia's wait while sucking on Amy's neck. Her left breast was massaged properly. Amy increased her muscles to keep her from collapsing, though it seemed unnecessary. Nadia seemed so light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy/Shawn moaned louder as they increase the pace. Her body was gushing liquid, her eyes closed to the wonderful sensations. Each thrust was driving her more and more aroused. Then the objects inside her began to vibrate. All thoughts left her as she began a series of explosions. She fell on top of Kia as her climaxes left her bereft of anything else. Her eyes closed and this time she didn't wake up straight away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy/Shawn's eyes opened as she rose slowly. Her whole body felt exhausted. Her shifted muscles were gone. She was still without her clothes, when she felt it. It was something no man had ever experienced in the history of mankind. It was a baby's kick. She stood up, looking at her belly with shock. The toilet door opened and two grinning, exposed girls greeted her. \"Hello Shawn!\" they chanted, wickedly. \"Wh-what?\" she gasped. Nadia beamed. \"Let me explain!\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed so unreal. \"ARGHHHH!\" she exclaimed, vomiting heavily. Both girls rushed over to help her. \"Come on, sweetie!

Using his shapeshifting skills to dodge all responsibilities, creditors and anyone who got in his way. Even used his fingers in a vile way. But you aren't like him, Amy! We don't want to lose you!\" she responds. Amy was shocked at how much Nadia and Kia knew about her. Clearly this wasn't decided overnight. \"Would you like some tea, sweetheart?\" offered Kia. All Amy could do was nod. Kia surprised Amy by lifting her up, making her squeal. \"Behave or I'll tickle!\" threatened Kia as she walked to their kitchen, keeping Amy in her arms. \"Your muscles look exactly the same!\" expressed Amy. Kia giggled. \"I've packed them tight internally. How do you think we were able to beat you in the race?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paused as Kia put on the electronic kettle. \"How did you both impregnate me? I still don't understand!\" Kia stiffened before apologising again. \"Kia, please just tell me. A lesbian threeway experience or pretending that Amy and Shawn are distinct personalities won't earn my forgiveness yet. Just be honest with me, both of you. And we can start to build a real relationship. A real relationship between the three of us as well as our children. But I have to know!\" expressed Amy, sighing. Kia nodded. \"Nadia figure you out the first time you two met. She and I discussed how we could do this. We agreed that we didn't want to just knock you up and steal the baby or babies. That we were going to be real girlfriends or wives to you. That we would help you emotionally, financially and professionally. We practised shape-shifting using our combined DNA. It took us ages to perfect it. We had so many samples checked with our 'special' GP. Finally we mastered it and set ourselves the task of our seduction. That \"Hello Shawn\" bit was unfair. I regret it and I know so does Nadia. We really want you to be part of our family, Amy!\" This was a lot to handle and Amy was grateful just to drink tea before she had to reply.</span></div></div>",

Inevitably all shapeshifters surrender it. Male shapeshifters have shorter lifespans. Female shapeshifters can live up to 256 years. Jeanne Calment was actually a lot older than she appeared to be.

So I can't help you much, sweetie as you need all that energy for the babies.\" she advised. \"So where do shapeshifters live?\" Asked Amy. \"All over, but there are plenty in Cosquillas Bay, the all female city. But men aren't allowed, so no-one changes into male form there.\" she answered. \"Naughty girls! Both still naked! Later I will have to use the feather duster on such naughty cheeks!\" exclaimed Kia. \"I got you a gig as Cassandra Cain, Amy. You are exactly what they are looking forward. Tiny, Asian and hot. You will be stunt double and I will be on tailor duties! Thing is its in Conkling, California not far from Cosquillas Bay. So we can stay at our house there! Sound good?\" Kia nodded.

What about a bra or underwear?\" Kia giggled at that. \"Honey, if modesty is an issue, you should know we are both still staring at that perfect bare bod!\" she remarked, making Amy blush.

All she knew was she was waiting at a cafe and the answer would come soon. A phone call interrupted her reveries. A quick check revealed that it was the producer of the gritty, underground, martial arts film. \"Mr Trillman, what a surprise!\" began Becky. \"Sorry to do this to you, but the funding has been cancelled for the film. So we won't be needing your services!\" responded the producer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky wanted to scream into the phone, but bit her lip. \"That isn't a problem, these things happen sadly.\" \"Thank you, Ms Perry. Good day!\" he concluded, before the phone went dead. Becky stared at the phone, before slamming it back into her handbag. \"Careful, you'll destroy it!\" warned a voice. Becky recognised Shawn's Amy disguise. Who she didn't recognise was the two beauties on each arm. They towered over Shawn, but neither was that tall. \"Hello Becky, I'm Nadia, Amy's girlfriend and this is Kia, our girlfriend!\" Becky was a little surprise, but shook both girls hands. As she did, she notices both hands bulking up then revering to normal. Yep, Shawn was having a lesbian relationship with two girls. Or they appeared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you too have uh...a unique condition?\" asked Becky, not sure how much they knew about Shawn. \"They know everything, Becky. You need to know something.\" she exclaimed, taking Beckys hand. \"Umm..what are you...HEY!...What?\" gasped Becky going from anger to confusion as Amy rested her had on her belly. Becky felt gentle kicks and stared at Amy. \"You...you're pregnant!\" Becky stammering, reeling from the news. \"Yes, Nadia and I are the daddies!\" Kia whispered. Becky looked at Amy for an explanation. \"Shall we explain more at our house?\" Offered Nadia. Becky nodded as the three other girls rose from their seats. Becky wanted to talk to Shawn alone, away from these two. But he seemed to revel in the attention, they were giving him. With kisses and hand holding and a few naughty thugs. Had he been brainwashed? Were they really girls? How could this be real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts swallowed Becky in the trek between the cafe and the couch in their luxurious apartment. Becky sat down as Amy on their laps, squealing a little as the girl Kia scratched her ribs. \"Sorry, Amy is hyper ticklish, I couldn't resist!\" explained Kia. Becky could just nod, nervously. \"Becky, we have a job for our Amy. Here is the script!\" Explained Nadia. Amy stared at the script, looking surprised as if she didn't know it existed. A quick skim made Beckys eye widened. \"This is for a superhero! And Steve Roland is the director! The man from the Dark Knight and Man of Steel trilogies!\" she exclaimed. \"And Sam Curtin is co-producer. This script was sent to me via my PA. I am a tailor!\" explained Kia. \"Let's start from the beginning!\" Suggested Nadia.</span></div></div>",

What struck her was how relaxed Shawn was. Again two beautiful woman were showering him with attention and obviously he must have received intense physical pleasure from both girls at the same time. Three ways were obviously a way to weaken anyone's sense of gender identity.  She was also a bit miffed about how Kia and Nadia had tricked her into thinking they were getting a Kung-fu movie while negotiating a job for Kia and Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did I just think of Shawn as Amy?\" thought Becky with an internal gasp. \"So Shawn can't go back to being Shawn Rowe?\" Becky sought to confirm. Both girls looked each other before reluctantly shaking their heads. \"Her default form has changed. Shapeshifters are overwhelming female. The male ones eventually default to female. Amy is just doing it sooner. Kia and I already have passports, drivers' licence, health cards, Photo ID cards, SCN and a host of other things set up for her.\" explained Nadia. \"How long have you been planning this?\" Asked Becky. \"Since Nadia caught Shawn staring at her. Once she shifted to Amy, I took her photo and we set to work, creating the new life for a cute lady love with her cute belly button!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky shook her head, slightly amused as Any dissolves into giggles from Kia playing with her navel. Nadia soon goosed some ribs and Amy was in fits. Things quickly changed and Becky rushed behind a door. Despite herself, she opened that door slightly. They had all forgotten she was there as three girls devoured each other on the large couch. Becky forces herself to leave her cousin and her lovers to their private moment. What should she do? Shawn might be thrilled down with the sex and beautiful girlfriends. But she was also pregnant. How would she explain thing to Shawns parents? Becky had promised to take care of her cousin. Now he had a sex change and was pregnant! Becky looked at her own body for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn had picked a very sexy little body. Large chest, round cheeks, beautiful eyes, long, flowing hair....Becky paused. Had Amy shifted her body again, because that sure wasn't what her Amy Rowe disguise looked like. Could it even be the girls she was having? So many questions. Becky gasped when she realised that her hand was under her thong, tenderly caressing the area. Becky had started questioning her sexual identity ever since she accidentally walked into a stall and got a look at one of the prettiest, private things she had ever seen. A profuse apology and a duck back into the lingerie section had not dulled how excited she had gotten. \"It's Shawn, not some random stranger! It's incest! And those girls are practically her wives! Stop it!\" Try as she could, whispering that statement aloud, didn't stop the embers burning at her loins. She ran into the same girl at the gym showers. She was lucky the girls eyes were closed, even luckier she turned around as Becky had to duck into the toilets after seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could still see the mysterious girl rubbing her mergers, eyes closed in silent rapture. Becky felt her knees buckle. She couldn't stand it any longer and she rushed. She found the master bedroom and flung her clothes away. She dug through cupboards, not sure what she was looking for until she found a strange box called ticeros. Becky was too far gone to contemplate as she opened the box.</span></div></div>",

I have your drivers licence, did you drop it in the gym?\" she asked. Becky went red and pink when she recognised the voice. It was the beautiful girl she saw at the gym. With her luck, she might turn out to be a shapeshifter too. \"Oh thank you! I have been looking everywhere for it!\" lied Becky. \"Wait, aren't you the girl that accidentally walked in on me in the gym bathroom, then avoided me after my workout when I was in the showers?\" asked Elaine.

Meet you there in an hour!\" declared Elsine, before hanging up. Becky stared at the phone for a minute before expressing herself. \"I have a date! I have a date! I have a date!\" She leapt up and down before hearing that dreaded expression. \"Ahem.\" Becky squealed, covering her privates as she spun to face Amy and her two beautiful companions. All three were dressed, making her feel even more exposed. \"That's a ticero on the bed. It's used by shapeshifters for extreme pleasure. Good thing you didn't use it before checking, it could have been disastrous.\" revealed Nadia. Becky wanted the earth to open and swallow her up. She truly feared she would blush herself to death a la KP. \"Although since you were so happy just to get a date, perhaps a great way to go?\" mused Kia before all 3 shifters broke into fits of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky just stood there, keeping herself covered. She couldn't recall feeling such embarrassing, mortifying m, humiliating shame as she was now experiencing. \"Becky, we're messing with you! We will let you get dressed, then we can talk about where to go from here. About the babies, the Roland job and what to tell my parents. And about your date.\" Proposed Amy, before taking her girls out of the room. Becky dressed quickly, her mind overwhelmed from all these events.

The whole thing had been an experience to say the least, and a big part of him was actually looking forward to his new job. He got to his feet and wandered over to the mirror, quickly shifting back into the brunette woman he had been last time. He tossed his hair out of his pretty face and smiled at his reflection, blowing kisses and striking poses. \"Oh I'm sure it won't be that bad!\" he purred in a female voice, before morphing back into his normal self. \"Not bad at all\" he then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it all depended on the actress he'd be doubling for.

She's going to be wearing skin tight outfits in the movie and you may have some close-ups during the action scenes, your body anyway, it'll show. \"Fine\", Shaun sighs.

Anyway...I never thought they'd get anyone who looks so much like me. Usually the stunt double has to seriously stuff her bra\" Bianca prattled on, laughing as they walked together. Meanwhile Shawn decided he'd better avert his own eyes from Bianca's cleavage and admire his own instead. \"I really LOVE that dress, it looks good on you, I'll have to borrow it\" Bianca then winked, acting more like Shawn's new sister than someone he'd just met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...sure!\" Shawn shrugged, smiling at Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very talkative are you\" Bianca chuckled, glancing at Shawn, still holding his hands. \"Well never mind, people rarely get a word in edgeways with me anyway, I know I talk a lot, but hey...I have a mouth so I use it right\" she said, which immediately put the image in Shawn's mind of Bianca sucking a guy off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I bet you do\"</i> he thought to himself with a cheeky grin on his pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 10 minutes Bianca continued talking Shawn's ear off while showing him around, getting him used to the set and the other actors/actresses.

The sound of a steady spray of urine hitting porcelain was heard only by him. He then wiped himself dry (itself a pleasurable experience) and exited the cubicle to wash his feminine hands. After that was done...Shawn just stared at his reflection in the mirror, admiring the way he looked. \"Not bad!\" he nodded, smiling again. He then got a picture of Julie in his mind, and he felt his crotch moisten again as his mind wandered, he really did like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, he snapped himself out of his self-induced trance and stared back into the mirror, and he was shocked to see Julie staring back at him. \"Oh shit!!\" Shawn exclaimed in Julie's cute voice as he ran his hands over his morphed body. He still had on the dress and shoes he had been wearing, but they were a little loose on him. \"That'll teach me to let my mind wander\" he grumbled to himself, as he swept his blonde hair from his face then looked down at his smaller breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he heard the door to the restroom opening, and in walked...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Truth be told she has a ton of clothes at home both make and female to suit whatever mood she's in. She really does enjoy shopping for clothes and it's even better if Becca is buying. She throws the rest in the bag and wears the jeans, blouse, and simply heels combo for the interview. The top is revealing though it would be hard to hide her assetts in any case. Becca thinks she should wear something even more revealing, but Kelly says, \"I'm going for a support staff role not an acting one\". They're soon on there way to the meeting. On the way Becca goes over his cover identity. Her name is Kelly Smith and she's a little known stunt woman that just moved from the East coast. She originally wanted to get into acting, but decided doing stunt work was more for her. Actresses were a dime a dozen and the careers fleeting. Soon they're pulling into the parking lot for the meeting. Kelly keeps the blonde hair. She thinks it looks better giving her a different look from the actress. She can always change it later for the shoot.</span></div></div>",

The office is full of people and they seem very upset. After an intraduction the man behind the desk says, \"Miss Perry I'm afraid there has been a problem since out last meeting. Bianca has dropped out of the movie due to some contract problems. We won't be needing your clients services\". Kelly's heart sinks. Becca is clearly upset to and says, \"Ok\". Becca and Kelly turn to walk out. Just then one of the men gets up and says, \"Wait! Ms.Smith have you ever thought of acting\"? Before she even considers the repercussions Kelly say, \"Yes, I've always wanted to act\". Becca nudges her in the ribs and shakes her head. The man smiles and says, \"How would you like to take Bianca's part\"? Before Kelly can respond one of the other men says, \"You've got to be kidding, Bill. She's a stunt woman\". The man named Bill says, \"I'm not kidding. Look at her she's perfect for the part. How long do you think it would take to find another, or to rewrite the part to fit another actress. It would cost us millions. This girl could be Bianca's sister. Production has already been held up for three weeks thanks to Bianca's demands. We could start right now with Ms.Smith\". The other men in the room start agreeing and it's then that Kelly begins to understand what all this means. She'll have to be this woman for as long as it takes to complete the movie. Taking a cue from the others the man behind the desk says, \"Ms.Smith, I guess the part is your's if you want it. I can tell you that it will pay a lot more than a your usual fee\". Becca and Kelly look at each other. The more money part sounds real good, but the staying a busty woman for several months maybe more depending on how well the movie does could present problems.</span></div></div>",

Rebecca then glanced at Shawn again, who was marveling at Carla's ample 'endowments'. And Rebecca's eyes grew wide in shock when she saw his shirt distending in front as two large breasts began swelling underneath it. Shawn had become so distracted with the producer's 'assets' that he was growing his own identical pair. A swift kick to Shawn's shin under the table caused him to snap out of his trance, and in a panic he quickly returned his chest to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Carla asked Shawn, when she saw him wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no...

Bye for now you two\" she then chirped, before clicking off in her stiletto pumps. Shawn's eyes were practically out on stalks as he watched her sexy ass wiggling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only another swift kick under the table from Rebecca than brought him 'back to reality'. \"You know its best that you not morph into the woman we're talking to, even partly\" she told Shawn with a feigned smirk. \"I can't believe you started growing boobs right there\" she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just any tits. Hers! Did you see them?\" Shawn responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its was hard not to see them!\" Rebecca sighed.

Instead he just smiled at the waitress as she topped up his drink, then he sat back and smiled at Rebecca again. As soon as the waitress had walked off, Shawn looked down his chest and concentrated. He began growing boobs again, this time identical to the waitress's. Rebecca just looked nervously around, hoping nobody would notice, then she glared at Shawn as his new boobs finished growing, rounding out at a healthy C-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're not in the mood to have an adult conversation, I'll meet you later, or rather I'll meet 'Kristy' later\" Rebecca said.

Becca told Shawn, \u201cI better pee before we leave!\u201c  Shawn was walking behind Becca and agreed, \u201cI could go too!\u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca pushed the ladies room door open and noticed the sound of Shawn\u2019s shoes on the ground changed.  The dull thuds of his male loafers turned into the taps of high heels.  Becca realized Shawn shape shifted into a woman.  Now inside the ladies room, Becca glared at  Shawn realizing he shape shifted into her exact twin.  Becca rolled her eyes, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn giggled, \u201cYou know how dirty Men\u2019s bathrooms can be!  I\u2019d rather go in here!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca shook her head, \u201cYou know I hate it when you shape shift into MY body!  It\u2019s like your violating my privacy or something!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn could tell Becca was angry.  He concentrated for a second and shape shifted his body again.  He was now an exact copy of the waitress who served them.  Complete with her big boobs and waitress uniform.  Shawn winked, \u201cIs this better?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca shook her head, \u201cNot really!  What if she comes in here? Try something a bit more discrete!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn nodded and concentrated again.  Moments later he shape shifted into a beautiful tall voluptuous blonde in a mini skirt.  He looked a model and joked, \u201cIs this ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca eyed Shawn\u2019s body with a sense of jealousy.  Becca looked unimpressed, \u201cYou realize real women don\u2019t look like that!\u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn then got an idea and shape shifted again.  This time, he was a very obese woman.   Shawn jiggled his fat belly and joked, \u201cIs this more like a real woman?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca smirked, \u201cYou\u2019ll probably crack the bowl if you try to pee in that body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn had some more fun showcasing his shifting abilities in front of Becca.  He rapidly changed bodies from his obese form into a petite Asian.  He went from black to mexican and then really got an idea.  He shifted into a white woman in her 80\u2019s and slowly regressed his body.  Over the course of 5 seconds his body got younger and younger.  Becca pointed out, \u201cNow you are just being showoff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn kept getting younger and younger and finally stopped about 3 years old.  His outfit was complete with a pink bouffant dress.  He looked up at Becca and joked, \u201cRemember this body?  I still can\u2019t believe I blew that audition!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca remembered the girl.  \u201cThat was your own fault!  I\u2019m still convinced you blew that audition on purpose.  I mean\u2026Who doesn\u2019t know the words to \u2018I\u2019m a little teapot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn then jokingly started singing and dancing, \u201cI\u2019m a little teapot short and stout.  Here is my handle here is my spout\u2026.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca snapped, \u201cAha!  I knew you blew that audition on purpose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn nodded \u201cOf course I did!  Do you blame me?   Knowing you,  if I got that commercial you would have tried for more.  Walking around as a kid isn\u2019t exactly my \u2019cup of tea.\u2019  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thanks to you, I lost all those studio contacts.  Even though that was 5 years ago, none of them still ever return my calls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued arguing back and forth until they were suddenly interrupted.  The ladies room door swung open and 5 other women came strolling in.  It was too late for Shawn to shape shift.  He would have to stay as a 3 year old girl for the time being.  The ladies all smiled at Shawn and one of them said, \u201cI love your dress sweetie!\u201d  Another woman told Becca, \u201cYou are so lucky!  Your daughter is absolutely adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca cracked a grin at Shawn being referred to as her daughter.  Becca joked to the women, \u201cThanks!\u201c  Becca then glared at Shawn and continued, \u201cBut she can really be a handful sometimes!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was obviously a mother too and  nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.  It will get easier once she\u2019s older.  I can keep her busy while you pee if you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca thanked the woman and went into the bathroom stall.  Knowing that Shawn was stuck pretending to be a 3 year old, Becca decided to have some fun.  Before she shut the stall door, Becca told Shawn, \u201cSweetie, go ahead and sing the teapot song you have been working on for these nice ladies while Mommy uses the potty!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn glared back at Becca as he began singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And I do know I'm not doubling for a prostitute as well\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It IS cold out yes, which begs the question...why the cheerleader skirt?\" Rebecca said, gesturing at Shawn's sexy lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just looked down at himself....started to speak, then looked at Rebecca again and frowned. \"Are we meeting with Carla today or are you just gonna spend all morning criticizing my choice of clothing and my nocturnal habits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dress as a Nun too?\" Rebecca joked, stifling a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn just rolled his eyes in annoyance. \"Enough with the crap jokes already!\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, just grab a coat or jacket or something, and I think pantyhose would be a smart move, it really is a brisk morning\" Rebecca said, giving Shawn some serious advice to avoid him being too cold. Once they were ready to leave, they left the house and drove to the same cafe where they had met Carla yesterday. Upon their arrival, they didn't see Carla and assumed they were the first to arrive. But Shawn did see the waitress whose breasts he had copied yesterday to have a bit of a play with them. \"Suppose we wait, I bet she always runs late\" Rebecca mumbled, as they took a seat. The waitress then came over to take their order. \"Good morning ladies, what can I get you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn just looked up at the attractive waitress and smiled, and as he did so...he felt himself getting aroused/wet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And anyways...you're a girl now remember, you want to be a lesbian?\" she said to him. For his part, Shawn just shrugged his shoulders and looked around as he adjusted his bra strap. \"I'll take that silence as a yes, you do want to be a lesbian\" Rebecca sighed. \"Well...do it on your own time, not mine\" she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill out Becky!\" Shawn said, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll chill out when you....\" Rebecca started saying, before hearing a car door close behind her. She turned in her chair and Shawn also looked over as Carla made her way over to them, followed by a teenage girl with her hair in a ponytail. The clicking of Carla's heels on the floor drew Shawn's attention to her feet. And even Rebecca seemed to be jealous that Carla was wearing black leather louboutin pumps with crimson red insoles and bottoms. Her expensive stiletto shoes were complimented nicely by a black skirt suit and a red blouse. <i>\"WOW!\"</i> Shawn gasped in his feminine voice, as he eyed her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Ms Perry!\" Carla smiled, shaking Rebecca's hand. \"This is my little star!\" she then said, introducing the main actress of the film, 18-year old Jessica Shepard. Rebecca shook the girl's hand and noticed immediately the similarity between her and Shawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Kristy!\" Rebecca smiled, gesturing to Shawn, who now knew to be on his best behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smiled as she shook 'his' hand' \"Wow, you really do look like Jessica\" she gasped, and even Jessica agreed with that statement. After the introductions were done, the two new arrivals sat down at the table and ordered more coffee from the eager young waitress. And Shawn found himself in the middle of a conversation with the girl he would be doubling for in the film. To his dismay it was a very 'girly' conversation. He did his best.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He picked up his pace as he went around the rink, moving up the ramps and back down and going further up each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you're doing okay, now how about a couple of back flips?\" Rebecca joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you do this instead?\" Shawn snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca just smirked. \"Now, now, I'm you're agent, you're the stunt girl remember, now act like it\" she said, daring him. Instead of refusing, Shawn stepped it up and began to shoot up the ramps to a point where both his feet left the ground for a second of two. On the third attempt however one of his skates clipped the edge of the ramp and he went flying face first into the rink, much to Rebecca's shock.

Shawn just wiped some of the blood from under his nose with one of his delicate fingers and looked at it for a moment, before shrugging his shoulders. \"Not a problem!\" he mumbled.

Then just as quickly he shifted back into 'Kristen', and his injuries were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The paramedics would be out of a job if everyone could do that\" Rebecca chuckled, still amazed at Shawn's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, they would be!\" Shawn nodded, then he started practising more jumps on the skating rink.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Strutting into the club confidently on his 4-inch stiletto heels, he immediately got the attention of a number of men. He smirked at them and then ventured further inside the club. The din of the music drowned out almost every other noise as he looked around the room, strobe lights made it hard to distinguish faces. \"Hey babe...how about we have some fun?\" a drunken guy suddenly said as he came up behind Shawn and grabbed hold of his breasts. \"How about I cripple you for a while?\" Shawn mumbled in response, immediately kicking one of his shapely legs up behind him and connecting with the guy's 'junk'. A loud groan and the sound of a body hitting the floor was just audible as Shawn walked off, leaving the guy in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of searching, Shawn located his new girlfriend, Natalie, over by the bar. She smiled at 'Kristen' as she approached her and they kissed. \"Hey sweetheart, how are you?\" Shawn asked, as they got to talking. And during the conversation he revealed to Natalie that he was a 'stunt girl', and she seemed impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to let me watch you practise some day\" Natalie cooed, resting her hand on Shawn's silky-smooth thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that!\" he nodded, pushing his hair from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while he was talking to her, Shawn felt guilty, he was in effect lying to the girl, pretending to be someone...and something he wasn't. He thought about telling her the truth, but he knew she would probably flip out and it would all be over. Could he take the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a drink? My treat!\" Natalie chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...yes please, I'm parched\" was Shawn's response, as he licked his painted lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn found his sexy new form swaying to the beat of the house music filling his ears and almost making the very room shake. He normally avoided places like this, but Natalie hgad suggested it as a meeting place for them. He couldn't say no.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Scott backed off momentarily, but Shawn could see the cogs turning in his mind as the young man weighed up risk vs potential payoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are all lesbians as uptight as you?\" he ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, Shawn laughed. <i>Wow, he actually tried it.</i> \"You're right. I should really learn to relax. I should be open to new ideas, like having a threesome with my girlfriend and some skater guy we picked up in a club,\" he said sarcastically.

We don't exactly have the luxury of spending money on wants.\"  Rebecca said justifying the skirt purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why couldn't you have just sent home for your old cloths, you could have told your folks you were donating them or something and in a way you would have been.  I could have made myself fit in them no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly, I grew up in the early 2000's, times and fashions have changed drastically.  Or do you think it would have looked good for a young hip stuntgirl showing up in a Backstreet Boys t-shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could have said it was retro.\"  Shawn said knowing that Rebecca did have a kinda valid point.  \"So we're going with Shelly for this body?  Sure why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've already sent off for the fake ID's, you should have it by tomorrow.  You'll be Shelly Perry, my younger niece who is staying with me for a few weeks and wants to try to get into showbiz while she's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.\" Shawn said as Rebecca took him into a shoe store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, after we're done shopping we can go to your apartment so can get a few essentials and then we can drop them all off at my place.\" Rebecca said pulling even more shoe boxes off of the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wait. What?\" Shawn said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are currently 16, you can't be expected to be living on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case you noticed, I'm not really 16 Becca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you have to be while on the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not when I'm off the job. Like when I'm at home. In my very own apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shawn, I mean Shelly. All the paperwork is going to have to say you live with me, if they do check ins and you aren't there you'll probably be fined or even fired. We can't have that. Now put these on.\" Rebecca said as she put down a pair of strapy sandals for Shawn to try on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he put on the next pair Shawn thought long and hard about his living situation in this body.</span></div></div>",

After making himself a bodybuilder to help move his stuff into Rebecca's place with ease he decided there would be no messing around with his powers like he normally would.  Shawn would wake up in the morning, eat his breakfast and then morph into his Shelly form for a good portion of the day.  And Shawn wasn't just doing his normal routine of jogging in the park.  Shawn and Rebecca had looked up every single cheer-leading video available on the web that actually had to do with cheer-leading and Shawn was spending at least 8 hours a day practicing every move and routine until he had them down pat.  Rebecca had even gotten Shawn a cute cheerleader outfit to practice in that looked more like it was used for role play as opposed for cheer-leading but Shawn chose not to ask Rebecca as to the costumes origin.  Every once and a while Shawn would think about how embarrassing this was until he remembered the paycheck and he would then redouble his efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few incidents where neighbors would come to the door and complain about the noise, but Shawn would say he was sorry and turn on the puppy dog eyes and came up with a sap story about needing to practice to make the team and everyone who would complain would melt like butter before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the big day came.  Shawn awoke in his room, which was more of a weird hybrid of his normal room and the room of Shelly.  Shawn shifted effortlessly into Shelly, he'd gotten it down so that this shift would be practically instantaneous and perfectly done.  He put on his Shelly underwear and cloths and walked into the living room area where Rebecca was ready with car keys in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last chance to back out.\"  Rebecca said knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just do this.\"  Shawn said preparing for his first day of work.</span></div></div>",

Nobody would think that he was originally a man and just shapeshifted into a girl to get this job. \"It is normal for girls to wear skirts\", he said to himself. Still he was not really satisfied. He knew that everything was alright and okay but the situation was so surreal for him. When he was a dog it was easier. Something about wearing clothes that were traditionally reserved for the other gender made it hard for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the director, a middle-aged man with graying hair, showed up and greeted the two of them. \"Ah, you must be Shelly and you must be her agent\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca put on he best smile. \"That's right. We're very grateful that you chose her for the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at Shawn. \"No, no. We're lucky to have her. From a far you might think they are twins. Even the face slightly resembles Andrea. You're the perfect girl for this job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\", mumbled Shawn, not entirely sure if this was really a compliment or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the production meeting began. Shawn did not listen very carefully.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the meeting Shawn went trait to costumes.  Rebecca had sent ahead Shawn's measurements so they already had a fitted costume set for him.  When Shawn saw it it first wondered where the rest of it was.  It wasn't the standard top and skirt he'd been expecting, but a red, black, and white cylinder of cloth.  Shawn was really skeptical about it, but all the other cheerleader outfits where similar so he went to the dressing room and squeezed his way into it.  Shawn looked into the mirror and for the first time in a while actually blushed because of how embarrassed and exposed he felt.  The top of the outfit covered just enough of his chest so that it wasn't pornography and the bottom of the outfit showed off all of the leg at Steven had and then some.  He was very happy that he insisted with Rebecca that he didn't wear a thong when she jokingly suggested it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn got out of the dressing room and was directed to a meeting room where all the main cast and stuntpeople were meeting for an orientation of sorts, Shawn was going to get out of costume, but was told by a costume lady the method director wanted everyone in costume.  And with his face still a little red, Shawn made his way to the room.  He'd been expecting a room full of high schoolers dressed, like, well high schoolers, but every single person in the room were female 15-18 year old's dressed in the same outfit as him, except for two good looking brown haired guys who were also in a male equivalent to the cheerleader garb, which Shawn bitterly noticed included pants.  Shawn was kind of confused by this as he sat alone in the back of the room as the director came out and talked to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 40ish year old greying director then started his speech.  And as he started Shawn droned out as he opened the speech by talking for how they should be honored to be a part of the 'art of theater' and the 'true meaning' of the movie.  Shawn did however pay enough attention to the director to note what the plot of the movie was.  Apparently it centered on a high school boy deciding to join the cheerleading squad because he wanted to hang out with the hottest girls in school, but eventually he falls in love with a girl (the girl Shawn was stunting for) and romance and hijinks ensue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director closes out his speech by saying, \"This film is very important to me, and it will be very important to the world, but it will only be believable if you, my cast, are completely in tune with each other, especially in the key roles.  So I'm going to schedule it so that you spend most if not all of your time while on set with one person.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What are we?  1st graders?  Is he really having us use the buddy system?</i> Shawn wasn't exactly happy with this, he's always been a social guy, but he wouldn't be a guy on set for this job.  And with someone around him all the time he'd actually have to try and act like a teenage girl.  The director then gave out everyone's 'buddy assignment' and Shawn saw who he would be spending his time with.</span></div></div>",

Before the director got to Shawn he paired off the lead actress Shawn was stunting for with the lead actor leaving only Shawn and the actor's stuntman left.   The director walked up to Shawn and the boy and said, \"Now Shelly.  Robert.  Your partnership will be the most important pairing on this entire shoot.  The chemistry that the two of you must show during the routines will have to be perfect.  You two must move and think as one cohesive unit.  You must be like water.

Shawn chuckled to himself as he realized he could have some fun potentially teasing this kid.  \"I'll meet to at the entrance Rob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  Rob said and the two went to their own dressing rooms and changed into street clothes before they met at the entrance.</span></div></div>",

When you aren't training or on the set, you'll be in this gym left free to roam with the other dogs.  Outside of having food dropped off you'll be left on your own to do as you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's better than being stuck in a cage I suppose.  Hell I might be able to find something to do to have a good time.  So, when does the job start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next week, but don't spend your downtime doing nothing Shawn.\"  Rebecca said, her voice suddenly becoming stern.  \"I want you to spend a few hours a day practicing being a dog and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Becca, I've been a dog before.  I know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not being a show dog.  I want you to look up videos online of dog show competitions and such so you can practice.  It'll make me and our business look bad if you don't look professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How hard could it be.\"  Shawn said kind of insulted at what his cousin was asking him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, you work on that and I'll work on looking for more work after that's done.  I'll pick you up next week to drop you off at the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, see you next week.\"  Shawn said as he hung up the phone.  As soon as he hung up the phone he went to the computer to do some image searching on poodles to find get a form in his head for what he's going to be like on the job.  As soon as he found a few pictures he was content with he sat back and wondered if he should do as his cousin suggested and look up dog show videos so he could practice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After 15 minutes of looking at pictures and dog show videos before Shawn started getting bored.  \"What the hell am I doing?  I've been a dog before.  I don't need to train to one.  I've been doing this for years.  I'll show her practice.\"  With that Shawn shut down his laptop and went to the park for some jogging.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow when most people went out for a jog the only thing they'd have to worry about is what color shirt they want to wear or what playlist to put on their mp3 player.  For Shawn not only did he have to decide on these things but also things like gender, race, height, or even species.  Luckily for Shawn he didn't care that much so for the next week whenever Shawn wasn't at home relaxing, he spent his time running in the park in whatever form he was feeling that day.  Although the day before the job started Shawn did spend one of his daily jogs in the park as a dog in order to fulfill Rebecca's desire for him to 'practice'.  As male golden retriever with was nothing like a female poodle, but still a dog none the less.  <i>I'll be spending enough time in that body, no need to get a needless head start.</i>  Shawn rationalized to himself as he put on his collar with his cousin's address on it just in case he got into trouble with dog catchers (can never be too safe) and ran off to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe usually enjoyed his daily run but today he couldn't help but get distracted by the little things.  Like the way one dog owner covered up his dog's crap with leaves as opposed to picking it up.  Or the way a large doberman was dragging along his young and petite female owner.  And even the way a large male dog would hump a smaller female one.  Shawn shook his dog head <i>well I know which one of those I'm not going to let happen</i> Shawn thought to himself as he finished his run and made his way back to his apartment.  As soon as he got back he made sure nobody was around with his now keen senses of smell and hearing and picked up his hidden door key with his mouth and maneuver the key into the lock and turned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell do I need to practice being a smart dog?  I'm going to be the smartest damn dog they've ever come across.\"  Shawn laughed to himself as shifted back into his normal form.<br>\r\n____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Shawn woke up to a loud banging on his door.  Reluctantly Shawn stood up and answered the knocking of his cousin who entered without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you too,\"  Shawn said grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry Shawn.  It's just I've been busy this morning getting the last of the paperwork forged for you.\"  Rebecca said opening up a breifcase with many files of forged paperwork for Shawn from over the last few years.  \"Here it is.  You are a pure bred, fully vaccinated, white poodle named Sasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha?  Well I guess it could be worse.\"  Shawn said gulping down a soda to start his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got your measurements here.\"  Rebecca said handing him a full on diagram of 'Sasha's' dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really gone full out on this one haven't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting better and part of me getting better is getting more details.  Now hurry up and change, I want to grab some breakfast before I drop you off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I don't have to be there for a few more hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I want to see what you've worked on this week.  You have been working right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"  Shawn lied, but Rebecca could see through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Shawn.  This is a big movie for us and could really put us on the map as an agency.  I don't want you to screw this up for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't I won't.  I promise.  Now if you'll give me a second I need to go get familiar with myself.\"  Shawn said as he took the diagram into the bathroom.  Shawn spent a few minutes looking at the diagram making sure he had every little nook and cranny down.  Shawn stripped off his cloths to avoid them ripping and started his shift.  It took a few minutes as he wanted to get every detail with as far as the muscles and such were concerned, they had to be perfect for him to pull of being a top class show dog off.  Something else that took a whole lot more time than normal was the hair.  Normally when he shifted Shawn would just let his hair do what ever it wanted to do.  But with the poodle he had to be very careful to shape and place the hair to form those poofy patterns.  <i>Nice, didn't know I could do that.</i>  Shawn thought to himself, impressing even himself with his ability to craft his body.  After the shift was completed Shawn opened the door with his paws for a final inspection from Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're supposed to be a very smart dog, but leave the door opening to the humans okay Sasha?\"  Rebecca said as she bent down to get a good look at Shawn, \"Don't give me that look.  You're going to have to get used to being called that for the next week.\"  She spent a minute going over him and comparing it to the chart.  \"Looking good, but I do notice one little problem.\"  With that Rebecca put a grasp around Shawn's groin region which made Shawn whimper a little.  \"You're supposed to be a <i>girl</i> dog Shawn, did you really think I wouldn't notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kinda hoped so.</i>  Shawn thought as he shifted his doggy genitalia from male to female.  \"Much better Sasha.\"  Rebecca said as she attached a pink and bejeweled leash to Shawn's neck.  \"Now let's get you to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how will Shawn's first day of training for the movie go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Rebecca dropped Shawn off at the revamped gymnasium the first thought that ran though Shawn's head was <i>I thought we were going inside?</i>  Somehow the studio had revamped the entire facility to look, feel, and even smell like a park.  The only way Shawn was able to tell the difference from his position was the lack of a sun and clouds when he looked up at the sky like ceiling.  Shawn was trying to get a good look around at the room to figure out some more of the logistics of it when all of the sudden <b><i>THWACK!</i></b>  Shawn recoiled as he looked up at the large African American gentleman who held a rolled up newspaper in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad dog!  When I am in your presence you will look at and pay attention to me alone.  For the next week I will be your master and you will think of me as such.\" the man said in a booming voice that shook Shawn a little.  \"Now let's see what they brought me this time,\" the man said to himself seemingly as he bent down to inspect the new dog.  Shawn felt humiliated and exposed as the man slowly looked and felt over every single inch of Shawn's doggy body.  What made it worse was that he wasn't saying a word.  Finally the inspection reached Shawn's groin and Shawn gave a shutter as Master Asshole (as Shawn now thought of him since he didn't give a name) practically massaged his genitalia.  \"You're a flincher.  I'll have to fix that.\"  Master Asshole said as he put something in his mouth and blew.  Didn't take Shawn but a millisecond to realize that the splitting headache and muscles tightening up were being caused by what must be a dog whistle of some sort.  As soon as he stopped he once again reached for Shawn's doggy vagina and once again Shawn flinched causing MA to blow the whistle again.  This happened four more times until finally Shawn managed to stand perfectly still while MA practically fondled him.  \"Good girl.\"  MA said placing a small and stale dog treat in front of Shawn as a reward which Shawn ate begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was then led to an area of the indoor park that seemed to have a lake where there were 3 dogs playing with each other but all stopped as soon as MA made his presence known with another blow of his whistle.  \"Scotty!  Lassie!  Maxwell!  Here!\"  At this command the small Scotty dog, a boarder collie, and a black lab all walked up to MA in what Shawn figured was close to being a doggy march.  \"This is Sasha, she will be your last companion.  Now we are going to jog around this lake at different paces and you will stay at full attention the entire time.  Now let's go!\"  Shawn was wondering how MA thought the dogs were going to understand the instructions but didn't have time to ponder it as MA took off with 4 leashes, including Shawn's, in his hand.  After a choke endued start Shawn managed to catch up to the dogs who were running in front of MA in posed unison.  If Shawn wasn't in the situation he was in he'd think that the look of four dogs running in a very pristine style almost perfectly step for step.  However Shawn kept feeling tiny tugs at his leash along with instruction being shouted at him of \"Run with the pack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what Shawn suspected were miles of running Shawn slowly managed to find a rhythm of the dogs he was running with.  Shawn wasn't sure if the negative tugging and yelling from MA were helping or hurting but Shawn knew that MA wasn't going to stop until Shawn got it right.  Finally after hours of jogging at various speeds MA mercifully stopped the pack.  \"Attention!\"  MA yelled and all the dogs, including Shawn, turned and stood perfectly still, \"I'm leaving for the day but I will be back tomorrow for your final work out.  I certainly hope you are all shaped up by then.\"  MA said sternly to his subordinates before he turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door shut and the 4 were left to themselves they all seemed to relax.  The 3 natural dogs all went to a food area where there was some meaty food waiting for them.  Shawn followed and for the first time Shawn finally got some time to look at his fellow show dogs.  There was a tiny black and gray haired Scotty male dog so brilliantly named Scotty.  A female medium sized brown and white female boarder collie once again with the totally original name of Lassie.  And then there was a large black Labrador who was referred to as Maxwell.  After gulping down some actually well made and tasty beef like food Shawn went back to the lake area to take a nap after the long afternoon of work.</span></div></div>",

It was then that he remembered that he was a dog in the grass and not himself in bed and he'd just rolled into the man made lake.  Shawn walked out of the lake and shook himself as dry as he could when Lassie came up to him and gave him a little lick on the face, the same one that had woken him up.  Shawn gave a bark that would have otherwise been a burst of laughter at himself for his blunder.  Lassie ran off and Shawn got the feeling she wanted him to follow so he did.  They ran to the other side of the gym where Scotty was walking around with a worn looking teddy bear in his jaw.  Lassie then walked over and played a little game of tug of war with the bear that Lassie won and then with the bear in mouth walked over to Shawn.  Shawn was a little grossed out by the obviously chewed up, dirty, and slobber covered bear and was about to refuse, but the (literal) puppy dog look in Scotty and Lassie's eyes made him reconsider, so with a cautious approach Shawn took the bear into his mouth and pulled it away from Lassie.  Scotty then in turn took the bear from Shawn and he ran off making Lassie and Shawn chase him and so the pattern continued for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn couldn't believe how much fun he was having.  It was just a very simple game.  As simple as it gets.  But he was having a blast passing the bear with his new canine companions.  After a few rounds Shawn decided to try to get Maxwell in on the fun, no need for anyone to be left out.  So on his next pass with the bear Shawn walked up to Maxwell who was sitting under a tree and offered him the bear.  Maxwell noticed Shawn and sniffed the air and the bear but didn't seem to be interested in the bear at all.  So deciding he'd try again later Shawn turned to walk back to Scotty and Lassie.  However Shawn hadn't gone far before he felt something cold on his rear.  Flinching and turning around Shawn was surprised to see that Maxwell had been sniffing him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot amused by Maxwell, Shawn went towards Lassie and Scotty at a faster trot, which Maxwell kept up with.  He then went into a full on run, which Maxwell kept up with again.  Finally after running as fast as his legs could manage Shawn was practically tackled from behind by Maxwell.  His eyes widening Shawn very much realized what Maxwell was getting ready to do.</span></div></div>",

Thinking on his feet (or paws) Shawn made some internal shifting with his organs, particularly the ones near his hind end.  It only took a few seconds to make his adjustments before Maxwell attempted his mount him, and just before Maxwell could, Shawn spewed out a skunk like spray from his rear coating Maxwell in a horrendously stinky substance.  No longer in the mood, Maxwell yelped and wined and ran to the lake where he submerged himself and did not want to move.  Shawn gave a strong doggy laugh at poor horny Maxwell and went back to Lassie and Scotty where they immediately resumed their pass the bear game as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later the game was finally dieing down.  The three friends were now taking minutes in between passes and were walking instead of running as Shawn took the bear from Scotty.  Deciding it was about time to get to bed for the night Shawn headed over to his spot by the lake, but on his way there stood an old foe.  Maxwell, still reeking of skunk spray, walked cautiously up to Shawn.  Shawn reshifted his insides back to the skunk spray in case Maxwell tried anything funny again.  But instead of sniffing Shawn's ass and mounting him this time around, Maxwell sniffed Shawn's face and gave a friendly lick.  Shawn was a little surprised by the nice gesture and loosened his grip on the bear just enough for Maxwell to rip it away.  So once again the game was on, but this time with four instead of three.  <i>As sad as it is, attempted rape aside this has been the most fun I have ever had with any coworkers.</i>  Shawn thought just before he fell asleep by the lake.</span></div></div>",

Waking up Shawn was curious to see where the smell was coming a bowl that was set right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's waking up.  What do I do now?\"  An anxious female voice said a little shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let her eat.  But stay near her so she knows it was you who gave her the food.  Let her know who is in charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn recognized the second voice as Master Asshole but the first was familiar but he couldn't quite place from where.  Looking up at the provider of warm chicken Shawn was surprised to see someone he knew.  Well, knew of.  It was the star of some quirky tv comedy about two hot sorority sisters who got into wacky antics on a weekly basis, Ally Larson.  Ally was a 5'6\" raven hair girl with nice C cup breasts and was currently wearing a skinny jeans and t-shirt combo that would be described as 'hipster like', but she wore it very well.  \"Why is she just looking at me like that?\"  Ally said to MA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because she can smell your fear.  Be confident.  This isn't something you can act your way out of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that he's been just staring at Ally for a little too long, Shawn turned his attention to the bowl of food and gulped it down.  <i>Damn this is good.  I'm eating better as a freaking poodle in a gym than I was as a man in my apartment.</i>  As he finished the last of bowl and went to the lake for a drink Shawn listened in on Ally and MA's conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I'm sorry.  I'm not a dog person, I don't know if this is a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me it is.  I've informed the director that the dogs are ahead of schedule with their training and she thinks that it's a good idea of the actors to spend some bonding time with their individual dog that they will be with on screen.  The other 3 have already taken their dogs earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wouldn't know what to do with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Sasha.  And the two of you can do whatever you would like.  You can take her to the park.  Take her to the beach.  Take her for a walk.  Or just relax at your home.  It doesn't matter so long as the two of you do it together.  Now here's her leash, I'll be waiting outside to lock up the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Ally said meekly.  Turning around Shawn saw that Ally seemed a little nervous, so he helped her by giving a friendly bark and walking up to her.  \"Oh good girl.\"  Ally said giving an awkwardly harsh pat on the head to Shawn.  <i>It's like the girl has never interacted with a dog before.</i>  Ally bent down to attach the leash to Shawn collar and lead Shawn outside to a waiting limo.  <i>Cool, never been in one of those before</i> Shawn thought as the two got in and after Shawn took a minute to take in everything inside Ally told him their destination.</span></div></div>",

This is my home.  Don't you want to see my home.\"  Ally said with each tug.  <i>I'll be glad to come along if you let me walk instead of choking me,</i> Shawn thought as he was practically pulled out of the limo.  As soon as he was out, Shawn took a moment to look at the quite sizable home of Ally but only got a second to check it out as Ally went right back to dragging him through the front door.  \"Come along girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlly led Shawn to the living room of the home where Ally sat down in a large and very fluffy looking chair, Shawn seeing that there was more than enough room for two hopped on up by her.  Something Ally obviously wasn't expecting, \"Oh my.  Dog's shouldn't be on chairs I think.  You aren't supposed to be up here,\"  Ally said getting up and pulling Shawn off the chair.  <i>Is this girl for real?  She has no idea how to handle a dog.  How did she get this job?</i>  Shawn thought but as Ally pulled him down his snout went down her top, <i>Ah, I see why.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she'd pulled Shawn off the chair Ally sat back down.  \"Now we'll watch some tv for a little while.  You just look at the lights on the screen while I make a few phone calls.\"  Shawn gave a doggy sigh as he lied down and watched the tv showing a dvr'd episode of Ally's show.  <i>Some day of bonding.  Come tomorrow when we start shooting she's going to have no idea how to act and then she'll probably get fired.  Can't say she won't deserve it, I mean who casts someone for a dog movie who doesn't know how to act around dogs.</i>  A few minutes later Shawn came to a new revelation, <i>Crap.  If anyone get's in trouble at the filming tomorrow it's going to be me not her, who blames the star?  Rebecca and I need this paycheck, I have to do something.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he did.  Shawn got up and started looking around the house for something that might give him an idea on how he can do something to get Ally's attention.

Shawn spent alot of time finding things like slippers, gloves, pillows, and just about anything he could reasonably find and tried to bring it to Ally but all he would get is a scolding about 'designer' this and 'name brand' that.  <i>I didn't think it was possible but our 'bond' has somehow gotten even worse.  Fantastic.</i>  But Shawn couldn't give up, his job, Becca's reputation, and most importantly his paycheck was on the line.  So Shawn made his way into a room full of open boxes that  seemed to have been dug through.  Figuring he might as well try looking in here Shawn tried to look through the boxes for something.  <i>What the hell am I doing.

He would have tried to shift back to himself to look through the boxes more efficiently but didn't want to run the risk of getting caught.  Finally getting ready to give up Shawn noticed something.  One old box in particular had a very peculiar smell.  <i>That one really smells like Ally...and now I feel like a pervert.</i>  Shawn pushed that thought out of his head and dug through one last box to find the source and emerged with an old rag doll in his jaws.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here goes nothing.</i>  Shawn thought as he once again offered Ally the offering of friendship.  \"What did you do this time doggy, ew what is that old...\"  Ally seemed to be frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  My.  God!  Miss Little Ally!  I thought I lost you years ago in the move.  But how.  Where did you find her girl!\"  Ally said to Shawn almost expecting an answer, so Shawn gave a bark in response, \"Wow, this is amazing, it's like you're trying to talk to me.  This is so cool.  You are the greatest!  Come on up here Sasha.\"  Shawn noticed a huge change in tone and also noted it was the first time Ally had used his name, well, his dog name.  So Shawn jumped up beside Ally in her chair and laid down in Ally's lap for a nice nap.  <i>Trying to form an emotional bond sure can be exhausting.</i>  Shawn thought as he fell asleep with Ally lightly scratched his head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That week was by far the best week of Shawn's career.  He didn't even care that he was a female dog the whole time.  All he had to do was walk in a certain way and stand still on cue and he was getting paid a lot to do it.  Shawn even started to make a little game of estimating how much he was making with each step on the set and was very very pleased with the math he was coming up with.  And the money wasn't even the best part.  Okay it was, but there were other perks of note.  When he wasn't shooting he was encouraged by Ally and the big wigs on set to just play with the other dogs, something that while simple was quite fun.  It was kind of like playing games when he was a little kid, only now he was on 4 legs and more importantly was on the clock.  His relationship with Ally was also getting much better.  It was weird but he was kind of developing a little bit of a crush on her, but that might have just been because she always gave him some high quality meat snacks to him on the set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all good things come to an end and the last day of shooting came.  Rebecca had come by to pick him (and the paycheck) up from the cast party.  He was glad to see his cousin again and was ready to get back to walking on two legs but on a level he did think he was going to miss this, heck he might have to pick up more animal work in the future if it looks like it will be as nice as this shoot.  Shawn was about to just walk over to Rebecca but saw that Ally was talking to her and decided not to interrupt so he played one last game of tag with the dogs from the film.  After a few minutes of play Rebecca came over and called out, \"Sasha!  Here girl.\"  Hearing his stage name Shawn immediately trotted over to Rebecca who took him away from the group but didn't seem to be leaving yet, Becca bent down and talked to Shawn in a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl.  Ally.  The actress you've been working with.\"  Shawn nodded showing he understood, \"She just offered me $100,000 to buy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn's jaw dropped, \"My sentiments exactly.\"  Becca said, \"We can't really turn down that kind of money Shawn.\"  Shawn shot his cousin a look.  \"Don't look at me like that.  I would never sell you...well unless I knew you were a shapeshifter who could escape in a few days or weeks.  And I do know that.  Of course I won't do this unless you give the okay obviously and you'll get 75%.\"  Shawn gave a little growl, \"Okay 80%.  All you have to do is be Ally's pet poodle for a few days or weeks.  And then whenever you feel it's the right time you make your escape and we're 100 thousand dollars richer.  What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn immediately wanted to say yes.  The money would be fantastic and it might be cool to hang out with Ally for a few more weeks, he was really enjoying her company.  But then again he'd have to be Sasha the poodle for an undetermined amount of time, and heck he pictured having to escape and the look on Ally's cute little face when he'd have to leave.  That image alone almost made Shawn turn down the offer then and there.  \"What do you say Shawn, I need an answer now.  Is it okay with you if I sell you to Ally?\"</span></div></div>",

Laughing at the reaction Rebecca said, \"All right, I'll give Ally the good news.  Now before I tell Ally I just want to lay down a foundation for a plan with you.  Now Shawn we can't have you run away just a few days after the sale because then she might try to get her money back and she'd probably have a potential legal case so let's say you stay with her for a minimum of let's say a month.  Does that sound reasonable to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn thought about it for a second but decided that for that kind of money he could deal with being a dog for a month.  Besides, Ally had a nice big place, if he really need to feel human again he could find a room and be himself for short time periods.  So once again Shawn nodded to his cousin.  \"Okay.  So you'll stay with Ally for at least a month, but as a safety plan if you haven't escaped or I don't here from you for two full months I'll assume something has gone wrong and you're in trouble or you've forgotten yourself.  Just for that precaution I won't spend the $100,000 just in case I'm forced to buy you back.  Now Shawn, please don't make me do that.  Understand?\"  Again Shawn nods.  \"Good boy, erm girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Rebecca took Shawn's leash and led him over to Ally where she excitedly wrote out a check and took the leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sasha I'm so glad you're mine now!  We're going to be best friends forever.  I love you so much.\"  Ally said bending down and giving Shawn an almost rib crunching hug which while uncomfortable did give Shawn a very good look at Ally's cleavage making the pain very bearable.  Still in the surprisingly strong bear hug Shawn looked to his cousin who had a slightly worried look on her face.  Shawn gave her a wink to alleviate her worries as Ally released the hug and lead Shawn back to her limo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How bad could being Ally's dog be?</i>  Shawn thought to himself as Ally scratched behind his ear.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a week Shawn was in a lower level of heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day Shawn would wake up cuddled up next to the beautiful Ally who couldn't bare to even sleep without her precious Sasha.  He was fed 3 square meals a day which usually consisted of sausage in the morning, chicken in the afternoon, and steak in the evening.  Ally would spend about an hour a day playing simply yet surprisingly fun games with him.  And when he wasn't eating or playing he was either taking a nap at his leisure or laying down on Ally's lap watching television.  He even got some 'Shawn time' when Ally would go out to do some shopping or excessive.  Overall life was nearly perfect and Shawn actually got a little sad about the idea of leaving this piece of paradise he'd carved out for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the friends came and ruined everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week into Shawn's living with Ally, a bunch of young woman, most of whom Shawn recognized from a variety of tv shows and gossip magazines, came to visit Ally.  Ally excitingly showed her friends her new best friend aka 'Sasha'.  Shawn proceeded to 'strut his stuff' in front of them expecting the usual praise and gasps of awe he usually got.  Instead Ally's girlfriends were disgusted.  \"This dog is just not cute enough for you.  I mean look at her, she's all muscle.  She should be much cuter than that,\" one of the friends said.  Shawn had to admit he was a bit hurt by this and looked to Ally to stand up for him but instead Ally simply said, \"I guess I know what you mean, but isn't that just who she is?  I mean we can't change that can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No you most certainly can not.</i>  Shawn thought and even gave a bark at the friends in disapproval.  Unfortunately they didn't feel the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began the decent into hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone were the sleeping arrangements where he cuddled with Ally at night.  \"That won't do.  You'll just end up with dog hair on your sheets and pajamas.\"  So you started to sleep on an overly fluffy pillow, that never would feel as good as the sleeping with a beautiful woman.<br>\r\nGone were the luxurious meats Shawn had received for every meal and enter a barrage of soy and tofu based meat like alternative that tasted like crap and made Shawn feel ill all the time.<br>\r\nShawn even lost his alone time where he could just be Shawn.  Instead Ally decided with some encouraging from her friends, to buy a deluxe security system with camera's all over the house making it nearly impossible for Shawn to shift unless he risked getting caught on tape.<br>\r\nOn top of that, Ally now insisted on taking Shawn with her wherever she went.  If she went to the mall, Shawn had to be there.  If she went exercising at the gym Shawn had to be there.  Even when she went out to eat Shawn had to be there.  Shawn thought that there must be some kind of laws again dogs in public places like this but it seemed that if you had the money those laws didn't matter as much, and Ally sure had the money.  And if that wasn't bad enough, Ally insisted that if Shawn was going out in public then she would have to dress her 'Sasha' for the occasions.  Which meant every single day Shawn was forced into ridiculous looking sweaters, hats, and even skirts and shoes designed just for dogs.  Shawn tried to protest these at first but Ally was persistent and even threatened to withhold food and play time if Shawn didn't cooperate, so cooperate Shawn reluctantly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't even seem too bad, he was even trying to get a laugh out of the whole thing until he saw a video of Ally walking him on some tabloid tv show.  If Ally wasn't there he'd have shifted into a mouse and just hidden away under a couch until the humiliation went away.  Shawn could even swear he could here Rebecca laughing at him half way across town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a month of this form of torture Shawn decided, <i>I've got to get out of here as soon as possible</i>.  Luckily an opportunity would soon arise.</span></div></div>",

She'd been on the phone with that guy constantly for the last few days.  At first Shawn was interested in the Hollywood insider stuff about what the movie could be and who was involved and what it'd be about and stuff, but as the days droned on and Shawn's food kept him feeling malnourished Shawn just stopped caring about the details and just wanted her out of the house so he could escape and get back to his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Sasha baby, but I've got to get packing.  I have to head out tomorrow to go start my next movie.  It'll be great, it's on a cruise ship and I get to spend a month out there on the open waters all expenses paid.  Doesn't that sound great?  Now there there, don't look at me with those eyes.\"  Ally said obviously reading Shawn's exhaustion for sadness at her leaving, \"Don't worry, I'll make sure you are taken care of, I've got a special plan for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fantastic.</i> Shawn sarcastically thought to himself, but he managed to give a half hearted yip to Ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a girl.\"  Ally said rubbing Shawn's head, \"Now wait here, I've got a very very special treat for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn just lied back down on the kitchen floor, <i>Probably more grainy soy surprise.</i>  Shawn thought, but quickly his head popped up as his nose sensed something it long sorely missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like a very special steak made just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes please!</i>  Shawn barked excited that he could finally taste real food for the first time in weeks.  In less than a minute Shawn had gulped the whole thing down.  But something seemed a bit...off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here girl, I need you over here.\"  Shawn heard Ally say, but it was weird, as if through some sort of filter.  \"Come inside girl.  I don't need you passing out on the floor.  It'll make it hard for me to transport you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Transport?  What?</i>  Shawn thought before realizing all to late that Ally was leading him into a traveling cage.  <i>No no no!  That's it, I've got to get out of here now!</i>  Shawn tried to make a break for the door but his legs gave out on him after the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!  The sleeping pills have already taken affect.  Guess we're doing this the hard way.\"  Ally said as she pull and pushed Shawn limp and numb body into the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where the hell is she taking me?</i>  Was Shawn's last thought before giving into the sleeping pills in the steak.</span></div></div>",

But with each passing minute Shawn came to the realization that he would probably be stuck with the stud dog that was just a few jail cells over.  Shawn knew because he could hear and smell him and he was certain by the tone of the barks and the unmistakable smell of musk that the stud could sense him.  Shawn knew that with the camera's and people around he wouldn't be able to pull the skunk spray maneuver he'd pulled just a few weeks ago during the movie.  He sure as hell would not let himself get pregnant, he'd already given himself a shapeshifting spading the second Barbie had mentioned the stud.  However even with that done he'd still get stuck with the stud for multiple 'sessions' while he was still stuck there and Shawn was not going to let that happen.  Shawn was starting to get desperate, he was strongly considering just turning into an elephant and taking down the building, screw secrecy, he was not going to let that stud dog have his way with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after taking a deep breath, Shawn started to calm down.  He's a kinda smart guy with shapeshifting powers.  Surely he can escape with a more...subtle approach.  After a few minutes Barbie came to Shawn's cage with a leash in hand, Shawn panicked thinking he'd run out of time before his time with the stud dog, but felt a rush of ecstasy when Barbie said, \"All right Sasha, I'm going to take you for walkees before I put you in the 'love cage'.  Once around the building should be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie attached the leash to Shawn through the cage so he couldn't dart away so easily and opened the door.  Shawn realized it was now or never.  Shawn quivered as Barbie walked him pasted a large black stud poodle.  It may have been a poodle but the stud sure scared the hell out of Shawn more than any dog ever could.  As Barbie opened the door to the hallway Shawn knew he had to make his move.</span></div></div>",

Finally he could go back to his human form, all he had to do was make it outside. Far behind him, he heard Barbie calling out for help as he deftly rounded the corner to the outside door. That's when he noticed that his plan was going to fail. Two large men with looped sticks sat waiting for him at a closed door. Damn, he should have thought of this. He was cornered with no way out. As he sat there, weighing his options, he heard Barbie coming up behind him. \"Easy there girl!\", she said between pants. She came up to Shawn and attached the collar, patting him on the head. \"You've got a lot of energy! I think we'll hold off on the walk for right now. Don't worry though, you can still run. We'll let you run in the courtyard for a bit. I don't think I could keep up with you Sasha.\", she said smiling and leading Shawn back through the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the courtyard doesn't have cameras.\", thought Shawn. \"I should have received a much larger cut from this agreement. I'm certainly going to have some words for Rebecca once this is behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was led out into a courtyard, about 50 by 50 feet. Once they were behind the gate, Barbie released Shawn and carefully backed out of the gate before latching it. \"Have fun girl!\", she said with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn took stock of his surroundings. \"Well, there goes any idea of escaping using my powers\", as he looked toward the monitor on the fence. The fence was extremely secure, so there was no getting out by force. \"Maybe I'll have one more shot when Barbie comes to get me. I have to think of something.\" As he was pacing the cage, he heard the gate open. It was Barbie holding the stud on a leash. \"I'll give you two some privacy.\", said Barbie after she unhooked the stud poodle and left, closing the gate behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His perseverance began to wear on the horny male as he started losing interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days passed without incident. Shawn wondered how long he would be confined to this area with the male dog when he heard the gate open and saw Barbie with another staff member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't seem to be getting along.

After all, I'm the only one who will know.\", he thought as he looked at the stud dog lapping up water from his dish in the corner of the cage. \"If I don't do this, things could get much worse.\", he thought as he accepted what he must do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Shawn decided to finally submit to the male dog, he had another problem. He had spent so much time rejecting him, that he was no longer interested. Shawn would need to not only submit, but he would have to encourage it. \"Maybe if I was in heat?\", was his last thought before he concentrated on a minor change to his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn felt a pleasant and warming tingling sensation in his flanks as he stared at the stud. The stud was enticed by the smells that Sasha was releasing and came over and began sniffing the bitch's rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do this!\", thought Shawn, right before the stud jumped up on his back and mounted his bitch. \"Oh my GOD!\", thought Shawn as a wave of euphoria washed over him. It had been so long since he had any kind of sexual stimulation and he was certainly enjoying the sensations from mating. Before he knew it, he was rocking to the rhythm of the male trying to push him deeper. Wave and waves of ecstasy hit him like a ton of bricks. He was so lost in the moment, he hadn't even noticed that Barbie had entered through the gate. He was finally rocked with a major orgasm and howled deeply. It was only after his final orgasm had faded that he noticed that Barbie was looking at him standing there with the male dog knotted up inside his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl Sasha! I knew Romeo there would finally win you over.\", she said as she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\", he thought. \"I guess I am a good girl.\" If dogs could blush, Shawn would have been the deepest shade of red. </span></div></div>",

Although he desperately wanted to get back to his own body, he was starting to enjoy it just a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for most of the week until the day Barbie came to get him. \"Hey there girl!\", she said as she clipped the leash to his collar. \"Looks like you are leaving today. You have a surprise visitor! I'm sorry to say that Romeo won't be coming with you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\", thought Shawn. He couldn't wait to get back to his old body and leave this embarrassing situation behind him. He looked at Barbie and happily wagged his tail. \"Maybe I'll look her up when I'm a man again. I'd certainly like to get to know her.\", he thought as he pictured her naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie brought Shawn into the waiting room where he saw Rebecca sitting in a comfortable chair. \"What the hell is going on!?\", thought Shawn. Rebecca was the last person he expected to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca rose and approached Shawn. \"Hey there Sasha! I'm here to take you home. I missed you so much that I talked Ally into selling you back.\", she said as she patted Shawn's head. \"We'll talk in the car.\", she whispered in Shawn's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie dropped to one knee and embraced Shawn. \"I'm going to miss having you around Sasha!\", she said sadly. \"I hope you'll come back to visit us. Rebecca told us she would bring back you're puppies once you've had them. I'm sure they will be adorable just like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puppies!? That's not possible, is it?\", thought Shawn. \"The changes I made to my body should have prevented that.\" The image of him mating and the wonderful sensations that it caused popped back into his head. Doubt suddenly took hold of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Sasha! We'll stop by the park on the way out. Thank you for taking such good care of her, Barbie!\", said Rebecca as she headed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were too many people around to continue the conversation with Shawn. \"Just wait until we get to the car.\", she urged. After a short walk, Rebecca opened the door to let Shawn in and hopped into the driver's seat, shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn started barking in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Shawn! You were gone so long that I began to worry that you were stuck. Ally only agreed to give you back if she could have first pick of your litter. We can figure out how we deal with this together, but first thing's first. Let's get back to my place so you can change back.\", said Rebecca as she pulled out into the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's a few more minutes.\", thought Shawn. He was actually starting to get a little nervous about changing back and tried not to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive wasn't a short one, but after an hour, they were back safe at Rebecca's house. Shawn ran as fast as he could to the door and impatiently jumped up and down at the door while Rebecca fumbled with her keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Shawn ran into the bedroom for a little privacy while Rebecca went out to grab the mail.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as he was alone Shawn excitedly started to change back to himself.  But nothing happened.  Shawn was terrified that the pregnancy was going to prevent him from swapping or worse, he'd forgotten how to shift completely.  Panic starting to set in Shawn closed his eyes and concentrated harder than he ever had before on a shift and much to his relief he could feel his face taking it's normal form and he could feel his paws turning into hands and feet.  But that was all.  Shawn tried and tried and tried, but he couldn't change anything else besides his head, hands, and feet.  Shawn looked back at his dog body, and specifically his belly area and knew that he must not be able to do anything to endanger what was in him.  \"Fuck!\"  Shawn barked out saying his first word in over a month.  Rebecca sprinted into the room to see what was wrong and when she saw her half dog/half cousin she let out a scream and fainted to the ground.  Shawn got to his feet to go check on her, but found that with his still doggy legs he was only able to take a few steps before he lost his balance and landed on all fours.  Frustrated yet more concerned than anything Shawn 'walked' over to Rebecca and woke her up.  When she opened her eyes and saw Shawn she began to scream but Shawn covered her mouth.  \"Calm down, we don't want to attract any attention, especially with me stuck like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Shawn explained to Rebecca that he assumed he'd be unable to fully be himself again until he gave birth to the litter.  Shawn purposely left out the details of the breeding and simply told her he'd been knocked out and artificially impregnated and thankfully Rebecca didn't ask for details.  \"So I guess I'm stuck like this until I give birth.  Atleast I can talk and use my hands...kind of.  How long is a dog gestation period?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca seemed to have calmed down enough to answer softly, \"About two months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn groaned, \"Well, it could be worse.\"  Needing a change of subject Shawn trotted over to the couch and grabbed the remote, \"So, I miss any good tv?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next few days, Shawn and Rebecca started a routine.  Shawn would stay at Rebecca\u2019s apartment during the days and watch TV.  Everything seemed normal until Shawn started getting terrible stomach aches.  After spending most of the days with his human upper body, Shawn was eating normal human food.  But he soon found out that his lower half dog body couldn\u2019t handle the human food.  After realizing he had to eat dog food, Shawn would shape shift completely into Sasha to eat.  He tried eating dog food with a spoon, but couldn\u2019t handle the taste with his human taste buds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn also found that it was nearly impossible to hold his body on top of the toilet.  Rebecca was fed up with cleaning up Shawn\u2019s messes and insisted on taking him downstairs for walks.  Shawn would have to morph into his complete \u2018Sasha\u2019 body for their walks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for being leashed, Shawn didn\u2019t mind the walks.  It was a chance for him to get out of Rebecca\u2019s apartment.  Shawn enjoyed the fresh air.  It wasn\u2019t until after a week of being walked, that the landlord approached Rebecca.  The landlord had heard many complaints of the new dog in the building who wasn\u2019t registered.  After almost getting evicted, Rebecca was able to pay the monthly pet deposit and was able to keep her apartment.  The following day, a new collar arrived in the mail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca pulled the new collar out of the box and giggled, \u201cI guess girl dogs get pink!\u201d  Shawn eyed the pink collar and rolled his eyes.  Rebecca explained, \u201cAll the rest of the dogs in the building have to wear this collar on walks.\u201d  Rebecca winked, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I wont make you wear it around the apartment!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn morphed completely into \u2018Sasha\u2019 and let Rebecca put the pink collar on him.  They went for their normal afternoon walk.  However, when Shawn tried to walk towards the normal tree behind the apartment building, he felt a shock.  \u201cWhat the\u2026???\u201d  Shawn thought as he yelped in pain.  Rebecca pulled the leash back and bent down to Shawn\u2019s level, \u201cI forgot to tell you about the shock collar.  The landlord said it wouldn\u2019t take you long to figure out where you can and cant go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA shock collar?\u201d  Shawn thought to himself.  It was bad enough he had to pretend to be a dog, but wearing a shock collar made the experience even more demeaning.  For the next 20 minutes, Shawn nervously walked around the apartment building getting shocked and figuring out where dogs could go.  Once they were back in the apartment, Rebecca unhooked the leash.  Normally, Shawn immediately morphed back into his human upper half.   Shawn just stared at Rebecca for a moment.  Rebecca giggled, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the collar! But it\u2019s apartment policy.  You are going to have to get used to it!\u201d  Rebecca waited a few moments and said, \u201cCome on Shawn!  Shapeshift your upper body so we can talk about this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca waited a few moments and Shawn refused to shape shift.  Rebecca finally replied, \u201cFine!  Stay as Sasha!  I don\u2019t care.  I\u2019m going shopping so I will be back in a few hours!  Maybe then we can talk about this!\u201c  Shawn still didn\u2019t budge.  Rebecca then grabbed the box the collar came in and found the handheld shocker.  She said, \u201cCome on Shawn!  Don\u2019t make me use this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn still didn\u2019t budge.  Rebecca pressed the button and saw Shawn yelp from the shock.  Rebecca said, \u201ccome on!  Shapeshift so we can talk!  Don\u2019t make me shock you again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn just hung his head as Rebecca pressed the button again.  Rebecca saw Shawn flinch from the shock and laughed, \u201cUgh!  You can be so stubborn!\u201c  Rebecca then yelled, \u201cBad girl!\u201c and swatted Sasha\u2019s butt.  Rebecca pressed the shock button once more.  Rebecca couldn\u2019t believe Shawn wouldn\u2019t shape shift.  Rebecca then left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later, Rebecca returned to the apartment.  After shopping, she blew off the steam from earlier.  Rebecca was surprised to see Shawn was still in his \u2018Sasha\u2019 form.  Rebecca giggled, \u201cAre you still mad about the collar?  I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t shape shift so you can use the remote control?  I know how much you like watching TV?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca then jokingly grabbed the shock collar remote and said, \u201cDon\u2019t make me use this again!  Come on girl!  Shapeshift so we can talk about this!!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca watched Shawn paw at his collar.  Rebecca could tell something was wrong as she bent down and took his collar off.  Almost immediately, Shawn shape shifted to have his human upper body.  Shawn looked surprised, \u201cI can\u2019t shape shift with that collar on!  There must be some magnetic field that interrupts my powers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was apologetic, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Shawn!  I didn\u2019t know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn rolled his eyes, \u201cI  cant believe you shocked me!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca felt bad, \u201cI just thought you were pouting for having to wear that collar.  I didn\u2019t know it prevented your powers?  I was just trying to get you to shape shift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was mad, \u201cAnd you swatted me too?  Like I\u2019m a real dog?  What the hell was that?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was embarrassed, \u201cI said I was sorry.  I was just caught in the moment.  You were acting like a stubborn dog, so I treated you like one.  I didn\u2019t know that collar prevented you from shapeshifting!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn sighed, \u201cWhatever.  But for some reason, I can\u2019t shape shift while wearing that stupid collar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca grabbed the shock collar remote and giggled, \u201cWell at least I know how to keep you from acting up when you are 100 percent Sasha!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn glared at Rebecca, \u201cVery funny!  You have no idea how much that shock hurts!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca set the remote down and giggled again, \u201cJust be a good girl and I wont have to use that thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn rolled his eyes, \u201cUnfortunately, I really have to pee.  So I need you to take me downstairs quick and we will finish this conversation later!\u201d  Shawn shape shifted back into Sasha as Rebecca put the shock collar back on.  With a grin, Rebecca put the shock collar remote in her pocket and said, \u201cI better take this along just in case\u2026\u201d   Shawn shook his head as they headed downstairs.  </span></div></div>",

Are you ready to go downstairs?\u201c  Rebecca was surprised Shawn didn\u2019t run up to greet her.  Rebecca was gone for almost 8 hours and knew Shawn would need to pee.  Rebecca grabbed the leash by the door and yelled again \u201cShawn?  Where are you?  And why didn\u2019t you return any of my texts?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca started walking around her apartment looking for Shawn.  Rebecca noticed the bathroom door was shut and could hear a pawing sound coming from inside of the bathroom.  Rebecca opened the door and saw Sasha looking at her growling.  Rebecca noticed Sasha was still wearing the pink shock collar and said, \u201cOMG!  I\u2019m so stupid!  Did I forget to take that off of you again?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha growled as Rebecca bent down to take it off.  Sasha\u2019s upper body immediately shape shifted back to Shawn\u2019s upper body.  Shawn was furious, \u201cThat was twice this week!  Is it THAT hard to remember to take off this shock collar after my morning walk?  You know my shape shifting powers don\u2019t work while I\u2019m wearing this collar!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca giggled, \u201cI guess this explains why you didn\u2019t return any of my texts today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn rolled his eyes at Rebecca\u2019s joke.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca could sense Shawn\u2019s anger and explained, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.  I was in a hurry this morning.  As we came in from your morning walk, I answered my phone.  I got distracted and forgot to take your collar off.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn added, \u201cTrust me, I noticed how distracted you were!  You didn\u2019t even realize I followed you into the bathroom.\u201d  Shawn let out a laugh, \u201cBy the way: Who flushes the toilet while they are on a business call?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca interrupted, \u201cI muted my cell phone.  Don\u2019t worry, they couldn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn continued, \u201cWhatever.  But after you were done, you shut the door leaving me stuck in here all day!  Without arms, I couldn\u2019t reach the door!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca replied, \u201cOMG, I\u2019m so sorry Shawn.  It\u2019s just habit to shut the door afterwards.\u201c  Rebecca thought for a moment and said, \u201cThat explains why you were barking so loud as I left.  I totally spaced out that you were still 100 percent Sasha.\u201d  Rebecca then got embarrassed, \u201cWait a second!  Yuck!  That means you watched me pee this morning?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn joked, \u201cBig deal!  Have you forgotten that I\u2019ve actually BEEN you before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca laughed, \u201cOh yea.  That\u2019s right.  I hate that when you shape shift into me!\u201d  Rebecca continued, \u201cAnyways\u2026I\u2019m sorry about leaving you hanging today but I promise my news will make up for it!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn asked, \u201cWhat news?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Rebecca said, \u201cSince you didn\u2019t read any of my texts, you have no idea that I booked you another role!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn listened eagerly.  Knowing he couldn\u2019t change back to his normal body until he delivered the puppies, Shawn was glad Rebecca figured out a way to make some extra cash.  He knew the gig was for a dog and asked, \u201cLet me guess, another dog food ad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca shook her head, \u201cNo.  Nothing like that.  This gig will actually earn you much more money.  When you give birth to your litter, it is going to be filmed!  I found an animal show looking to make a documentary.  They are going to pay 5 thousand dollars!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was surprised, \u201cWow!  5 thousand bucks is amazing!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca pointed out, \u201cYou are going to have to give me a slightly larger agent cut this time though.  You owe me 500 dollars for the pet deposit and another 150 for the shock collar.  Not to mention all this dog food you have been going through that I\u2018ve been buying.  I figure we will split this gig 50-50 this time to make up for the extra expenses.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn knew he owed Rebecca for letting him stay with her.  Shawn laughed back, \u201cCool.  So 2500 bucks to let them film?  Sounds like an easy gig!  It shouldn\u2019t take more than 20 or 30 minutes right?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca shook her head, \u201cSeriously Shawn?  20 minutes?  I cant believe you haven\u2019t researched anything yet?  You are going to give birth as a dog in a few weeks and you haven\u2019t even looked into how it works? \u201c  Rebecca rolled her eyes, \u201cYou need to really start learning what you are supposed to do.   It\u2019s going to take a few hours at a minimum to get all those puppies out of you!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn rubbed his belly with a gulp, \u201cHours?  I just figured I would push these two puppies out in a few minutes!  What takes so long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca rolled her eyes again, \u201cTwo puppies?  I can\u2019t believe how ignorant you are!  You have a minimum of 6 in there!  You could have up to 10!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn\u2019s eyes got wider as he answered, \u201cHoly crap!  I didn\u2019t realize how many were in here!\u201d  Shawn rubbed his belly again and giggled, \u201cThat explains all this extra weight I have been putting on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca laughed, \u201cYou only have a few weeks to research this!  You need to really perform for the camera too!  Afterwards, you need to lick them all clean, and let them feed off you!  You need to get on the internet and get this stuff down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn quickly joked, \u201cWell if SOMEBODY wouldn\u2019t forget to take off my collar so I could shape shift, maybe I could actually do something productive during the day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca answered, \u201cI told you I was sorry about that.  It wont happen again.  But I\u2019m serious about doing your research.  We don\u2019t get paid until after the documentary is filmed.  You need to make it look as natural and normal as possible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn agreed and added, \u201cGross.  I can\u2019t believe I have to lick them.\u201c  Shawn then got a feeling and said, \u201cUh oh!  I better shape shift back to 100 percent Sasha! I really need to pee after being stuck in here all day!\u201d  Moments later, Shawn shape shifted and Rebecca put the shock collar back on.  They quickly made their way downstairs so Sasha could pee.  </span></div></div>",

But he found out there were many \u2018instincts\u2019 that dogs were born with and know exactly what to do during birth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca came home and Shawn met her at the door, \u201cYou have to get me some meds!  Apparently dog\u2019s hide their pain and I looked at some videos online and it looked like it really hurt!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca laughed at the procrastination of Shawn.  She assumed Shawn knew what he was getting into.  Seeing Shawn starting to freak out about the whole situation was secretly rewarding for Rebecca.  Shawn had the gift of shape shifting and has abused it his entire life.  For once, Shawn would have to deal with the consequences of something real in his life.  Even if that reality was giving birth as a dog.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded, \u201cYou have a veterinary appointment tomorrow.  I will talk to the veterinarian and see what we can get.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn remembered they had scheduled a veterinary appointment.  It was something he was dreading because that meant spending most of the day as 100 percent Sasha.  It was comforting knowing a professional would be checking him out though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca grabbed the leash by the door and said, \u201cGo ahead and shape shift so I can take you on a walk.  The producer of the documentary will be here soon to start setting up for next week!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn complied and shape shifted his upper body back into Sasha.  After his walk and getting back to the apartment, Rebecca didn\u2019t take off his collar.  Shawn looked up and pawed at his neck to remind Rebecca to take it off.  Rebecca bent down to pet him, \u201cThe producer will be here any minute.  It will be easier if you just stay like this until the meeting is over.  He is going to take a survey of my apartment and see where to set up cameras.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn let out a growl letting Rebecca know he wasn\u2019t happy about staying 100 percent Sasha.  Rebecca jokingly grabbed the shock collar remote and said, \u201cBad girl!  You keep growling at me like that and I\u2019m going to have to use this!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn\u2019s ears perked up at the threat.  As Rebecca set the remote down she giggled, \u201cI love the power of this thing!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn shook his head and jumped up on the couch in front of the TV.  Rebecca picked the shock collar remote back up and pointed it at Shawn, \u201cDown girl!\u201c  Rebecca yelled.  \u201cYou know I hate it when you sit on the furniture!  You shed everywhere!  I just vacuumed for the producer and I want this place to look nice!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn just stared at Rebecca and did his best to roll his eyes.  Rebecca was irritated that Shawn didn\u2019t listen and grabbed the remote, \u201cCome on girl!  Get down!  Don\u2019t make me use this!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn didn\u2019t budge and Rebecca said, \u201cFine!  Have it your way!\u201c  Rebecca quickly hit the button.  Shawn yelped at the shock and jumped down from the couch.  Shawn looked up at Rebecca with a glare.  Rebecca set the remote down giggling, \u201cI\u2019m sorry girl.  But you have to get used to listening to  me while we are being recorded!  Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn shook his head and curled up on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Normal dogs bark when the doorbell rings!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn stood up on all 4\u2019s and obeyed the request.  He started barking and ran to the door.  The producer came in and bent down, \u201cHi Sasha!  It\u2019s nice to finally meet you girl!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn did his best to act like a normal dog and continued to bark and sniff the producer.  Finally the producer pulled a treat out of his pocket and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry girl!  We will get to know each other pretty well over the next few weeks!\u201c  Shawn took the treat from the producer and ran away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe producer and a team of 2 workers carrying supplies.   Rebecca asked, \u201cWow?  So what is all of this for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe producer began pointing out items as the workers unloaded.  He explained, \u201cWe are going to replace Sasha\u2019s normal kennel with this upgraded model.  It has built in cameras to capture everything on camera leading up to the birth.  Because she could pop at any time during the next week, we need to start recording her reactions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca watched as the workers disassembled Sasha\u2019s kennel.  The kennel was really only there for looks.  It was only used if Rebecca needed to transport Shawn in the car.  Normally, Shawn slept in the guest bedroom.  He had never actually spent a second in the kennel at Rebecca\u2019s apartment.  Rebecca tried to explain, \u201cA Kennel?  Normally Sasha sleeps\u2026uhhh\u2026(She lied)...in my bed.  Is the kennel really necessary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe producer explained, \u201cThis must be your first experience with a  pregnant dog!  Once the labor starts, Sasha is going to get very protective and want to be in a safe area.  It would be best for you and her if you started kenneling her when you weren\u2019t home.  That way, Sasha will feel safe in her environment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca tried to fight the issue, \u201cBut she really doesn\u2019t like being in a kennel\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe producer interrupted, \u201cRebecca.  You signed the contract for this documentary.  We spent nearly 10 thousand dollars on all the equipment in this kennel.  You will have to use it so we can catch as much as possible on film!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca finally agreed with the producer.  She didn\u2019t want a small detail like this to ruin the gig.  She knew Shawn wouldn\u2019t be happy about being kenneled while she was at work.  Next, the producer pulled out a tiny camera and said, \u201cThis one here is the money maker!  It\u2019s a head cam Sasha will wear to capture her point of view during the process!\u201d  The producer called Sasha, \u201cCome here girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn came running up and got another treat from the producer.  The producer pet his back and talked in a baby voice, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Sasha.  This wont hurt if you stay still.  Be a good doggy ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was curious on what the producer was doing.  The producer held the tiny \u2018collar cam\u2019 up to Shawn\u2019s neck and smiled, \u201cStay still Sasha.  This will only take a moment!\u201d  Another worker grabbed a solder iron and held it up to Shawn\u2019s neck.  Shawn could feel the heat and stayed completely still.  Seconds later, the producer let go and smiled, \u201cThere we go!  The cam is now soldered to her collar!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn ran away to the guest bedroom to examined what happened.  He was surprised to see a tiny camera was now mounted to his shock collar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other room, the producer explained to Rebecca, \u201cWe will start taking some test recordings from our remote studio in a few days.  That way we can make sure the positioning is correct.  We will go to 24 hours a day recording starting sometime next week.  We don\u2019t want to risk missing anything from Sasha\u2019s point of view!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebercca asked, \u201cHmm\u2026So starting next week, everything here will be on recording?  What about my voice in the background?  What if I call somebody?  Will it record everything I say too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe producer shook his head and explained, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that!  There is no audio on the collar cam.  That way you can still have your privacy.   It only turns on for a few minutes if there is any movement of Sasha\u2019s head.  However, I would recommend not walking around naked in Sasha\u2019s point of view if you don\u2019t want our crew to see anything inappropriate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca giggled, \u201cThanks for the warning!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and the producer talked for a few more minutes and he left.  Rebecca realized she had an opportunity to finally have some peace and quiet around the house.  Only Rebecca knew that the recording wouldn\u2019t start until next week.  She found Shawn in the bedroom laying on the bed and took off his shock collar.  Immediately Shawn shape shifted his upper body back to human form.  Shawn complained, \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about a collar cam?  Am I going to be able to shape shift with that thing always recording?  And what the hell is that Kennel all about?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca grinned to herself inside.  She knew the test recordings wouldn\u2019t start for a few days.  Even more, the cameras wouldn\u2019t even be turned on until next week.  She knew the collar cam didn\u2019t even have audio, but Shawn didn\u2019t need to know that.  Rebecca secretly loved the fact that Shawn was finally have to work for a living.  He usually lived such a carefree life with his shape shifting ability.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at her watch and tried to look rushed, \u201cWe only have a few minutes! The recordings are going to start soon!  Once they start, everything will be recorded!  You aren\u2019t going to be able to shape shift during the days.  And I\u2019m going to have to talk to you like a normal dog ok?  We cant have conversations like we normally do.  You are going to have to act as much as a normal dog as possible!  No reading or watching TV either. Your POV is going to be recorded and it will look bad if you do any human stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was furious, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this?  I\u2019m not even due for another week or 2?  I have to stay 100 percent Sasha until then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca lied, \u201cI\u2019m guessing you never read the contract did you?  If you did, you would have known recording was starting this early.  It\u2019s too late now.  You cant be caught reading anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca then pointed to the kennel, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the whole kennel thing too.  I honestly didn\u2019t realize they were going to bring such a sophisticated piece of equipment here with all those cameras.  Unfortunately, you are going to have to spend the nights sleeping in there and the days inside while I\u2019m at work.\u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn\u2019s ears perked up, \u201cWhoa whoa whoa!  8 hours at night?  And 8 hours while you are at work?  That\u2019s practically the entire day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca tied to give the best pity face she could, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Shawn.  But you should feel lucky that you haven\u2019t had to spend more time inside that thing.  It\u2019s apartment policy that dogs stay kenneled while owners are away.  You should be fortunate you haven\u2019t had to do that this whole time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn rolled his eyes, \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not really a DOG!  I don\u2019t need to be kenneled all day.  I\u2019m not going to eat the furniture or bark all day out the window!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at her watch and said, \u201cUh oh!  They are almost ready to start!  You need to shape shift back to 100 percent Sasha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn gave a disappointing look, \u201cOnce this stupid pregnancy is over and I shape shift back to normal, I am NEVER turning into a dog again!  This is BS!  I\u2019d rather be anything than a pregnant dog right now!  I\u2019d even spend a year filming a movie as a woman or even a stupid kid any day over dealing with this shit!  I can\u2018t wait until I deliver these damn puppies and end this!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn quickly shape shifted into Sasha and Rebecca attached the collar.  Rebecca pet Shawn on the back and said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget!  From now on I am going to have to talk to you like a normal dog!  Try not to act so human ok?\u201d  Shawn nodded his head and Rebecca continued, \u201cOh..and one more thing.  The contract doesn\u2019t end after the birth.  There is a follow-on week of the documentary seeing how you interact with your new puppies.  I wanted you to know now before you found out later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn growled at Rebecca hearing about the added week after giving birth.  Shawn curled up on the floor with another growl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca leaned back on the couch with a grin.  She only slightly felt bad about lying to Shawn.  But since Shawn thought the collar cam had audio, it would be much easier to relax at home.  She wouldn\u2019t have to listen to Shawn\u2019s constant complaining about his situation.  Rebecca would have 3 or 4 weeks of her normal life back.  With Shawn forced to pretend to be a real dog, Rebecca was going to take advantage of the situation!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took some adjusting to the new living arrangement, but Shawn decided the best thing to do was to stay as professional as he could during the filming of the documentary.  Being stuck in a kennel for practically 16 hours a day was boring for Shawn.  Because he was stuck with his lower body as Sasha until the litter was born, Shawn figured it was nice to make some money out of the situation.  He would have liked to be able to shapeshift his upper body into a human during the day so he could watch TV and surf the internet.  But now that the documentary was being filmed constantly, he had to submit to being 100% Sasha all the time.  The highlight of his day was when Becca came home from work.  She would take him on a walk and he got to spend the evenings out of the kennel.  Becca had started a new routine of making Shawn do tricks.  Having to keep up appearances for the filming, Shawn tried his best to act like a normal dog.  Shawn liked the treats so he didn\u2019t mind obeying Becca\u2019s commands.  He was careful not to stare at TV when Becca watched it.  Shawn also had his own fun and would sometimes act like a bad dog and jump on the furniture.  Usually when Becca threatened the shock collar, Shawn would stop acting up.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca was loving the temporary living arrangement.  She of course lied to Shawn about when the filming began. Shawn had thought the filming started a week ago.  With Shawn stuck as 100% Sasha all the time, Becca was getting used to having a real dog around the house.  It was a little payback for Shawn having such a carefree life.  For once, Shawn would have to work harder for his money.  Becca considered keeping one of the puppies after they were born.  She figured after Shawn shapeshifted back to normal, it would be nice for him to come over to her apartment and see one of the puppies he gave birth to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 weeks of Shawn being 100% Sasha, Becca was at work and got a phone call.  The producer of the documentary had been monitoring the \u2018collar cam\u2019 and the other cameras inside Sasha\u2019s kennel.  The producer told Becca, \u201cSasha is starting to give birth!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Becca woke up the following morning, there were 6 puppies all snuggled up to Sasha.  Sasha was resting after being up all night giving birth.  Becca reached in the kennel to pick up one of the puppies and Sasha growled.  Becca laughed, \u201cI forgot how protective a mother can be!\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the following 2 weeks, Shawn had to stay 100% Sasha until the filming contract ran out.  Finally, after all the cameras and the \u2018collar cam\u2019 were taken away, Shawn could finally shapeshift.  Becca took the money from the producer and went into her bedroom.  She counted the money and split it up accordingly.  She took extra money this time from her \u2018agent cut\u2019 because of all the extra costs associated with having a real dog for a month.  Becca went back into the living room and was surprised that Shawn was still Sasha.  Becca laughed, \u201cWow Shawn?  I would have thought you\u2019d shapeshift immediately back to human after the filming crew left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn pawed at his collar and Becca remembered that Shawn\u2019s shapeshifting powers didn\u2019t work when he was wearing the shock collar.  Becca smiled, \u201cOopsie!\u201d  Becca bent down to take off the collar and paused for a moment to pet Sasha, \u201cI\u2019m going to miss having you around girl!  I was actually enjoying having a dog again!\u201d  Becca then grinned, \u201cBefore I take off your collar so you can shapeshift\u2026How about a few more tricks first?...You know\u2026For old times sake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn growled at Becca.  He was eager to become human again and Becca was procrastinating.  Shawn barked at Becca loudly to show his anger.  Becca giggled, \u201cOh relax Shawn!  After spending a month as a dog, a few more seconds wont hurt!\u201d  Becca grabbed the dog treats and told Shawn to \u201cRoll over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn didn\u2019t budge as he just stared at Becca.  Becca laughed, \u201cCome on Shawn!  I know how much you like these!  Even though you are trying to pout, your tail is wagging back and forth!  I know you cant resist these!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn looked behind to realize Becca was right.  His tail was instinctively wagging eager to eat the treats.  Knowing Becca wouldn\u2019t let up until she had her fun, Shawn decided to roll over.  Becca gave Shawn the treat and giggled, \u201cGood girl!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more tricks, Becca took the shock collar off so Shawn had his shapeshifting ability back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve put on a few pounds this year.  You might want to grab a bigger pair..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn patted the back of his butt and jiggled it laughing, \u201cWow.  You are right.  This feels different from last time I shapeshifted into you.  I didn\u2019t even realize you packed on a few pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca was furious, \u201cUgh!  That\u2019s why I hate it when you shapeshift into me!  Hurry up and get dressed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn reached into Becca\u2019s closet to grab a sundress.

It was tight and not very flattering for Becca\u2019s body.  Using his shapeshifting powers, Shawn made his body fit perfectly into the dress and had Becca\u2019s figure from a few years ago.  Shawn spun around and said, \u201cTa-da!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca groaned and mumbled, \u201cUgh!!!   It must be nice to have shapeshifting powers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn grabbed a pair of Becca\u2019s heels and began walking out the door.  He asked, \u201cSo?

Shawn ran to the bathroom mirror and stared at Becca\u2019s reflection.  He concentrated on his shapeshifting ability and changed his hair to red.  \u201cThank goodness!\u201d  Shawn thought to himself realizing he still had shapeshifting ability.  Just to make sure, he gave himself larger breasts and changed his skin tone several times.  Satisfied that he still retained his ability, Shawn turned himself back into Becca.  Shawn wondered how this happened.  Something involved with giving birth must have enhanced his shapeshifting ability.  Now he could shapeshift other people too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn then noticed an old schedule on the countertop from the documentary producer.  Shawn read it and was surprised, \u201c\u2026.I can\u2019t believe this?  According to this schedule..They didn\u2019t even start filming until the birth?\u201d  Shawn remembered how Becca was adamant about Shawn staying 100% Sasha for 2 weeks before the birth.  Additionally, they didn\u2019t film anything else until today.  It was the follow-up filming session to see how the puppies were doing.  That meant that Becca lied to him and tricked Shawn into being a dog for almost a month.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn decided to\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shawn took the shock collar off and shapeshifted Becca.  Now Becca had the body of a greyhound with her normal human head.  Becca quickly realized she could talk again and immediately screamed, \u201cAHHHH!   What the heck is going on?  Turn me back to normal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn settled her down, \u201cRelax Becca!  I\u2019m still trying to figure this out..\u201d  Shawn took the opportunity to get a little revenge after being stuck as Sasha for a month.  Shawn lied to Becca, \u201cSomething happened with my shapeshifting powers\u2026.It seems like I can\u2019t shapeshift my own body anymore.  I can only project my shapeshifting powers onto you..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca seemed slightly relieved, \u201cOk..Whatever?  So shapeshift me back to normal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn grinned, \u201cNot so fast cousin.  Until I figure out how to get my shapeshifting powers back, you realize this means I am stuck as YOU right?  If I turn you back to normal, there will be 2 of you walking around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca didn\u2019t seem to mind, \u201cI don\u2019t care if there are 2 of me!  We can just tell people you are my twin or something!\u201d  Becca walked around on all fours with her human head to the other side of the room, \u201cCome on Shawn!  Turn my lower body back to normal!  You have no idea how embarrassing this feels to have a dog\u2019s body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn sighed, \u201cOh really?  Did you forget that I spent the past month as dog?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecaa retorted, \u201cThat\u2019s because it was your job!  I lined up that gig so you could make some money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn added, \u201cAnd yourself some money!  I\u2019ve been your only client for quite some time!  If I\u2019m not working, that means you aren\u2019t earning any money either!\u201d  Shawn gave an evil grin to his cousin and said, \u201c\u2026.It looks like we are going to have to swap roles for time being.  That means you will be shapeshifting into whatever role is next!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca\u2019s eyes got wide as she realized, \u201cUh oh..The next role I lined up is that Greyhound stunt job starting today!\u2026.\u201d  Becca panicked, \u201cGive me my cell phone so I can call the producer and cancel!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn giggled, \u201cI don\u2019t think so Becca!  Like you said yourself, we need the money!  Maybe with ME being the agent, I will be better at lining up human roles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca got defensive, \u201cDo you seriously think you could be a better agent than me?  You have no idea what goes into networking and lining up roles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two started arguing back and forth when Becca\u2019s cell phone vibrated.  It was the producer of the new Greyhound stunt role.  The text read, \u201c<i>Where are you?  Filming starts in an hour</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn quickly typed back, \u201c<i>Running late\u2026Be there in 10</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn then used his shapeshifting power and turned Becca\u2019s head back to the  greyhound\u2019s head.  With Becca once again 100% dog, she whimpered at her loss of talking ability.  Shawn pet her back, \u201cCome on!  We need to get going!\u201d  Shawn clipped the collar and leash on her.  Shawn grabbed Becca\u2019s purse and they headed to the gig.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Crap!\"  Shawn yelled as cereal hit the floor.  Things hadn't been going great for Shawn.  Sure he was no long 100% dog and had his head, hands, and feet, but life still really sucked.  He was sleeping the Rebecca's guest room, but because the door automatically shut hard he'd have to knock on the door and yell for his cousin to let him out for food and if he had to go to the bathroom, and unfortunately as a towel that was now at the dumb could attest Rebecca didn't always make it in time.  Speaking of the bathroom for the first few tries Shawn tried his hardest to maneuver himself so that he could go in the toilet, but after no any success Rebecca put her foot down and told him he'd have to be 100% Sasha and she'd take him out on a leash to the corner.  And today what was ticking off Shawn was due to not being able to bend his arms correctly he constantly found himself knocking off dishes, bowls, and cups from the dinner table.  Rebecca had tried to convince him to just eat out of a bowl on the floor, but Shawn would have none of that.  He'd make his way onto a chair and lean awkwardly over table and tried to shovel food into his mouth with the silverware.  But what Shawn thought was the worst is that since he was sharing a place with Rebecca she had control of the television most of the time and to say that he didn't share a taste in tv and movies was an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shawn!\"  Rebecca hissed from the couch, \"Stop being so loud, I'm tired of getting noise complaints from neighbors about your outbursts.  I know that some of them notice that the distinctly male human voice isn't coming from me and it can't be coming from my dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your damn dog.  I'm your cousin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not according to my landlord who is being kind enough to let you stay while I'm 'dog sitting' even though I'm not supposed to have pets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should stop giving me things to yell about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First and foremost is the stupid taste you have in tv.  I mean soap operas?  Daytime talk shows?  What are you 60?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I like having something on in the background as I try to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what about the stuff you watch in the afternoon for fun?  Those stupid wedding dress shows, half of them knocked up.  And speaking of knocked up, you actually watch those stupid teenage mother reality shows.  I mean half of the girls on that show aren't girls.  They're adult women with boob jobs who got knocked up to start an acting career.  And don't even get me started on your taste in late night tv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shawn!\"  Rebecca said with her eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Did somebody see me or something?\"  Shawn said as he walked up to the door and looked in the small window at the top to make sure nobody looking in and saw him.  \"No coast is clear, jeez Becca you scared the crap out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca still was in shock, \"How have you not noticed you dolt.  Look down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn did look down and for the first time in forever he saw that he had legs and arms and long blonde hair breasts and a pregnant belly.  Well, those last three things are still not normal for him, but he was human again!  \"YES!\"  Shawn screamed in a soprano voice.  \"I guess I just needed a massive recharge.  Now time to get back to being me.\"  Shawn once again tried to become Shawn, but nothing changed outside of his head.  \"Crap,\" His again masculine voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea,\"  Rebecca said thoughtfully, \"Try turning back into Sasha.\"  Shawn obliged and sure enough he was able to turn into Sasha no problem.  Confused Shawn concentrated and went back to the pregnant blonde form he was just second before.  \"It looks like you always had your shifting power, you just couldn't do anything to destroy the babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can be human, but I just have to be a pregnant lady.  Just great\"  Shawn said grumpily.  \"Well this is better than being a dog/human hybrid.  I'll just stay this way until I'm about to burst and turn back into Sasha to give birth and then I should be able to go back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But judging by how pregnant you are as a human, I'd bet that it would add a at least a month to the pregnancy, the gestation will take longer as a human.  So if you want to get back to being you sooner, I'm sorry but I'd recommend you go back to your Sasha like form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but being like that really really sucks.  I can barely stand it, it's driving me nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think just because you're human having about...let's say at least 6 babies in your belly for a couple of months will be a piece of cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of this made the blood drain from Shawn's face, he hadn't factored that in, \"Give me a few minutes to decide, but for now,\"  Shawn walked past Rebecca, \"You have no idea how long I've waited to go to the bathroom indoors, even if I do have to sit.\"  Shawn sits down on the toilet and begins to seriously think about the decision before him</span></div></div>",

I guess that'll be a nice change of pace I guess if I have to be an animal.  But what is it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca breathed a sigh of relief that her cousin seemed kind of interested, time to drop the bomb.  \"Well, the studio I'm in contact with is looking for a highly intelligent animal and I, and by I, I mean you, were recommended for the part of Luci the primate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn looked at his phone in silence.  \"You want me to be a monkey.  A monkey named Luci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The studio wants you to be a highly intelligent primate, and it has to be female, sorry.\"  There was a moment of silence so Rebecca continued to make her case, \"Come on Shawn, it'll be fun.  I don't think you've ever done a primate before and it'll be much more human than any dumb dog part I'd have gotten you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess it'll be nice to be able to keep having opposable thumbs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!  And you'll be able to just walk around naked and poop wherever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Becca what kind of animal do you take me for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect you to be a primate by the time I get to your pigsty of an apartment in about an hour.\"  Shawn looked around his room when he heard his cousin say this.  She wasn't exactly wrong about his place being a mess, mainly because he had the clothes of about 30 different people strewn about his apartment.  Of course all thirty of those people were just different forms of Shawn but that didn't really leave an excuse for the mess.  Rebecca continued on the phone,  \"I've already got your transportation ready to the set.  You start today and the first check is already in your account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you're giving me a choice in the matter.\"  Shawn grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, I knew you'd say yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to give me the low down on what kind of monkey I need to shapeshift into, I kind of need you to be more specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry about that Shawn, my bad.

See you in a bit cousin.\"  Rebecca said before she hung up leaving Shawn to ponder his task.  Shawn set up some image searches for research and made a microwave pizza to treat himself since he figured it may be a while before he could have human food.  As he ate his pizza Shawn studied and memorized how the chimpanzee body was structured.  Then when he felt comfortable he set up a bit of a practice round.  Removing all his clothes he stood in the middle of his room and started to shift his body about.  He grew hair all over his body and shifted his face a bit.  In a matter of seconds Shawn looked like a perfect hybrid of himself and a monkey.  He looked perfect if they ever made another of those future ape planet movies or whatever they were called.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter admiring his own handiwork for a minute Shawn figured it was time to make the final product and gave himself the proper proportions and shrunk himself down to about 3' 6\".  He checked a mirror and sure enough Shawn looked exactly like a normal chimpanzee.  Shawn took the opportunity to go a bit wild and jumped around his apartment.  He jumped on the bed and had a blast for the first time since he was about 5 years old.  Then he tarted climbing and hanging all over his furniture.  He was beginning to contemplate trying to hang off of the ceiling fan, but the doorbell stopped that probably bad idea from being executed.  With his normal voice he called out, \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your cousin/agent, could you let me in please?\"  Rebecca's said formt he other side of the door.  Shawn walked over to the door a little duck footed and opened the door with no problem.  Rebecca entered quickly making sure no neighbors could see the chimp in Shawn apartment.  \"Looking good Shawn, I just have a few notes for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?  The color?\"  Shawn said as he turned his black fur blue getting a smile out of Rebecca.  \"This isn't a space monkey thing so standard black will do.  Don't you remember that your character's name will be Luci?  Don't you think Luci should be a girl chimp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn sighed, \"I guess so.\"  And he quickly and quietly made the needed adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know this should go without saying but could you go ahead and change your voice, we don't want to freak out the rest of the world by bringing them a talking monkey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of amateur do you take me for?  But if you want me to do it now I will.\"  A second later the next thing that came out of Shawn's mouth was, \"Ugh eek ook ook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled, \"Thank you Shawn.  Now lets get you to the set.  We have a meeting and make sure you're on your best behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne very awkward ride later where Shawn had to stay in the back of an enclosed truck in a cage, Rebecca was wheeling her shapeshifting cousin onto the studio lot where a middle aged man and a young black haired Hispanic woman seemed to be waiting for them.  Rebecca started her wheeling and dealing, she introduced herself and 'Luci' to the man who it turns out is the director, Trevor Robins, and the woman was the animal trainer Sonia Nunez.  For the first time in his life Shawn was kind of glad he didn't have his manhood because if he'd had it the whole world would be able to tell that he was very attracted to Sonia.  He liked the idea that he'd be spending a whole lot of time with her on this shoot but really hated the idea of being a monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor looked at you and said, \"Well she certainly looks good and healthy, but is she smart enough for this, can she be trained for being on film?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia squatted down to look you in the eye and said, \"Let's test her out.\"  And began making motions with her hands.  In a moment of panic shared between you and Rebecca at the moment you realized she was trying to talk to you with sign language.  Rebecca quickly stepped in, \"Luci doesn't know sign language I'm afraid, but she does know English very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia looked skeptically at Rebecca and said, \"I'll be the judge of that.\"  Turning back to you she softly and sweetly said, \"Luci?\"  You made sure she understood that you understood her.  \"Luci I'd like to be your friend, I'm going to offer you my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor looked nervous, \"Is that safe Sonia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Luci is trained it is, we're about to find out.\"  Sonia held out her hand and smiling you took it and put your lips to it and gave it a kiss.  Sonia smiled, \"Well she certainly is sweet, I think I can work with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great news, Miss Perry let's finalize the contract and let these two get to know each other better.  Trevor and Rebecca went off into some building while Sonia wheeled you over to your home for the time being.</span></div></div>",

Curious about his new living space, Shawn grabbed the bars of the cage and pressed his rubbery face against it to see if you could get a good look at wherever you were going.  Sonia saw this and smiled, \"Have some patience Luci, we're almost there.  You'll be rooming with me miss big star.\"  Shawn were very surprised with this.  In every other animal stunt job he'd gotten he was always just put in dirty cages with a bunch of (other) animals.  It was usually awful because not only was the smell awful but if he was a female like he was now Shawn would have to fight off any males with a stick (or a shapeshifted chainsaw arm).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes Shawn were taken to a very large trailer, well more like a very nice mobile home.  The inside of it looked like it had been lived in for months.  With his monkey senses Shawn could tell that he weren't the first monkey to live here, but the first in about a month.  And it also looked and smelled like Sonia was the only human who was ever here.  Sonia let Shawn out of his cage and pointed him to a little play area she had set up where her closet should be.  Inside were a series of toys and pictures you would normally associate with toddlers but soon realized that they were for him and Sonia definitely didn't have a child that they could be for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia began to encourage 'Luci' to play with them.  She seemed to be gauging how intelligent Shawn was.  Not wanting to seem like dumb and replaceable he made sure to fit all the square pegs in the square holes and pointing out shapes when Sonia told him about them.  It should have been boring but seeing the joy and intellectual curiosity from Sonia made it enjoyable.  But after a while something happened that Shawn didn't expect, Sonia began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so dumb, this is the most intelligent conversation I've had in about a year and it's with a monkey.  No offense Luci.  How did I let my life get to this point.  I mean I love my job and all but I have all but cut out human contact in my life.  I haven't even had a boyfriend since high school.  Hell I haven't had a girl my own age to just hang out and get drinks with since college.  I'm almost 30 and I'm just going to end up spending all my life talking with animals on crummy movie sets.  I just wish I had someone, anyone to just...be a normal woman with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was dumbfounded by all this, he had turned into a female monkey for a paycheck and now he was playing amateur chimp psychologist for his trainer.  He felt bad for her, but then a rush went to Shawn's head, a similar one to the adrenaline rush he would get from doing stunts.  What if he just shapeshifted right now in front of Sonia and gave her the friend she so badly wants, nay, needs.  Shawn didn't even think of any other consequences, he wanted to do it and had already decided.  The only question now was how risky was he going to be with who he shapeshifted into?</span></div></div>",

Shall we just watch a movie? Seeing that you are clearly well trained.\" Luci giggled again. \"Well reasonably well trained. After a little liquor, I get a little handsy!

This chapter is based on the work of Wanderer and Dark Writer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edwina and the night visitors? Never heard that one before!\" admitted Luci. \"It's kind of a horror, shape-shifting adult drama.

I'll protect you!\" Watching 'Edwina' howl made Luci very nervous. This was really scary. There was no way Edwina wouldn't give in. How did she endure 6 movies of this? \"I have to keep this sort of work away from Becky. I sure don't want to stunt as this!\" she thought. \"Nervous, Luce? You aren't ticklish, are you?\" she teased, giving your aide a poke. You squealed, half jumping in the air.

I never did. I sinply bemoaned the lack of boyfroends. So I am sure did Drew Barrymore, Angelia Jolie and Madonna!\" \"They are all boy preferring bisexual women!\" \"So was I.\" She replied.

You are gorgeous and sweet. I need a friends with great benefits. If things get romantic, then that's fine. If not for both of us, either can walk away without fear. Neither of us exposes the other.

It had a flattened upper body like a crab, and stood on four anthropod legs. The front of the carapace had a single, glowing, red eye, either side of which were set two heavy machine guns. Beneath those were two mean-looking metal claw hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn ran his fingers through his hair anxiously. <i>This</i> could be more of a challenge. He had tried shapeshifting an inanimate object only once before and handle found the experience particularly enjoyable. This <i>thing</i> was a monstrosity and he was going to be expected to maintain his form for hours, maybe even days at a time, depending on what happened to him between shoots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some trepidation he continued through the attached files until reaching one labelled 'set_accident.mpg'. It was a recording of the last scene filmed. The set had been expertly made up as a post-apocalyptic landscape, crumbling buildings, smoke and flames. As he watched, the star of the film and a young actress sprinted out of one of the buildings. A moment later, the E-1 appeared in the doorway, chasing them, it's twin miniguns spraying underwhelming, pre-production sparks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn really had to admire the animatronic work - the E-1 moved with amazing fluidity, it's four legs scuttling in perfect unison. All up until it stopped responding to controls. Halfway out of the door, the robot froze. There were shouts from the crew but it was too late; the pyrotechnics went up and the building came down, burying $3,000,000 of advanced animatronics under tonnes of rubble and reducing it to scrap metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of the footage was of the director going ballistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the rest of the morning familiarizing himself with the schematics. They were baffling complex and detailed. While a machine was technically orders of magnitude simpler than a human body, shapeshifting them was second nature to him. Forming servomotors and hydraulics and CPUs was a different thing entirely. But eventually he was comfortable to give it a first try. Only he doubted his small flat could accommodate a 7 foot tall robots. He'd need somewhere with plenty of space and secluded. He went for a drive.</span></div></div>",

Honestly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titular Exterminator of Exterminator 2: End Times had been a mechanical shapeshifter that had pursued John Conrad relentlessly, morphing its liquid metal body into blades to brutally kill anyone in its way. It was a truly terrifying, seemingly-unstoppable bad guy that even today gave Shawn the chills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not that. This was the sexed up version. Neither the liquid metal nor skeletal versions, this new model more resembled a store window mannequin, with a distinctly female chassis - flared hips, slender limbs, and breasts. <i>Way to pander to the lonely nerd demographic</i>, Shawn sighed to himself. He flicked through some more of the attached photographs, but none looked particularly terrifying, or any less sexualised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The E-X Exterminatrix is the latest and most advanced of Cloudnet's deadly Exterminator units,' read one of the press releases. 'After our hero, John Conrad, was returned to the 21st century at the end of Exterminator 2, he thought the nightmare was over. Little did he know that the scattered remnants of Cloudnet had one last trick up its sleeve - the Exterminatrix. Sent back in time with a deadly arsenal of futuristic weaponry, not least of all its ability to holographically mimic any human, the Exterminatrix will not stop until it fulfills its primary objective - to kill John Conrad!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sounds really dumb.\" Even the footage of the animatonics in action, prior to its untimely explosion, was lame. It could barely stand, let alone walk, and the arm movements looked like something out of Chuck E. Cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoading up the schematics, Shawn resolved himself.

The engineers had done an exceptional job making the external shell look like a nerd's wet dream using only lycra, fabric paint, and foam, but internally things were a different story. Being a human was something you only missed when you were no longer one, and the absence of breathing or a heartbeat unnerved him. A chill ran through him as his body heat began to leach out into the surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis form felt weird, alien, inhuman, and he recalled more clearly why he'd never repeated his foray into inanimate shapeshifting. He tried some simple movements; his limbs responded sluggishly, moved slowly. A simple step sent his metal body thudding hard to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked like a marionette operated by an inexperienced puppeteer as he climbed awkwardly to his feet. This wouldn't do at all. He focused his power internally, giving himself a tune-up - tightening up hydraulics, loosening joints, improving signal pathways. He wasn't aware of it, but soon his body was a specimen of robotics decades ahead of current technology. He flexed his fingers experimentally - found the motion fluid enough for him to almost convince himself he was still human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he focused on the external dressing. The metallic painted lycra wrapped around his robot skeleton just looked tacky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll soon have th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-at improved.

He sat bolt upright, disorientated. \"What the- Where the-\" He stared around him. He was in his cousin's apartment. Staring down at himself, he discovered he was still in the body of the Exterminatrix and that a thick, black cable had been jammed into a socket in his navel. It was an invasive sensation having it in him, and he instinctively moved to pull it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch it!\" Rebecca shouted, running towards him. \"You'll only shut yourself down again.\" She pulled him into a hug. He felt her human warmth spread through him a little from the contact. \"Thank God you're alright,\" she said with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? \"Shut myself down\"? \"Again\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found you out cold in your apartment,\" she explained. \"You idiot; you completely drained your battery, deactivated yourself.

The floor around him was strewn with a multitude of phone chargers, laptop adapters, dongles, and even a pair of jumper cables. Outside, night has fallen, while to him it had been daylight only a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran through him as he processed her words. For several hours, he'd been without power. Dead. If it hadn't been for her he would have stayed that way, forever, just an inanimate, mechanical... thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing before you passed out?\" she asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just using my power,\" he replied. \"I mean, my ability.

Lay it down!\" the male voice snapped. \"Over here! Somebody get a crowbar and pry this thing open! Let's see what I've got to work with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more thuds and the splintering of wood later, and light flooded into his prison. His eyes adjusted slowly. He was laid on his back, encased in custom-moulded, protective black foam inside a large wooden crate. <i>I look like a frigging barbie doll.</i> Faces peered down at him. He made sure not to move a muscle, staring straight forward blankly, even while his peripheral vision excitedly tried to call his attention to several A-list faces it was sure it recognised. And there, standing over him with a critical look, was his director, Jamie Cameroon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmf. Not a bad copy,\" he sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut among the faces, Shawn could see nothing of cousin, agent, and owner, Rebecca.</span></div></div>",

Slung over a shoulder, he was carried some distance and deposited on a metal workbench littered with bits of wiring. A monkey wrench the size of his arm lay within in his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful with her,\" a nasal voice whines shrilly. It's owner enters his field of view. Whereas the previous men had most likely been mechanical engineers, this guy was unmistakably a software engineer - the physique, the glasses, the t-shirt written in binary. He leans over, for a moment his fingers tracing down Shawn's face. Shawn represses the urge to recoil. \"She's very delicate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's made of titanium,\" the mechanical engineer that carried him points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But her skin is only lycra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, relax. It's a working model, it's expected to get scratched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's our only one. If we ruin this one, we're screwed. Do you have any idea, any idea at all how much they had to pay that woman to give it to us? More than either of us make in ten years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the important thing is she sold it to us, right? So we're not renting. <i>So</i> we don't have to worry about returning her in one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, Becca sold me! How could she?</i> Shawn was stunned. He had trusted her and she'd handed him over unconditionally. Bitterly he hoped it had been a good offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're overreacting,</i> he tried to calm himself. <i>She knew that she could get more money with a straight-up sale and she knows that you can slip away once filming is complete. Then she'll split extra cash with you.</i> Yet it still smarted. He had wanted her here keeping a close in case anything went wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt that invasive sensation penetrating into his skull again. He felt fingers on his neck. They'd plugged him in. A moment later he could hear the laptop singing in his head, his body and the computer exchanging data. Lines of text and code scrolled across his vision. He lay perfectly still, listening to the sound of fingers on the keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd...\"</span></div></div>",

He felt himself being picked up with much effort, stood up against a wall, and he some dust brushed off his robotic bust.  \"Can't believe I'm feeling up the real Exterminatrix.  It's metal but oddly flesh like, you know?\"  One of the two men said giving Shawn's chest a squeeze.  \"You know what, you're right, wonder how realistic she is 'down below' if you know what I mean.\"  The second man said now reaching too low for Shawn's liking.

Suddenly Shawn could feel something going on inside of his eyes, and suddenly he had night vision.  \"Whoa, trippy.\"  Now that he could see it only took him a glance to realize that he seemed to be in the back of a moving truck.  \"So I'm being shipped, fantastic.  What else am I being shipped with.\"  Shawn said as he look around the truck and saw...\"Is that...me?\"  Shawn said at what looked like him, but on second inspection was just a cardboard cutout.  \"Must be for the movie.  Wait a second.  No, that's wrong, I was supposed to be in Exterminator 3 and that was just supposed to be a few months of shooting, what the hell happened?!\"  Shawn said as his eyes drew to the movie title at the bottom of the cutout.</span></div></div>",

Based on the usual rate that Hollywood pooped out these sequels, he estimated he had been out for no less than four years. They must have filmed the entire of Exterminator 3 with a team of engineers guiding him around like a puppet, with his 'programming' asleep inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a disturbing thought, but he knew he should thank his guardian angel that his original mind was hard-wired in. He hadn't planned for that, so his powers must have implemented it automatically as a safety feature. Good Guy Powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dim, green-tinged night vision, he examined his surroundings closer. There were several wooden crates. Searching through them failed to yield the one thing he desperately wanted: a battery adapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Shawn, calm down,\" he said to himself. \"You've no idea how much charge you've got left - hell, you could deactive any second - but as long as you don't use your powers, we might be okay. All we gotta do is get out of here, find Becca, <i>kick her flipping ass</i>, and get charged up. Then change back. Simple.\" With that, he boldly pushed open the metal doors at the back of the lorry. \"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he had thought was the interior of a lorry was, in fact, a shipping container. And what he had initially mistaken for the jostle of the lorry down a bumpy highway was in reality the roll of the container ship as it plowed a wind-tossed, iron-grey sea. Salt spray hit him in the face as a wave crashed over the side. There wasn't a scrap of land to be seen all the way to the horizon, only miles of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That complicates things...\" he gulped. \"Okay, rethink... rethink... Ah ha! \" he cried, snapped his lycra fingers together. Changing his whole body would drain his batteries, but if he was lucky he might have just enough to transmogrify his recharge socket into something more standard, something like a phone charger perhaps. He just needed to find any sort of charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked astern towards the ship's bridge, illuminated from within. That would be a good place to start searching.

The deck beneath him was slippery wet and every now and again the freighter would run into a powerful way or plow into a trough, and would roll and shudder violently. Shawn was grateful he didn't have a stomach to feel sea-sick with. Waves crashed over the side of the ship, and soon his lycra skin was dripping salt water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope I'm waterproof,\" he muttered to himself. He doubted very much that he was bouyant and so stayed far away from the ship edge; one slip and he'd be down in Davy Jones' locker, walking to shore along the sea bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to reach the door to the crew quarters, the hand wheel began to turn. Shawn froze as the door swung open and a seaman stepped out. He was swaddled in his luminous waterproofs and had his hands cupped in front of his face as he struggled to light a cigarette - it was only that which stopped him noticing the animated gynoid skulking about on deck. He turned his back, shielding his cigarette from the high winds with his body, and Shawn took the opportunity to slip past him and inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself in a dimly-illuminated metal corridor of a ship's interior. His lycra-padded feet made little noise as he tiptoed onward. He saw no sign of further crew members, but after a while he <i>heard</i> over the hum of the engines what sounded like snoring. Following the noise down, he descended a flight of stairs and came across the sleeping quarters. Four bunks were set into the walls of the tiny room and on one of them, a man was sprawled on his back, an open copy of playboy laid on his chest, his mouth open and snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn hesitated. The last thing he wanted in this body was to get discovered. Explaining the situation would be impossible. He'd be a stowaway. Worse, he'd be a sexualised fembot trapped on a ship of seamen unlikely to have seen a woman in weeks. He shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept clutched in the sleeping man's hand was a phone. It was no design Shawn recognised - no doubt technology had come along in five years - but importantly it was connected to a charger plugged into the wall. Exactly what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith supreme caution he creeped forward and crouched beside the bunk. The sailor shifted in his sleep when he first tried to pry the device out of his hands, and Shawn found himself holding his breath despite not having lungs. But slowly he was able to tease the phone out from between his fingers without waking him. Elated, he removed the charger and held it up to his own recharge port in his belly button, willing his powers to conform to the female equivalent of this male dongle. He just wished he had the power remaining to do it...</span></div></div>",

What if his ability had deserted him or his battery was so depleted it couldn't manage even a tiny transformation like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it turned out he was just a little rusty, so to speak. Slowly but surely, his recharge port began to shrink and adopt the complementary conformation of the slim phone charger. Eagerly he thrust the dongle into its place. His knees buckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh y-yeah, that's it.\" His battery must have been near exhausted - recharging had felt nowhere <i>near</i> this good the last two times he tried it. He slumped against the wall, his eyes half-closed as the cable in his navel pumped warm, electric pleasure into his belly. \"Juice me up, baby,\" he gasped quietly, his head buzzing, his fingers stroking the plastic cable. He bit his lip, trying to stifle the soft moans building in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snoring had stopped. The sailor was lying with his eyes open wide, staring directly at Shawn. It was hard to feel alarmed when he felt this good, but as the man stood up and stepped closer, panic rose in him. He had barely even begun to recharge; he needed more time! He went limp as a doll, sagging against the wall with his head lolled against his shoulder and his arms unmoving at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck. Who the hell has been keeping <i>this</i> thing a secret?\" the man chuckled, grinning broadly as he crouched over Shawn's body. \"Hey, I recognise this...\" The man snatched up his copy of Playboy from the bunk. He flicked it open on the centre fold. There, dressed up in raunchy underwear and sex gear and posed in a variety of compromising positions, was Shawn's body. They had done a photoshoot to promote the Exterminator 5 release, and he had been the star. The indignity!

It felt weird at first, before she felt herself becoming more real. The words disappeared in front of her and she felt full of energy. Her strength felt full. \"You need to change into another sailor. This guy didn't show up! Change into him!\" she suggested. A quick look at the photo was all it took.

He was 31 years old, but he was home. \"Ready to go, have a chat with your cousin?\" asked Kia. Shawn had learnt that his cousin had become very wealthy off selling him. And that she had lied about what happened to him, telling his parents that he died. And this was less than 2 days after he had been sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had figured out that she could make money off Shawn through more direct methods. She had betrayed him.

She also had arranged for the adoption of no less than 98 children produced from her cousin Becky the rat and her late 3 paramours. To Shawn's delight, the babies born in 21 days, all developed human form. Once hitting 3, they could turn into rats or humanoid rats at will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, they were able to turn themselves back without any difficulty or fatality. She arranged for them to be adopted by various families. However Becky was ageing. She was no longer capable of breeding as she was nearing the end of her lifespan. Or so, she had thought. Shawn had given Becky's new male infant self to Shawn's own parents to be raised as the new Shawn. Shawn was uncertain how much of her treacherous cousin remained, but it didn't much matter. Becky had now redeemed herself in full, not that it mattered. She would never be able to prove what Shawn and Kia had or could do. It amused Shawn to think of Becky growing up as a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn was amazed at how much he had enjoyed being a talent agent. Helping talented young people achieve their goals, gifting them a helpful boost with a face change due to cosmetics of course. She no longer had any desire to be a stuntwoman.

She had hoped that she might develop the same powers as Shawn, so that she could at least be immune to her cousin's power. But Becky 'Shawn' Perry was 55 with 6 daughters. And all 6 of her second cousins were shapeshifters. As they showed her as they grew up. They were not aware of her past and thought that she was joking when she claimed to be Becky Perry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky, to her great surprise, had developed interest in women only. She suspected it was due to her upbringing with the Rowes or perhaps it was when she was kissed by a girl when she was in elementary school. The thought of men was repulsive. It made her angry to think that Shawn not only got her to be impregnated by rats, but actually changed her sexuality somehow. The fact that she slept with male rats and had babies, might also have become a factor. The Rowes were excellent and kind parents, despite the fact they were turning 75 and 73 respectively. Her original parents were also quite encouraging of her. The Rowes never revealed that she was adopted, nor did she ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky had a girlfriend, Natalie Rogers. Natalie was kind, supportive and openly bisexual. This was a great relief to Becky as she still held out hope of returning to being a woman. If she did, then she could still be with Natalie. Although Becky was a little afraid of losing her interest in women if she became one. Finding homosexual intimacy unpleasant didn't mean that lesbian relations would be viewed the same way. At least that was the hope. She had watched adult lesbian films with Natalie and was pleased that it was stimulating to both. As she stared at herself in the mirror, she tried to focus on changing herself to mirror her 18 year old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever all that she saw was the average size of a man in the year 2039. She sighed deeply, shaking her head. She reached for her Interpad V7. It still amazed her that Tim Cook had arranged for the Apple-Microsoft Merger with Steve Ballmer that led to the first Interpad in 2025. Steve Balmer died in 2038 at the age of 82 from Thermal Radiation as part of the disastrous Venus Expedition which remained the larger space disaster in Human History. She opened her Interpad and separated the communication component. To think that hardware could integrate physically was still amazing.

Slowly he scuttled across the coffee table, a tiny Black Widow spider moving with a somewhat drunken gait. The glass beneath him seemed to stretch out as huge as a football field. He had never once tried a form this small before and he couldn't say he was exactly comfortable with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eight eyes spaced around his head watched every part of the room at once. Both the body's instincts and his own concerns made sure he paid special attention to the human. From this angle, Becca seemed vast, literally miles high. When she spoke, her voice was like a foghorn. When she moved, the movement of air felt like a powerful gale howling over the sensitive hairs that coated his abdomen and many legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling light was blocked out as Rebecca's huge head moved closer and hovered over him, like a pink meteor that could crash down and crush him any second. Shawn tried to scuttle out from under her, finding his animal panic overrode his clumsy human control of his legs, allowing him to scuttle more freely. Alas, she followed him around the coffee table, peering at him, her nostrils not more than a few inches away, pumping out hot blasts of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Shawn, you're really picking it up now!\" Rebecca boomed excitedly. \"If I didn't know any better I'd swear you were the real thing. I'd probably have smooshed you by now!\" He wished she wouldn't use that word: smooshed. \"So you're probably wondering what the film is by now, right?\" She paused, as if expecting him to answer. \"It's a remake of Arachnophobia, y'know the old 90s film. I know you're gonna love it because they've really sleazed it up, kinda like the Piranha franchise. Something about a crate of poisonous spiders washing ashore at spring break. Basically an excuse for close up shots of you scuttling over teenagers racks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn hesitated. He wasn't sure if this sounded like such a good job after all. Sure stuntwork was supposed to be risky, but being such a small creature in close proximity to a bunch of twitchy teenage girls was <i>suicide</i>. He was just about to will the shift back to human form when...</span></div></div>",

The lid snapped shit on top, sealing him in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell Becca?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough training for now. We've got to get you to the shoot,\" she boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, I need to change back now!</i> He visualised his human form, willing it to alter his body to fit... Nothing happened. <i>It's the box,</i> he thought in dismay. <i>If I transformed now I'd be crushed, my powers must be protecting me.</i> He pressed his front two legs against the plastic wall, searching for a gap. There was nothing. The prison lurched suddenly, tumbling him off the walls and floor. When he picked himself up, he wasn't even sure which surface was the lid anymore. <i>Looks like I'm committed,</i> he sighed as she slipped him inside her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe traveled in darkness for what felt like hours, clicking his mandibles nervously with each bump and knock. As light flooded back in, he stared around at the world around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hot damn. I wish I had <i>ten</i> eyes,</i> Shawn drooled (or at least leaked venom). Everywhere he looked - which, with 360 degree vision, happened to be everywhere at once - there were bikini clad beauties. He was in an interior film set. There was a painted, blue sky backdrop, wind machines, and golden sand spread across the floor to emulate a beach. Bronzed, toned teenage bodies skipped hither and thither beneath the light rigging, as a team of make-up artists touched up their make-up, fluffed their hair, sprayed fake tan on their butts, and sellotaped the strapless bikini tops to their breasts. Shawn was in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun in there?\" Rebecca chuckled, as the Shawn-spider scuttled back and forth in its box, ogling each actress as they passed by. \"Ah, here comes your handler now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn's excitement dwindled as his box was exchanged into the hands of a middle-aged woman in khaki. He was raised up to eyeline and peered at by a weatherbeaten, sunburnt face. \"Cor, she's a real beaut. Look at the markings.\" Australian. Naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's one of a kind alright,\" Rebecca replied. \"Take good care of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry about her, little miss. If there's one creature you don't wanna piss off, it's a <i>latrodectus</i>. By the sounds of things it's only gonna be a couple of shots, so you should have her back by tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

It won't bite if you don't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, cameras rolling in 5...4...3...2...1...Action!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's right, keep perfectly still,</i> Shawn thought as he stood on a pink hill, his eight legs splayed on the warm, gently rising-and-falling ground beneath him. He hadn't been intending to go through with it at first but as the handler carried him towards the set and he saw the actress laid out on the sand, he'd changed his mind. She wasn't an actress, she was a stuntwoman like him ( except he was a stunt<i>man</i> of course (well, usually anyway)), and that had allowed him to trust her not to smoosh him in a pique of girlish terror. He'd actually met her once at a stunt-training workshop a year ago. Back then she'd been a B-cup and pretty cute. Somewhere along the line she'd upgraded to a pair of DDs and fallen in a vat of peroxide. <i>God, I hope she didn't get implants just for this role. That'd be depressing,</i> Shawn thought. Then he reconsidered who was really the more desperate for work here: the woman who had altered her body, or the man who had changed it into another species entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, he was perched on her right boob. All he had to do was walk across her cleavage and he'd be done. It seemed simple enough. The only difficulty was that the girl was practically <i>drenched</i> in fake tan and the hot, set lights (not to mention his precarious, poisonous presence) was making her sweat buckets. It was like walking through a muddy field. All around him, beads of perspiration the size of his head were forming on her skin. He lifted his legs through the greasy sludge one at a time, moving ponderously down the slope of her breast. Down in the valley of her cleavage, he stared up at the mountain before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne foot after the next, after the next, after the next, after the next, after the next, after the next, after the next. Halfway up, he knew he wasn't going to make it, the strain was exhausting his long, spindly legs. He forged southward, clambering onto the dry fabric of her bikini top. This was <i>much</i> easier going. From here it was an easy climb to the summit. He paused at the top, feeling a surge of achievement, and giggled mentally as he realised where he was standing. Her nipple stuck out like a cairn through the thin material. To her credit, the girl continued to lie still on the sand with her eyes closed even as his legs tickled her areola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameras were still rolling. Shawn descending the flank of Mount Stuntgirl for a second time. As he neared the edge of her body, he heard the shout of \"CUT!\" The Australian woman was there in an instant, scooping him deftly into a plastic container. The stuntgirl let out a shuddering, pent-up gasp, grinning madly, her hands roving over her breasts for puncture marks, just in case. \"That was terrifying!\" she shrieked shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, she wouldn't hurt a fly,\" the handler chuckled, tapping the side of Shawn's container. \"Well maybe <i>just</i> a fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Speaking of, Shawn was hoping the shoot would be over before he had to feed. Already he could feel his stomach was empty. Just a few more shots and he'd be human again and tucking into a nice, juicy hamburger.</i></span></div></div>",

Look, you're still getting paid for the insect. If you needed your bug back so soon you should have specified it in your contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... I just need to check on it's well-being is all,\" she pleads. \"Is that the cage there?\" she asks, peeking beneath the manager's armpit into the interior of the set. Before he can stop her, she ducks beneath his arm, hurrying to the large, perspex box set aside from the cameras. Gravel lined the bottom of the tank and the few leafy branches placed inside it had been festooned with spider silk. She spotted a few spiders lurking among the shadows of the leaves, but none that resembled Shawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this one, right?\" the manager said tersely, wandering over to the tank and tapping the glass in one of the corners. \"Looks, it's doing fine. It's even got a little nest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca peered closer. It was a Black Widow alright, though she couldn't know for sure that it was him. It sat hunched-up in the middle of the most craptastic spider web she'd ever seen. It looked like the arachnid had gotten entangled itself several times. Broken strands of silk clung to it's bulbous, black abdomen. Yet somehow, something had become caught in the crude construction. A greenbottle fly thrashed its legs and wings helplessly. \"If that's him, he's going to kill me for this,\" she groaned as the spider sank it's fangs into the struggling insect. He still whined at her about the time he'd eaten garbage as a concussed dog. This was even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy?\" the manager snapped. \"If it's all fine with you I've got a job to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what's that other one doing,\" Becca said, pointing to a smaller, brown-bodied spider that was approaching the Black Widow's corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one? That's the male. It keeps trying to get with the female, but everu time it steps in her web she cases him off. I'm surprised she hasn't bitten his head off yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown spider made a timid attempt to mount the abdomen of the widow. She whipped around, throwing it off her, and chased it away across the tank, waving its front legs in the air in a distinctly human gesture of anger.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<i>It's almost flattering really</i>, Shawn thought as he returned to his web, confident that the brown spider would not dare return for a few hours. Ever since he'd been placed in here with the other spiders, it had pursued him relentless, doing mating dances into the early hours, bringing him flies to eat, acting all nicey-nicey right up to the point that it whipped out its freakish alien penis and tried to mount him. <i>Is it my fault? Am I leading him on? Did I pick a really skanky-looking spider body to switch into? It's my abdomen, isn't it...</i> Shawn thought, glancing back at his big, black rear. Slightly smug at how sexy a spider he was, Shawn climbed back into his, if he did say so himself, pretty awesome web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he realised the human voices he could hear were coming from nearby. He'd spent so long in the hubbub of the set that he'd just fazed them out. He stared upwards, upwards, uuuupwards, through the plexiglass to the two behemoth figures on the other side. It was Becca! She'd come to rescue him! Finally he was going home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you at least give me a date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other human walked away from the tank, throwing up his arms in defeat. \"Fine, Ms Perry. We should have finished shooting-\"</span></div></div>",

Take care.\"  Becca said as she took the freshly copied contract and left the studio.<br>\r\n____________<br>\r\n<i>A month!?  She couldn't have just said a month.  Tell me she didn't say a month!</i>  Shawn thought to himself.  He'd heard the producers talk about how they'd get more movies out of this, but he didn't think he'd be the spider still around for them.  As he thought this the brown spider dropped off another fly for him and tried to make it's moves again.  <i>And with my luck you'll be my roommate the whole time, great.</i>  Shawn once again waved his front legs in a way that scared the male brown spider off, but Shawn knew that his flailing arm move was getting less effect each time.  <i>It's going to be a long month.</i>  Shawn said as he dug his spider fangs into the fly.</span></div></div>",

Thanks to all who have been a part of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawn Rowe 25 year old man in California pursuing his dream to become a big time Hollywood stuntman.  And Shawn's got an advantage that nobody else has; he can reshape his body to anything he wants.  As you can imagine, this would make him a highly coveted commodity.  That's why he works through his agent/cousin Rebecca who gets him the best jobs possible (or whatever happens to come across her desk).  The two have only done work with smaller budget films up to this point, but their fortunes are about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMain characters (so far):<br>\r\nShawn Rowe- 25 year old shapeshifting stuntman.  His 'default' look is that of a 5' 9\" guy of average size who's in pretty good conditioning due to his job.  He's outgoing and will take just about any job offered to him, for better or for worse.  He keeps his powers a secret from everyone except his agent in order to prevent himself from becoming some government experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca Perry- 27 year old agent.  Cousin of Shawn.  She moved to California with the dreams of becoming an agent but after years of interning she found she was getting nowhere, when practically out of the blue Shawn reveals his powers to her.  She immediately quit her job and started up her own agency with Shawn is every single client.  Whenever a studio needs a stuntperson they call her up and she 'just so happens' to have a near perfect duplicate of the actor/actress on file.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules:<br>\r\n1. Keep additions more than just a quick sentence or two, have a little substance to what you write.  Aim for at least 1000 characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No matter what role or shape Shawn takes, his mind does not change.  He will always be Shawn Rowe, no brainwashing, hormones taking over, instinctual changes, or just random personality shifts in general.  Shawn stays Shawn in mind and heart, a 25 year old heterosexual male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.
