It seems like every cent of of every dollar you earn goes into food, paying the bills, and college expenses. . Unfortunately, you have neither the intelligence, academic aptitude or the right skin color to afford a scholarship so you're stuck earning your college degree the hard way, living off of takeout when you could afford it and ramen when you couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long day of bending over backwards at your terrible to earn enough money to make sure your electricity doesn't get cut off you tiredly crawl into your bed, and after a short wank session quickly drift off to sleep.<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you a mysterious light begins to grow from underneath your bed, illuminating the room in a silvery glow.<br>\r\nSix tendrils emerge from the light source and slowly inch their way up the sides and over the comforter before coming to rest over your lightly snoring body.<br>\r\nThe tentacles seem to gently caress your body, their feather-light touches barely registering against your covered skin.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the tendrils cease their stroking and pull your covers down over you and reach down beneath your back and bottom.<br>\r\nHad you been awake you might've been surprised to learn that you were suddenly levitating in the air, blankets hanging free off your body as you were suspended by a mysterious force.<br>\r\nThe light under your bed suddenly intensifies, and in response the tentacles tighten and expand forming into a sort of cocoon.<br>\r\nAs the light grows ever brighter so does the silky embrace grow tighter on your form, almost like you were returning to the womb...<br>\r\nAfter a time the light begins to fade until there's only a dull glow and the darkness rushes in to consume you once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wonders where you have been transported to. Just as gets up, he hears a very American accent behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why howdy stranger. You don't look like you're from 'round here.\" said the voice, which turned out to be a small horse with a cowboy hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey, a talking orange pony!\" Anon said in a British accent. \"And it's American.

The portal machine worked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what machine?\" the pony said becoming ever more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well bloody hell then. What's your name strange horse thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. It's Applejack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well than Ms Applejack\" Anon said as he picked up his rifle and placed a machine onto the ground, \"Welcome's to the glorious British Empire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The British what?\" Applejack said, feeling quite concerned at the word empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Anon's machine opened up a massive portal of light, and out of it came dozens of tanks, soldiers, and planes, all bearing the Union Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confused Applejack looked and the strange machines and people in horror and confusion. \"Wh- what's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ms. Applejack,\" Anon said, \"The royal army is here to bring you the wonders of civilization! In return, we just ask for your excess land and resources to aid in the war effort.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"War?! What war?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the war against the germans of course. We have to defend the empire and freedom. Don't worry. Just work with the royal army and everything shall be most spiffing for the both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Applejack realized that she had just encountered some dangerous creatures. She would have to let the princesses and her friends know.</span></div></div>",

The telegram arrived an hour ago.\" Becher pulled out the note with the telegram and read it out loud. \"By order of the Fuhrer, General Schneider is tasked with invading and taking over the other world and prepare it for colonization. You shall be given command of the 9th, 10th, and 38th infantry divisions, the 2nd and 9th panzer divisions, and the 3rd SS infantry divisions to establish a foothold for future campaigns.

With the war going how it is?\" Schneider asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's an order from the furrier himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchneider sat down to think for a moment.  He knew that the resources from the other world would be crucial for the war effort, but in order to take it over in the first place would require just as many resources, and the Reich couldn't afford the manpower for such a campaign with the war in their world going on already. Eventually, Schneider came to a conclusion on what to do.</span></div></div>",

You tense up so much that you seize up and immediately and start coughing uncontrollably, just barely keeping the bile from forcing its way up your throat. A soft-spoken panic-stricken female voice pierces through the haze. <br>\r\nOh my goodness! Are you all alright? Do you need some assistance?\"<br>\r\nCough!**Cough!\"I.. think so..\" You wanted to say no but your everything hurt, you were dazed and you frankly were seeing things double because you were seeing an angel coming up to you, an angel with ethereal, multicolored hair, and... a horn? You couldn't pick up the face, everything was blurry and brilliant. \"Am I dead?. Because I think I'm seeing an angel.\" This made the 'angel' looked even more panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems fine to me\", another voice next to you coolly comments. You turn to see yet another beauty standing next to you, except this one was colored in midnight blue and wore a small black diadem encrusted with jet and onyx. The white creature instantly recognizes her. \"Luna! This creature has been badly injured and requires medical attention. Do you think that you could get a room ready for him while I call for the doctor? \" \"Luna\" nodded and gave you a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not, young creature. You shall rest easy with us while your wounds heal.\"<br>\r\nAs she declared, her horn glows in sparkling azure as you were suddenly lifted off the ground, you were rushed toward a colorful corridor that resembles that of a Palace the most, soon, you were taken to a room then to the softest bed in existence. The other but dark angel sat beside you and seems to scan your body.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, it appears you have several cracked ribs, bruises around the arms, and sternum.  I also believe you're displaying classic symptoms of a concussion, therefore I recommend you stay in bed and do not move until the doctor comes, \" she sternly advises.<br>\r\nYou nod slowly and lay your bed back into the pillow. The bed is comfortable and you're not going to want to move anyway, so you instead close your eyes and pull the comforter over your head. What did they stuff these beds with anyway, clouds?<br>\r\nNo matter, you felt like sleeping anyway and you slowed drifted to Morpheus' arms. You hear her urging you to stay awake but it was too late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up from a dreamless sleep, you kind of regretted it as you felt a strong pain around your ribs and a pounding headache, aside of that, You felt wrappings around your torso and arms and head. Where... you are? You remember the portal, the fall, the pain, and... the angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose... weren't part of a dream, were they? The room look kind of luxurious, though bit old-fashioned, it wasn't a hospital room but something you'll see from European Royalty.<br>\r\nYou try flexing your arms and upper body to move around a bit, but the wrapping proves too restrictive, so you just lay back in the bed and sigh. Guess you're not going to be going anywhere for a good long while.<br>\r\n At least your ears weren't ringing anymore, and your vision had returned to a clear, crisp state.<br>\r\n Your eyes rove around the room, taking in as many details in an effort to tell where the hell you are.<br>\r\nA sun motif seems to be quite prominent, as you can see it carved into the door, the chest drawers and even on the wooden bed frame you were laying in.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door creaked open, slowly revealing someone entering. It was the... \"Angel\" from before, you gasped seeing her in great detail. She was...<br>\r\n\"I hope you're alright, your sudden appearance caused a rather strong commotion. Seeing you hurt was painful to see.\" There she was; Alabaster colored skin, ethereal multi-colored hair and... tail(?). Regal, almost royal looking attire complete with a golden tiara. but the most predominant part of her... was her rather inhuman but cute, equine-like face.<br>\r\nWherever it is you ended up, you're most definitely not on Earth anymore. You're so transfixed by the beauty of the female alien that you completely forget to speak. Her brightly smiling face quickly turns to one of concern. \"Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n Her voice snaps you out of your reverie, and you quickly reply, \"N-no ma'am there's no problem... I've just never seen anything like you before.\"<br>\r\n This brings the smile back.<br>\r\n\"And I've never seen anything like you before.\" She says in a rather warm, and motherly tone as she approached, you noted that she was rather... gifted in curvature, it was almost being on the presence of a fertility goddess of some kind. Fortunately, she didn't notice you ogling her until she gasped lightly but smiled good-naturedly \"I forget my manners. After all, you are our guest, My name is Celestia, princess of Equestria, and the other that brought you here was my little sister and fellow co-ruler, Luna, who will join us soon enough.\"<br>\r\nWhoa, did you hear that right? You were in the company of a princess? She did seem like the regal type, and the tiara and fancy clothes were a dead giveaway... Wait, so that meant that you were in a royal palace after all.<br>\r\n \"Wow, a real-life princess,\" you breathe. Never thought I'd see the day I'd ever meet one. So, uh, is Equestria the name of the planet we're on or the country?\"<br>\r\n The princess grows thoughtful for a moment before replying, \"All the myriad species and cultures on our world have different names for it, but for simplicity's sake we call the planet Terra. I guess that would mean that you're not from our world, then?\"<br>\r\n You slowly shake your head. \"No, ma'am, I'm from planet Earth, and I live in the United States of America, or at least, I used to.\"<br>\r\n The princess clapped her hands gleefully. \"So we've been given the honor of entertaining a guest from another world born from a completely alien culture. Oh, joyous day! I can't wait to tell Luna about this,\"<br>\r\n \"Tell me what?\" There she was, the other midnight angel, her attire was like those of Celestia but darker but still regal, her figure was similar to her elder sister but smaller, unlike her sister's mane and tail, her mane was dark and starry as the night. She was beautiful just like her sister. It is almost as you were in the presence of goddesses with incredible beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lulu, glad you could join us.\" Celestia looked happy at the arrival of her sister.<br>\r\n\"This young creature here... um, forgive me  but I don't believe you've given me your name yer.\"<br>\r\n\"Anon.\" you supply, \"and I'm a human.\"<br>\r\n\"This young human, Anon, was just telling him that he doesn't hail from this planet at all, but from a far off world called he calls Earth.\"<br>\r\nLuna snorts, \"It makes sense. He doesn't look like any creature I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\nShe then sits down at your side and softly stroked at your bandaged head. \"You're quite lucky you landed here, human. We have all the means necessary to ensure you enjoy a speedy recovery.\"<br>\r\nLuna's bosom was very close to your head and you could clearly see her breasts straining against the fabric.<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks. I'm lucky in being in the care of two beautiful princesses.\" You couldn't help glances on the youngest's bosom, you blushed but moved your eyes away from the Royal Chest. You hoped that neither of them notices and thinks of you like you were a pervert or else any goodwill might be evaporated in an instant.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From every angle the anomaly persists in your vision like a pulsating sphere.<br>\r\nGingerly you reach a hand inside and close your eyes.<br>\r\nA strange, not unpleasant sensation runs up your arm and persists until you chose to withdraw your hand from the swirling vortex.<br>\r\nYou stare at your hand, fully expecting it to have burst into flames or have radiation burns or <i>something</i> but it seemed that your flesh would remain unsullied by contact with the portal.<br>\r\nA chill of excitement ran up your spine as you came to a sudden realization.<br>\r\nThis portal could lead to <i>anywhere</i>, and if you were to allow yourself to satisfy your curiosity by stepping through...<br>\r\nThis could be your chance to have a real adventure outside of what you experienced through movies and video games.<br>\r\nA chance to find something no one's ever seen before. <br>\r\nYou can't let this oppurtunity get away from you.<br>\r\nOn impulse you run into your room and throw open the closet, rummaging through it before pulling out an empty backpack. <br>\r\nFrom the kitchen you piled several perishable foodstuffs into the pack along with a few bottles of water.<br>\r\nJogging back into the living room you threw your phone inside along with a pair of earbuds, slung the pack over your shoulder, and approached back to the swirling portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully prepared for a long trip, you once again reach an arm into the portal, this time slipping in up the shoulder, and step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly upon entering you feel like you were splashed with a bucket of icy cold water. Electrical crackles dance across your skin running up and down your spine extending all the way out to your extremities.<br>\r\nIf the buzzing outside the portal was loud and distracting, then the noise inside stole your breath away.<br>\r\nIf you had full control of your faculties you would've moved to plug your ears, but the movement of your arms was slow and sluggish, almost like you were trapped in a lake of molasses. Your eyeballs were assaulted by bright lights and swirling colors flashing in every color of the rainbow.<br>\r\nSoon the sensations became to much for you to bear and you quickly lose consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Where is it that you end up?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Take the day off, to get yourself back in order and tomorrow I don't want to hear a single stutter out of you, do I make myself clear? \"<br>\r\n Dusty was confused now, Spoiled never give anypony the day off but considering her mental condition, she could see it that way, she was nervous and stressed already so instead of talked, she nodded as no trusting her own voice and left.<br>\r\n Spoiled smiled as the servant left and cupped her breast where the tiny is sitting. \"Now we can be alone.\"<br>\r\n You stopped and looked up and smiled at her, this made her coo on you. \"I don't know why or how but you bring something out of me that I hadn't felt in years.\"<br>\r\n Your stomach was completely full of milk now and you couldn't drink any more if you tried., so you just relaxed in her hand and basked in the warmth of her fur.<br>\r\n You suddenly turned but instead of being repulsed to it she released another \"Awww..\" she cooed again p, it reminded her the moment Diamond Tiara was born when she was suckling her teats for the first time after 11 months of wait of an anxious but worthwhile wait.<br>\r\n Those days were long past, of course, she had since grown into a fine young filly. Still, deep down she had nostalgia for the day when she was taking care of her infant daughter, which were among the happiest days of her life.<br>\r\n Spoiled quickly debated whether she should bother putting her bra on or just go around topless, and ultimately decided that she would rather let them hang loose.

You weren't complaining but also you find it overwhelming, You really don't know how you will please her if this was coming but damn! she was really gorgeous.<br>\r\n Spoiled sighed as she laid down on the bed with you cupped closely to her breast. She laid you in the middle of her cleavage and with her now free hands sensually rubbed all the way down her body,<br>\r\n Her body bent as she propped herself up with a pillow and she smiled down at you with that same warmth as before.<br>\r\n \"Now, with that out of the way, we can now have fun, you and me.\" She says in a mix of sensual and motherly tone.<br>\r\n Spoiled took you into her hand once again, except this time she started lifting you up to her muzzle.<br>\r\n For a moment you thought she'll eat you until she puckered her lips and starting smooching you, kissing you in appreciation, you got to confess, the deal was dangerous for you could be sucked into her mouth but it was really hot!<br>\r\n Just then you remembered something. Before you left you loaded up and snack cakes and such for a long rup and stuffed them into your backpack for a long trip. Maybe the goddess will appreciate them as offerings? You weren't going to have to worry about food anymore, in any case.<br>\r\n You pushed your arms out to stop the goddess' barrage of giant kisses. \"What's wrong, did I hurt you?\" She looked concerned but you shake your head and instead, you looked on your back and revealed your snacks, pastries and food to her and presented her as an offering.<br>\r\n \"You want to feed me... after I fed you?\" Spoiled was touched. Her eyes shimmered with mist at what the human was offering her and a strong warmth burst inside her chest. Of course, she would accept.<br>\r\n She opened her mouth and stuck her tongue out to catch any falling sweets while also avoiding pulling the human in.<br>\r\n You saw her tongue out as you offered it all to it to the sensory organ, she opened her maw wide, giving you a view of her, glistening cavernous mouth and her pearly white monolithic teeth.<br>\r\n God even her mouth is just so sexy. You imagined the pasties traveling down her gullet to be digested and processed into more milk to drink.<br>\r\n You individually unwrapped them one by one and tossed them onto the tongue while stuffing the plastic back into the bag. She slowly withdrew her tongue and closed her mouth. They were all so minuscule that they would immediately melt in her mouth, but it's the thought that counts.<br>\r\n She gulped and smiled down to you, at least she did manage to taste them. \"That's so sweet of you..\" She giggled on her own pun.<br>\r\n You chuckled as well, but suddenly, she began to move you away from her face.<br>\r\n\"I have a problem, a problem that you can help me solve. Would you help me? You nodded numbly, already having an inkling of what's about to come.<br>\r\n The goddess looked gleeful at this and gave you another hearty kiss. \"Thank you. After this, you can have all the milk your little heart desires.\"<br>\r\n With one hand holding you, she lowered you down to her panties, the sole piece of fabric separating her from immodesty, and with the other hand pulled the waistband open with a single hooked finger.<br>\r\n Then, she then drops you in into the damp and humid atmosphere, pressed against her searing hot, heaving slit, you were suddenly filled with a raging need once your head was swimming on the pheromones it permeates.<br>\r\n Your body moved on autopilot towards the source of the pheromones, the heaving pulsating entrance to Spoiled's birth canal that was eager to swallow you whole. Spoiled Rich laid back, enjoying the feelings you were giving her and spread her legs so that you would have better access to her flower.<br>\r\n Down inside her panties you saw the flaps of flesh open up like magic, inviting you in.<br>\r\n You dove straight into the slit and let yourself get lost in the wet, clinging darkness.<br>\r\n All along the way, you felt the ribbed muscles caressing and massaging your entire body as they slowly pulled you to their destination.<br>\r\n This wasn't just having sex, this was making love, warm and caring, with the intention of making a baby.<br>\r\n You weren't just Spoiled Rich's toy now, you were her lover, for her alone.<br>\r\n Spoiled Rich wasn't sure if she was going to feel you but she was feeling you right and nice, you were venturing your way deeper into her core, as she was cheating on Filthy Rich? Haha Tartarus, no! This was barely cheating if that stallion can get away with dozens of his foals with his herd. This very experience reminded her that she was a mare with needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she wants those needs satisfied. So imagine her surprise when she moans on feeling the tiny thing already on her cervix, caressing and making out with it.<br>\r\n \"Ungh, oooh yes keep going,\" she urged the tiny on. \"Don't stop. Kiss and touch my womb. It's yours!\" Her entire body was on fire now, outraged but also delighted at the little human being in a place he had no business being. Spoiled rapidly stroked at her cunt flaps and twisting and pinching her rapidly winking knob. A torrent of juices pouted from her quim and out into her already soaked panties. She imagined the tiny swimming in a lake of her own fluids and drinking his fill, and this made her even more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, you held on by gripping yourself on the rounded, quivering organ, the place was totally flooded with her juice, you were almost about to swim of it and frankly, even her love juice taste milky! However, you have an goal in mind and was to mate with the goddess' womb. Your pants were down and aligned to the quivering hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen pushed in.<br>\r\n Spoiled Rich gasped as she a tiny pinprick penetrate her core. He was going it, he was really doing it. Meanwhile, inside, you gasped as you felt the roundish button completely envelop your dick, and from behind the quivering meat closed up provide aa cushion to lay against.  You were already at your limit, the journey in here had made you rock hard and your balls were full to bursting with seed. It was time. You gave one final push, thrusting slowly and deliberately to ensure that when you pop it will be a big one, The chamber was slowly filling up with fluid but you didn't care, you were single-minded in your attempt to breed this mare and make her yours,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You did, you popped a huge nut as you roared, pushing your dick deep, ensuring your load gets into her womb, even if any chance of offspring is impossible due to the size difference, it didn't matter, you heard a shriek of pleasure from her, as the entire place tremble and fill up with more of her juice, you twitched as you let out the final tiny burst and dislodged from the cervix's tunnel who closed up entirely, likely to not leak your hefty donation. You panted as you fell on the twitching meat that provided a soft cushion.<br>\r\n The wall behind you slowly opened, and you were carried away by a river of love fluid.<br>\r\n Then you were then squirted out onto the sticky panty fabric, panting heavily.<br>\r\n Suddenly there was a giant hand, grabbing gently out of the warm, humid ridden panties.<br>\r\n It was Spoiled, come to collect her bounty, and thank him for a  job well done.  She panted and laid back against the pillow with a pleasured look on her face.<br>\r\n SH lifted her hand from her panties and sucked on her fingertips, savoring the juices.<br>\r\n She, however, deposited you back to her bosom, bouncing gently as she pants as she lick her finger off her juice.<br>\r\n You wondered... Will something grow inside of her?... Nah, you were too small and your seed was monumentally small. Besides, you were a different species and she was a giant alien. chances are that nothing will happen..</span></div></div>",

It seems so although it was quite something if you managed to pleasure a goddess, a Titaness.<br>\r\nShe sensually sucked her fingers, one by one savoring the taste of her own juices and moaning unashamedly. As soon as she was done, she looked down at you and fixed you with a loving gaze.<br>\r\n\"I was having doubts if you could pleasure me but I was thankfully mistaken.\" She spoke in a soft tone<br>\r\n \"You even managed to quench my heat!\" She giggles \"I no longer have that annoying need anymore. At least for a time.\"<br>\r\nYou looked at her confused on the term, what she meant with heat? whatever it was, she seems to be genuinely happy after that. Maybe sex is something more in this world than just reproduction? You had my questions.<br>\r\n\"It's very likely I'll become a mother again soon, and it's all thanks to you.\" Spoiled softy patted and massaged the breast where you were staying.<br>\r\nYou, in the meantime, tensed on the words. \"W-what?!\" you say in surprise, finding your voice for the first time, dread started to creep on you. She looked, hearing you talk with such a shocked tone. Does this mean she wanted you to make her pregnant? that's was her heat was about in the end? wait...(edited)<br>\r\nMother again?<br>\r\nWas she married?<br>\r\nYou were starting to get dizzy with the dozens of though running in your head but you finally realized one thing \"Of course, she was able to lactate, she had a child!\" You though fearful.(edited)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nId Spoiled was aware of your inner anguish she didn't appear to show it. She was srill basling int the afterglow of a wonderful orgasm. \"Now what am I to do with you, my little stud? I have all day to play with my new little pet.\"(edited)<br>\r\n'Little pet...' That's right, you've basically accepted her as your goddess at this point. She doesn't seem to be too concerned about it, in fact, it seems like she wanted this from the very start. Maybe you shouldn't be all that worried and embrace your role.<br>\r\nWell... there was no going back, besides, it can't that bad, right? You now have roof and food and a beautiful goddess taking you in with kindness, to pleasure, and breed. So what if she was married? Let him know that her future children, it gonna be yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpoiled Rich was having a horrible day, said horrible day turned for the worse when Filthy Rich decided to tend his herd now of all days, and this particular week! However, that changed when this little thing appeared, drinking from her bosom. At first, she thought it was an annoying pesky bug bitting her but noticed his stallion-like physique, it was a very tiny colt! but it was different from any colt. He looked awfully a lot like one of this extinct species that crazy anthropologists, Lyra, obsess about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she has found one! It opened something her, the maternal instinct that told her to protect him and her lust driven by her heat, tempered said instinct with excitement and want and her lust when no sated, can get very creative and she was greatly rewarded, despite the tiny size, he managed to hit all her buttons and he was so thoughful..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so adorable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! This tiny human is hers now.<br>\r\n Her mind raced with all the possibilities and the places she could keep him, and all the fun they could have,<br>\r\n She had in her hands a creature that she could shower kindness upon and in return would be devoted to her, willing to help her find relief when she's stressed and he would be incredibly easy to take care of him.<br>\r\nYes... This would the start of a beautiful and productive relationship.<br>\r\nShe wonders... what if she could include Diamond?<br>\r\n ...Yes, she should have a right to know where her little sibling is going to be coming from. Spoiled didn't often show it, but she was sometimes frustrated that she was unable to connect with her daughter in a meaningful way, it seemed like they were continually drifting apart due to her won stubbornness and pride.<br>\r\nA discovery like this is be something that should be shared.<br>\r\nAnd maybe this can be the start of a family restructuring, a new bond between mother and daughter. No, Herd Sisters.<br>\r\n\"I think I know.\" She says, a grin formed on her lips \"Maybe I should present you to my beautiful daughter, Diamond Tiara. After all, you're the  father of her future little sibling.\"<br>\r\n Whoa, first you get to impregnate this drop-dead gorgeous mare and now she's taking you to meet her daughter? Score! You could not have come up with a better outcome if you tried.<br>\r\n \"She's getting around that age where she's going through her First Heat she's getting curious about sex and I've almost caught her masturbating a few times. I think a hands-on approach to teaching her would be appropriate, hmm?\"<br>\r\n\"... And if I get her pregnant?\" You asked, going to be a little cautious here.(edited)<br>\r\n\"The she will have learned her lesson,\" Spoiled said simply.<br>\r\nSo... just simple as that, gave her a grandchild as the aftermath of a lesson of sex? just how lax are those giant sensuous beings. Either way, you had reached a jackpot when entering that portal. You nodded in agreement and gave her your widest smile.<br>\r\nSpoiled seemed rather pleased by your answer. \"Very well, then let's go meet her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'll likely find some alternative solution for you in the future, but as for right now, she elected to keep wearing it.<br>\r\nShe picked up the discarded bra off the bed and hooked it into place, then picked you up and tucked you into one of her cups.<br>\r\nOnce again you pressed against her mammary flesh, and the familiar nipple flesh. Satisfied with her temporary arrangements and looking semi-decent enough, Spoiled left her room and back to the corridor, looking for Diamond's room.<br>\r\nIt didn't take long until she was in front of her door. It was still somewhat early in the morning so she should still be inside. The door was standing slightly ajar so Spoiled took this opportunity to peek in.<br>\r\n her eyes widen but a wide grin formed in her lips, There she was, on her bed as she read a book, the book was some erotica as she was massaging her mound, releasing small, cutely sounding moans.<br>\r\nSpoiled slowly creaked the door open, taking care not to alert her daughter to presence, and slipped inside, before slowly closing the door behind her.<br>\r\nShe stood there watching her daughter masturbate while pressing a hand against her own mound and bit her lip.<br>\r\nShe stealth fully went toward her daughter's bed as she went near it. Diamond was completely unaware, too enthralled to the book to care that her mother was in the same room as her despite being in her own little lustful world.<br>\r\n\"Diamond?\" The filly froze and released a shriek of surprise upon hearing her mom.<br>\r\n\"M-mom? What are you doing in here... I-I mean... Uh, it's not what it looks like?\"<br>\r\n \"Would you like some help with that sweetie?\"<br>\r\n Diamond's eyes opened wide and her mouth flew open in shock. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\nSpoiled sat down at the edge of the bed and gave her daughter a sympathetic look. \"I know you're getting to that age where you're curious about your body and you want to do things to make yourself feel good. I completely understand.\"(edited)<br>\r\n\"You.. You do?\" Diamond asked cautiously, Unable to thrust her mother, after all, it was the realization that her mother has been pushing her to become like her and because of that, she also found out that she doesn't like it.<br>\r\nSeeing the glare of suspicion made the matriarch flinch.<br>\r\nShe recovered quickly though and came up with a plan to get through to her daughter. \"Of course. You know, I was the same way when I was your age, except I lived on a dairy farm and didn't have access to the same 'literature' you have. You don't have to be scared of what I think. In fact, if you'll allow me we can do it together if you like.\"(edited)<br>\r\nDiamond was still distrustful, it could be a ploy, an attempt to lower her guard only to snatch the book away and scream at her as those things are not for winners or something along those lines. Still... This was the first time she has seen her mother in another emotion other than scowling and irritation. So she let herself lower it<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" She says uneasily as she lowers the book.<br>\r\nSpoiled smiled and crawled into bed with her daughter, who shifted over to make room. She unbuttoned her skirt and pulled it off leaving her pantied pussy exposed just like Diamond's. She propped herself up with a pillow so she could see what she was doing, and after a moment's hesitation, her daughter did the same.<br>\r\n\"So... what are we doing?\" Diamond Tiara asked a bit awkwardly, realizing that this going to turn a bit... awkward.<br>\r\n\"The same thing you were doing, except now we're doing it together.\" It took a moment for her words to click and realize what she was talking about, Her mother was asked to masturbate with her. Diamond Tiara felt weirded out by this request and initially would've said no, had there not been a fire rising deep in ger loins and sending chills up her spine. Despite herself, Diamond Tiara was getting wet at the thought, and no matter how much she tamped down the feeling it kept coming back in full force. She squeezed her eyes shut and simply said, \"Okay.\"<br>\r\nDiamond's hand slid down her body until she was back at that forbidden junction between her thighs and began to rub against her puffy lips.<br>\r\n You heard all the conversation going on even from within the cup and pressed against Spoiled's nipple, She seems that there were some tensions between your goddess and her daughter but at least there seems to progress.<br>\r\nIt seems like they don't quite have need of you yet, so you decided that you would drink some more of that creamy, delicious milk.<br>\r\n You hear the loud Human of satisfaction from high above. Suddenly, however, you felt the cup getting loose, she was removing her bra again.<br>\r\n Spoiled unhooked her bra and let it drop to the floor and let her breasts bounce free. She began mimicking her daughter's movements and slipped a hand inside her panties while the other massaged and kneaded her breast, conveniently the very same one you were situated on.<br>\r\n You hear the cutely, small mewls and moans coming from Diamond as you hold yourself on the bouncing hill teat, she looked adorable even for someone that looked like a budding teenager that was becoming of a blossoming woman. And hum broke your thoughts and looked up to see the mother's grinning face on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Spoiled took you into her closed a fist around you before saying, \"Baby, stop for a minute, there's something I want to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Notice the soft-looking features in his face and he is not a pony, he is a human colt.\" Diamond Tiara's eyes widen on the information. A human!? a real human!?<br>\r\n She's heard of them before, through tales and stories about how they used to live in the Everfree forest until ponies drove them out. They were supposed to be creatures of magic that could disappear at will, change their size, and create illusions. The fact that her mother had one right now was rather shocking, though not because of the size.<br>\r\n\"He's my new pet and breeding stud, and he's utterly devoted to me,\" Spoiled said lovingly. \"I want to share him with you to help ease your heat.\"(edited)<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She says in skepticism despite the surprise of the existence of the once extinct human still present. \"How can he do that? He is tiny..\"<br>\r\n\"Pull open your panties, and I'll show you\",\" Spoiled said.<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara dis as her mother asked and pulled down her underwear, then moved to face her mother so she could see her fillyhood in all of her glory.<br>\r\n \"Like this?\"<br>\r\nSpoiled licked her lips in anticipation. :\"Yes, just like that.\"<br>\r\n Spoiled then looked at you \"Go ahead, Please my daughter~\" Spoiled then dropped you toward her daughter's puffy, and undefiled fillyhood. Diamond yelped a bit but waited then, she felt your intrusion in sliding into her young folds. She suddenly gasped as she felt the tiny human invading her maidenhood's canal. \"B-by Celestia!\" She gasped.<br>\r\n Diamond Tiara felt him quickly pass through her folds and crawl inside the entrance to her fillyhood, and weirdest of all, could feel his tiny hands working on her inner flesh. Her body involuntarily seized and convulsed upon feeling these new sensations.<br>\r\n Seeing her daughter like this, made the matriarch approached and embrace the filly \"It's fine, see? he is really good in pleasure us despite his tiny size.\" She cooed and the filly a kiss to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Spoiled pulled Diamond on top of her and continued the kiss while running her fingers through her mane.<br>\r\n Deep inside, you continued to crawl inside the wet pulsating tunnel taking your time and kissing her every few steps. You wanted to make her feel as good as possible to get her used to the idea of using you, and just like her mother, the juices began to flow. Speaking of which, it felt quite to be inside her rather than her mother.<br>\r\n Unlike her mother, who had supreme control over her muscle groups and slowly but surely pulled you along, the filly's muscles were more erratic.<br>\r\nYou were pulled deeper and deeper almost like being sucked straight to her core which was getting ever nearer.<br>\r\nYou felt the walls convulse and shift under your touch as the tunnel gets flooded.<br>\r\nGiven that the tunnel of the virgin filly was much tighter than the seasoned adult, it didn't take long for the juices to fill the space.<br>\r\nThankfully, however, it didn't take long for you to reach your destination, highly visible, albeit smaller cervix.(edited)<br>\r\n \"Jackpot.\"You decided to instead of just getting to the point, you were first going to give that succulent hole a very nice and deep kiss.<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara gasped sharply and moaned \"He is kissing me! he is kissing something deep in me.\"<br>\r\nSpoiled chuckled and said, \"That's your cervix, dear. He's going to put something inside you that will stop the heat by way causing something called an 'orgasm'. or 'cum' , making it so that eventually you'll be able you'll grow a foal inside you. Just lie back and let it happen.\"(edited)<br>\r\n\"A foal?!\" Diamond's voice was panicked now, even as she felt her arousal grow.(edited)<br>\r\nSpoiled's voice as calm and serene.\"Yes, dear, that's the only way to stop the heat, I'm afraid, and I don't want to see you suffer another second. Soon you're going to become a mother like me.\"<br>\r\nShe repositioned Diamond's head so that it was aligned with her teat and pushed her into it. Just relax and drink, dear. It will be over soon.\"<br>\r\nDiamond was about to protest but was silenced by the creamy substance invading her mouth. Diamond was surprised but slowly but surely decided to accept it and began drinking her mother's milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou at the same time retreated your mouth from the dilating, pulsing hole and decide to get to the main attraction.<br>\r\n You aligned your incredibly hard rod with the hole and pushed, forcing your cum cannon deep inside the protective sphincter. You began to hump against the womb imagining scenarios of your life with these two lovely ladies and the swell of their pregnant bellies filled with your offspring, living in the lap of luxury while spending your life with people who genuinely love and care about you. You carefully embraced the bulbous structure gave it a soft, tender kiss while you pumped away inside of it.<br>\r\nSpoiled felt her daughter tense and moan, feeling vibrating on her teat, she smiled as this happens, she caresses her daughter as she continues drinking her milk, it reminded her of the day she was born and drinking from this very same teat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, sooner than you'd like, you gelt the familiar pulse of your dick and a familiar onrushing of fluid forcing its way to your cumslit. You didn't even bother trying to hold back and released it all, grunting as you released yet another cloud of sperm into a womb. This time you felt no compunction about what you were doing and relaxed upon knowing that you did something to please your goddess. You lied back and relaxed, completely spent, with a big goofy grin on your face.<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara gave another moan, she let go, gasping as she moans and trembles, she felt her face had drips of milk falling on her face, she moans and shrieked in an orgasm feeling the human unleash his essence into her violated sacred place, her tongue was out, lolling out of her mouth as her eyes were unfocused and tearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara has her first, strong orgasm.<br>\r\n Her hips shuddered, bucked, and rolled riding the wave of her orgasm. Diamond Tiara had never felt anything like it in her ife, ir was like soaring into the heavens on wings of light. All of the muscles in ger body relaxed and released their tension, and for a split second, she had no idea who or where she was.  Meanwhile, the resulting flow of fem and squeezing muscles and the rapid expansion and contraction of the ribbed walls carried you back to the entrance unscathed and you were pushed back out onto the bed.<br>\r\nSpoiled was satisfied with the performance, really satisfied, so much that she was surprised seeing Diamond suddenly latch on her nipple again and drank with so much want and greed, she felt the tongue lapping on the nipple as it releases more to her, She was was embraced by her. Spoiled saw her daughter's face to see what's going on until she saw... love and regret on those eyes.(edited)<br>\r\nYou had completely freed yourself of Diamond's pussy and laid on the bed, still feeling the aftershocks of your own orgasm. Spoiled saw you lying there and collected you into her hand before placing you on the other nipple.<br>\r\nYou started instinctively to lap and kiss the hard nub of flesh and suck from the milk duct and starting drinking from her, Spoiled gave a satisfied hum, seeing her two important lovelies drinking on her breasts, she sighed contently. It been quite a while she nursed Diamond and even then, she never really stopped, she thought it was an annoying condition but for once, she was really glad to never went away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond n the meantime felt a feeling that couldn't explain, that burn on her loins was finally sated, replaced with a feeling of contentment, this feeling of love that came from her mother, its... been quite a while since she felt the appreciation and motherly love from her. She glances at the tiny who was drinking on her mother's other teat, the one who satisfied and quenched her need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe father of any possible foal she and her mother might get. Maybe it won't be that bad, the human was cute, maybe his foals will also be cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking around the gigantic room you are currently standing in, you notice how simple the room looks, the floor and walls are that of an old wood, firm and sturdy in build, the overall colour of the room is that of a light oak colour, however the walls are decorated with many no-doubt hand made posters, flags, drawings, the list goes on. Most of them consists of 3 human beings, one white with purple/pink hair, one orange with messy purple hair and one yellow with deep red hair. All seem to also include the letters 'CMC' plastered all over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This room must belong to a child, anywhere between 8 - 12 years old maybe.\" You decide to check your position in the room, you seem to be underneath an old desk table, as there is a wooden stool just to the side of you. You notice that the desk and stool, as well as the giant bed (located to your left) and the wardrobe (to your right) all seem to be made out of a similar wood make. Your nose then picks up the overpowered scent of apples, its not an unpleasant scent by any means, but still draws your attention to it. You believe that you may be in some sort of apple farm, and this is the bedroom of the families child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are about to start moving, you hear the growing sounds of something thumping along the floor outside of the room, as you peek your head out to see the door more clearly, the door knob turns, and is swung open rather quickly. 'BANG' is heard throughout the room, as the door slams against the wall, and a absolutely giant creature enters the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis creature appears to be human in shape, apart from 2 factors, the first being most prominent, it is covered by yellow fur, apart from its hair, which is a bold red colour. And the second is it's nose, or lack of for that matter, as it appears to have more of an equine snout than anything else. She (going off of her looks) is currently wearing a bright red tee-shirt, with light blue denim overalls, and some old cowboy boots as well. You suddenly feel extremely nervous and afraid, as you notice this pony like being throw her backpack onto the bed, and start to walk over toward the desk, and YOU!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAfter a long, hard day of school, Applebloom finally makes it to her bedroom, kicking the door open, she throws her school bag onto her bed, something she does by habit at this point, and makes her way towards her old desk. Pulling the stool out a little and siting down, a very audible creaking sound can be heard throughout the room. She swings her legs under the desk, and starts to work on some homework. <span class=\"clred\">\"Gosh darn et, why must I complete mah homework now? Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo are off playin.\"<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nApplebloom starts to take off her old boots, whilst trying to study maths, as she removes them, the air is filled with a very pungent scent, one that the young child is more than accustom too due to her working with her family, playing with her friends, and just being a very overly active child anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\nDown below, you notice the young girl sit down, and complain about having to do homework, and this makes you recall all them times you had complained about it. You was deep in thought, when suddenly  your nose was attacked by probably one of the worse scents you had ever encountered. Covering your nose with both hands, and tears forming in your eyes, you look towards the giant girls giant feet pop out of her shoes. You can easily see the sweat build up under her soles, and even see some get flicked onto the floor in front of you as she wiggles her toes, probably for the first time since putting the boots on. As she sets her toes down onto the floor, one of the boots falls onto its side, which results in a very loud 'THUD'. From where you are standing, you can see quite clearly the inside of this boot, and can see the constant use has left its mark, but the smell is so strong, that your mind starts to break slightly, almost wanting to get closer and see more, experience more of the interior of the boot itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst you have to cover your nose, you would like to get some help, as you do not know if there is some reason you are so small in the first place, so hopeful this little girl can take you  to an adult who could possibly help you. But the only option infront of you are somewhat limited. With your mind starting to break from the extreme odour from the boot, you have to make up your mind fast.</span></div></div>",

With your mouth agape, you could only stare in awe at the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe definitely wasn't human, though she resembled one. At least her face was roughly the same shape as a human's, though the prominent (yet graceful) snout didn't fit the picture. And you couldn't spot more than the usual two arms and legs a human would have on her, though you couldn't tell what exactly the thick blanket covering the giantess' body was hiding.<br>\r\nThat was where the similarities ended and the differences became all the more prominent. For one, the enormous flood of hair that sprouted from the giantess' head was enthralling and couldn't be natural. In a multitude of brilliant colours, it flowed down her shoulders, sprawling out on the bed. You couldn't help but think that you could easily lose yourself within those thick strands if you weren't careful.<br>\r\nNext, a massive horn spiraled out of her forehead, towering over you. It was at least twice your size and ended in a sharp point. Gulping, you made a mental note not to get too close to this particular appendage.<br>\r\nThe enormous pair of wings growing out of the giantess' back was the final difference. You didn't even question their presence or functionality. Nothing of this made sense...<br>\r\nYou had never seen anything like this. As far as you knew, something this size shouldn't be able to exist at all! Such a titan violated multiple laws of physics. Yet, the giantess didn't care, staunchly defying her own impossibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soft snores shook you out of your paralysis and your senses returned. The shock at the sight of the gargantuan woman faded somewhat, and a sliver of your earlier eagerness crawled back into your mind. Wasn't this exactly what you had wanted? It hadn't even been a minute and you had already discovered a completely new life form! And if something like this was possible, you couldn't even imagine what the rest of this world was like!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you tried to get back to your feet, but you stumbled. The ground wasn't exactly solid. With every shift of your weight the ground shifted as well. In fact, your feet were sinking into it!<br>\r\nIt took only a moment to realize what was happening. You looked up at the sleeping giantess' face and with a little visualization you realized exactly where you were standing. A hot blush erupted on your face. Of course it would be hard to get up if you were standing on the soft flesh of this creature's breasts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, after a few tries you finally managed to stand up. And you realized that you hadn't exactly planned far ahead. What would you do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking first contact with the giantess was the first thing that jumped into your mind. But as exciting as that seemed, you doubted that you could even wake her. At least not from where you were standing. You'd have to climb up all the way to her face if you wanted to get a chance of her noticing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was all assuming that she would even be friendly, once she woke. Her imperious size made you think twice about whether you wanted to surprise her by waking her up. The alternative was to try and wait until she woke up herself, preferably while you were not standing right on her chest. Then you could observe and make a more informed decision, but it would require you to make your way down the bed, a climb that you were not sure you'd be able to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you decided to... </span></div></div>",

Risking your neck by climbing the massive furniture only to wait for hours until the giantess woke by herself? If it even would happen that quickly. Judging by her size she might sleep for years... And exploring a world where you were nothing more than a speck wasn't a good idea either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo first contact it was! Excitement bubbled up within you. Even if you were afraid, you couldn't deny that being in your position - a tiny explorer in a vast, alien world - was the best thing that ever happened to you. Only meeting a fantastic creature like this up close could top that.<br>\r\nOf course, you needed to get to her face first, which was a good idea anyway. You didn't want her to find you walking over her breasts, in any case. So you made your way forward, careful not to lose your footing as you climbed over the vast hills of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rhythmic snores made your trek quite more adventurous than you had liked. More than once you had to grab onto her fur to avoid sliding into her cleavage, though a small voice in the back of your mind was very insistent that you do just that. Shaking your head, you freed yourself from its niggling whispers. You had better things to do than indulging in your desires.<br>\r\nSliding down the side of her right breast, you fell onto the giantess collarbone. Thankfully, a thick strand of her enormous hair was nearby and you could continue your climb towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got closer, her breath started to wash over you. It almost blew you off her hair, but thankfully it was thick enough that you could dig yourself in, shielding you from the tumultuous winds of her exhalations. Still, it slowed your progress even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your efforts didn't go unrewarded. Soon you were met by the shape of her ear, poking out under her glamorous mane. This was your chance to wake her up.<br>\r\nGetting closer, you steadied yourself. Was this a good idea? Doubts crawled into your mind... but you dismissed them. You had already come up here and you wouldn't let the strain be wasted by backing out now.<br>\r\nWith a final breath, you called into the cavernous ear...</span></div></div>",

Judging from how you would react to a bug fluttering in your eye, it most certainly wouldn't end well for you. Her mouth was of course also out of the question. You didn't want your journey to another world to end by being swallowed by a titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left you with little options, and your legs were already aching just from the trek up here. Trying to get somewhere else on this titanous body would be utterly exhausting.<br>\r\nAt least, the strand of hair you were resting on was soft to give you a brief reprieve. Maybe you could rest here for a bit until you regained your energy. Yes... that sounded good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, you settled yourself into the soft mane, letting out a content sigh. The hair beneath you was incredibly soft, but for someone at your size it was still a serviceable mattress. It didn't take too long for your eyelids to become heavy... and you had to fight to not fall asleep. You only wanted a little bit of rest, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as you got comfortable, you could hear the giantess mumble something... and your stomach lurched as her head started to turn.<br>\r\nThere was never enough  time for you to react, as the enormous woman turned her head to the side, settling for a more comfortable position. Her movement was over in an instant. For you, it was as if the earth itself had shifted. Your soft bedding of hair suddenly shifted upwards ever so slightly, the surface becoming vertical. Desperately, you grabbed for something to stop yourself from tumbling downwards and missed her hair by a millimeter. Closing your hand around nothing, the world slowed to a crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid down the smooth strand of hair, gaining speed until you once more collided with the giantess's collarbone. The impact made your head ring but it didn't stop your momentum from carrying you even further. Rolling over the enormous body, you were filled with relief that at least you weren't heading anywhere really dangerous.<br>\r\nFinally, you came to a stop as your minuscule self slid in between the enormous mounds of the giantess's chest. A sigh of frustration escaped you. This was where your journey had begun, and now you were already back here as if you'd never left. Well, with one difference:<br>\r\nThe weight of the gargantuan hills encasing you softly pressed down on your body. There was barely any room in between. The gargantuan woman's breasts were large enough that even lying down, they pressed into each other. And you were wedged right in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it would not be impossible to escape this predicament. Even though it felt like you were buried underneath a mountain, you could push yourself forward through the mass of flesh resting atop of you. It would be slow and exhausting, but you could manage to free yourself of this prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where would you go afterwards? You were already exhausted and you doubted you'd have much energy after climbing out of the giantess's cleavage. Would it be a good idea to waste all your energy right now? Or could you turn this situation to your advantage? The heavy breasts surrounding you felt like the softest bed imaginable, pressing down on you like a weighted blanket. You were sure that you could fall asleep in here in no time.<br>\r\nOn the other hand, what would happen if the giantess woke before you? Would she even notice you? If she didn't would it be a good idea to make her notice you in here? Like before, you doubted she more pleased at finding a bug like you between her breasts, rather than in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still... you could risk it right now. Maybe, if you used your energy, you could finally make her wake up. Her breasts should be sensitive enough to make her feel you, right? Still, you would take a whole load of risks by doing that. She might not even wake up, leaving you exhausted. Or you might anger a creature a thousand times larger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

Instead, you could feel yourself being barely held in position as they drooped down beside you. Thankfully, they were large enough to still pin you in place, but you could feel gravity trying to pull you downwards.<br>\r\nBut another layer had been added to your prison. An enormous sheath of bright orange fabric had been stretched over the giantess's breasts, covering them from prying eyes. A dress, or a bra perhaps. No matter what it was, it completely sealed you into her cleavage, the only way out being above you. You'd have to climb her breasts for a chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you started to try though, everything bounced. The mountainous mounds beside you jumped upward, pulling you with them... and slammed down all the more forcefully, pushing you deeper into the giantess's cleavage.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You settled back into the warm embrace of the twin mountains beside you. A barrage of thoughts ran through your head. <i>Princess?</i> Your situation had just gotten worse by magnitudes. Of course, it wouldn't make much difference what position the gigantic creature held. If she found you, you were at her mercy no matter what. But her being a monarch... stifled your hopes of being received warmly, should she find you. After all, nobles of any kind were notorious for being proud, rich, and easily insulted. And your current location probably violated multiple laws of etiquette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant that moving right now was probably the worst idea you could have. No, better to wait until the giantess rested once more. Then, when she was asleep, you could safely escape... hopefully. Spending the day in her cleavage would hopefully let you rest enough to regain your strength. Maybe then you could finally fight through the tons of flesh resting on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of footfalls grew steadily louder as more and more people entered the room. Even though you could barely see through the fabric sealing you in, you realized that this 'Daycourt' had to be pretty popular. Soon, countless shadows danced across the fabric, each one belonging to one of the many petitioners, seeking the princess. From your angle, it looked as if you were looking down upon them. Either this princess was especially tall, even for her own species... or her seat was elevated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the rustle of paper (or was it parchment?) nearby, and Miss Inkwell cleared her throat.<br>\r\n\"The first noble received by her royal highness, Princess Celestia, will be... one Sapphire Ridge! Please, step forward!\"<br>\r\nOne of the many shadows came closer, bowing before the gargantuan princess.<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for receiving me! I've come with a petition.\" You cringed slightly as you heard the nasal voice. Something was oddly familiar about it... you almost felt as if confronted by a snooty customer demanding a refund.<br>\r\n\"As you know, my mining operation has long since supplied Canterlot with the most beautiful gems in all of Equestria. Now, we have discovered a very promising location, near the city of Manehattan, but...\" the owner of the unpleasant voice sighed with annoyance, \"the mayor has been rather difficult. I've tried every amenable solution, yet she still refuses. So therefore, I petition you, Princess Celestia, to settle this dispute! My business cannot run smoothly, if at every step bureaucracy gets in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tuned out for the rest of her diatribe, fed up with the self righteous tone she was taking. But the response the princess would give was much more interesting to you. She was utterly still, breathing calmly. Every so often, she nodded her head, affirming that she was listening.<br>\r\nYou knew from the quick conversation before that she was used to talking with these nobles, but you were still amazed at her patience. You had expected her to quickly shut down this noble, to remind them of her position. Wasn't that what a princess would do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hear your petitioned,\" the princess responded after the noble had finally finished her rant. Her voice was just as melodious as before, though not lacking in firmness and determination.<br>\r\n\"Yet, we cannot allow you to mine in your preferred area. The mayor of Manehattan is in the right. She is the authority over the usage of land within her city, therefore, if you have no proof that she is misusing her power, you have no case. However, there are large deposits of gems much more easily accessible. I'm sure your operation will see no decline.\"<br>\r\n\"Those mines are plagued with those gem gobbling mutts!\" The noble answered with a sneer, \"Do you really expect us to...\"<br>\r\n\"My word is final.\" As she spoke those words, a power suddenly radiated from the princess... and you knew in your bones that her words carried absolute authority. As did the noble.<br>\r\n\"Of course, your highness,\" she squeaked. \"We will find another place to mine, and will not bother the mayor anymore.\"<br>\r\nThe shadow of the noble bowed repeatedly, as she backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in awe. This giantess seemed kind and gracious... but held an iron hand on her rule, it seemed. How quickly she shut down the argumentative petitioner made you shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day dragged on. Noble after noble appeared before the princess. Most of their requests were pointless and quickly dismissed. Some sought retribution for perceived wrongs they had suffered. Some, just as the first, tried to get the princess to sign of on some ludicrously dangerous business idea. Only a few had legitimate concerns, and you could positively feel the princess' smile widening when one of them came forward. To the rest of the room, she probably seemed just as neutral as before, but the way her breathing changed and her body relaxed, you could tell that she was enjoying solving those problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, most of the politics didn't make sense to you, leading you to just lay back, letting yourself be hugged between the giantess' enormous breasts. It wasn't so bad, as long as she wasn't moving. Like two massive pillows, her bosom flowed around you, making you feel as if lying on a cloud. Your eyelids became heavy... and soon, you were fading in and out of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with that, the Daycourt is dismissed. Every pony that hasn't yet had the chance to petition the princess, please leave your name with the receptionists. You will be received tomorrow.\"<br>\r\nMiss Inkwell's voice shook you awake. The collected nobles groaned, clearly annoyed that they hadn't gotten a chance to bring their requests forward. None of them argued it, though. Instead, the shuffle of countless feet made the last flakes of sleep fall of you, and you were wide awake once more. Your strength had returned and your muscles weren't aching as much anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess let out a sigh once the last nobles disappeared through the throne room's doors.<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n\"Today was... difficult, wasn't it?\" you heard Miss Inkwell ask, tentatively. \"Usually, they are a bit more restrained.\"<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I've had a few hundred years of practice dealing with them.\" She sighed again. \"I just hope they aren't bothering Luna too much. She has yet to adjust to these times... and I'm afraid she is going to explode if they come to her like that.\"<br>\r\nMiss Inkwell winced slightly. \"I'm afraid... that may have already happened. At least, the Nightcourt's document show her threatening to 'send all of you to the moon, should I be bothered with one more inane petition.'\"<br>\r\nYour world shifted, as the princess leaned forward, rubbing her face.<br>\r\n\"Then I guess I should talk with her...\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm, if you don't mind...\" Miss Inkwell stammered, \"I think there is a bit more on your plate, still, princess.\" With another rustle, she pulled out what you recognized like a scroll. \"The Gala is tonight... I think you should get ready. The courts tailors have made a selection of dresses for you to try, and it would be a shame should their work go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep sigh escape your gargantuan captor. For a moment, she was quiet, thinking about what she should do...</span></div></div>",

And please, tell Luna to get ready as well. She will be expected to participate, even if she hates it just as much as me.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, princess!\" Raven bowed, \"Your bath will be ready in just a moment!\" With another bow, she turned and rushed to a side room, leaving Celestia on her throne. The princess let out a deep sigh, once more shaking your world.<br>\r\n\"I really should make a decree outlawing this inane Gala. And one to send my past self to the sun. What was I thinking...\" With another sigh, she stood up. Gravity took hold of you, and you desperately grabbed onto her fur as to not slide even deeper. \"But a bath sounds just like what I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the world once again began to quake in time with her footfalls, you searched your mind for a plan. The princess bathing could be a chance for you to escape unnoticed, if you only could get out of her clothes. You might not know where you'd end up... but better than to be caught on her once she disrobed.<br>\r\nStill, for now you could only hold on for dear life as the massive breasts beat down on you from all side, slowly pushing you deeper and deeper, ready to smother you underneath their colossal weight. It took all your strength to simply stay in place as with every step, your world rose and fell with unimaginable force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately felt when the giantess entered the bath. The heat surrounding you became so much stronger as steam wafted towards your colossal captor. You could feel tiny droplets of water roll down on you between her fur. Apparently, she liked her bath hot.<br>\r\nHer whole posture relaxed, as Celestia entered into her own private bath chamber. No one would bother her here. A small refuge from her responsibilities. The bath itself was a giant pool, build into the floor. It was lined with marble tiles, golden lining between. Additionally, there was a sauna, a place she loved dearly and usually spent some time in before going to sleep. Then, there was a massage table. Something she needed every so often... and she had personally chosen the few of her servants that were skilled enough to work the stress of centuries out of her.<br>\r\nShe strolled towards the massive vanity table, a rack for her clothes nearby. She sat down. Sighed. And started to unzip her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the pressure on you let up as the princess disrobed. As the large sheet of orange and gold fabric fell away, you could finally see the outside world again, though only barely. Her chest still took up most of your vision. Still, you realized she was sitting in front of a mirror - and could even see yourself! Barely noticeable, her breasts were pushed apart by a minuscule bump... your tiny head, poking forward.<br>\r\nA thick, orange bra held up the gargantuan bosom of the princess, something you had to be thankful for. If she hadn't been wearing one, you could only imagine that her breasts would have crushed you to nothing but paste after only a few steps. But now, that safety was going away. You could see the snow white princess reach one of her slender arms behind herself - and with a click, the support vanished.<br>\r\nYour hands dug into her fur as her bra fell away. Her breasts lowered, though only slightly. They were still large enough to push together, even without the piece of underwear, but now, a small crevasse had formed underneath you. One that you could easily fall through. Underneath, you saw her pillar like thighs, pushed together tightly. Her thumbs hooked into the waistband of her golden panties, ready to pull them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might be your chance! If you let go now, you would simply fall onto her soft thighs. They would easily break your fall! Then, all you had to do was to get down from the giantess and find a safe place somewhere in the bath. As tiny as you were, squeezing under the door would still be impossible. You would simply have to wait until the princess left, and get out while the door was open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... maybe this wasn't a good idea, after all. The room was hot. Hotter than any bath you'd ever taken. Steam rose into the air and flowed around you. You couldn't imagine how hot the floor had to be... and the fact that the princess was walking on bare feet didn't particularly reassure you. She was the one who was bathing in nearly boiling water.<br>\r\nBut, if you didn't let go, she would be taking you with her, wherever she was planning on going. You might be fine in the pool, but the sauna? The massage table? Your chances would be much lower, should she decide to use those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... maybe it was finally time to make yourself noticed. This situation seemed nearly inescapable. Either you'd run the risk of being smothered under the giantess, or cooked in the steaming water, the hot floor, or at worst, the sauna. Even if she was angry, at least you had a chance to not die in this bath.</span></div></div>",

She wore a professional-looking uniform with the pictogram of a peach and a stylized hammer ironed onto it. The cart she wheeled contained a number of bottles containing various fragrant oils, combs, brushes, files, and other tools that oddly reminded you of a horse grooming kit you saw on the internet once.  Beside that was a mysterious series of lumps that you couldn't identify covered by a white cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare pushed the cart over to where the princess stood and then gave a small bow which caused the princess.to beam in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness, it's so good to see you again. What is it that you require of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Peachy Pummel, just the mare I wanted to see,\" Celestia stated fondly, \"I'm to go to the Gala tonight and if I'm going to be put on display for the masses I figured that might as well look my best, so I'm in need of your magic touch to ensure that I don't become fatigued during the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peachy\", who knew all too well how much her princess despised going to the Gala, nodded and pointed at the table, \"Alright, your highness, I'm going to need you to lie on the table while I get things prepared for you. May I ask which side part of your body you would like to focus on first?\"</span></div></div>",

Why don't you take them on, first?\" Celestia said. With a sigh, she stretched her arms and back, her spine popping audibly. You could barely hold on to her fur as she let herself fall onto the massage table. You had bigger things to worry about, anyway. A back massage? That meant that she would be lying down... on top of you!<br>\r\nBut there was no way for you to escape. The giantess already shifted in her position, turning side wards until you could see the head of the massage table, a thick pillow at the top for propping up her head. All you could do was pray to whatever deity might have been listening that you would survive what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thunderous clap, Celestia lay down, her breasts squishing together underneath her. From all sides, the flesh encroached upon you, surrounding you and sealing you in completely. The weight of her full upper body rested on top of you, while she obliviously put her head down, a blissful smile on her face. You opened your mouth for an involuntary scream... but your voice was cut off as the mass of fur and boobflesh forced itself into your mouth. You couldn't even move. The pressure was so strong, that her tits pinned you completely.<br>\r\nThankfully, her fur was light enough that you could still breathe through your nose. But otherwise, you were utterly at her mercy. You could only hope that this massage wouldn't take too long, lest her breasts squeeze you into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeachy Pummel, as oblivious to you as the princess, opened the first of many bottles and let a thick, warm balm flow onto her hands, smelling of citrus fruits. She coated her hands in it and got to work. As soon as her hands dug into Celestia's back, the princess let out a moan of delight. A slight smile formed on the masseuse mare's lips. She was one of the very few ponies the princess trusted enough to let this close to her. An honor that she savoured.<br>\r\nWith practiced movements, Peachy worked out many of the knots in Celestia's back muscles, the princess descending into blissful sighs as her aches melted away. Soon, she worked her way up to her impressive wings. Those required extra attention. With a small, special brush, she preened each feather individually. After a long day at court, Celestia's wings were always a bit messy, and she loved the feeling of having their natural beauty restored.<br>\r\nFinally, Peachy moved on to her upper back and shoulders. The last few knots would quickly be worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for you, it was as if the entire world had changed once the masseuse laid her hands onto Celestia's upper back. She massaged the princess with such force and intensity, that you could feel the circular motions of her hands even within your prison. It didn't help that the princess shifted ever so slightly whenever Peachy Pummel focused on a different spot.<br>\r\nThe gargantuan mountains imprisoning you shifted with her, flowing over you and pushing you helplessly around. The enormous breasts made you their unwitting - and unnoticed - plaything. With each shift, you were pushed lower and lower, more of the unimaginable weight of the princess settling on top of you. Your body was getting a merciless massage of its very own, the soft flesh of her chest caressing you all over.<br>\r\nDespite yourself, you couldn't help but moan. The pressure was immense, but the feeling of your skin against hers was indescribable. Her luxurious fur tickled you all over, the walls of her breasts squeezed and squished around you. A blush crept on to your face. If she discovered you in this state, there would be no way you could talk your way out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how long you were stuck in there. Time ceased to have meaning as you were relentlessly milked by Celestia's massive mammaries. But at some point, the pressure let up. The massage was over... and Celestia rose.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't get a grip, every time you grasped at the brilliant white hair, another shattering bounce tossed you around. Every step the giantess took felt like an earthquake, her breasts rising and collapsing on top of you, pummeling you mercilessly.<br>\r\nAnd now, that you weren't able to hold on anymore, you were completely at the mercy of her enormous mounds. With every bounce, you could feel yourself sliding deeper and deeper into the giantess' bosom. The deeper you went, the tighter the space around you became. You had already seen how huge her chest was, but being buried underneath its weight only served to hammer the point home. Soon, you couldn't move anymore. The gargantuan mountains of flesh sealed you between them, softly flowing over your body until you were trapped in a you-shaped dent in her breasts. Your whole body was perfectly encased within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you couldn't rest. It had only taken a couple of steps for you to be swallowed into her cleavage, and the giantess wasn't slowing down. And now, trapped within the deepest spot of her chest, the weight a top of you felt, as if a mountain had collapsed upon you. Even though you weren't tossed around like a ragdoll anymore, you still felt the heaviness of her chest fall onto you every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though you were exhausted beyond belief, you couldn't really complain. In fact, after the ache in your muscles dulled a bit, you realized just how tightly you were being hugged by the massive mounds. It felt... good.<br>\r\nA hot blush crept over your face. The biggest breasts you had ever seen were massaging you from all sides... and who knew, how long this would continue.<br>\r\nCould you simply stay here? Enjoy this feeling and bother with escaping later? Surely, the giantess would either notice you at some point - or go back to bed. Then, you could get back to exploring this world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuriously, you shook your head - at least as much as the walls of flesh allowed you to - and banished the thought. Not only was it your goal to see as much of this world as possible, but staying here was also highly inappropriate. You couldn't give in to your lower desires... or you might risk insulting these titans. A prospect that didn't seem very favourable to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that posed the question of how to get out. As tightly as you were wedged in the giantess' cleavage, climbing upwards was out of the question. There was simply no way of fighting the enormous weight of her breasts, as well as gravity. But maybe you could push yourself deeper... at some point, you might fall out and into her dress. Then you could find another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand... you could still try to get her to notice you. Which was probably a bad idea. Even though you weren't familiar with there kind, you doubted that the giantess would fish you out of her cleavage while in public. But the odds of her believing that your presence between her breasts was merely an accident were getting smaller with every moment you stayed here. You should get it over with... or she might become really angry...</span></div></div>",

The way she looked at you, she seemed bemused, but also... something else. A strange emotion glinted in her gigantic eyes, one that you couldn't quite read. But whatever it was, it sent shivers down your spine.<br>\r\nStill... at least she didn't squish you on the spot. And she didn't seem angry at all. That was a start. Maybe you could explain all this to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you stammered, heart racing, \"I didn't mean to end up... there. I didn't mean to spy on you or 'court' you...\"<br>\r\nThe giantess laughed. Though soft and melodious, her giggles rolled over you like thunder. Instinctively, your grip on her finger tightened, to not be blown away by her breath.<br>\r\n\"No need to apologize, little one. I certainly understand the desire of anyone to get this close to me.\" She looked down herself, a large smile spreading across her face. \"Not everyone is blessed with a figure like I am. So you don't need to lie. Many have tried more brazen things to get where you were... though, I do prefer to know when someone tries.\" Her eyes fell onto you again, the strange glint even more pronounced. \"When, pray tell, did you get there?\"<br>\r\nYou waved your hands as well as you could, trying to deny it. \"You've got it all wrong, I tell you! I didn't even want to be there! It was an accident!\"<br>\r\n\"You hurt me, little one,\" the massive woman said, mock hurt in her voice, \"so you mean to tell me that my bosom doesn't interest you at all? And that staying inside was all an accident? Truly, your words sting.\"<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean it like that!\" you shouted. What was happening. Was she upset? Was she not?<br>\r\n\"Ah, just as I thought. Just to shy to admit to his own desires,\" she laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired of being toyed with, you raised your voice as much as you could.<br>\r\n\"No! I didn't want to insult you, but I really got there by accident! Please, listen to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, I just want to have a bit of fun... my position doesn't lend me much of that.\"<br>\r\nQuickly, the giantess turned her head, and when she saw no one nearby, she hurried into a small side chamber. It was stuffy, and clearly not used much. A study room, perhaps, that had long since been abandoned by its students. She walked forward, wrapping her fingers around you until she reached the tall, wooden desk. Gently, she placed you down.<br>\r\nYou tumbled out of her palm and scrambled to your feet. A massive shadow fell over you. Looking up, you saw the enormous form of the giantess, her face smiling down at you with that same unreadable look in her eyes. She had pulled up a chair, sat down, and leaned over you. Her head rested on her hands, her elbows propped like marble pillars next to you. And there, in the center between  the desk and her face, loomed her enormous chest, wrapped in a tight, orange and golden dress. You gulped. Even now, after having been trapped inside, it seemed impossibly large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now tell me, little one,\" the giantess said, her tone soothing, though still bemused, \"how did you end up between my breasts?\"<br>\r\nYou told her everything. The portal. Your desire to explore another world. How you landed on top of her sleeping form and tried to get to her face to wake her up. How a tiny movement of hers had sent you tumbling down into her cleavage. And the rest. During your tale, you noticed how her face became flushed. A look of excitement came over her face, when you mentioned scaling her. It only got stronger as you told her how you got trapped and carried between her breasts.<br>\r\n\"And now we're here, I guess,\" you trailed off. Tentatively, you looked up at the giantess, waiting for some kind of reaction. She still smiled at you, though her eyes were glassy, as if she was only half listening, half thinking about something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she snatched you up once more, holding you infront of her face.<br>\r\n\"Curious. I cannot say that I have ever heard such a tale before... though I can think of a few suspects in this world who could arrange such a thing. We will find out the reason, I'm sure. For now, though...\" the giantess stood back up, \"I'll have to get back to my day. The court won't hold itself, and the nobles are so impatient.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you stammered, \"Court? Nobles?\"<br>\r\n\"Why, yes, little one,\" she giggled, \"It seems I have forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Princess Celestia, one of two rulers of Equestria, as well as the sun itself.\"<br>\r\nYour mind started racing. She was royalty? And still, she just... accepted your intrusion. At least, it seemed so.<br>\r\nCelestia laughed at your stunned expression. \"Why don't I introduce myself later, once the day is over. It looks like you need to calm down, little one. Fear not, you will have enough time to relax...\"</span></div></div>",

She hadn't been lying. It was indeed more spacious than you had thought. Still, it was a cage. A golden one, but barren of any amenity. There was no seat. No pillow. Nothing to spend the time with. And you would probably have to wait until the enormous woman decided to let you leave it again.<br>\r\nBut you were far to tired to put up a fight. Even if you weren't you doubted you'd manage to get away from this giantess, since apparently she wasn't only magnitudes larger than you but also possessed the ability to transform ordinary objects with a mere thought. You shivered. Her being able to do actual magic was probably the most worrying thing. Was there any chance you could even assert yourself against her will, should it come to that? Or had you inadvertently stumbled into an inescapable situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door of the cage shut behind you once Celestia pushed you inside. A faint click told you it wouldn't open again anytime soon.<br>\r\n\"Very good. Thank you for complying.\" The giantess lifted the golden cage and for a moment, everything blurred as you rushed through the air. Only when you dangled in front of her face, the shapes around you came into focus again. Her enormous eyes pierced through you, still regarding you with the strange mixture of amusement and curiousity.<br>\r\n\"Now, it will be a long day, little one. But I'm certain, you will enjoy your time with me. Since you have been so eager to explore my body before...\" she giggled, \"I think you can spend some more time in this valley of mine.\"<br>\r\nThe princess glanced down at her own cleavage, a sly smile curling her lips. A terrible premonition made your stomach sink into your knees. At this moment, you realized to things. First, that she very much enjoyed having you this close to her. And second, that her enjoyment came first - your wishes, second.<br>\r\n\"Some even would say that you are on your way to paradise,\" Celestia laughed again, \"or at least, the closest thing to it on Equis. Well. Be nice, little one. I will get back to you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the cage plummeted downward. Vertigo overcame you as the world blurred once more... only the enormous valley of her cleavage remaining inexplicably in your focus. As if time had slowed down, you could feel yourself get closer, inch by inch. Her bosom was ready to swallow you up. And there was nothing, you could do to stop it.<br>\r\nWith a soft bounce, the cage landed on Celestia's right breast. You were thrown around inside as the impact flung you around, and you smashed against the golden bars keeping you imprisoned. Above you, the giantess clasped the golden chain together behind her neck. With a smile, she looked down at you once more.<br>\r\n\"Oh... no I can't have you there. That looks silly.\"<br>\r\nA shadow engulfed you as her enormous finger rose above the cage. With gentle prodding, she pushed you forward, ever closer to that massive cliff. You simply lay there, trying your best not to have one of your arms caught outside. What could you even do, but accept it? For now, she ruled your life completely.<br>\r\nWith one final push, Celestia brought the cage towards her cleavage. It poked out, slightly. Her breasts were far to large to simply let it fall between. So, with her finger she pushed down on it, letting her gargantuan bosom engulf you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you were again surrounded by the gigantic white walls. It seemed you had made exactly zero progress since you arrived last night. And now, the princess was aware of you - and seemingly entirely intent on keeping you right where you were. If you stayed like this, there was no way you'd ever get to explore this world... or return home, for that matter.<br>\r\nSighing, you got up. Your muscles still ached from your involuntary ride between Celestia's breasts. If there was one thing better about being caged, it was that you were at least not constantly battered by the white mountains next to you. Instead, every step of the titanous princess only made you bounce slightly upward, the flesh flowing around you, bulging through the bars. On all sides, her breasts encroached on you. Threatening to swallow you once more, should you dare leave the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you couldn't just accept being trapped like this, could you? Not only would it take away your chance to explore this world, but your freedom altogether! And becoming a toy to this giantess was the last thing you had planned when you went through the portal. Sure, you knew it could be dangerous. But that didn't mean you had to just give up.<br>\r\nYou tested the bars. Each of them was solid gold, and much to heavy to pry them apart without tools. The lock however, seemed fairly simple. Maybe you could actually get it open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then what? The only thing that would change would be that you were once more at the mercy of these massive mounds. Maybe you could hope to slip underneath, but that would probably leave you exhausted.<br>\r\nMaybe it would be better to just wait. Regain your strength. The princess didn't seem entirely heartless. Maybe you could reason with her later. Or at least escape once she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to make a choice... and much of it was out of your control. Would you try to escape? Or stay in your cage?</span></div></div>",

From your freely swinging cage, you could look out into the world and see quite a lot of what Celestia herself is seeing, provided the furry bulge of boobflesh doesn't happen to get in the way, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about 3 to 4 hours, give or take, the princess simply sat motionlessly in her throne and received pensioners much in the same way a medieval king or queen would <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither individuals or those in groups would come to seek an audience with the princess and bring forth complaints, disputes, or problems for the princess to hear and offer her wisdom and guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of them the princess clearly genuinely enjoyed, as you could hear her heart rate and breathing slow as she leaned back into her throne<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether good or bad each and every one of them provided valuable insight into the society, technology, and inner workings of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Equestrian society was still somewhat in the pre-industrial, pre- mass manufacturing days with a few odd modern ideas peeking their heads above the clouds. For example, you heard tell of the wireless telegraph having been recently invented, trains carrying freight running on tracks spanning the width and breadth of the country and frontier towns far to the south which basically amounted to the wild west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was magic, <i>magic</i> of all things! While it's true that you witnessed Celestia casting a spell earlier that didn't prepare you for just how far down the rabbit hole you'd truly fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, in coming here you had fallen down the drain of the fantasy kitchen sink, as you heard mention of several mythical creatures that humans have only ever dreamed of griffins, hippogriffs, minotaurs, honest-to-god <i>dragons</i>, and all manner of other fantastic creatures existed here and all had societies and customs of their own, which absolutely blew your mind upon hearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was mention of magical pests like parasprites, who reproduce asexually and will eat through all of the crops like a swarm of locusts and multiply endlessly or wood-boring spark beetles, which produce just like the name implies, bore into the wood of houses and produce little sparks and arcs of electricity that become a fire hazard if left unchecked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, hanging around Celestia (pun not intended) provided you with much more information than you ever could've gathered on your own.<br>\r\nEven though she had basically forced you in here it was clear that she was a kind and just ruler who cared deeply about the well-being of her subjects and this softened your opinion of her somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the stream of ponies flowing into the throne room slowed to a trickle until there were only a few petitioners left. After Celestia helped them and sent them on their way Celestia slumped back into her throne while a nearby crier announced that the time for audiences was now closed until lunch convenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia begrudgingly lifted herself from the gilded seat and stretched out her tired, stiff limbs, then proceeded to exit the throne room and walked down a corridor until she reached a door with a yellow and orange sun emblazoned on it,  and then stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gripped onto the bars of your gilded cage as it swung wildly, moving to and fro as Celestia unclasped the necklace and held it up to her snout, allowing you to once again to look into the antiquarian pink eyes of your royal captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gently, Celestia lowered you downwards until the cage landed on the giant, brown desk below with a soft clink. Something in front of you clicked. The lock turned.<br>\r\n\"Come out now, little one. I believe we have a lot to talk about,\" her melodious voice rang in your ears. Your legs were shaking. She hadn't seemed to concernd about you before, but you had seen how she treated what must have been her subjects. In the courtroom, she was nothing but gentle and kind. Maybe you were in luck... and your involuntary stay inside her cleavage had just been an exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward slowly, pushing against the cage's door. It swung open without a sound. As you got out, you immediately felt the shadow above you and looked up. There, princess Celestia's smiling face loomed over you, her eyes half-lidded and filled with curiousity. Even now, you couldn't escape her breasts. Like mountains, they protruded from her chest, hovering over you, threatening to bury you once more. You gulped. There was nothing you could do but hope that you were right in your assessment of the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now first, why don't you introduce yourself, little one. You already know who I am, yet I'm left to wonder about your identity.\"<br>\r\nCelestia's amusement with you hadn't faded. She almost sang the words as she stared down at you, taking your tiny form in. Suddenly, you felt very naked under her gaze. It was, as if those pink eyes could pierce through your skin and peer into your very soul. There was nothing you could hide from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... my name is Jack,\" you stammered.<br>\r\n\"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Jack,\" Celestia giggled. She held out one of her fingers towards you, almost poking you in your chest. Stumbling backwards to evade the colossal digit, you look up at her.<br>\r\n\"Oh? Is it not customary in your world to shake hands?\" the princess laughed again. Clearly, she was enjoying toying with you like this. Still, you didn't want to risk insulting her. Getting back on your feet, you approached the massive finger and put one of your hands on it. You doubted she even felt it. But her smile got even wider.<br>\r\n\"Great, little one. Now we are officially introduced.\"<br>\r\nHer finger wandered upwards, brushing against you and over your head, were she patted you softly. But she underestimated the sheer difference in power between you two. One simple pat on your head was enough to send you to your knees. It didn't hurt, but your legs simply gave out. Instinct, you guessed.<br>\r\nA soft chuckle escaped the princess. \"I'm sorry, Jack. I didn't mean to push you around like this... and I think I've toyed enough with you for now.\" She withdrew her hand, and leaned down further. Her face filled the sky above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you've told me you were from another world? How very interesting. I know of some portals, but never have I seen someone like you before. What are you?\"<br>\r\n\"I am a human,\" you stuttered. Being this close to her face only hammered the point of how small you were home. Like this, you were barely bigger than one of her eyes. One inch, maybe one and a half, at most. You couldn't help but shiver at the sight of the titaness above you.<br>\r\n\"A human... I can't say I've heard the word before. Tell me, where do you hail from? What is your world like?\"<br>\r\n\"That's kind of a big question,\" you said.<br>\r\n\"Do not worry. We have time. The day is long this time of year, and I won't have to set the sun for another few hours yet.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" You took a deep breath, ready to launch into an explanation of Earth, when your mind just stopped. Did you hear her correctly? <i>She</i> needed to set the sun?<br>\r\nAnother laugh above you shook you out of your stunned trance.<br>\r\n\"I have told you before, haven't I? I am one of two rulers of this land, and the princess of the sun itself. Which means, that star is under my control. Together with my sister Luna, I guide the firmament, and decide when the day is done and when night begins. The celestial bodies bow before our magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you were utterly stunned. That couldn't be possible, right? The sun... it was so utterly massive, nothing could control it. She might as well have told you she had created the sun herself. Equally impossible.<br>\r\nBut only impossible in your world, you had to remind yourself. Clearly, different laws ruled this universe. And apparently, Celestia was their enforcer. If it was even possible, this revelation made you feel even smaller than before. You were standing before what could only adequately be described as a goddess. One that was very interested in you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can show you later, little one, if you still doubt my words. However, I did ask you a question. Please, tell me about your own world.\"<br>\r\nNow, shaken out of your reverie, you began your tale. Of course, you couldn't fit the entirety of world history into your explanation. So you settled for contemporary things. Your modern life. The state of the world. Technology. The usual worries of an everyday person, such as you.<br>\r\nEvery now and again, Celestia would interject, asking you about seemingly innocuous points. Her questions were sometimes small, sometimes large. How far advanced was technology on earth? What did humans do for fun? What mode of government was most prominent in the world? What was the sweetest thing you'd ever eaten?<br>\r\nThe questions bounced back and forth between serious and almost inane. But you felt that she genuinely was interested in your world, and, by proxy, you, which made conversing with her much easier. She had also refrained from poking you again, which was a plus, though her bosom still hung ominously over you. But after a while, you didn't fear it as much anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed. Your throat was absolutely dry. How long had you been speaking for? With a start, you realized the light outside had gotten much dimmer. Dusk was approaching.<br>\r\n\"Oh, forgive me, little one,\" Celestia said, \"you must be parched. Here, drink something.\" With a flash, a miniature carafe appeared next to you, floating in mid air. At this point, it didn't even surprise you, anymore. You simply nodded thankfully up to her and helped yourself to it. The water inside was delicious... the freshest you had ever tasted. It rejuvenated your body, soothed your sore throat. After only a few gulps, you felt as if you had just woken up!<br>\r\n\"Please, continue, little one,\" the princess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you did. For hours, you told her about your world, barely scratching the surface, while she listened and occasionally asked her questions. The day dragged on. Soon, the horizon turned red as the sun slowly set behind it. But in that state of dusk, it remained. You didn't notice at first, but at some point, it simply didn't get darker.<br>\r\nThen, Celestia rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for telling me about your world, little one. I'm sure there is much more you haven't yet had the chance to touch on. But we should continue this conversation another time... for now, I have to set the sun.\"<br>\r\nShe held out her palm towards you. For a moment you hesitated.<br>\r\n\"I can show you, if you want. Didn't you say you wanted to explore another world? I doubt you'll find much that compares to this.\"<br>\r\nTentatively, you stepped forward. The last few hours had definitely helped mend your trust to the gargantuan princess, but you still weren't entirely sure she wouldn't stuff you back into her clothes. Still, there was barely a choice. And if she had planned to return you into her cleavage, there was nothing you could do about it anyway.<br>\r\nAfter you had settled down, Celestia carefully carried you in her open palm. She went through an innocuous door at the side of her chamber and climbed up a massive spiral staircase, until she reached the very top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but gasp. Before you, a massive marble city stretched out in all directions, bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun. The houses were absolutely beautiful, white with golden tops. Furthermore, it was built into a mountain, perched above the surrounding lands. There was little you could make out with your own eyes... but you could see the blurry shapes of towns and cities, forests and mountain ranges at the horizon. Celestia's giggle shook her hand and you fell to your knees.<br>\r\n\"Beautiful, isn't it? Well, just you wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Celestia's body vibrated and a shiver ran down your spine. You felt as if high voltage electricity was flowing around you, just barely missing your body. The air around you became ripe with energy. The intensity was staggering. All your limbs went numb and could only stare in hapless awe at the giantess holding you, as her horn was engulfed in a golden glow... the glow of the sun itself.<br>\r\nMoments later, the horizon dimmed, softly shifting from its burning red to a gentle blue. Stars littered the sky. And as you turned, the silver disk of a massive moon slowly crept over the horizon, ready to begin its own journey across the firmament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how was that, little one?\" Celestia asked, not bothering to hide the pride in her voice. But there was nothing you could say. How would you even describe this display of power. You could only continue to stare at the princess, her bemused eyes looking at you. She chuckled.<br>\r\n\"I guess I overdid it. I am kind of a braggart, in some regards. Still, I hope you enjoyed the sight. Now that it is night, why don't we rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia strolled down the staircase, humming to herself, while you slowly regained your faculties. You couldn't decide, whether you were the luckiest person in the universe, or absolutely doomed to have appeared in the room of such a powerful being.<br>\r\nBut for now, it was Celestia, who decided your fate. And she already had plans on how you would spend your first night in Equestria...</span></div></div>",

The look in her eyes made you shiver once more, her wonder replaced by a primal hunger.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I know the perfect place for a tiny little thing like you. The safest in all of Equestria...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her hand down her body, pushing you under her enormous, thick blanket. First you thought that she would stuff you back into her bra, but then you went past it. For a moment you wondered where you would end up. Than, a horrifying realization struck you as you wandered past her belly button. There was only one place left, after all. You craned your neck, trying to see your destination.<br>\r\nCelestia was already pulling the waistband of her bright orange panties upward, making a cavernous entrance just for you. Instinctively, you fought against her pillar like fingers, but there was no escape from her fist. Without hesitation, she carried you past the waistband, reaching deep into her own underwear. Finally, she let you fall onto the thin, overstretched strip of fabric that went between her legs - and terror filled you as you saw her massive womanhood loom over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, little human. Do not worry. Nothing will harm you in there,\" Celestia said, another yawn erupting on her face. \"Sleep well. You will need all the rest you can get. Though,\" she snickered, \"if you would like to... thank me for keeping you save, I wouldn't say know to a tiny, little massage.\" You could almost hear the suggestive wink she wanted to give you. Your whole body froze up. What was she saying? Did she really want you to... touch her there?<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted as she let go of the waistband, and the fabric snapped back, carrying you upwards and right into her flesh.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, that's good, little human,\" the princess moaned above you. You must have hit a sensitive spot. \"Don't hold back now. I could use a little something to fall asleep. But I understand if you're too tired,\" she yawned again, \"because so am I. See you tomorrow, tiny human...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost didn't hear her last words as you couldn't believe what had just happened to you. This literal goddess had just casually stuffed you into her underwear. And asked you to pleasure her.<br>\r\nEven though the powerful scent emanating from her made your head swim, you knew this wouldn't be a good idea. Hell, just her pushing her thighs together might end you. Getting a titan like this horny would be a death sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... maybe this was the best and easiest way to get into her good graces. She had certainly already taken a liking to you. If you survived this, maybe she would even grant you some privileges. Like not being constantly confined by her. Of course it was a risk, but so was staying still. Maybe she had just posed it as an option, when in reality it had been a demand. You didn't know the rules of this land. But was it a good idea to defy its ruler?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was, of course, also the most rational idea: wait till she fell asleep and escape this crazy titan. The last thing you needed was for this goddess to start seeing you as a sex toy! If she did, you'd probably never leave her sight ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some deliberation, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

As if you had never exhausted yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes and gasped as you saw the bright stars shining above you. The sky was a perfect night blue, lit by millions of little lights. It looked like one of those pictures, taken on a Caribbean isle where no one lived. You could see constellations you'd never seen before and so much more. Even what looked to be a nebula was visible to your naked eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat there in awe, you didn't notice the sky slowly shifting, the stars drifting to the side. Until they appeared.<br>\r\nTwo absolutely massive eyes appeared in front of you as the sky fell away to reveal the gigantic face of another of those massive creatures.<br>\r\nTerror filled you as you saw the gargantuan pupils focus on you. Whatever you had imagined it to feel like for the giantess to find you, you couldn't have imagined the primal fear of being in front of a creature this powerful. You curled up, hoping against hope that if you just made yourself small enough, the giantess would lose interest in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that didn't happen, and dread rose in your stomach as you could feel the massive being get closer to you. A wave of air washed over you as the creature exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how did you get here...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire body froze as you heard the angelic voice ring out. It wasn't as deafening as you had believed it. In fact, it was downright pleasant. Beautiful, even! Slowly, you turned, seeing that the giantess was looking at you with a mix of curiosity and pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a strange creature. I wonder if Celestia would know about it,\" the giantess mumbled, more to herself than to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you broke out of your stupor. What were you doing? This being was obviously intelligent, not to mention caring! This was your opportunity to make contact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut should you? By the way she was looking at you, she didn't seem to think you could understand her. How would she react if she found out you were, in fact, intelligent? Old horror stories, of government scientists dissecting a strange new thing, came unbidden to your mind. Maybe it was best to just play the fool for now...</span></div></div>",

I have never seen a creature of you like before, not in my many years of living. Since we're in the midst of introducing ourselves, you may call me Luna. I am the mistress of the night, the realm of dreams is my dominion over which I have absolute control, and I wield that power to ensure that my subjects receive a restful night's sleep.  You can imagine my surprise and shock when I sensed something new entering from the Aether. Tell me, Anon, from what land do you hail?\"<br>\r\nThat was going to be a difficult question to answer. Would she believe that a mystical portal appeared in your living room and you threw yourself in on a whim?<br>\r\nWell... Honesty was the best policy, and you had a feeling that she would be able to tell if you're lying. \"Well... Miss Luna... would you believe that I come from another world? There was a portal that suddenly appeared in my room and things led to another I came forth into it and landed someone sleeping.\" You gulped a bit nervous but remained even, You continue. \"I went to her head to wake her up and get her attention but was futile and...\" The last part was a bit hard, it would involve the fact you climbed into her exposed cleavage and currently asleep nestled in it.<br>\r\n\"I...see.,\" she said slowly while nodding her head, \"The initial jump was intentional, where you ended up was where the misstep occurred.

Ket's just say I'm sort of stuck in a sensitive situation, and in trying to get out I exhausted myself and that's where I fell asleep,\" you confessed sheepishly.<br>\r\nLuna's normally calm gaze instantly took on an air of deep concern. \"Oh my! Are you quite alright? You're not hurt, are you?\"<br>\r\nYou rapidly shook your head and waved your hands. \"Oh, no no no. Believe me, I'm somewhere very soft and very safe.

Do not worry, little human, she is by far wiser than even I. If there is one person on Equus, that would know how to find a way home for you, it would be her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chewed over what Luna had just said. A way home? Already? Not that your exploration had gone swimmingly so far, but you somehow doubted that another extra planar portal would manifest itself in your room anytime soon. This was probably your one and only chance to explore this world.<br>\r\nBut having some of these giantesses looking out for you would certainly make this expedition into the unknown a lot easier. Especially Luna. Even though you had only seen one other member of her species so far, she had an extraordinary sense of power about her. 'Mistress of the night' she had called herself. <br>\r\nYou gulped. Had you by accident encountered the royalty of this strange land? The way she spoke of this 'Celestia' only made you more nervous. If even Luna, a being powerful enough to rule over the land of dreams, would adhere to this person, you could only imagine how powerful she must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. What were you worried about? Luna had been nothing but kind, so far, and having her and her sister on your side would surely only help you. Besides, you had to return to your own life at some point, didn't you? It would be a shame to want to return, only to find that there was no way back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up at Luna, you realized she seemed just as deep in thought as you. Her eyes were slightly unfocused, as if she was staring at something behind you. Worried, you cleared your throat. \"Uhm... Luna?\"<br>\r\nThe giantess broke out of her trance as soon as you spoke, returning her gaze towards you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, my apologies, human! I was simply telling my sister of your arrival. She is looking forward to meeting you!\"<br>\r\n\"Great...\" you mumbled. Of course, you were thankful, but your nervousness still lingered. The prospect of meeting with this Celestia outside of the safety of this dreamland loomed ominously over you.<br>\r\n\"But... how will I find her? I don't really know where I am... at least not exactly. And I doubt the things I do know would be helpful...\" you trailed off. You thought better than to tell Luna the fact that you were sleeping in someone's cleavage. There was no need for anyone to know that.<br>\r\n\"Oh, its very simple!\" Luna said, smiling down at you, \"You said that you had appeared near someone?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you answered, glad that she apparently hadn't noticed your embarrassment, \"There is another one of your kind sleeping nearby.\"<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Then all you need to do, is to get their attention. Do not be afraid, Equestria's inhabitants are perfectly kind. You do not have to fear danger from them. Simply tell the pony you have encountered that you need to reach Canterlot and talk with the princesses! They will certainly bring you to us.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Of course, you would first have to explain your position to the 'pony' in who's cleavage you were currently encased. Even though Luna seemed confident that you had nothing to fear, you couldn't imagine that this giantess would simply let you get away with that. Hopefully you would have the chance to sneak out, once you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, little human, I sadly must return to my duties,\" Luna said suddenly, \"But I'm glad that we have met! I am looking forward to meeting you in the waking world, soon!\" With that, she pushed herself upwards, rising to her full height above you. You stumbled backwards. You had thought that you had gotten used to her massive height during your conversation, but... it still took you off guard.<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah,\" you stammered, \"Hopefully I'll meet you and Celestia soon... if I can reach the pony...\"<br>\r\n\"Very well. If you wish, I can return to you tomorrow night - and you can tell me if you have any difficulties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. Luna gave you one last smile. Then, she opened her wings and with a mighty flap, she shot into the night sky above you. The ripple of the air she so casually displaced sent you flying, tumbling into... nothing. The world you had been in faded and you could feel yourself fall back into a restful sleep as you were once again submerged into the familiar darkness...</span></div></div>",

This creature seems to be sleeping rather peacefully for the time being, which would make traversing around easier on your part. When looking at the face of the creature, you notice that there isn't a nose similar to that of a humans, but a slightly curved snout, you can only link this to a pony of horse back home. While it is dark in this place, you can just make out a slight horn protruding the top of this pony-thing's forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom simply looking at this creatures giant, yet soft looking face, you quickly come to the fact that you are currently standing on top off one of it's boobs. With a slight yelp from yourself, you slip slightly and fall onto your backside, your whole body slightly sinking into the big mound of flesh beneath you. You quickly look towards the owner of this breast, thankfully finding it still slightly snoring away, completely oblivious to your current situation. Putting the facts that A: you're currently sitting on top of this individuals boob, and B: the face looks rather soft and has no sharp edges, you come to the conclusion that you are on top of a gigantic girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you gather your bearings, you can't help but notice a number of new senses entering your system. All you can currently see is that of the giant girls face that is far off into the distance, and the breast you are currently sitting on top off. You hear the soft snoring that escapes the giant lips, as well as the gentle beating of her heartbeat from beneath you. Your can feel the soft fur touching your hands, and the natural body heat warming your very body up. And finally, you can smell a very powerful yet feminine scent of lavender enter your nose, however strong it is, it's not over-powering to the point of sickening, it seems to be the perfect balance to sooth someone to sleep. Talking about sleep,<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTaking in all this new information, the fact that it is clearly the middle of the night, and all your senses combining together the warmth, the scent, the gentle heart beats and soft snoring, you start to feel extremely tired all off a sudden, as in all the days events having caught up to you. However, you still hold onto the fact that you are somewhere you do not recognise, sitting on top of a giant pony female's breast, and not forgetting that you are incredibly tiny at the moment.

The walls almost seemed to be untreated, as if you were in a gigantic tree. Shelves, books bursting out of them, lined the walls. In the corner was a large, impressive telescope propped up next to the window. Moonlight brightened the darkness, shining inside in thick rays. A massive, oaken door was at the far side of the room and you could barely make out the small gap between it and the floor. You might be able to squeeze through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could reach any of that, you would first have to traverse the lavender expanse stretching out before you. You looked up to the strange creatures face, softly snoring away. Its massive size made you shiver.

Worse, you somehow doubted that she would react calmly if she suddenly found you skittering across her body.<br>\r\nMaybe you could wake her up later, once you weren't in such a delicate position.

Your eyes fell on the small gap near her neck... and moved upwards to her sleeping face.<br>\r\nMaybe you should abandon your plan of hiding out? Running around here was already proving very dangerous. If all it took to pulverize you was a simple shift in position by this sleeping titan, maybe exploring alone wasn't the best idea.

Making the giantess notice you could lead to her either mistaking you for a bug, or bringing you to a dissection table. You had read enough stories about aliens to know that that was probably only a trope... but it had its roots somewhere, didn't it.<br>\r\nBut leaving her unaware of you carried the obvious risk of her simply crushing you without ever noticing.

It wasn't as bad as when you were on the massive breast of the creature, but still, it made your progress harder.<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of arduous travel, you were exhausted. But you had finally reached her collarbone. Her arm was outstretched and rested under her pillow, revealing her armpit. The smell of lavender got slightly more pronounced the closer you came to her body and here it mixed with something else... sweat, probably. Not much, but enough to be noticeable.<br>\r\nYou shook your head, deciding to focus on the task at hand. First, you needed to get up there, then you could make a decision on how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing fistfuls of purple fur, you slowly pushed yourself upwards. Scaling the colossus proved to be much easier than you had assumed. She lay there, still except for her breathing. The rise and fall of her chest was the only hindrance as her fur kept stretching away from you with every inhale. But soon, you dragged yourself over the edge, tumbling down on her collarbone.<br>\r\nPanting, you looked around. Before you lay the titaness, fast asleep. The blanket was tightly wrapped around her, but you could see the small entrance above her chest much better now. Her breasts were so large, that they pushed the blanket upwards, allowing you to pass inside. You blushed. Was this a good idea? If she found you in there, who knew what she might do to you. On the other hand, these massive pillows would certainly protect you, should she shift once more.<br>\r\nYou turned and looked up at the giantess' sleeping face. It wouldn't be too hard to climb up there and try to wake her. But that would open the pandora's box of the massive creature actually knowing you existed. Were you willing to risk that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA decision needed to be made...</span></div></div>",

As you climb on top of the now discarded blanket, you can still feel the warmth radiating off of it from its recent usage. As you make your way towards the edge of the bed, you suddenly hear the giantess behind start slightly murmuring to herself <span class=\"cviolet\">\"go..t.to....finis...h..th....a..t..re..port\" </span> , you sigh as she appears to just be sleep talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to descend down the blanket, the cool air rushing through your hair, you suddenly start to miss the warmth from this sleeping titan. But you have to plan your next steps very carefully, so you just ignore the chill for now. As you slide from the bottom of the blanket out onto the cold wooden floor, you hear a rustle from behind you, as you slowly turn, you see the giant simply turning over in her sleep, but taking the blanket back up with her. You are now stranded on the hard, cold floor of this giants bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where you stand, you can see some discarded, what appear to be slippers near the bed base. These will surely keep you warm during this cold night, and will almost certainly be comfortable to sleep in, but these will also have obvious risks attached to them as well.

Of course you could sleep in one of the corners, but you doubted you would rest well on the cold, wooden floor. Getting out of the room might have been possible, but for you the simple trek from the foot of the bed to the door would probably take an hour, if not more. All in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, these slippers would have to do. The risk was obvious to you, but surely you would wake as soon as the giantess started to move around. Even down here you could still here her snores reverberating throughout the room. You could only imagine the sound a single one of her footfalls might make. Yes, that was probably right. Even if it was risky, there was no way you'd miss having the giantess wake up. A being as titanic as this one couldn't move silently, at least not to something as tiny as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those slippers did look mighty comfortable. A yawn suddenly broke across your face. Climbing the titaness and down her bed had left you exhausted. The adrenaline of being transported to another world was already fading, as well. Not that you weren't excited anymore, but your body's strength was sapped. Seeing this massive creature had briefly activated your most inner instincts - fight or flight - and now your muscles ached. Sleep would be welcome.<br>\r\nDecisively, you grabbed onto the fluffy exterior and pulled yourself upwards. Compared to the difficulty of walking on the giantess and her bed, this was a cakewalk. With a few grabs and pushes, you soon reached the gaping entrance into the slipper. As you thought, the inside was even softer, lined with lavender tinted cotton. The same, pleasant smell from before wafted towards you, though slightly stronger. It surrounded you as you stepped deeper into the massive shoe, but still, it was better than you imagined inside.<br>\r\nYou walked forwards until you reached the tip of the slipper. The massive dome fused to the sole without so much as a seam. Everywhere around you was the soft cotton and you got more tired by the second. Finally, you let yourself simply fall to the ground. The material caressed your skin. It was better than any bed you had ever slept in. With heavy eyelids, you yawned one last time, before you drifted off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

You started to get pulled back into conscious by what sounded like a distance, thunderous yawn, seemingly getting closer and louder as the dream world faded away. Once you awake, you start to stretch your body as you normally would once you wake up. After a well needed stretch, you start to open your eyes, your vision is still a bit blurry, so it was hard to focus on anything in particular. All you can see is lavender, all around you, the floor, the walls, the ceiling, all of it. As you focus on clearing your eyes, the smell starts to get you back to your senses, the strong lavender scent you inhaled last night, this brought all of last nights events rushing back to your mind. The lavender giantess, the blanket slide, and finally your decision to sleep in the giant slipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you realise this, you hear the giant bed springs creaking above the slipper roof, followed by a pair of giant \u2018BOOMS!!\u2019, your body then acts as on its own, you need to get out of her slipper and gain her attention, before anything problematic happens. You start to run towards the opening of the footwear, you feet sinking slightly into the vast insole, the air becoming more and more fresher the closer to the exit you are. As you get towards the only exit of this self made prison, you look up in freight, as your view is dominated by the massive lavender sole of the giants foot, your mind screams for you to start moving, however your body is too shocked to even move a muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are pushed down onto your back, as the giant gently lowers her foot onto your tiny body and pushes you deep into the insole of her shoe, you can feel the massive foot pressing into the front of your body. The slipper had cooled down during the night, which almost makes the giant, fleshy soles warmth inviting, the scent of lavender having magnified 10 fold. However there is too much fear going through your entire body right now as old.the pressure building as you\u2019re pushed into the insole and her sole. This is how you die? crushed to death by an unaware giant purple pony, who simply put on her slipper after waking up. You can feel the girl has finished putting on her footwear, you can hear the gigantic toes smash against the tip of the shoe above you, so you can only assume you are roughly under the ball of her foot, suddenly, you start to feel the immense weight that bares down upon you start to get heavier. The giant pony is standing up. You can only think of 1 things to do at this moment in time?</span></div></div>",

No, getting her attention was the last thing you needed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach dropped as the massive creature took her first step. Suddenly, all the weight lifted off of you and you soared through the air. The pressure faded. Greedily, you sucked in the air, its lavender scent making your eyes water. Down here, under her foot, it was so much stronger than before...<br>\r\nThe relief came to a crushing end as her foot connected with the ground again. Your eardrums rang from the explosive impact a single step of her made. Thankfully, the slippers muffled the noise somewhat. Otherwise, you might have gone deaf right here. However, you couldn't really appreciate this small blessing, as the ball of her foot ground you even deeper into the sole, making your muscles scream with panic. A moment later, you were soaring again... and the next step was even more brutal. You gritted your teeth. All you could do was hope that your body didn't break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, completely unaware, descended the spiral stair case of her house-library hybrid. Spike, her little dragon companion, was already up and as usual, had taken care of breakfast.

Just as she sat down at the table, he turned, two plates stacked with pancakes, a fat helping of syrup on both of them. At last, you had a break from her apocalyptic foot steps. Even though you had somehow gotten pushed further ahead, now only a few millimeters separating you from her toes, you basked in the relative calm. At least, nothing was broken...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! You're planning on something big, Spike?\" Twilight blanched at the sheer amount of food before her.<br>\r\n\"You're asking me?\" The little dragon raised an eyebrow at her, giving her a questioning look. A chill ran through Twilight. Even you, buried underneath her sole, could feel the shiver.<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you forgot...\" Spike said, a worried tone creeping into his voice. Twilight thought for a second. Then, a smile erupted over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I didn't forget...\"</span></div></div>",

However this soon changed though as her foot shifted from its position, and suddenly slammed back down, violently crushing your body and winding you. This definitely hurt, but thankfully you still didn't suffer any serious injury as this giantess started walking, each step from the foot you where under was painful for you and knocked the air from your lungs, and the only chance you had to breath was when she moved her weight off of you, causing you to gasp for breath each time she lifted her foot, the air was even thicker then before and you could taste Twilights sweat, which was incredibly salty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight climbed back up the stairs to get ready, she started to get changed from her sleeping attire to the clothes she would wear today, which consisted of a dark purple blouse, and a simple pair or jeans.

Even though the scent of her sweat was all permeating, it was good to get something at least resembling fresh air. However, your joy at this didn't last long as you realized something very important: The slipper had fallen away. But you were not in it. With horror, you realized that you had somehow become stuck to the gargantuan woman's foot. Desperately, you tried to fight your body free. You couldn't just stay here! It was a miracle that she hadn't stomped you to bits already. If you remained here, it was only a matter of time until you were nothing but paste. <br>\r\nBut it was no use. No matter how much you struggled to break free, the collected sweat as well as the pressure had firmly wedged you into the giantess' sole. Your arms were stuck in a crease of flesh where the ball of her foot flowed into the sole itself. The thick liquid of her sweat glued your legs to her as well. There was no escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlank horror filled you as you saw the gargantuan, white sock approaching! The fabric was thick. Cotton, probably. No matter what it was, getting stuck inside was not something you wanted to experience. You redoubled your efforts of escape, but soon became exhausted. After being stepped on for the last minutes, your muscles were screaming and you felt as if you hadn't rested at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing you could do, except stare on in terror as the giantess stuffed her toes into the sock and slowly pulled it upwards. The fabric rolled over you, sealing you in completely and mercilessly. It only took a moment for the giantess to engulf you completely. Your breathing became short as it trapped you once more with the musty scent of the massive creature's sweat. The hint of lavender didn't help much, anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar weight settled on top of you and everything got even tighter. You could barely see through the thick wool of the sock, but you believed to spy a large, yellow shape, a hole at the top. A sneaker. Of course. Your torment wouldn't be complete without being stuck in her shoe, as well.<br>\r\nThe giantess quickly slipped the sneakers on and you were once more pressed into a sole. This one didn't have the soft interior of the last, instead you were pressed into hard and unforgiving canvas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight suddenly intensified a hundred fold as the titaness rose, settling all of her body weight on to her feet. Your head was mercilessly pushed down into the sole. How was it possible that you were still alive? Had your body somehow gotten more durable in this world?<br>\r\nWhatever had happened, your nerves were certainly still the same. Your body was already sore from getting stuck in her slippers, but now the giantess had a spring in her step, as well. Every single footfall crushed the air out of you... and you could only guess how long you'd be stuck inside. From what you had heard, she was planning to help a friend. And she seemed intent on walking there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to do something! If this went on, you could kiss your life goodbye. Though you had miraculously survived thus far, you doubted your luck would last much longer.<br>\r\nIt didn't matter now, whether the giantess would be angry at your presence. You needed her to notice you if you wanted to stay alive. With the rest of your strength you wiggled and struggled. You could only hope her sole was sensitive enough that she would feel you...</span></div></div>",

As she made her way towards the edge of the town square, She noticed the time on the clock tower, \"<span class=\"cviolet\">10:18! Oh no I'm going to be late! I need get a move on!</span>\". As she went to take off in a sprint however, she noticed that sweat had already started to accumulate in her shoes, \"<span class=\"cviolet\">Urg, I knew I shouldn't have worn these shoes</span>\" With a slight stomp, she burst forward, running towards her friends cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though everything was muffled deep under her weight, you could still somewhat hear her talk to other people, other ponies? as they went about their morning. You struggled with all your might, but it just didn't seem to be enough to gain the giantess's attention to your situation. Desperately trying to be discovered, your clenched your eyes shut, waited for the next step, and once this girl had raised her foot off the ground, your tiny tongue left your lips, stroking against her soft fur, which was starting to form little beads of sweat. It tasted just like it smelt, an over powering taste of salty lavender enters your system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lap at her foot every time she raises her foot, until suddenly you hear \"<span class=\"cviolet\"><b>Urg.

Wait, you seem to be raised in the air for a much shorter time now, and each step seems heavier... Your face pales at the realisation, she has just started to run. You can feel the heat start to increase with every pounding step, you try to lick her sole again, but needing to breath came first, and by the time you had sucked in all the air you could, it would be forced out of your lungs by this girl. </span></div></div>",

As this purple giantess continues to stand and wait, you cannot help but wonder how you are still alive, has you body got more durable? to a point where immense weight cannot crush you into a pulp. This question rings in your mind until you hear a muffled conversation from up above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Of course. Please come in and make your self at home\"</span>. Said a very muffled, soft sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this, you began to raise again, the feeling of weightlessness becoming more and more familiar to you now, and you braced your body, gritted your teeth, then \"BOOM!\" and hundreds, if not thousands of tons land upon your tiny frame, as \"Twilight\" as this pony has been called, continues to walk into a new environment you have yet to see. You can tell, even in your current situation, that this Twilight is walking with a bit more of an exhausted manner, the step is more ... well heavy than before. You can tell she isn't running anymore, but you imagine more of a 'tired' walk, where someone would ensure their footing more than a normal everyday walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight walked across Fluttershy's front room, and taking a seat on one of her couches. Her body sinking into the cushion a little,  while she rests her aching feet on her heels, <br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Thanks Fluttershy, that run has really exhausted me.\"</span> Twilight explained as she let her body rest.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Ummm. Why didn't you simply teleport here? If you don't mind me asking that is...\"</span> Asked Fluttershy, shrinking away behind her hair as she finishes her question.<br>\r\nTwilight simply stared at her friend, completely baffled as to why didn't she simply teleport here. \"<span class=\"cviolet\">Urgh, I don't really know, I guess I didn't think about it all that much back then\"</span> Twilight then realises that her friend is starting to get nervous due to her explanation. \"<span class=\"cviolet\">Oh nononono please don't worry about it Fluttershy, my feet are alittle sore from all the running, but thats just because i'm not used to it is all. Just let me rest a little before we start tending to your animals.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Fluttershy perked up for 2 reasons, 1) Her friend was currently aching, and she has just the lotion for that, and 2) her animal friends can finally be helped all at once. <span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Oh, well if you don't mind, I have some lotion I use on my feet when they are feeling sore from all the walking I do sometimes. You can use some, but only if you want to that is\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh yes please Fluttershy, I would greatly appreciate that, I will be in the bathroom, just leave the lotion outside the door for me okay?\"</span> Twilight excitedly told her friend, for she had heard of Fluttershy's home made recipes for this kind of stuff, and couldn't wait to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then made her way towards the bathroom, thinking about how nice it would be to finally get these shoes and socks off, and air her poor tired feet a little. She proceeds to sit down on the edge of the bath, remove her shoes and socks, letting out a sigh of relieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't notice, was that your tiny form was currently...</span></div></div>",

It takes a good hour of steady climbing to reach the floor, having to use different climbing techniques along the way down. As you land on the floor, you look towards your possible options, the slippers are closer, and you can guaranty their softness from just looking at them, but they come with obvious risks.

There certainly were more unpleasant ends than being smashed to paste underneath a giantess' breasts, but you were still very much attached to your life. There also didn't seem to be much else that could make for either a hiding place or bed. The room was sparse, very sparse. Its only decoration were a large, wooden closet which, judging by the splinters might have been a hundred years old, and a thin carpet. Not exactly luxury places. Not to mention that getting down from here only opened the risk of getting stepped on, later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, there was only one thing to do. And that was to wake the sleeping titan up. A strange mixture of giddiness and fear filled you. It was time to meet the inhabitants of this strange new world! Not in a way you had planned, but still, it was a thing no one had ever experienced before you. Right now, you were making history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, for that you first had to actually wake the giantess, and you doubted she'd be much pleased if she found you between her massive breasts. You didn't want to look like a pervert on your first impression, anyway. So there wasn't much of a choice of where to go. Her face was the only place where you had a good chance of her actually feeling you. And though you had to scale her chin to get anywhere, it was preferable to anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you walked forward - and immediately stumbled. Your foot sunk into the soft flesh of the massive creature's breast, causing you to loose your balance. With a small scream, you rolled forward, holding your arms to your head in the hopes of protecting it from the impact. In the end, it was much less dramatic than you had thought. Your fall was more of a harmless bounce down her chest. The soft flesh gave in at the slightest pressure and it felt more like falling onto a sporting mattress than anything else.<br>\r\nRegaining your bearings, you stood up. At least the first part of your journey was already over - you had landed on her collarbone, right in front of her throat and chin. Thankfully, their was a very good way up to her face. A strand of her voluminous sandy blonde mane had fallen on her shoulder. The hairs were thick, and as sturdy as a steel wire to you.<br>\r\nYou approached and grabbed one of the many hairs. It felt smooth, though tiny ridges were scattered all over it. Perfect. You could use these as climbing aids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your whole body, you hugged the strand of hair and slowly pulled yourself forward. While you climbed the enormous creature, her breath washed over you every so often. While you had to hold on tightly every time she exhaled, you couldn't help but notice that, like the rest of her, her breath held the faint smell of apples.<br>\r\nFinally, you got close enough that you could step on to her face. The ground was more stable here, though you still had difficulty holding your balance. The hard bones underneath provided solid ground, but the thin layer of skin and flesh above was not as safe. You had to make your way slowly.<br>\r\nStill, with determination, you approached her heavy eyelids. You could see the massive orbs underneath flick too and fro. The giantess was dreaming. Taking one last deep breath, you knelt down in front of her right eye lid. The thick, black hair of her eyelashes were almost as long as your forearm. This would be an ordeal.<br>\r\nYou dug your tiny hands into the space between her upper and lower eyelids and pushed, forcing the skin open. Now, you could only hope that this would actually wake her.</span></div></div>",

A smudge against the furniture, crushed like a fly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. It seemed like luck was on your side! As you got closer, you saw that the closet door was open. Though it was just a little gap, the giantess had hit a one-in-a-million shot. You were flying right towards it! Though it was dark, you could see that it was filled with clothes, all messily thrown together. There didn't seem to be a system, just a pile of garments. Most of them were plaid shirts in various colours, though red featured prominently. A large hat hung in the back. A few pairs of jeans and shorts lay at the top, as well as multiple pairs of... the giantess' underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have time to take the whole scene in. With a yelp, you landed in that massive pile of clothes. The giantess had thrown you with such force that you didn't merely bounce off it, though. Instead, your velocity carried you deep into it, pushing multiple entangled pieces of clothing out of the way. Finally, you came to a stop. The musty scent of sweat and earth surrounded you from all sides. Clearly, these clothes had seen their fair share of work.<br>\r\nBut buried underneath the mountain of clothes, no light reached your eyes. You couldn't even tell which way you needed to go to escape! Not that you even had the energy to move the gargantuan garments. No, there was little you could do. The throw had sapped your strength. Every bone in your body screamed at you to just pass out. With a sigh, you resigned yourself to your fate. At least for now, you needed to rest... maybe tomorrow, you could escape the clothes and finally explore this world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke when two twin explosions rang through the room. At first, you were confused and panicked at the massive pile of fabric smothering you. Then you remembered where you were... and dread filled you.<br>\r\nA tiny beam of light pierced the mountain of clothes through a minuscule gap you hadn't seen in the night before. But what you saw through it made you shiver. The giantess was stood over you, eyeing the pile of her clothes. Her hair was still messy. She had just gotten out of bed. And now, she was searching for something to wear for the day.<br>\r\nCarelessly, she pushed her hands into the pile, grabbing whatever took her fancy. In an instant, the floor gave out under you. Reflexes kicked in before you could think. Your fingers dug into the fabric being pulled out from under you. And instantly, you realized your mistake as you sailed through the air, grabbing hold of a piece of clothing the titanous woman was intent on wearing.
