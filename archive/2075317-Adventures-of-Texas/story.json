At the moment, the town appeared to be perfectly at peace, with nothing breaching the blissful peace save for the gentle twittering of birds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this distance, and looking at this serene picture, it would be impossible to tell that this small town was the battleground for a long and hard-fought war. The area in and around Gold Springs was a breeding ground for bandits and thieves, lead by a corrupt and greedy mayor. There was just one obstacles standing in the way of their complete control of the town, and that was the forces of the law, namely Sheriff Texas and her deputy, April, who fought hard to restore the town to its former glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs life started to stir around the town, it was time for the sheriff and her deputy to get to work. And who knows what the day would bring...?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the day was getting complicated. Roxxie was her oldest and most hated enemy, an eight-foot tall kangaroo bandit who was constantly accompanied by her massive, smelly horse, Butterscotch. Texas had gone head-to-head with her more times than she could count, and win or lose, Roxxie was always a tough foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then. Ah know where her old hideouts are, an' she's a creature of habit. I'll check them out one by one until ah find that varmint.\" Texas said, standing up and grabbing her revolver from the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, there's one other thing, Tex... They're moving a shipment of gold out of town today by coach... If there's any target she'll go after, it's that... So, where do you think she'll be? Her hideout, or the coach?\"</span></div></div>",

Behind her, April sighed worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do, sheriff... Stay safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Texas arrived at the outskirts of Roxxie's hideout, a large, battered shack with an even larger barn nearby, meant to be a stable for Butterscotch. Looking around, the weasel could see the telltale signs of lights in the windows, as well as exceptionally large hoofprints leading to the stables, each one as big as her torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Roxxie in the shack, Butterscotch in the stables.\" She muttered to herself, dismounting and starting to creep forwards, planning out her approach.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortune favours the bold, and Texas had beaten Roxxie many times before. She would make this quick and brutal. The weasel sheriff ran up to the door, then booted it open with a heavy kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FREEZE, YA VARMIN-\" She paused as her mind briefly registered the kangeroo gut in front of her, before it slammed into her a split second later with the force of a mule kick, sending her flying backwards into the hard dirt. The weasel slammed down with a grunt, her gun bouncing out of her hand and stars spinning around her head. However, she was just lucid enough to see the grinning kangeroo crouch down, then launch herself into the air with her powerful legs. As Texas watched in a dazed horror, Roxxie sailed through the air and curled herself into a cannonball, her massive butt aimed at Texas with pinpoint accuracy. The last thing the sheriff saw was the giant roo rump filling up her entire vision before-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQUISH!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie snorted with laughter as she ground her butt down on her most hated enemy, enjoying the delicious squelching and crunching noises as she reduced Texas's body to a pathetic pancake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, you're just in time, Tex.\" She snorted with malicious glee. \"I was just thinking how hard Butterscotch's saddle is on my ass, but now I have a nice, soft, weasel-fur cushion!\" Underneath her, Texas screamed and protested, but was quickly silenced by Roxxie clenching her ass cheeks together, squishing the weasel even further, before getting up and walking to the stables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, the bandit wasted no time in grabbing her large leather saddle and saddling up her beloved Butterscotch, making sure to grind her sweaty cheeks together as much as possible during the process. When the massive mare was finally saddled up, Roxxie reached back and peeled the squashed sheriff out of her ass, grinning as she hung limply in her grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure to take the long route, just for you.\" Roxxie said with a grin. Texas barely managed to summon the energy for a weak mewling whimper before Roxxie slapped her down onto the saddle, which was big enough to fit the entire sheriff's body with room to spare, and mounted up, her fat kangaroo butt slamming down on Texas once again. Butterscotch whinnied in delight at the situation as Roxxie urged her forwards out of the stables, the constant motion of the horse causing the sheriff to be constantly ground flatter and flatter by the bandit's butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot today, huh, sheriff? My butt's gonna be getting real swampy, real quick. But I'm sure you can soak that up for me. After all, you've got nothing better to do for the rest of the day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long time later, as the sun was beginning to sink below the horizen, Roxxie slowly rode back into her hideout. It had been one of her most successful heists ever, having ended up with two saddlebags filled to the brim with gold nuggets. She had also run into the sheriff's deputy trying to defend the carriage, and had happily trampled the fox into the dirt until she was a whimpering mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie dismounted her loyal steed, then turned to examine her saddle cushion, grinning in delight at what she saw. Due to all the heat and squashing, the weasel sheriff had become fused with the leather saddle, to the point where she now looked like an elaborate decal painted on to the seat. Roxxie ran a hand over the weasel's face, which was a perfect portrait of disgusted horror, and was overjoyed to find that she could not feel the difference between sheriff and seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I just got myself a new favourite saddle, Butterscotch! Welcome to your new life, Tex. Beneath me!\"</span></div></div>",

What Texas needed was a stealthy approach, to take the bandit by surprise. The weasel slowly crept around to the back of the house, her gun drawn, and spotted a back door up ahead, hanging slightly ajar. With a grin, the weasel gently pushed it open noiselessly, and slipped inside the lair of her most dangerous foe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of her, a corridor stretched deep into the house, with a few doors branching off to each side, and a large cupboard against one wall. Texas walked forwards and pushed open the closest door, revealing a large, filthy bathroom beyond. The weasel wrinkled her nose in disgust and stepped back, but just as she did so, the sound of heavy footsteps came from further down the corridor, heading in Texas's direction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even the seat got significant splotches of waste scattered around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex squeaked as the door knob turned, running out of time as she dove into the toilet without thinking.

As Tex prayed she only had to shower or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fuck.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fried beans were quick to make it to the exit and the kangaroo bandit let out a volley of noxious farts. The foul gas had nowhere to go and soon Texas' nose burned with the pervasive stench of Roxxie's farts. She had to stay silent at all costs. If the roo found her here, she would be in even deeper shit, if that was at all possible. But as the farts kept flowing and the stench made her eyes water it became impossible to hold on. The weasel gagged and coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!!\" Roxxie shouted as she sprung up from the toilet. She turned around to peek down the hole and spot the source of the noise. When she laid eyes on the weasel, buried up to her neck in old shit, the kangaroo fell apart laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha, what in the name of all that's holy are ye doin in there? Were ya tryin to hide? In ma toilet?! Ah know ah call you a dumbass on the regular, Tex, but this has gotta be the single dumbest thing ah ever dun saw.\" Her belly still rumbled with the fried beans and a cruel smirk grew on her face. \"Well then, sheriff. If it's shit you want, allow me to oblige.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smug grin the roo turned her back on the weasel, looming her huge butt over the toilet hole. Roxxie parted her cheeks, showing off that filthy hole once more, and plopped herself down. She wouldn't get up again until her bowels were completely empty. To add just a pinch of extra torment the bandit also closed her legs, ensuring all her foul emissions would be trapped down there with the weasel. The farts didn't wait long to emerge, sputtering out of the roo's twitching asshole and filling the sheriff's environment with nasty stench. Soon the gas began to subside and with a subtle squelch the bandit started to take a shit in earnest. Solid lumps of horrid waste smacked the weasel on her head and rolled in front of her face. But as the solid material passed the beans hit the main stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie cried out in agonized relief as a steady stream of thick, fetid gunk poured from her rear. Like warm mud it was heaped onto the sheriff, who loudly retched and sputtered below. Hearing the weasel's misery lifted the roo's spirits as her ass felt like it was on fire. She cursed her gluttony and held her big belly. With a wry smile she could only imagine how bad it had to be for Texas. It spurred the kangaroo bandit on to fight through the pain and give it her all. After what felt like an eternity the roo's hole finally got to relax, having delivered a horrifying payload right onto the weasel's head. But Roxxie Roo was not finished yet. She would've just called it a day here, but now that she had her nemesis trapped in her toilet, the bandit was going to take her time. She may not be able to give a shit anymore, but her gut was still a champ at producing the foulest farts in the West.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas winced at the rotten stench of the crap smeared all over her. In the darkness of Roxxie's toilet she couldn't see a thing, but she felt the uncomfortable warmth of the sticky mess clinging to her. The smell defied all description and just in case it wasn't nightmarish enough the butthole looming over the weasel added even more in the form of lengthy, rancid farts. Specs of crap still sprayed as the last remnants of Roxxie's bowel movement were blown out in the foul winds. Even when the kangaroo ran out of farts she didn't get up, adamant to trap the weasel down there with her concentrated stink for as long as possible. When the bandit's thick legs started to get a little numb she finally stood up, turning around to admire her handiwork. Roxxie smiled, looking down on the barely conscious weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you stay nice 'n put, alright?\" She taunted before taking a few shaky steps on her semi-numb legs and leaving the bathroom. From her fetid new prison the weasel tried to wiggle out, much akin to how she got herself in to this predicament. But horror set in as she realized the shit around her had compacted and completely immobilized her. From the other room she could hear two excited voices shouting back and forth, interrupted by bellowing laughter. The conversation finally died down and after some time even the smell of Roxxie's farts seemed to dissipate. But after only an hour had passed the bathroom door swung open and in strod Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn, it really is you. Ah'm a little curious how ya ended up there, but let's be honest here Texas, we both know what's gotta happen here.\" The mare said haughtily as she turned around and dropped her pants. The terrified weasel looked up to the monumentally huge ass of Georgia descending on her. She'd been squashed flatter than a sheet of paper several times beneath that colossal mass, but now it just made the wooden seat of the toilet creak as it sealed the weasel into smelly darkness once more. The horse may not have any rotten turds to add to the pile right now, but farts began to flow in abundance. Though her wretched stink couldn't quite match the intensity of Roxxie's, the mare's farts still carried their own uniquely disgusting stench. She contently patted her belly after emptying it of all the gas present. Georgia stood up and with a smug grin turned to face the weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, ah'll get ya some horse apples later, Texas. Me 'n Roxxie are gonna enjoy buryin ya in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits were true to their words and with every day the weasel was covered further in their foul shit as the toilet slowly filled up. When the sheriff couldn't be seen anymore the two threw a big party, celebrating their victory. Vivian appointed Georgia to be the new sheriff and together the two brutes pillaged everyone in Gold Springs that Vivian didn't like. Neither of the big-bottomed bandits ever managed to make sense of the weasel's decision to hide in their toilet, but they would laugh about it for the rest of their infamous careers.</span></div></div>",

It barely had enough room to fit her, but with a bit of manoeuvring, she managed to get the door closed behind her, just in time to hear the loud, booming footsteps stomping down the corridor. As the weasel watched through the slats in the cupboard door, she could see the massive kangaroo bandit walking down the hall, her butt so big that it grazed the walls on either side of her as her hips swayed from either side. As she was right outside the cupboard, her butt pinning the door closed, the roo suddenly stopped, frowning at the open back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember leaving that open...\" She said, suspiciously, gazing around and peering into the bathroom, then just shrugging. \"Eh, musta just been the wind. And speaking of wind...\" Roxxie's stomach suddenly rumbled and gurgled alarmingly, before she let out a long, loud blast of gas from her oversized rear, the foul gas spreading all through the surrounding area. Inside the cupboard, the roo's foul gas washed over Texas, who gagged in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh... Better out than in! Just wish I had a certain weasel's face to soak up that gas.\" The roo said with a devious chuckle, blasting out another, even longer fart following the first.

The strong smell of manure and other ungodly things hit her nose almost instantly. Then she heard the sinister laughter of Roxxie. \"Having trouble, Tex?\" Texas tried to fire back, but discovered she'd been gaged. With a worn pair of Roxxie's panties no less. Roxxie roared with laughter as Tex realized her predicament, and just how much trouble she was actually in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Tex, I've got a little bit of a game for you. It's an easy one, honestly. All you have to do is stay awake, for... Let's say, a half hour... and I'll take you back inside, and you and I will do something else. If you happen to fall asleep, for some, odd, reason... Well... I think I'm just gonna leave you in here for awhile, with your new friend...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie then walked over to the other side of the stable, the ground shaking as she did, and unlocked the gate. Roxxie smirked. \"She's all yours, girl.\" She stated, and left the stable. The ground shook even further as the massive mare known as Butterscotch entered the main stable, looking right at Texas the entire time. Texas tired to beg, plead, or something, none of it audible at all from the gag of Roo's nasty panties. Butterscotch was slow in her approach, taunting Texas the entire time. Suddenly, she turned around, and Texas was greeted to the ungodly sight of Butterscotch's rear end. It was larger than Texas' entire body, and filthier than any of the cows Smiling Jack owned. Texas let out a whimper, as Butterscotch lowered her rear, slowly flattening Texas beneath it... </span></div></div>",

Nearby, Roxxie had been kind enough to leave a huge trough of feed, and Butterscotch took great pleasure in chowing down on it.

She faced her ass towards it, then lunged backwards, slamming into it as hard as she could while simultaneously letting out another atomic blast of gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas screamed in pain and disgust, but her torture was only just beginning. Butterscotch ground her ass into the pole, wiping up and down on it like she was trying to scratch the worst itch she'd ever had.

She found the limits of her wishful thinking when the horse gave out a loud neigh of surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Butterscotch?\" a familiar voice cried from inside the hideout. Texas' ears rang with terror as she heard the loud thumps of kangaroo feet moving down stairs. She was soon to be discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well! What do we have here?\" Roxxie asked with a massive grin as she peaked through the window of the stables and saw a small weasel staring back at her like a deer in headlights. \"It looks like you're a few miles away from your jail cells, sheriff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex reached for her pistol, but realized she must have lost it when she was blasted back by the horse's gas. It had probably sunk into the muddy ground of the rain-soaked stable, never to be found again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't need a jail cell to pummel you!\" the sheriff bluffed, intimidation being her only weapon left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't need to pummel you to pummel you.\" The kangaroo laughed as she locked the door to the stables and pulled up a lawn chair to the window. \"You think Butterscotch was waking me up so I could deal with you? Nah. She was waking me up so I could watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas looked at the horse, which nodded in agreement. A smile crept across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff screamed as she started running around the pen, the horse giving chase. The two darted back and forth throughout the small enclosure, Texas just barely dodging being trampled and bull-rushed with nimble leaps and wild-west agility. Her eyes frantically searched the room for any way she might be able to leave, but her options seemed to be vanishing fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only possible exit seemed to be the window through which Roxxie watched the hilarious ordeal. Tex could easily dive through it, but it would take a lot out of her; then she'd be right at the feet of her least favorite kangaroo. Still... it might be the only chance she had. </span></div></div>",

She leapt out of the way of a headbutt attack from Butterscotch, who was getting closer to catching her with each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep running, Tex!\" Roxxie laughed from the window. \"You're gonna have to get tired sometime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas feared that the kangaroo's words would be prophetic, but her prediction actually would never come to pass.

She endured the ghastly gas wafting in the air and summoned everything she had to repress her groans of disgust. She remains absolutely still waiting to see what the mare would do. Seconds felt like hours and for a moment the gas was the least of her concerns. Butterscotch smacks her lips, snorts.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then falls back asleep. Texas lets out a sigh of relief, just as Butterscotch rips one more nasal torturing fart before returning to sleep. Once the danger has passed, Texas fans the air with her hat and resumes her search. After a good ten minutes of carefully tiptoeing around the stables, occasionally stepping in to a recent payload of poop, the sheriff couldn't find anything that could possibly hold the massive mare. Even if she did, from the looks of it she could probably smash her way out if needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas needed to find some way to put the mare out of commission. For a moment she considered putting a bullet in its head but aside from being inhumane the gunshot would probably alert Roxxie. As she examines the room again, the sheriff composes a new plan. Looking up the second floor of the barn, she climbs up and discovered crates of stolen loot. None carrying treasure but food, hay, and alcohol. As soon as she laid eyes on it, Texas gets an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first idea she notices is to get the horse drunk on stolen whiskey. If she could get the horse drunk and put her out of commission, then Roxxie can't commit her robbery or make a getaway. At least, that is if she could convince the horse to drink. The second idea is to wake up Butterscotch and have her eat all the food stored up here. Texas was confident a beast of that size would love a feast of that caliber and once she's full, she shouldn't be able to run as fast. Only problem is Roxxie would definitely notice if her steed suddenly gained an immense amount of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas had to choose fast. Roxxie could come in at any moment and even in her sleep Butterscotch wasn't letting up on her gas.</span></div></div>",

The weasel sat up and slightly tugged back the curtain blocking one window, seeing exactly what she expected. About thirty yards ahead was the rotton roo herself, smirking down at the carriage from atop her massive, fat steed, easily as big as the coash Texas was hiding in. In one of the roo's hands was a pair of colossal saddle bags, and in the other was an extra-large revolver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you know how this works by this point.\" Roxxie says, smiling at the carriage drivers and tossing the saddlebags forwards into the dusty desert road. \"Start loading 'em up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the carriage crew scurried over to grab the saddlebags, Texas narrowed her eyes and held her rifle at the ready, debating how to deal with this. If she leapt out of the coach now she would have the drop on Roxxie, but might put the crew in danger. On the other hand, if she climbed out the opposite door of the carriage, she might be able to circle around the sand dunes and get the drop on the bandit, but if she was seen the element of surprise, her only advantage, would be lost.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The stagecoach horses whinned in fear as the bullets whizzed around them, then stampeded forwards. Texas yelped as the carriage slammed into her, sending her flying, her rifle and her revolver landing in the sand nearby.

Texas spun around to try to shoot at her, but Butterscotch was faster, turning and slamming her gigantic ass down on top of the weasel, Texas disappearing with a squeak and a splat. Roxxie breathed a sigh of relief, then dashed over and climbed back on her seated horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get outta here!\" The horse whinnied in agreement, but lifted a leg and blasted out a rank, eggy fart over the flattened sheriff before getting up and dashing off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, Texas was left half-buried in the ground, the fumes of the horse fart slowly rising off her prone form. She groaned in pain and gradually pushed herself to her feet, surveying the scene in front of her.

The lynx looked at Texas and smiled. \"Still, if we must clean things up, I suppose it pays to finally get rid of ALL the trash... this has been a long time coming, sheriff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas's hand instantly flew to her gun, but as she did so, a large shadow approached behind her, one of the mayor's thugs slugging her over the back of the head. The weasel yelped and crumpled to the ground, and the large rhinocerous thug instantly sat heavily on her back, pinning her down. The mayor smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with you...\"</span></div></div>",

Wasting no time, the sheriff dragged herself over so that her back was to the wall, then started to try and cut through the bindings that held her hands behind her back using the nail. She'd been tied up before, and she knew if she could just get her hands free, she could escape from there. The only question was, would she be faster than the horse's digestive system? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on... Come on!\u201d The weasel growled, feeling the rope begin to fray and weaken. She was almost there! She just had to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low rumbling sound caught her attention, and the weasel's gaze shifted over to Butterscotch, whose stomach had just gurgled alarmingly. As she watched, the horse's tail lifted, and the weasel's eyes widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no...\u201d She whimpered, exchanging a shocked look with April, before Butterscotch sealed their fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful horse gas washed across the room as a rancid green fog, engulfing the two lawgirls and leaving them gagging, screaming and retching from the utterly abominable smell.

Nearby, Texas saw April fall limp, collapsing into the mud of the horse pen. The weasel gave a weak whimper, trying to crawl over to her friend, but with every breath she grew weaker and weaker, her mind spinning as the only air her body received was the recycled bean air being produced by he gassy horse. Slowly but surely, the weasel's struggles weakened, and everything went dark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Butterscotch!\u201d Roxie called out happily, entering the horse's pen with two overflowing buckets of horse feed. Inside, the giant horse was sitting happily in the middle of the room, her absolutely colossal ass pressed down firmly into the mud of the enclosure floor. As Roxie watched, she saw the mud suddenly bubble alarmingly all around the horse's ass as she let out another of her foul farts. The bandit just grinned, walking over and pouring the feed into the trough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, girl! Grub's up!\u201d She shouted, and the horse whinnied happily, getting to her feet and tromping over to the mountain of food. Roxie smirked, then glanced back to where the horse had just been sitting, seeing a deep double crater in the mud where Butterscotch's ass had been planted, and buried in the bottom of that crater, an extraordinarily flat, smelly fox with a horrified and sickened look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's one cushion, which means the other must be...\u201d Roxie's gaze shifted from the foxy fart cushion to Butterscotch's mud-stained ass, where a delightful sight awaited her: A flattened weasel lodged deep within the horse's ass crack, barely visible if not for the tiny, flattened arms sticking out, and the muddy, crushed ponytail dangling loose. With a hugely satisfied grin, the kangaroo bandit walked forwards, then grabbed the ponytail and pulled Texas's flattened face free, crushed two-dimensional by the mighty ass cheeks on either side of it. The weasel's eyes spun dizzily, and her face was a sickly green from the constant barrage of farts she had been swallowing, but slowly she came to her senses, mustering the power to give Roxie a desperate, pleading look. The bandit just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Tex! Oi, you know what today is?\u201d She asked with a grin. The weasel didn't, or couldn't, respond, so Roxie just continued. \u201cIt's your one-year anniversary of being defeated! One entire year of being a horse's fart cushion. Ah, I remember it like it was yesterday...\u201d The roo said wistfully, the grin never leaving her face. \u201cAn' since it's such a special day, I've given Butterscotch her extra-spicy feed today, nd she's raring to give you a congratulatory kiss! Pucker up!\u201d The bandit's grin turned wicked, before she slammed Texas's face back into the horse's ass crack, burying it so deep that the weasel's nose acted as a butt-plug for the horse's asshole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere's to a year of sniffing horse ass, Tex!\u201d Roxie shouted happily, while Butterscotch's stomach started to rumble, a sure sign of what was about to follow. The horse looked back at her ass and snickered happily, then clenched her muscles and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRBBBBBBBBTTTTTTT!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel screamed muffledly and spasmed in Roxie's grasp as the ungodly stench invaded her nostrils and conquered her lungs, but the strong hand holding her in place never wavered, as not a single whiff of the stench made it to Roxie's nose. As it had been for the past year, Texas acted as the perfect fart absorber, not a solitary foul fume making it past her. The roo just laughed, then continued to hold the weasel in place as Butterscotch's stomach roared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd many more to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBBBBRRRRRRTTTT!!</span></div></div>",

Butterscotch\u2019s cheeks were much too thick and muscular to give the Sheriff any room to escape. As the journey went on, Texas found out, much to her horror, just how badly Butterscotch could sweat in the oppressive desert heat, and how horrible the sweat from a massive obese horse\u2019s ass could stink.

No, instead, she was trapped between the massive meaty globes of Butterscotch, who held her there, and made sure Texas soaked in the horrific fumes from her tailpipe.

Butterscotch then turned towards Texas, and placed a hoof on her head, before squishing Texas down deep into the mud, until Texas was trapped below her shoulders, with only her head, neck, and shoulders sticking out of the mud.

He sat down on her, hard! He didn't even try to do it gingerly.  With a loud <b>CRACK</b> his huge ass flattened her to the ground.  He wasn't sure if anything was broken...yet.  He intended to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas groaned and tried to move her arms, but they were awkwardly sticking straight up. Luckily for Clives, they missed his anus and only jutted through his long matted tail.  Her face was half covered in said tail as he sat on her chest. \"Ohhhh...good God, yer heavy...\" She wheezed. That made him extremely excited. He whinnied in glee and lifted his ass over her body, which she gasped, trying to inhale as much air as she could.  Then she saw the big buttocks coming toward her again, \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the Clydesdale started bouncing, and we're not talking about a small bounce either.  It was more like a semi going over a cliff.  <b>CRUNCH</b> went the weasel's tiny bones.  Her mouth hung open in pain and shock.  Then he went up in the air and repeated the process.  Shit smeared on her chest, and hay stuck in her teeth.  She groaned and coughed whenever she could.  Clives just lolled his tongue out and continued his fun.

There stood a massive brown horse, he was about the same size as the Clydesdale, if not a little bigger. He stood taller than much other horses, his body was just as ginormous, and his ass was very bulbous as it stretched out far and wide. He had a dark purple mane, a bright gold nose ring in his right nostril. Dirt covered a bit in his dark purple mane, and over his body. Texas couldn't see it but flies hovered around his ass, and ass crack. Old crusty shit plastered in his inner ass cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Clives, who's the broad?\" the dark brown horse asked. Texas's eyes opened wide, completely shocked that this horse had just talked. \"Aw, Laurence you ruined the surprise!\" Texas's eyes only grew wider as she slowly turned around to see the Clydesdale lunging at her grabbing a hold of her shirt and threw her down to the ground near some horse manure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was to dazed to move, and she just realized the huge horse was plummeting down upon her, his blubbery ass, eclipsing all light from the outside. Then splat! The horse dropped his heavy ass on the poor weasel, crushing her entire body. The horse whinnied and swayed his large hips back and forth, causing Texas to be mushed around and get horse manure totally covering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now Clives. Don't hog the girl all to yourself. I want some fun myself\" Laurence said as he used one of his hind legs to close the large barn door, destroying the sun's bright light that lite the now dark barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Clydesdale, continued to sway back and forth. Moaning and groaning, before letting loose thunderous farts, it caused the muddy and shit covered ground to fling chunks of mud everywhere, as well as bubbles forming from the puddle. Laurence looked down on the pathetic crushed weasel girl, who was trying to get free by flinging her arms and legs about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my daaaaad~\" Clives grunted releasing another deafening fart, causing the muddy ground to bubble again, and making Texas fling about wildly. The fart's were just as smelly as they were loud, the smell was about the same as a sewage plant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least move that fat ass over, I want in!\" Laurence said as he opened and closed the stable door.</span></div></div>",

Somehow, it was larger than Clives\u2019, and even larger than Butterscotch\u2019s, both of which were two of the biggest asses Texas had ever seen in her livetime, placing Laurence\u2019s ass in the firm number one spot when it came to size- and as Texas was about to find out, it would possibly be the smelleiest as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurence slammed down his planet sized behind on Texas\u2019 face, getting to work on the poor Sheriff. The stench was unbearable before Laurence even did anything, but once he farted, Texas knew a new meaning of Stink. The harsh, powerful, thick odor forced its way into Texas\u2019 lungs, violently replacing any oxygen that had previously inhabitted them. A dark green cloud floated up from the ground where the mighty stallion was sitting, the sheet volume of gas unable to be absorbed by Texas Herself. The two horses took turns, each one farting on Texas, until the two built up a rhythm. Soon, Texas didn\u2019t go a single second without being bombarded by some sort of gas from either one of them. Texas had shut her eyes tightly, and had prayed that she either passed out or died beneath the ass of Laurence, as either would bring some sort of mercy. Alas, Laurence lifted up before either occurred, leaving Texas on the floor to wallow in the stench. Laurence used his teeth to lift Texas up by the collar, and walked her over to the massive manure pile in the stable. Texas didn\u2019t have any energy left to fight back, but as the smell of the pile began to assault her, she half heartedly began to kick her legs a bit. It didn\u2019t help, and Laurence dropped her down, face first, into the manure pile. Texas\u2019 predicament soon went from bad to worse, as Laurence\u2019s massive hoof pressed into the back of Texas\u2019 head, squishing her down into the pile, forcing the fermented horse shit into her nostrils and mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you listen good, little girl. You stumbled into the wrong stable today. Me and Clives here have been without a good toy for awhile, so we\u2019re gonna keep ya, and see how many of our sick, horrible fantasies we can reinact until your little body quits on us. From now on, you will know us as King Laurence, and King Clives, and will address us as such. You will get to know every inch of our godly asses, and you will smell- and eat- everything they provide for you. There will be no freedom. You belong to us now. Understood?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas obviously couldn\u2019t respond, but by careful maneuvering of his hoof on the back of her head, Laurence made it seem as if Texas was nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d The giant horse and his friend giggled as they thought of all the horrible things they were about to do to this poor sheriff...</span></div></div>",

Except that she really should have, because Roxxie, now free of her cuffs, walked over and slapped a pair of cuffs on Texas, smirking a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame I don't get to obliterate you myself, Sheriff, but I'm just happy knowing you'll be unhappy. Very unhappy.\" The weasel opened her mouth for a witty comeback, but Roxxie instantly grabbed the sheriff's ponytail and turned around, slamming her face into her oversized ass before blasting out a noxious hellstorm of farts. The last thing Texas heard was Roxxie's snorting laughter before everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs conciousness slowly returned to the weasel, she had the oddest feeling that she was floating, then opened her eyes to discover that she was not far off. Texas was dangling from the hook of a crane in some sort of large wooden warehouse. She glanced down, instantly recognising the machine below her, a contraption made almost entirely of steel rollers and heavy machinery. A printing press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle from her left made her turn, and sure enough, there was Vivian, Roxxie and the mayor's rhinocerous thug, standing on a nearby catwalk. The mayor was grinning with malicious glee as Texas turned her head to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is yer plan, Vivian? Run me through a printin' press? Fer a great thinker, you ain't thinkin' too well. Ah've survived way worse than that!\" The sheriff shouted in defiance. The mayor's grin just widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Texas, stupid as always. THAT is a printing press,\" She said, pointing towards another, very similar machine in the warehouse, with some slight differences from the one Texas was dangling above. \"This one makes a slightly different sort of paper... So long, Texas. It has not been a pleasure.\" The lynx's hand slammed down on a huge red button on the control panel, and the machine hummed to life, the rollers spinning madly. Above Texas, the crane hook detached, sending her plumetting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, no-AARRGHGHHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel's body disappeared between the rollers with a series of loud squishing and crunching noises. As she passed through all of them, the villains could occasionally catch glimpses of the sheriff as she was flattened more and more, her body going from flat paper to a thin, tan mess, completely unrecognisable as a weasel. As the sheriff reached the end of the rollers, her mess of a body was fed into a large metal box, from inside of which came a cacophinous series of squishes and crunches, until finally, from the conveyor belt leading of the machine, came hundreds of tan rolls of toilet paper. The Texas toilet paper were fed along the conveyor belt, until they toppled into a box marked 'to county jail.'Up above, Vivian sniggered in sadistic glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As mayor, I officially declare it to be burrito week at the jail. They'll burn through that toilet paper before anyone notices she's missing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the end of Sheriff Texas, made into hundreds of rolls of low-quality toilet paper for the massive prisoners to wipe their asses with. Sure enough, as the mayor predicted all the toilet paper was used up before anyone figured out what had happened, and the sheriff's last contribution to the world was a humerous headline in the town newspaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheriff turned into toilet paper for prisoners. A shitty way to go.\"</span></div></div>",

Slinging the rifle over her back, the weasel continued to sneak forwards until she was at the base of Butterscotch's back legs, then leapt up and grabbed some handfuls of stinking fur, beginning to climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Texas, though Butterscotch's hide was tough, the horse instantly felt something climbing up her butt and glanced back in confusion, glaring as she saw the weasel. Texas froze and gulped as her eyes met the horse's, and she slowly shook her head, begging her not to. The massive horse just sniggered, then SLAMMED her colossal ass down right on top of Texas, crushing her flatter than paper in an instant. Roxxie, who had been focused on the robbery, blinked in surprise and glanced back, smirking as she saw Texas's hand sticking out from beneath her massive mare's derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely catch, Butterscotch. Why don't you keep the sheriff busy while I finish up here.\" She said, and the horse whinned in joy, before blasting out a foul fart, causing the weasel to squeal and whimper and sending sand flying. As Roxxie dismounted and got the shocked stagecoach crew moving, Butterscotch continued to grind the stupid sheriff flat and gas her senseless, the sand around her butt soon becoming drenched with horse sweat and filth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity to the sheriff, Roxxie placed the gold-loaded saddlebags on her horse and motioned for her to stand up, grinning at the sight that appeared before her. Texas was flatter than flat after an hour of Butterscotch's treatment, her face a delightful picture of horror and humiliation, and her body absolutely reeking of the horse's stench and covered with her sweat. Roxxie snorted with laughter, then grabbed the weasel's flat ponytail and peeled her out of the sweat-drenched sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you actually thought that would work, moron. Well, you made a shitty sheriff. Maybe you'll do better in your new job. As my cushion!\" The weasel could only whimper in terror as Roxxie scrunched the paper-thin sheriff up and shoved her between her oversized cheeks. The kangaroo grinned triumphantly, then mounted up and rode away, already planning out every way she could torture the sheriff for the rest of her life.</span></div></div>",

Normally April would be waiting for her by the door, but today she was absent. It struck her as a little odd, but she wouldn't be upset at her deputy for being a little late given her usual record of punctuality. Instead, Texas took her tin pot, measured out some coffee grounds, splashed in some water from her office spigot and set it on the burner. She was in desperate need of a hot cup of coffee on this groggy morning. But the water hadn't even started to percolate when she got her first \"case\" of the day, wrapped around a rock and delivered directly through her window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodging to the ground to avoid the glass shrapnel, Texas quietly cursed every single person in her horrid little town for letting stuff like this happen. She scooped up the projectile, aiming to throw it back at whoever was outside, when she noticed the piece of parchment roped around it. Written on the outside was her name (along with a few derogatory terms that don't need to be mentioned) and on the inside was a plain note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE HAVE YOUR DEPUTY. GIVE UP YOUR BADGE OR SHE'LL GET IT\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was written in hasty, long lettered script, and at the bottom was a red paw print that gave her a good clue as to who was behind this. And beneath THAT was a scribbled drawing of what she guessed was April, tied up underneath a loose artistic interpretation of a cow and crying. There was also plenty of stink lines included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas understood the urgency of the situation, with or without the drawing, and so she had to act fast. The only problem was that Smiling Jack and his gang weren't exactly the easiest to find. They moved around constantly and had several bases that they hopped between, abandoning or destroying those that were compromised. That, and even if she knew where he was hiding, it was hard enough tracking bandits in the wilds with backup. Without it, she was a sitting duck.

The weasel crumpled up her note and grabbed her things, buckling on her pistol belt and grabbing her hat as she went out the door. She may not know where Smiling Jacks had gone, but she knew exactly where she could find someone who could, at The Crushed Weasel. It was a bar the mayor herself had funded in the bad part of town, where villains and mercenaries could meet in peace, and usually even Texas didn't go there. In fact, there was almost a truce with the bar. She didn't kick down the door and arrest everybody, and in turn, they didn't beat the weasel to a pulp and turn her into toilet paper for the bathrooms. However, desperate times called for desperate measures, and if she wanted to find Jacks, she would have to take the risk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short ride later, the weasel hitched her horse in the mud outside the saloon, gritting her teeth as she looked at the sign over the door, a rather good likeness of her screaming as a grinning cow squashed her underneath its smelly ass. From out of the broken window on one side of the door music drifted out lazily from a poorly-tuned piano, along with the sounds of rowdy drinkers and, as always, a fight going on. Texas walked up to the door to kick it open and make her entrance, but right as she did so the door swung open, and the weasel was met with a massive ass flying the other way, which slammed into her and knocked her off the porch, landing on top of her with a loud squelch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And stay out!\" A voice yelled, before the door slammed shut again. The huge bull sitting on top of her groaned drunkenly, before letting out a long, sour fart directly into the weasel's noise, causing her to gag muffledly. Thankfully, he didn't seem to notice, and after a few minutes pushed himself to his feet, the sucking mud sticking to his filthy, furry ass, but leaving the flattened weasel behind as he staggered off. Stuck in the mud, the weasel groaned and tried to peel herself up with all her strength. This was not a good start...</span></div></div>",

The weasel grit her teeth and walked up to the door yet again, this time prepared to make her grand entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bar, things were going rather pleasantly. Despite having to throw out that drunken bull, the patrons were all getting along, playing cards, plotting Texas's demise and, most importantly, drinking lots. Behind the bar, the huge cow girl owner, Annabelle, smirked to herself as she cleaned out another glass with a rag, or at least smeared the dirt around it so it wasn't so obvious. The peace and quiet was immediately obliterated however, as the door was suddenly kicked open at full force, the sheriff standing silhouetted in the doorway. Instantly everything stopped. The piano player struck a bad chord, the card players looked up from cheating each other and the plotters suddenly looked up in surprise, not sure if this was a blessing or a curse. As the weasel swaggered her way into the room, dozens of hands slowly moved to rest on dozens of weapons, but the weasel was unphased, walking up to the bar and glaring up at Annabelle, who was at least twice her height and four times her width. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls stared at each other, until Texas grabbed a leftover glass of whisky on the counter and gulped it down in one fiery mouthful, placing the glass upside-down back on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think ah've forgotten your bank-robbing past, just because the mayor gave you this cushy job.\" The weasel said, glaring back up at her. Annabelle looked completely unphased, but started putting any glasses on the bar under it, preparing for trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't think I've forgotten how you brought me in, Weasel. There's still a spot inside my ass-crack with your name on it.\" She said, turning around and pretending to tidy up the bottles behind the bar, but really just giving the weasel a good long look at her colossal backside, the widest part of her, trapped behind a tight (for her) pair of jeans, but with a visibly filthy sweat stain running straight down where her crack would be, and a foul odour emanating off it. The cow swatted a few flies absentmindedly with her tail, which also served to waft the stink over to the sheriff, then turned around, disappointed to see that the weasel remained as unphased as she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you cross that line again an' all put you right back inta jail. You an' any o' the rest of these varmints.\" She said, glaring pointedly at the bar's patrons. A few looked away, one of them actually bolted out the door, but the rest returned the glare. They had the power here. \"So luckily for all of us, that's not why I'm here.

And more importantly, how did you plan to walk out of here still in the third dimension?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, Texas heard chairs scraping across the floor as a few of the larger patrons stood up, heavy footsteps approaching...</span></div></div>",

It hit like a stone, shattering into bits on the cow's thick skull, and sending her head over heels. Annabelle hit the ground with a thud, her ass sticking out in the air. Which turned out to be the worst way she could've fallen, because the shock from that blow to the head caused her bowels to release, letting out a thick haze of her held in cow farts that spilled over the bar like a smoke bomb. Texas covered her face with her hat, rushing to get out of the bar and away from the stench, which had everyone else hacking and wheezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas ran out, coughing and barely holding onto her lunch, and from the looks of it most of the other patrons had done the same.

Anna's grimy ass cheeks were on either side of her head, completely blocking out any view for Texas that wasn't the cow's greasy ass. She closed her eyes and gently pushed her lips to meet Anna's brown lips. Texas shivered in disgust, reflexively shedding a tear from pure revulsion. She kissed for what felt like an eternity before starting to pull back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going sheriff?\" Annabelle said, grabbing the back of Texas's head and forcing her deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas started to struggle, pushing back against the cow's ass, but leverage was against her and she couldn't extricate herself from that rotten crack. She felt Anna's pucker clench against her lips and realized the worst was about to hit. Before she could pull away a damn near gigantic fart blasted directly into her mouth, hitting with such force that it blew out of her nose and her ears. For a second, Texas's entire head was full of more fart than brain. Needless to say, the shock of it knocked her out cold.

There was some kind of dim light buzzing above her, and the stench that hung in the air was ghastly. She tried to stand up, but she's had her legs and arms tied up to keep her kneeling. Her mouth was propped open with a ring gag, and looking down she realized that there was a sign around her neck that said \"Complimentary cleaning service\". She was in the bathroom!

She then shoved a lot of Texas' body to her head inflating her lips to a comical size. The Bear then thrust her lip first into Annabelle's sphincter.

As she fell to the floor Texas coughed and scratched her tongue. \"Ugh thanks for nothing.\" She said getting up to leave only for Annabelle to grab her arm. \"Where do you think you're going I said I'd give you information, I didn't say you'd be free to leave!

As much as she just wanted to run outside, Grizzel was still towering over her and her lungs needed more oxygen for her to run. For now, she was just going to have to bear with this sick little game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is Anna, better make it quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now little lady. You do this for me and my staff will gladly help you find out where you dear deputy is.\" Annabelle began as she lightly pushed Texas down onto one of the chairs with a odd softness to her voice that sent a tidal wave of uneasiness down Texas's spine. Oh how much she wished that she listened to her instincts and just booked it out of that door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Se now, tonight I was meant to have a special show with my entertainer for the night but your big bad Smiling Jacks ended up getting her assistant trampled by his guys. I'm guessing that was them making their getaway with April.... Lousy lowlifes.\" The large cow explained with a snappy spit to the side, only now pulling up her pants and squeezing in her buttcheeks one at a time. But while Texas now had a better idea on why she'd want payback against Smiling Jacks the voice in her head was yelling for her to just escape the next chance she could get. Her gut practically was doing backflips to warn her not to trust a word Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're gonna be her assistant. Shouldn't be too hard even for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a lot of willpower for Texas not to just deck Anna across the face for that remark. Even if she did the saloon was still buzzing with thugs who all wanted to have her scream between their cheeks. Anna's offer didn't sound all that bad but Texas knew that behind those eyes was a strong desire for payback. She just needed to figure out how to make her want to get revenge against Smiling Jacks to overshadow her desire to have Texas as her new ass wipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

Tight and 100% Texas-proof. Just like the knots Annabelle used to dangle the weasel behind her bar counter and used her as a seat for several long hours in the heat of the summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tongue bear. I am no simple circus act you know. I am a witchdoctor as well as an entertainer. Except, I don't think miss Texas would like her future read.\" Another voice called out as footsteps walked through the backdoor, deep and feminine. It was then that Texas saw the woman in question and was almost completely taken by surprise by her exotic appearance. It was a slender cheetah, around the same size as herself, walking with grace and pride, unintimidated by the small swarm of low lives that were in the building. In fact, she seemed rather unimpressed by them while she inspected the sheriff, walking around the bound woman in a revealing blue dress and exotic trinkets and jewellery while a large bag stuffed to the brim with bottles, herbs and what appeared to be a voodoo doll hung from her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

So, what exactly is your ac-Mmmmpf?!\" Texas tried to question with her usual cop like interrogation before her mouth was stuffed full Anna's G-string. That gigantic cow must have taken them off and rolled them into a ball while she was distracted by Abra! And no matter how hard she tried to push them out with her tongue or cough them out, those black sweaty silk panties were wedged firmly in her mouth, engulfing her tongue with the overwhelming taste of the large bar maiden's buttsweat, bringing tears to her eye and laughter to the rest of the crooks that watched their enemy get dragged over to the stage by Anna herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll find out lawgirl! But first, how about a little preview of the act for disturbing my, honest patrons?\" Annabelle cackled before tossing Texas on stage, still bound to the chair as she bobbed and flung herself around to keep herself on all four legs of the chair, much t her relief. But that sense of relief soon vanished as she watched Abra join her on stage, looming over her with a glowing blue bottle. Despite her obvious protests, the witchdoctor simply turned towards the crowd and made a small bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold ye of Golden Springs! Today you will witness the power the spirits granted me! But before the fun begins, what shall I change first for da day? Da sheriff's body? Or transform her mind?\"</span></div></div>",

One like a predator about to go for the kill. The weasel tried to shake free of her bindings, desperately doing her best to break free as if she could destroy the chair with her back and elbows. But before she could even get a chance to test out her theory, Abra's long tail wrapped around her prey's hair and pulled, forging a pained groan from the weasel's gagged mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas then could feel the panties being pulled from her mouth, instinctively choking and rubbing her tongue against her teeth to get rid of that vile taste. As she did so she felt a hand go around her muzzle and forced it open, pouring in a slick blue liquid. Her first thought was to spit it out but the cool touch of this odd, almost fizzy sweet liquid was a sincere relief to her tastebuds, encouraging her to swallow the potion eagerly like it was a refreshing mellow cola. The sheriff tried to keep her eyes open, wanting to stay as alert as possible in this den of treachery but her body just felt so relaxed. Did she regret drinking the potion? It was hard to tell by the tired expression on her face. But then, the moment it felt like nothing was going to happen, she felt a strong tingle inside her stomach, making her twitch and wriggle around while the audience started to gap. It felt like the chair was closing in around her waist and that her chest was getting heavy. But then she noticed, the binds around her wrists and ankles felt loose! She could break free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation she pulled her wrists out of the ropes with only a few seconds of struggling, getting up only to suddenly loose balance and fall back into the chair with a light push from the witchdoctor. Then Texas could see the cause of her lack of balance, the reason why her bindings felt loose and why the thugs and low lives were now making catcalls at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boobs had somehow swollen to J sized milk jugs but the feeling wasn't unpleasant. It was almost scarily delightful and, in its own way, like having someone on top of her, snuggling her warmly. Her handscouldn;t help but feel themselveves rubbing the fur of her large new mounds, the touch sending ripples of pleasure through the sheriff's body. That's when she realized. Her hands were on her fur. Her shirt was cut open by Abra's claws when she pushed her! All the people in this tavern were staring at her rubbing her naked breasts! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexa's eyes widened in horror as she realized what was going on, trying to get up but she then realized that her ankles felt loose too! One quick look confirmed her suspisions. Her hips were widening as her figure became more waspish with her shins and thighs looking a lot more shapelier, thicker, and more muscular too! The sherrif gasped in even more surprise as her fingers ran along her hips. they were definetly wider by at least three inches more than before and her but felt like it was practically gonna tear her trousers appart by the seams! She had to get out of here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by the time she managed to get up and loosen her belt, a quick flash of light flew by her trousers before they were ripped to shreds by Abra's claws, forcing Texas to try to desperately in vain cover herself, her face turning as red as a tomato will the crowd pointed and laughed at her misfortune, some even taking pictures as she tried to run off the stage, only to have two rat gals grab her by the arms and pull her back to the centre of the stage. She tried to throw them off of her but her new feminine figure was a lot less powerful and Texas could feel it, unable to say a word as she realized that now the simplest thug that she would arrest daily could now overpower her. Her mind was screaming but her body still felt like it was practically moaning in pleasure. She just couldn't shake this feeling even as the rats began to slide their hands along her new plump ass and breasts, squeezing her nipples and forcing her to groan in unwanted levels of lust through her now fuller looking lips. The sheriffs face was softer too, almost good enough to pass off as a beauty model even without any makeup. There was no hint of the tough crime fighting warrior left on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra simply smiled at her handiwork while the rat thugs began to rub their hands along the sheriff's thighs, relishing in her humiliation while noting that this sheriff was a lot easier to handle. And Texas could sense what they were all thinking as they looked at her naked state. These girls were now thinking of all the ways they could 'play' with her for decades to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you enjoyed da show. Da spirits too are pleased with your new look sheriff. You'd give even give da girls at da L'Odeur S\u00e9duisante a run for their money.  Maybe you'll be living there as da, how you people call it, da 'new girl' once you've finished your performance as da town's new bimbo.~\" The witchdoctor scoffed with a almost mockingly gentle touch as she untied Texa's ponytail, letting her long black hair flow freely and bounce to the rhythm of the rat girl's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nngh....I swear I-ll-Ooouh\u2026. I'll send each and every one of you into jail!\" The helpless and weakened curvy weasel tried to threatened between moans in a vain attempt to gain control of the situation. But it only made the thugs flood the room in hysterical hyena like laughter, some even falling off their chairs while tears came down the sheriff's face. There was no way she could fight. Her body's new libido was practically on overcharge! Even the slightest touch on her fur was sending waves of pleasure through her body. She was at their mercy. No matter how much her mind screamed otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sheriff. No need to be rude. Maybe you should learn to SERVE more than protect. What does da audience think? Da spirits are feeling generous today! Do you wish to have her mind as it is? Or for her to get one more, in line with her now assets?\" Abra called out with an arm raised to the crowd, placing the sheriff's fate once again in their hands. It was almost like she was conditioning the law enforcer, letting her remember who exactly was in charge.</span></div></div>",

Seeing their approach, the two rats backed away from their prize for now to let the others have their fun. Texas had no time to react as the rat girls' dainty hands were replaced by a swarm of forceful mitts. They all started pawing away at her body, each one trying to get a handful of her new assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Texas found herself pushed to the ground by the wave of faceless hands. She lay on the ground, held down and groped by more hands, as the crowd began to spread her legs open, revealing her arousal to the world. Among the crowd, a question was being silently asked. \"Who first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas looked up to see some of the first in line, and no doubt would be the first to violate her among this group. She saw two male rabbits, likely stragglers from Smiling Jacks' gang. The two shared glances between each other and at Texas. They must be planning to go in together.

Even so obviously aroused, her presence is commanding. Towering over the bimbo weasel, she lightly kicked legs apart to expose Texa's tight, thigh-soaking virgin slit.

A complement I seldom give.\" A booming warm voice echoed behind the naked weasel as she turned around to see a giantess snake woman, large, pink and with glowing blue and green tribal tattoos that decorated her body like priceless works of art, yellow eyes that glowed like streetlights as they eyed Texa's body like one examining meat at a butcher's, her forked tongue licking her large plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I can tell just by ya gaze that you need some adjustments.~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could protest or ask what was going on, the giant snake spirit simply tapped the weasel's head, sending a sudden burst of heat through her body and forcing the sheriff to drop onto her volumptuous thighs, gasping for air, muscles twisting, arm thrashing, head thrown back, the bright, wonderful, painful, white-hot, dripping wet orgasm washing over her, washing around her, and washing her away while her hands were struggling just to resist the urge to grab and squeeze her tender tits while thrusting her fingers inbetween her legs as they leaked cum slowly. Whatever this new foe was, she cold make Texa's orgasm with just a single touch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Texas Stanton. I'll run da brief summary though you while you, 'adjust'. This is for ya on good.\" The serpent began as she expanded the hood of her neck like a cobra and slithered closer, shrinking untill she was more Texa's size but still at least twice as large as Annebelle or Georgia. Size however was the least of the soft moaning sheriff's worry as she sweated, unable to grasp what was happening before the coils wrapped around her body, squeezing her tightly and rhythmically like a pussy squeezing around a dildo, making the helpless sheriff scream in heat while her body kept on cumming against her will, eyes rolling back and her tongue sticking out. It was like her entire body, mind and spirit were being drugged heavily. It was easily the most confused and aroused moment of Texa's life, but her mind was quickly starting to love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya have been beaten, flattened, farted, used as a sex toy and even eaten at least four times. Haven't ya had enough? Da people ya protect kno this place is crap but they still live here like da dodos cause day smart as dodos!\" The snake began to explain before wrapping her tongue around Texa's face, lapping up the sweat on the weasel's fur and leaving it coated with her own saliva while her prey panted heavily, almost too much in an ahegao state of mind to even react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya too good for em Texas! You'd face a fate stuck in ya enemies asses if this goes on! So, wetha ya like it o not, ya have just had ya spirit branded. Ya soul, now is mine.\" She continued to speak while a faint chain seemed to grow around the weasel's mind and lead straight to the spirit's hand, sealing the magical branding while Texas struggled to even watch, unable to even scream in the pleasure giving coils for her to stop. Hell anything she did try saying just came out as a uncontrollled lust filled moan anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of ya though slave.~ Ya enemies will be a bit more gentle as long as ya submit to em. Even willing to protect their new favorate toy.~ Ya will worship me daily. Worship all the spirits! Den, when time comes, ya will serve me as a spirit, for all etirnity! Though of course, as a bimbo, ya'll be unable to think of one thing for very long. Your meaning in life will be being da perfect bubbily, dumb minx, constantly being in heat! Even pain will pleasure ya! No longer will ya fight, ya will simply bend ova and let any one use ya however they want! Day're all hot in your eyes after all~\" The voice boomed as the coils began to hoist Texa up to the serpent's large plump lips, enovelping her head in a soft, loving French kiss while a forked tongue slide its way through Texa's mouth while her words dug into Texa's mind, making her become nothing more than a sex loving bubbily version of her former self. and as she was released, her orgasmsed stopped, letting her heavy eyelids close for her to wake up from the magical trance, the serpents voice faintly heard in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe not all da spirits. Dem voodoo ones are nothing but big jerks ya kno? Always strutting around like stupid idiots 'Oh look at me and my voodoo! It's so much betta than what yoodoo!' Bunch a big headed inflated egotistical f***s.... No wonder someone like Molly serve em! I dated one ya kno. Went as lousy as ya'd expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the spirit rambled on, Texas slowly managed to feel herself stire awake, checking her surroundings while her body felt sore, no doubt from all the abuse it took in the trance and through whatever the thugs did to her in real life. But, where was she now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weasel tried to move, but she quickly discovered her whole body was tied down with a leather harness. She was stark naked and by the looks of it on the bar of the Crushed Weasel. She could barely move her head in the tight harness, and soon her attention was drawn to a stinging pain. She wanted to shout out at the sudden sting, but the only thing coming from her mouth was a soft mooing. What had Abra done to her?! She felt her swollen tits dangle free in the harness, but a different machine was attached to them. Texas strained to see it, but she could feel it working. It was milking her ample bosom with gusto, adding a steady trickle of her sweet nectar into a large glass container. At the base of the container was a tap and on the side of the machine hung a sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cweasel milk: $2,00, 'special' weasel milk: $15,00\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas whole body ached, and not just from the tight straps. She had been freely abused for who knows how many hours. All the patrons in the bar seemed to be back to their usual business, barely shooting her a glance. The weasel dreads to think that every last one of them had taken a turn with her newly grown assets. That vile witchdoctor responsible for this all was sitting at the bar, enjoying a small bowl of chili and a glass of milk. She gave the weasel a sultry wink before finishing up and leaving. Soon a different voice calls out to the sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh gotta say Tex, never thought you could get these guys off the booze, but I'll be damned, you actually did it.\u201d Annabelle guffaws. The weasel looked around the Crushed Weasel again and her eyes widened. The evil cow was right, almost every glass and pitcher in the saloon was filled with milk. Her tits ached at the mere idea of having supplied it all and she mooed pitifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, all yours, Tex. Didn't think you'd be a bigger cow than me, but here we are.\u201d Annabelle grinned. She flipped a switch on the machine and the light sting of the suction seized. With a soft pop the cow detached the machine from the bound weasel, only to lay Texas on her back on the bar. She couldn't resist a taste herself, fresh from the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas shuddered when Annabelle's lips touched her boob, the soft lips surrounding her painfully sensitive nipple. With a gentle squeeze and little further effort the cow made the sheriff moan and squirt a stream of sweet milk into her mouth. \u201cMmmm... not bad.\u201d She cooed, her lips still suckling on Texas's big tits. Even supplying a whole saloon full of patrons had not stemmed the weasel's flow. Her breasts felt as full as ever, no doubt a result of that vile magic Abra used. Some patrons hollered and cheered at the lewd display, but Annabelle just smiled and drank her fill. She finally let go when a patron came up to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah, don't she taste good?\u201d He chuckled, his beer belly jiggling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAin't that the truth. Now what can I do you for?\u201d Annabelle replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have the special.\u201d He said, winking and gesturing at Texas. The cow laughed and turned the weasel on the bar until her legs were facing the patron. She was a slobby looking rat woman, her tongue hanging out in anticipation. The weasel was all too aware of the breeze she could feel between her legs. The harness kept them spread and the cow's gentle suckling had made her all kinds of aroused. The patron dove in and began licking enthusiastically, massaging the sensitive folds of the weasel's pussy with her tongue. In mere minutes she'd coerced the sheriff into an orgasm, eagerly lapping up the sticky fluids. She stood back up and gave Annabelle the biggest smile. \u201cWorth every penny.\u201d She said, amused at the state of the weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kept going for the remainder of the day. Texas was hooked back up to the milking machine, providing Annabelle a steady source of weasel milk to serve. Every so often another patron would ask for the special and ravage the sheriff's pussy. The weasel's mind was still swimming from the hazing it received from the witchdoctor. Though she had managed to stop mooing she wasn't able to produce a single intelligible word any more. After a long day Annabelle finally closed shop and commended the weasel on her contributions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't wait to see how much money you'll make me tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a long night for Texas as she laid on the table, bound with her body feeling heavy from all the 'work' it had been put through for hours. Her mind kept on drifting to her deputy, almost tearing up at the thought of what April was going through.... That poor, curvy girl with long soft hair and tat tight white top that hugged those large DD breasts. The weasel had to shake those thoughts of the deputy leaning over her, touching her new and improved body all over. <br>\r\nSuddenly, the weasel jumped awake breathing heavily as she noticed the sunlight shining through the windows, the leather collar around her neck, and the warm toast and eggs laying next to her on a plat on top of the bar counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... Moo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noticed that did ya sheriff? Or should I say, former sheriff?\" Annebelle chuckled from behind as she petted Texas almost like she was a puppy, slowly holding infront of the terrified weasel two documents with a wicked smile. One was a copy of the sheriff's resignation with a fake signature and the other, papers signed by the forger and the mayor herself to let Texas give up all  her sentient rights to Annebelle\u2026. It was a horror that the woman could barely believe! Her heart sank deeper than ever before. Annebelle, this woman who was milking her senseless and selling her for sex.... Now LEGALLY OWNED HER! IT was a horrible fate and one that somehow was making the weasel start to feel hot deep inside. Almost as if part of her enjoyed this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... Moo... Moo! MOO!\" Texas tried to protest while reaching out for the papers to snatch them away! But Annebelle was too fast for her! Pulling gently on her leash and keeping the papers just out of arms reach, toying with her new slave in childlike delight at her helpless state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Bad Bimbo! Now sit!\" Annebelle ordered firml, her smile growing bigger as Texas felt her body obey every word. She literally was now sitting on the counter, feeling her mind grow calmer after following the huge cow's orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! Works like a charm! Listen here you little slut. That fancy witchdoctor made a few changes to your mind! You can'tspeak unless we say so, and anythingwe say, you'll love to do! Now eat up and get ready for buisness Tex! Don't wanna disappoint our customers! A lot of them are really eager to get a piece of that fine ass!\" The cow gloated with a wild laugh, watching Texas get on all fours on the counter and eat her meal with her ass high in the air, allowing her mistress to give her a large smack on her plump jiggly rear, feeling her pussy get wet at the onslaught of humilliation. No matter what Texas tried to think, a loud voice kept on telling her in her mind that this new fate was absolutely hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer meal however was cut short as the doors opened up to reveal a large skunk woman, dressed like a high class lady with a white top and a long black dress with frills but that dress couldn't hide her curves! She was about 8 feet tall with a volumptious, sinfully feminine with very wide hips a waspish waist and an impressive pair of enormous, beach ball sized, marshmallow soft breasts, perfectly round and most likely Q cups. Her face was as well painted as the Mona Lisa, supple lips with  coral blue #2 semi gloss lipstick... Or maybe it's coral blue #5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Annebelle was unamused by the surprise guest, hand now placed on her hip while the other hand stroked Texa's back, making her nearly shiver in delight against her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget the time or something Lucy? I ain't open until one hour from now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Charming as usual aren't you Anne? You're lucky I like em rough.~\" Lucy replied in a near flirtatious tone, grinning smugly as she licked her lips, eyes scanning Texas from head to toe at least eight times before Annebelle stomped in front of her, glaring at the skunk while Texas had no other choice but to hide behind the large cow.... The first time she ever wanted to be behind her in all her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywho, I'm here to do business. Smiling Jack's goons were kind enough to tell my girls Texa's recent 'career change'. And to cut to the chase, I want to buy that ass... Oh what people will pay just to pound her and make her squeal.~ I can easily make her one of my top five whores.~\" This giantess like skunk drooled hungrily, imagining the sheriff, milked endlessly, tattooed, spanked and sat on all at once in a large orgy party for her girls. And before Annebelle could protest or say no, she reached into her tail and pulled out a large suitcase, half the size of her body and slammed it on the ground, revealing to her more money than both the bar owner and the busty weasel had ever seen in their lifetime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooooo~ Just hand over her papers, you get this loot and we all sing merrily and happily. I've already asked Jack for April and I'm hoping to get the pair of em together. Pound their brains out to the point they're humping like horny bunnies on overdrive! So? Come on Anne! I'll even give you full discounts and deliver the milk to you! Wins all around!\"</span></div></div>",

And unless you wanna enjoy being on the milk machine I suggest ya beat it.\" Annebelle commanded the woman while walking towards her, pressing her large brests against the skunks untill they almost started to envelope the buisnesswoman's mounds. Her glare was firm and menacing, letting the skunk know that if she didn't leave now, she'd definetely go through with that threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by the way, Maybe you should tell Lucy that if she's too afraid to come out here and face me herself, maybe she should get a impersonator that actually LOOKS like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Hey! Hey! Lots of crazy folks live around these parts. Remember that mouse Lil Mossy? A cat gang literally tied her up and farted on her before selling her to an elephant. Can't blame her for not wanting to stay outside for too long.\" The skunk woman replied as she put the money back away inside her tail with her other hand raised, showing that she was unarmed and not about to start a fight with someone like her. In the end, she just quickly and in a fast haste rushed out of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Let us know if you change your mind though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said beat it!\" The cow lady continued to call out before rubbing her forhead, making sure that there would be no more further interuptions before the tavern was meant to be open for the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... Nerve of some women. Right Texas?.... Tex?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the large lady calledout to her bimbo slave, Texas herself was only left drooling lightly as she oogled the giant woman's assets. That view from behind wat like eying two planets crashing together. Every erogenous zone on Texa's body began to tingle and engorge at the memory of her being stuffed into that crack. It was damn hot! She couldn't even remember why she even escaped that heavenly zone before!  Part of the weasel's mind briefly consider leaving, but the 'pleasant memories' ketp her pussy wet and firmly in control of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnebelle's ass was previously the most rancide, vile ass the weasel ever had the displeasure of being under, was now like soft smooth mounds of a goddess, sm elling like all the glorious scents of warm bread and soothing orchids. Even the scent of fine wine was pale in comaparison to Annebelle's ass. It was like a magnet for her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Texa's mind was drowning in lust, the cow started to raise her red dress so the helpless weasel could take in the full view. A sneeze erupted from Texa's nose out of nowhere but by now, the scent that made her nose curl before Abra shared that glorious drink with her only made it another quality the weasel adored about the in the presence of the beauteous ladies of Gold Springs. Something about the slimy sweat around their butts in the glistening just tickled her nose But at the same time, they did make it quite easy to sit there and stare, watching true perfection of their supple, female form twist and writhe for nothing more than her amusement and love. Why didn't she just worship them all the time? There were so many people she needed to bow down before just to tell them how sorry she was for being mean to them! Arousal kept on building within Texas, unchecked by restraint as her mind and reasoning kept on losing itself to her lust, drowning in the warm pleasure that she was singing deeper into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex inhaled, deeply, and felt more relaxed with every passing second, suddenly aware that Anna's power over her seemed to be strengthening. Her nipples and ass, making her vision more and more clouded and harder to resist as if they were the source of her power. Whatever fragment of her that wasn't corrupted by her libido tried to yank her view aside but all she wound up doing is realizing how wonderfully Curvatious Annebelle looked, how sinfully succulent her breasts are, and how deeply they\u2019ve rooted themselves into her consciousness. Each breath she took relaxed her muscles more and more, compounded by the way her mistress swayed her body, silently inviting Texa's to come in closer for a 'reward'..... What was left of Texa's original mindset whipered as she realized that she couldn't break free from this fate.... Nore did she even want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose pendulous, hypnotic lumps of Annebell's flesh slapped together as they\u2019re moved more forcefully, more aggressively to lure the weasel in, making her crawl on all fours, humongous breasts swaying side to side with each breath untill suddenly... Slap! Her face planted itsel into the mind-melting backside with Annebelle reaching one arm around to push the former sherrif in deeper. The wasel then began to nuzzle her soft pumped anus happily as her groping took on a new sense of urgency while she french kissed that backdoor harder than any lover kissed their partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexa's face was completely smothered by her bolvine honeypot, plush, vast backside, and thick thighs. She grinded her vagina from the weasel'sr nose, all the way down to her chin, where she barely hade time to breathe, smearing her face with a mixture of her girl cum and hot gooey sweat. The bimbo could barely see her misteress with this ass over her smothering cheeks, flushed with pleasure and beginning to lightly moan in pleasure. It was unclear how much time had passed but judging by the amout of scoundrels and villains peeking in, it had to be close to opening time now before Annebell quickly grabbed Texas and thrusted her hyperfeminine face into her pussy, blasting cum into her mouth as they both orgasmed, breathing heavily before Annebell picked up Texa's by her large marshmallow soft breast and used them to wipe off her sweat like a rag before dropping her slave in a puddle of her own cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that, I can REALLY get used to. Might even offer that mouth for these girls to enjoy... Might even hang photos of it on the wall.\u201d Annebell began to ponder alout as she stood before Texas, soaking in that dopey lustful smile on her pink lips before getting fully dressed and looking almost no different from when she walked in the room just a few hours  ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs cute as you are Tex and as much as these people wouldn\u2019t mind us going again, I\u2019m afraid having you act as a pornstar fr free ain't gonna pay the bills. Get cleaned up and lick up this mess you made.\u201d An, without another word, the large lady left the room, leaving Texas to clean up, soaked in a variety of juices. And to think.... This was just the morning!</span></div></div>",

Having no real plan Texas grabbed a bottle of whiskey and threw it on the ground splashing liquor and glass everywhere. She redirected her attention to what was directly behind her which as luck would have it was a gas lantern. She hopped the bar and shoved the lantern in Annabelle and Grizzel's location, the lantern broke and the area behind the bar combusted into flames. The two fat tormentors avoided the fire and were frantically trying to beat down the fire. Annabelle was angry beyond belief searching for Texas, but by the time she found her Texas was smirking at the doorway tipping her hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas sighed in relief, glad to be away from Annabelle's rump. After rinsing her mouth of butt crack with some scotch she stole Tex spit out the alcohol after it purged some of the taste, she was afraid that taste and smell will be with her for a while but she trekked on regardless. She arrived at the large wooden building labeled \"Cleo's Kinky Clothing\". Texas wasn't sure how to go about this and looked in the window to see what she was getting into. Currently all she saw were a variety skimpy clothing for regular girls like Texas to absolutely tent sized underwear. Just then Cleo walked in front of Tex's view, the massive hippo had rippling fat particularly in her butt. Being the creature she was, she was easily bigger than Roxxie and Georgia. Currently she was wearing black panties and a dark blue corset pushing up her breats. Her head was shaved but there was some remaining blonde fuzz, she was also wearing red lipstick.

Something was off, Cleo was nowhere in sight. There's no way someone of her size could just disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Texas heard a creaking sound above her. She looked up just in time to see two gray cheek clad in black panties slam down onto her. \"Welcome Texas always nice to have the Sheriff in my place of business, but I don't allow firearms at my store regardless of who they are.\" The hippo lady said with a slight accent. Cleo may have been born in Africa but she was raised in America, particularly in the city where the lingerie business is a little too competitive which is why she moved to Gold Springs. Cleo sat up revealing the weasel crushed into a butt print on her welcome mat. Cleo walked over to Texas removing her gun from her holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas twitched and groaned as she was back to being 2D, it hasn't even been an hour since her last squashing. Cleo then pulled back a curtain behind the front desk revealing a huge steampunk esque machine and threw Tex's gun into it.

Alright Cleo tell me!\" Texas said feeling triumphant. \"Oh sure thing and before I do answer me this. Why should I?\" Cleo said with a smile that was getting bigger. Tex was bout to pull her gun, but she recalled it was turned into lingerie decorations. She thought of the bribe angle, but she left her wallet at Annabelle's place. All Texas could muster in her moment of confusion was a simple \"Uh...\". \"That's what I thought!\" Cleo said shoving Tex on the floor, before she could react, the hippo lady slammed her foot down on Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cleo rubbed her foot back and forth and squished Tex's face between her toes she started talking. \"You aren't in the position to make deals Texas, that being said I'm really on my own side, not Smiling Jacks. So I'll give you a fighting chance at saving April, but first I want to see some humility. I'll give you the location to your partner in exchange for helping me with a client. There's this pig lady from Russia who's come all the way to America to become a famous strong woman in the American carnival circuit. She spends most of her time working out and toning her muscles, especially her glutes. Her cheeks keep growing and bursting through her underwear, so she wants me to help her get some new panties that will stretch with her on her last day of training. Now I could make it but I'd need to buy specialized material that is very expensive, or a nice stretchy sheriff could be her thong for a day! That's my deal Tex, you be a pig's panties for a twenty-four hours, then you get to save April, deal?\" Cleo explained lifting her foot revealing Tex squashed into a footprint. The very idea of this disgusted Texas beyond belief, but this was her only lead, and who knows if she'd find any other clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Cleo sighed and put her hands on her abundant hips, shaking her head sadly, then removed her foot from the sheriff and peeled her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Texas. Too proud to be a pig's panties to save your deputy, hmm? Well fine. Now poor innocent April is going to suffer... and you'll still be panties!\" The weasel squeaked in terror as the hippo whipped her away to her backroom, which was full of steam presses, sewing equipment and workbenches. \"You should have taken my offer, Texas! My friend will get her panties either way, but now they'll be a more... long-term pair!\" Wasting no time, Cleo slammed the mushed-up sheriff down on a steam press and swiftly jammed the lid shut, turning it up to it's highest setting. Instantly steam bellowed out from under it accompanied by the screeches of a weasel in trouble, and when the hippo opened it again, Texas had been perfectly pressed into an oblong sheet of shimmering material, her horrified face staring up at the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply divine, Texas! Oh, you'll make such wonderful material!\" Cleo whipped the weasel off the press and onto her workbench, and mercilessly fell into a frenzy of snipping and stitching, scraps of weasel fur going flying as Cleo perfected her art, producing an absolute masterpiece. When she finally held Texas aloft, the weasel had been converted into an absolutely splendid thong, the hippo having added insult to injury by making her face the inside back. \"She will absolutely adore this... Too bad about the law in this town, but I'm sure Georgia will take over now that the previous sheriff's... gone undercover?\" She chuckled at her own pun, then stuffed the Texas thong into an envelope and sealed it up, scratching some details on the front and marching off to the post office to get it sent off as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas's new owner was everything she had been scared of, and more. The second the weasel received a look at the gigantic, fat, Russian bodybuilding pig, glistening with sweat, she knew her life was over. Cleo's friend wasted no time in whipping off her old pair of underwear, which Texas noted with dread was heavily stained, ripped and freyed, and pulled on the new pair without a second thought. Texas's last view of the outside world was a picture of two giant, sweaty ass cheeks, before she was plunged into darkness, forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig went on to finish her training in record time, a fact she attributed to her new 'lucky' pair of panties, and from then on, they were inseparable (Mostly because the pig's sweat was like glue). Texas was worn every second of every day, her life now consisting of unending crushing, sweat and pig farts, while the pig trained, stretched, ate and slept. Due to her awful personal hygiene, Texas was almost never removed unless the pig needed to go to the bathroom, and sometimes not even then. However, Cleo was right about one thing. Texas did make fantastic material. She never ripped or frayed, and stretched perfectly around the pig's ass no matter how much weight she gained or lost. The fiercest sheriff in the west was now the comfiest panties in the world, and so it would be... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForever.</span></div></div>",

As bad as the terms were she was completely at the curvaceous hippo's mercy and unable to even squirm free from the massive woman's toes. Even if she did, what hope did she have of saving April now? She was unarmed, out of money since Annebelle or some other varmite is most likely now buying rounds for everyone with her money. This, was hopeless. Still, she could still do one thing for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But only if April returns normal, unflattened and not gassed out of her mind..... And make sure she stays like that for the rest of her life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Cleo pressed her foot down harder on Texas before throwing her head back in laughter, her enourmous breasts and lovehandles jiggling violently with each breath before she wiped a small tear from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're trapped between my toes and you think you're in a place to make the demands? Oh that's so precious it's almost cute.\" She gasped with more laughter, releasing Texas from her stinky position before picking her up from the back of her neck, tossing the weak flattened girl helplessly onto the counter, a contract and pen being placed infront of her while she breathed in heavily for fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what the heck. Why not? Write your terms to the contract and then sign. Don't want anyone saying this wasn't a fair agreement.\" Cleo chortled while standing behind Texas, cutting off any possible escape route while the weasel slowly picked up the pen as cautious as a mouse, and began to add her terms, mentally yelling at herself to stay strong. April would surely be able to find and save her. She was a great deputy after all. As the signature was finished, her thoughts were disrupted as Cleo picked her up off the floor by her ponytail  and gave the now former sherrif one big sloppy kiss, practically flooding the smaller girl's mouth with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled back the weasel then fell to the ground with a loud thud, coughing as she rubbed her tongue against her mouth to get rid of that fowl slimy taste. Anger flooded her mind before shock quickly took its place. Cleo was towering above the weasel with a pair of scissors in one hand and her entire ponytail in another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the devil you whale sized galoot?! That wasn't part of the deal!\" She yelled in fear as she tried to crawl back, not liking the gleam in this gigantic foe's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please sherrif. You really aren't the smartest. In the contract, that you seem to have failed to read in your self pitty, I, as the sole OWNER of you, get to decide what happens to you. And I'm thinking this silky soft hair of yours would make a very sexy fur coat to go with you!\" Cleo grinned from ear to ear as she then tossed the hair into her machine, pressing more buttons before a thin lace coat with beautiful and elaborate patterns was sown with a fancy fur like trim, making Cleo's wicked mile grow even wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always read the small print 'Sherrif'.\" She continued to mock before walking over to the Sherrif, pointing to the door for the backroom as she loomed over her powerless victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip sheriff. Then start crawling.  Time to see some of that humility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to protest, Texas knew that this was the only way to get April home safe. She just needed to endure the humiliation. so, with her head hanging low, she, pulled off her clothing while her tormentor watched, licking her lips lightly at the sight. Sith her rear raised high, the weasel crawled on all fours, pushing open the backdoor quietly before gazing upon what looked more like a gigantic engine room with how big all the backroom, which was full of steam presses, sewing equipment and workbenches. Wasting no time, Cleo picked up the sheriff and placed her down on a steam press, slamming down the lid and jamming it shut, turning it up to it's highest setting. Instantly steam bellowed out from under it accompanied by the screeches of the once proud weasel being in horrific ammounts of distress, and when the hippo opened it again, Texas had been perfectly pressed into an oblong sheet of shimmering material, her horrified face staring up at the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful! Simply wonderful dear Texas! You may have been a idiot goodie-two-shoes but look at you now! The finest material for underwear in miles! Makes me wanna hire  someone to catch your whole family for me. I can just see it now. 'The Stanton family set!'\" Cleo squealed with glea as she tossed the terrified material onto one of her workbenches, spending hours snipping, sowing and crafting Texas into one of her finest works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippos tood proudly as she looked at the complete set with pride almost as enourmous as her rear. On the XXXXXL mannequin in a sluttery pose was the former sherrif as a specialized lace G-string panty with the words 'Kiss here' on the rear in fnacy handwriting. Sexy as hell, stretchable beyond compare, suitable for long workouts, keeping in stains and smells and as comfortable as the purest silk. It was practically gleaming. and with the sherrif cam her own hair as an equally as good matching fur coat with the sherrif badge over one of the mannequins nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel happy Texas. Many girls will be willing to sell their homes for you.~ I think I'll....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn't believe she'd agreed to this! Yet here she was, a pair of panties and a coat. On account of the intricate stitchwork and the fact that scraps of weasel material that got left over to stuff a seat cushion pillow ensured that there was virtually no coming back from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks despondently as her less than favorite... and even some who weren't miscreants... stopped by the window to stare, gawk, laugh or rub one off just at the sight of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it wasn't until about a day later that Texas saw April Briggs, her deputy, intact and perfectly normal, come up to the window, jaw agape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas cringed.

I'd have thought you would have been smarter than that. There's too much at stake here to honor the letter of a contract. I had some changes made to it and notarized it, all perfectly legal.

I'm glad ya've come around and see this is where you belong...\" Georgia cooed, drawing Panties over her enormous, jiggling thunder thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of Panties that hated the surrender, the submission, the calm, was becoming quieter and quieter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.. and it silenced as Panties was drawn up over Georgia's ass, fitting perfectly. Panties' face was stretched across her former deputy's backside from the middle of one cheek all the way across to the other, their muffs pressed together, offering both continuous stimulation when worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanties relaxed, feeling more complete and whole and ironically, <b>free,</b> than ever before in her life. Free from responsibility, worry, concern...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as her former deputy patted her own ass through her, the marvelous new panties...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now... bet you're feelin' like an idjit for not letting me make you two my underwear years ago, eh? Heh heh heh heh...\" Georgie snickered, then fished Bra out of the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Panties, who had a look of surrendered bliss, whimpering meekly as the mare held her in front of her face too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a nice gig going before you showed up, cutie. But hey... no hard feelings. It all worked out in the end, didn't it? You got to taste the small town life and see what it's really like out here.

This is a damned fine look for me...\" The new sheriff vainly preened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBra felt the fullness of Georgia's bust smooshing against her, glossing her up in sweat too. The warmth, the slick skin on skin, the way Georgia cupped her breasts through her and let them bounce...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBra couldn't help it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLURT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia looked down in surprise where a splatter of girlcum had added to the slick canyon of cleavage, then laughed. \"Heh heh... hahahahaw!!! Popped your cherry, eh Bra? Even Panties had more restraint than you! Heh heh. Welcome to the ensemble!\" She cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the moment Bra gave up and let go, following her sheriff's example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was that a golden age of crime came to Golden Springs, and every time the Marshals or Rangers came to lay down the law, Cleo found fresh new material to make more amazing undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia paid good money to have the names Texas Stanton and April Briggs erased from every record in America, right up to the census in DC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo record that they had ever existed remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Bra and Panties couldn't have possibly cared less, having found true meaning and purpose as the underwear of their superior.</span></div></div>",

I think it suits you ladies much better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underwear items exchanged nervous glances via the mirror as Roxie felt up the mannequin through them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the whole outfit!\" Roxie declared, then stripped her vest, shirt and shorts off, flinging them at the wall with such force that they spread across the wood, the sweaty garments seeping into the wall to the point that they'll never scrape off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBra felt herself peeled off the dummy and meeped as her arm straps were cut off, making her a tube bra. She felt Roxie's thick rack squeezing into her confines, her body fit only to hold back breasts now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roo donned the hat, flipping the fox tail that had once belonged to Bra over her shoulder with a grin, then stuffed her thick, sausage-like digits into the gloves that used to be part of Bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanties could only watch, whimpering shrilly. She wished she could go back, smack herself silly for even considering this, for not considering all the details. Now she and <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Alice</span> Bra were just clothing, just property...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBra whimpered softly as Roxie finally stopped fussing with her, squeaking as those oversized feet got shoved into Bra's leggings that were once her calves! The material easily stretches over the outlaw's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie slung the dark weasel-hair vest around her shoulders, admiring the shiny gleam of the flattened star and finally reached for Panties, stepping through her leg holes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Leg holes.... I have leg holes for Pet's sake...! I'm not s'possed to have leg holes...! I'm a Sheriff, not underwear!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and then slowly sliding Panties up, creasing smoothly over her calves, then her knees, accumulating oily sweat, affording the underwear a healthy sheen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she's snugly buried in her arch-nemesis' buttcrack, her vision flanked by twin, yellow globes on either side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm! Snug! But flexible! Hell... I don't think I'll need to take these off that often!\" Roxie cackled, smacking her ass through the former sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strolled out the door, her gang of cats, skunks, rats and rhinos laughing and jeering at the dressy duo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me in, Golden Springs! This is the look of this town's biggest businesswoman! And this is what happens to the brainless twits that make a habit of getting on my bad side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBra and Panties whined and groaned in humiliation at the laughter, especially when the gang girls came around and groped their boss, feeling up her new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmrrrmmmph...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie heard both of her garments squeal in response, but to her delight, she couldn't tell them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buttercup! Let's ride home!\" The giant roo sounded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanties' eyes widened in dread as the obese horse clopped up, then let Roxie board before trotting off into the sunset, her ass smooshing against the smelly saddle while Bra bounces, tightly cupping the roo's bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whenever, from there on out, until she disposed of the degraded, rotten, smelly clothes in a pig sty many years later, when asked about her outfit, she'd simply smile and say 'Just find two heroes who suck at their jobs and visit Miss Cleo in Golden Springs. Tell her Roxie sent'cha!\"</span></div></div>",

Despite all her wriggling and writhing, she wasn't able to dislodge herself one inch. Thankfully, she knew she wouldn't be stuck in the mud for very long, because she could hear heavy-hoofed footsteps thundering behind her. A pair of meaty hands grabbed ahold of her and peeled her off the ground before shaking the mud off of her like she was a doormat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, lookee here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran up Texas's pancaked spine when she realized who it was. Annabelle, the owner of the tavern and long time criminal, had her in what may be the most compromising position of her life. This was going to be six kinds of awful. Annabelle looked her over, checking both sides of her, then laughed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that dang ol' welcome mat I ordered from the catalog! It's about time too, my last one got trampled into tatters a week ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas's eyes turned to pinpricks.

Jus' need a little something to keep the wind from blowing it away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle grabbed a bottle of paste and smeared it up and down Texas's back half, then splatted her against the ground right in front of the door. Then, just for good measure, she stamped her hooves over and over on top of Texas until she was absolutely certain that the little weasel wouldn't be budging anytime soon. Then she stomped on it a few more times just because she felt like it. Then Annabelle grabbed the dinnerbell hanging right beside her door, ringing it loudly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey y'all! The Crushed Weasel's got a free 'round for everybody who gets inside in the next minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle wisely ducked inside of the bar to avoid the coming chaos, but poor Texas could do nothing but sit there and whimper as the storm of footsteps drew closer. In one brutal, loud, painful instant, Texas was trampled upon by at least two dozen pairs of muddy boots, torn shoes, and even bare feet. She was left in such a miserable state by the end of it that it made that coating of glue seem redundant. Texas wasn't going anywhere anytime soon, she was now The Crushed Weasel's namesake.</span></div></div>",

So, after pouring herself a desperately needed cup of black coffee, she dug through her desk and found her old help wanted ad from back when she first recruited April. As she headed out to the center of town to paste it up, she noticed more than few townsfolk were muttering under their breath about it. It was never a good sign when a sheriff was looking for a new deputy, especially given what tended to happen to folks around here when they turned up missing. But, undeterred, Texas put up her poster and headed back to the office to rustle up what little supplies she had for a posse. She wasn't expecting much, so if nobody showed up before sundown she'd just have to head out on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was five in the evening when Texas had decided she had enough ammunition, rope and non-stick grease to try and tussle with Smiling Jacks, but she was still out of a partner. She was just about to head back to the square to peel down her poster when there came a knock at her door. She opened it up and was nearly bowled over by a mass of feathers inviting herself in. Standing just a foot over texas and weighing close to three times her, was Clementine Clucknoggin, the eldest (and dumbest) daughter of the Clucknoggin estate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Clucknoggins were, as their name would imply, probably the furthest from \"learnded folk\" as you could come, but Pa Clucknoggin made up for his lack of literary prowess with his ornery temper and his virility. The Clucknoggin family was the primary reason that there was no official census taken of Gold Springs, both because of their ever expanding family tree and the fact that most census takers or any \"gummit men\" that set foot on their property lose whatever they had above their shoulders. But while they weren't exactly civilized, the Clucknoggins as a whole had a profound hatred for criminals and so they were about the only ones Texas could rely upon to resist the bullying that the local crimebosses put out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeelll howw dee, Missy Sheriff!\" clucked the chubby chicken, \"I's saw your poster up onna bul't'n board and I wanna helps ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas cocked an eyebrow, \"You can read?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot naw, I had tha paperboy read it ta me, and he said it said you's lookin' fer a new depudee, and that I oughta get my big stinkin' butt outta his face, which was an awful weird thing to print onna poster iffn I do says so myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas weighed her options. Clementine wasn't exactly a perfect partner, in fact she could be more of a liability than not. There had been more than a few times in which Texas had to cut a chase short because she ended up running into her fat feathered ass and she didn't realize it till hours later. But on the otherhand, she was big, strong and packing her paw's rusty double barrel.</span></div></div>",

Consider yourself officially, temporarily deputized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClementine's face lit up and she let out a triumphant, clucking cheer. She clapped her wings and stomped her feet, with her massive girth shaking the entire sheriff's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy! Oh boy!\" She said, \"Wait until paw hears that I'm a big time hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on,\" Texas took Clementine's hands and held her steady, \"Take it easy, you're not a hero just yet. First we gotta save my partner. Now grab yer stuff, we're gonna ride out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClementine nodded, and the two readied themselves. Texas snatched up as much of her weaponry as she could: A pair of six-shooters, a rifle, ammunition for the both, a few of her sticks of flash-powder and a shot of whiskey for luck. Clementine didn't need nearly as much, just a bag of seed and as much shotgun ammo she could stuff into her purse. The two saddled up (Clementine borrowing a spare mule which struggled with her weight) and rode out for what they hoped would be where Jacks would be holed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Gut Gorge was a favorite spot of Jacks', given that it was both easily defensible and terribly intimidating. The duo reached the gorge right at sunset, but even that late the guards wandering around were impossible to miss. It looked like Texas had found exactly where they were holding April, otherwise it'd make no sense to have this much muscle staked out. Texas and Clem hid their horses behind a ridge and snuck up to the gorge, keeping well out of the patrols sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'think this is where theys at, Sheriff?\" Clem asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Texas said, \"And I think I know how we're gonna handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!

That being said she'd need to train Clementine, she may have her Paw's shotgun but Texas would've bet the entire sheriff's budget that she doesn't know how to use it. \"Ugh sure Clementine I'd love to bring ya on board.\" Texas said meekly. \"Really? No foolin' aw shucks thank ya sheriff whatsa muh first job.\" Clementine said eager to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question stumped Tex, she was too inexperienced to ride with her. As she was thinking Tex was rubbing her sore back that had knotted up thanks to this stressful kidnapping situation. Just then as she saw Clementine's large almost manlike hands she got an idea. \"Well Clementine, most of the sheriff stuff can wait. What I really need you to do is give me a massage.\" Texas said. \"A what?\" Clementine said scratching her head. Texas couldn't believe it, was this girl so dumb that she didn't even know what a massage was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on her phrasing Tex decided to show her visually. \"Well ya see Clementine my muscles are all tight, like this, I need ya to smooth them out.\" Texas said balling up her hand into a fist then opening it leaving her hand flat. \"They do?! Shoot I dudnt even know theys needed that. Can ya show me again?\" She said still a little confused. Texas sighed and repeated the process. \"Just grab my muscled and smooth them out.\" Texas said. All the while Clementine watched trying to put two and two together then something clicked. \"Oh yeah now I know what you talkin' bout, I do that to muh smaller cousins all tha time. That feels good huh? Well when I do it I don't use muh hands.\" Clementine said walking behind Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas smiled believing she'd finally gotten her point across to this bird brained idiot. Then Tex put Clementine's words together in her head. Before she could say anything, Clementine threw Texas to the floor and slammed her butt down on her flattening her instantly. The fat chicken then grinded her rear all over Tex side to side. \"I think I felt them knots you is talkin' bout. Fer like a second, suppose I should crush down real hard to make sure they don't come back.\" Clementine said not understanding how muscles work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was in torment as she was squished beyond belief. There was also the unbelievable stench, even through Clementine's overalls, did she never bathe?! \"I also noticed that this here place smells kind of funny, all these different flowers and crap. They belong outside! Don't worry Tex I'll fill this place up with the right smell. Come to think of it you smell like that too! I'll fix ya right up!\" She said raising her butt up then crashing it back up over and over before planting herself right on Tex. The next thing the weasel knew were large gurgles coming from Clementine's stomach and then, PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTttttttttttttttttttt, a huge rancid fart exploded on Texas body, exploding the floor underneath them, thankfully the Sheriff's office didn't have a basement but it left Texas in the dirt still crushed under the feathered globes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta make sure that nasty flower smell don't bother you no more Tex.\" Clementine said rising up leaving a tan paste on the ground that was Texas. She then picked up the Sheriff, unbuttoned the back flap of her overalls revealing her naked butt, then shoved her in. \"Yep ya won't need to worry bout me not smellin' this way I usually almost drown in tubs, but paw says muh stink makes the home better and I wanna give you a thank ya present, not only am I lettin' ya smell like my hindquarters but it's gonna be your new natural smell, forever!\" Clementine said buttoning her overalls sealing in Tex. She then twerked and slammed her rump in the floors and on the walls. Inside her butt Tex was in torment as the fart from earlier was rubbed into her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'd say that about does it!\" Clementine said walking over to a chair, unbuttoning her overalls, an farting Tex into it. The tan disk with green stink lines emanating off of her tried her best to moan over the torture she received. \"You must be so relaxed, no ya don need to thank me it's all part of the job. Now if you'll excuse my I need to spread my scent all over this place.\" The obese bird said waddling off. Texas had to reform, April still needed to be rescued, but would she be successful?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Things were looking especially grim, with losing her partner on one hand and losing her badge on the other. Trying to resist Jack in this instance seemed foolhardy and would just end up humiliating her. But giving up her position as sheriff meant giving up the town entirely to the scum and villains that inhabited it. She owed Gold Springs more than that. It seemed like the best option was not to give in to these absurd demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas crumpled up the note, poured herself some of her freshly brewed coffee and sat down to write up the want ad for a new deputy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days later, over in Smiling Jacks hidden holding pen, the rabbit in question was getting hopping mad. A lackey of his had just had the misfortune of being the one to tell him that Texas has not given into their demands and was apparently still going around town being a sheriff like she didn't even care<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddaya mean she's ignoring us?\" Jacks howled, \"You threw the other notes too, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir, she didn't even look at 'em! 'cept for the one that almost hit 'er.\" replied the trembling bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Jacks was doing anything but smiling now, but Seething Jacks didn't roll off the tongue quite as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINE! Well if she won't respond, then we'll make an example out of her partner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacks pointed to the pen, where April was hogtied in the mud beside the county fair's prizewinning \"mammoth\" hog which he had stolen a week earlier. The sow was sleeping soundly, but Jacks didn't care. He snatched up a prod and jabbed the hog in the side. It didn't wake up, but it DID roll over towards the terrified April. She flailed about and tried to avoid the smelly hog belly, but there was absolutely no chance of it. The colossal pile of pork tumbled over on top of her, crushing her into the mud under at least two tons of stinking ham gut. And that hog just kept soundly snoozing, for hours and hours and hours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Texas arrived at the sheriff's office, to open up and check the status of her want ad. Sitting right on the welcome mat was a plain parcel, tied up in rope. She was a little suspicious, but it was too early in the morning for her to really care, so she brought it inside with her and sliced it open with her bowie knife. Sitting inside was a pair of panties, ones that were a muddy red brown. They had a distinctly foxy feel and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, April!\" Texas shouted, \"We need to figure out some way to change you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas caught herself. She looked around. She was still out of a partner, so she didn't exactly have the manpower to go on an unrelated adventure and leave the town to police itself. Plus those panties looked pretty comfortable. She gave a devilish smirk and slipped the partner-turned-panties onto her shapely behind. They were a perfect fit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry April,\" She said, \"I'll make sure to take you on all my most exciting missions! That way you're not missing out on anything!

It would also be the perfect place to store a kidnapped deputy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun began to set on the horizon, the weasel's horse drew up to the entrance to the gorge and Texas hopped off, quickly tying her up and continuing on foot.

Just past the cattle was what looked like a fortified mining foreman's office that would seem to be a perfect place for a gang boss to set up shop.

Not a sign of Jacks or her crew to be found, in fact the base looks like it hadn't been touched in some time. It was all disappointing beyond words for Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas spit on the ground and said, \"I guess the only thing to do now is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Texas was cut off by a tremendous rumbling sound. The entire shack seemed to shake beneath her feet, and Texas could barely hear herself think with all the noise. It took her a moment, but she quickly realized that the sound was coming from...</span></div></div>",

She thought for a second that someone was out there with her, but she almost immediately saw the crowd of cows that were rushing past, deeper into the gorge. She let out a sigh of relief, thanking her lucky stars that she had been just barely out of the stampede's reach. She stepped down off the office's steps and into the mud, adjusting her hat as she thought to herself,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I need to check out the- Yipes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA misstep in the slippery muck sent Texas tumbling ass over teakettle. She splattered into the sludge, getting herself almost completely covered in what she prayed was mostly mud. She tried to pull herself up, but the suction of the muck was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no big deal, I just need to carefully pull myself up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas slowly yanked one leg out of the slop, and was making to pull the other out when she heard that rumbling return. Her eyes shrunk and her heart sank. It was all perfectly clear to her: The cows, having realized the gorge was a dead end, and redirected their stampede back out the way they came. Which was directly in her direction. She tried to keep a cool head and pull her other leg out, but ass the rumbling and rampant mooing grew louder and louder she couldn't keep calm. She yanked and struggled and shouted, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cascade of cattle descended upon her and nearly fifty fat, filth-crushed hooves crashed down on her, smashing her into the muck and manure. The only mercy of the several tons of beef pulverizing her poor body was that it was at least quick. But as quick as it was, it had left Texas completely crushed into the mud. Her flattened form, combined with the suction of the sludge made it impossible for her to extricate herself without any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut help came quicker than she thought it would've, in the form of...</span></div></div>",

Flanking her on either side were two more bunnies, each one carrying a rifle and surely more members of the rabbit's gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought for sure I'd have to teach one of my girls a lesson for letting the cattle get loose, but instead it's looking like they earned a promotion!\" The bunny continued, putting her hands on her hips as she looked over the powerless Texas. \"Looks like you need a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacks nodded to her underlings, and they slung their rifles onto their backs, walking forwards. While the sheriff muffled protested, the rabbits grabbed an end of her each and slowly peeled her up, the sucking mud making their jobs rather difficult, but they were practised at this, and soon held Texas between them like a sheet, the weasel as thin as a dime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls!

But her body was beaten so severely that every attempt was completely futile, eventually only leaving her completely exhausted. Realizing the futility, she could only wait until they eventually made it to Smiling Jacks' hideout, which was crawling with her henchmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough one person stood out like a sore thumb, as Texas noticed a little bunny child, possibily in her mid teens. The child's excessively adorable appearance was heavily contrasted by her absurdly wide hips which would stick out twice as wide as her torso, complimented by a terrifyingly monstrous ghetto booty which rivaled the size of Jacks. She was only wearing a simple shirt, as she had nothing covering herself from the waist down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were brought closer, you noticed that the little bunny was holding a 1\u00bd foot long bean burrito in her one hand, and a soiled, broken pair of panties in her other, which was drooling chunky excrement on the ground beneath her.<br>\r\nWith a rather sad expression, the bunny would look to Jack as she spoke.<br>\r\n\"Auntie! My asshole destroyed another pair.\" She tossed the pair of underwear on the ground, as it was bathing in a puddle of liquid diarrhea, complimented by a disgustingly large log of shit poking out like a flag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack let out a comforting smile as she laughed. \"Oh Kim, that's the fourth pair in two days. I still can't believe you tore your last pair in half just by farting.\" Jack reached out and rubbed her niece's head, as Kim's ears twitched in response. A wide grin would stretch across the little bunny's face as she closed her eyes in content, as a small series of meaty, wet farts punched through her asshole and sprayed the ground beneath her feet, followed by a series of four sloppy logs of shit which each equalled to Texas in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a massive bite of her burrito, Kim's eyes would light up as she finally remembered something.<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh!\" Kim bounced eagerly as she tugged on Jack's clothes, completely oblivious that her butthole was still leaking a steady stream of booty cream. \"Am I finally gonna be able to tag along into town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyes lit up in a way Texas had never seen before as she turned to the absolutely flattened weasel. \"Of course you are, my precious niece.\" Jack cooed as she reached her hand out and grabbed a handful of Kim's left buttcheek, playfully shaking it as the tiny bunny would giggle and cheer in response, while her absurdly thick booty would wobble and flail uncontrollably as more and more wet farts splurted through her puckered hole in rapid succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack approached the flattened sheet, previously known as Texas. \"I managed to get my hands on the very best saddle for your horsie, I just need to make some final adjustments.\"<br>\r\nTexas shivered and whined as Jack had a twisted, toothy grin on her face. Leaning into Texas' face, which could only be identified as a blurred smear. \"I've spent the last six months trying to find something that could survive my niece's monstrous ghetto booty. Though nothing has ever come close to being a match for it... But don't worry, I don't expect you to survive. I just expect you to give me one hell of a show as I watch you get absolutely destroyed by my nieces beefy shithole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jack snatched Texas' flattened shape and effeciently molded her into a saddle-like shape, making sure her face would be positioned at the absolute center of the seat... But, something was missing. Biting her lower lip, Jack got an idea as she shaped her hand into a claw and groped around Texas' flattened head, as she started to pull it out a few inches from the seat.<br>\r\nKim, who was standing beside her aunt, eagerly watched her craftsmanship in amazement, until she pointed her fuzzy index finger and poked at Texas' portruding head. \"What's that for, auntie Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this? This is... Uh... Well, since you're new to riding on a horse and such. I figured you could use this as a guide.\" Jack pulled Texas' head further outward. \"Just make sure to align your asshole with this knot when you're riding, and you'll know you're sitting correctly.\"<br>\r\nKim gasped in awe at the nifty little device as she took another huge bite of her burrito, quickly followed by a thundering roar from her stomach as another torrent of wet, slobbery farts punched through her oiled, sweaty sphincter and completely coated a majority of the tiny bunny's buttcheeks in creamy diarrhea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack licked her lips in arousal as she looked at Texas' pathetic head. Imagining that knot being shoved up her niece's disgusting farthole repeatedly.<br>\r\n\"I just realized I need to head into town for a quick errand. What do you say Kim, want to take your new saddle for a spin?\" Jack asked with a smile. Kim nodded rapidly in response and swirled around, dashing over to her little pony with impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas sunk into a bottomless depression once the little bunny turned around, giving Texas a complete view of her shitsoaked buttcheeks, covered in a thick, creamy layer of booty cream which drooled onto the ground behind her. Once she started sprinting, her thick, meaty buttcheeks started to flail and clap relentlessly, momentarily with every step, Kim's buttcheeks would flare wide apart, giving Texas a complete, uncensored peek at her doughnut-shaped butthole, which was throbbing and pulsating angrily from the neverending gas explosions exiting it, as Texas could swear she managed to catch a glimpse of a trunk-like log of shit, slithering in and out past her plump sphincter repeatedly, unrecognized by the small bunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tossed the modified Texas onto a small pony belonging to her niece. Strapping the weas--- the saddle properly to the equine.<br>\r\nTexas could do nothing but stare straight into the sky, her eyes blinded by the blazing sun. All she could hear were the impatient squeals of the little bunny. But soon Texas was once again reminded what true horror was, as she felt herself tug slightly to the side when Kim stepped into the stirrup. And Texas' vision was soon engulfed by a shadow as the tiny bunny's massive booty came into view, further verifying the absurd size of the teenagers derriere. Once Kim had both her feet in their respective stirrups. The bunny would slowly begin to squat. Her thick, meaty buttcheeks slowly parting, and immediately as her crack opened, a stream of slimey diarrhea pumped through her bloated shithole, trailed down the rebelliously resilient turd which was still pumping back and forth through her pucker. Texas used whatever strength she had left to reform her mouth and squeal for help. Because Kim had no idea her saddle was actually an actual person, Texas was optimistic enough to assume her new captor would at least second guess using her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her efforts seemed to bear fruit, as Texas slowly felt her lips part and her mouth opening wide. She wasted no time to squeal for help, but her vocal cords were still completely destroyed, as not a single sound escaped her. Texas burst into tears as she realized she couldn't close her mouth again, as the stream of liquid diarrhea from the bunny eventually splattered onto the saddle, Texas helplessly feeling the liquid pour into and fill her open mouth, forcing itself down her throat.<br>\r\nTexas wanted to howl in agony as she helplessly swallowed the excrement of her nemesis' niece. Her inability to defend herself, or even move a muscle, was excruciating. But as she was all too familiar with by now. Things always seemed to get worse.<br>\r\nAs Kim's face came into view, she stared down onto the saddle, straight at Texas as she tried to align her butthole to the knot. Texas felt uneasy as the bunny let out a comforting and charming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello mister saddle. Thank you so much for deciding to take care of my rump~ Hope I'm not too heavy for you.\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, the shadow which covered Texas' vision grew progressively darker as the bunny begun to squat her fat buttmeat onto the saddle, the bunny's buttcheeks gaping wide open as the thick, greasy turd hovered inches away from it. Texas' stared in utter horror as her gaping mouth was perfectly aligned to her captor's flexing, throbbing butthole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Texas felt the tip of Kim's turd push down onto her, forcing itself into her mouth, her throat, and belly, whilst the majority of it simply smeared onto Texas' face and the rest of the saddle. Though as the turd started to push against the saddle, Kim could feel it starting to sink further back into her asshole. Arching her back, Kim let out a squeak as the unpleasant feeling of her turd trying to push itself back into her ass caused her to flex her hole, spraying a disgusting torrent of diarrhea farts directly onto Texas which forced the turd out from her hole and violently smeared it onto the saddle, ending with Kim's booty pounding itself with it's full weight onto the seat. As the knot which was Texas' head was smeared onto Kim's giganticly beefy shithole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommanding her pony to move into a canter. Every step of the horse would repeatedly cause Kim's booty to lift from the saddle, leaving it hovering for a second or two, before crashing back down.<br>\r\nUnaware of the torment she's causing Texas, Kom approached Jack as they decided to start their journey into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Back in Town.</b></u><br>\r\nAgainst all odds. Texas manages to survive the entire trip into town, giving her a chance to reform and escape, unless something unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Death By Booty.</b></u><br>\r\nTo noones surprise. Texas could impossibly survive the entire trip. As the last thing she would remember was the overwhelming sound combination of Kim's relentless booty explosions and Jack's uncontrollable laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Raising the Stakes.</b></u><br>\r\nDeciding to take a slight break halfway to their destination. Jack was severely dissapointed in your ability to survive. And decided to hatch a plan to make Texas' suffering way more interesting.</span></div></div>",

Jacks didn't need to waste another breath telling her goons what to do, they were as ready for this as they could be. Both rabbits held tight to Texas's sheet like body and started walking backwards. Texas's malleable, squashed self started to stretch like a piece of taffy, slowly but surely, and straightening out as it did. They kept pulling, getting further and further apart as Texas's paper thin body was pulled to its absolute limits. They stopped when Texas was only about six inches across and fifty feet long. Smiling Jacks strode up to one end of the sheriff and placed a wooden dowel on top of her, and her goon started to roll her up onto it, walking towards her opposite partner until they met back up and Texas was fully wound around the rod, just like a perfect little roll of weasel TP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Jacks grabbed the roll of Texas and gave her girls a wink, \"Y'all round up the rest of the gang, I'm gonna take first wipes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed to herself as she sauntered into the nearest outhouse, one that had gotten quite a bit of use from the stench. She placed Texas on the TP holder and rubbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're ready for some second hand Carrot con Carne, lawgirl.\" She sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo drive the point home, Jacks's bowels roared and the rabbit grunted to force out a horrendous storm of reeking shit from her little tailhole. Texas, even in her flattened and rolled out state, could hear and regrettably smell everything that was going on, and it all served to worsen her fear. But fear or no fear, nothing could stop Jacks from grabbing ahold of one end of Texas and stuffing it down into the steaming shithole to wipe her sloppy crack. She wiped up and down, really scrubbing it clean, before letting the still attached piece of Texas flop down into the shitty muck below. Then she grabbed Texas further along the roll, wiping with the next portion of her without ripping her apart. She forced out some more wet shits onto Texas below, then gave one last, good, hard flossing of her nasty crack with the weasel before standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting right outside for her was a line of her goons, some of them clutching their stomachs in pain and others already venting some nasty gas,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies, no shovin!

Straightening up and cursing herself, the weasel strode forwards into the camp, seeing that the firepit was cold and the buildings were abandoned. However, just as she was about to leave, a light breeze caused something to flutter at the edge of her vision. Turning quickly, her hand moving to the gun on her hip, Texas whipped around, only to see a note pinned to the wall of the gorge with a bootknife, quite similar to the ones she and April used. The weasel instantly dashed over to the note and tore it free, wiping the red stone dust off it as her brow furrowed, reading over the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you get... when you cross a weasel... with a boulder...?\" Texas frowned in confusion, turning the paper over to see if their was anything on the other side, only to find that it was blank. \"Well what the heck does that me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boulder smashed down right on top of her head, flattening her from sheriff to doormat in seconds and embedding itself deep in the ground. Next to the boulder, the note fluttered to the ground next to Texas's hand, the only part of her sticking out from under the boulder, which twitched in pain and humiliation. Up above, perched high on a ledge worn into the gorge's walls, Smiling Jacks and two of her crew chuckled to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Tex. But I guess we're about to find out!\" The bunny says with her characteristic cheerfulness, then begins to climb down the rock, eager to get a look at the squashed sheriff.</span></div></div>",

Jacks leaned down and grabbed her by the tip of her tail, peeling her up like a fresh piece of roadkill, and flapped her in the air like a dirty carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we got you,\" Jacks said, \"We can finally get to some real fun! But first we gots to ride a little bit, can't have anyone interrupting out fun, can we Texas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Jacks grabbed Texas's paper thin self and started rolling her up into a tube, before taking that tube and folding it in half on itself several times until the entirety of the sheriff was no longer than Jacks' index finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!

Jacks bent forward pushing her cottontail up into the air, and pushed Texas right into her sweaty asscrack with her thumb. Then she hopped up on her horse and whipped the reigns, laughing all the way. Jacks made sure she went the bumpiest path she could, happily bouncing her behind on her saddle as much as she could and really making sure she walloped Texas as much as she could. All Texas could think of was the total pain of being bounced between those cheeks and the saddle, and the horrid stink that Jacks' off-white buns carried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Texas, it felt like forever until they reached their destination.

The bunny happily waved and greeted her gang as she rode in, bouncing her butt excitedly in the saddle as she lead her horse into the stable and dismounted. Instantly a few of her subordinates were there to deal with her horse, taking the reigns and leading it into one of the stalls, but Jacks was already on the move again, whistling happily as she walked down to the very last stall, a jumbo-sized enclosure that seemed custom built and added on to the already completed stables sometime recently. Pushing open the massive doors the room was revealed, and the bunny bandit smiled at the sight of April right where she left her, pinned under the ass of a morbidly obese cow, only her head sticking free and being gassed mercilessly every other second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you won't get away with this!!\" April screamed a little manically, apparently having been stuck in this scenario for at least a day. \"Texas will come for me! Just you wait and see!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacks just chuckled to herself, shaking her head a little and shaking her hips, enjoying the almost imperceptible squishing noises that came from within her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're not wrong on that count, foxy! But I'm afraid she's already come for you, and... well... it ended about as you'd expect.\" The rabbit reached back, then dug deep between her cheeks and slowly extracted the folded-up weasel from her ass crack, sticky with butt sweat and other, nastier substances. With a flap of her hand, Jacks unfurled Texas, revealing the completely sickened-looking sheriff, dazed, disgusted and disoriented. April gasped in fear, while Smiling Jacks just grinned wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know what to do with myself! I'm like the dog that caught the carriage! I needed you cause I wanted Texas out of the way, foxy, but look! I've got both of you! Mmmm! Life couldn't be sweeter!\" She grinned, dropping the sheriff next to her deputy, Texas crumpling up like paper. \"There's a big, BIG bounty on both o' yer heads. I'm more than a bit tempted to get all my animals an' have them butt-slam you one by one. By the end of it you'd just be smelly little smears on the floor, an' the mayor would pay me handsomely... But I think I could put you two to better use. You've caused me so much trouble, after all, I think it's only fair you repay the favour...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'see, this enclosure wasn't built fer old Besse there.\" She says, Besse punctuating that sentiment by letting out another foul fart onto April. \"This was built t' house the mother o' all rustlin' rewards... the big one... the grand prize! Y'see, a rancher round these parts by the name o' Patty Porker raises the best an' biggest darn pigs this side o' the west, but her prize pig, Priscilla? She's worth her weight in gold! An' seeing how she's about five times the size of Besse there, that's a lotta gold. Problem is that Patty don't take kindly to rustlers, an' all the girls I've sent ain't come back. I don't wanna waste more good talent when they're likely just gonna end up as piggy butt-plugs, but it seems like I've got two expendable little volunteers right here... So how 'bout a little wager, girls? Steal Priscilla for me, an' you don't end up with a terminal case of being squashed out of existence. Interested...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flattened Texas, who was slowly starting to re-inflate, glanced at April, pinned and suffering, then glanced back at Jacks, ready to give her answer.</span></div></div>",

You must think I was born yesterday or something. I ain't letting you go nowhere by yerself, I don't trust you as far as I can throw ya. And 'fore you ask, no I'm not going with you either. I don't get my hands dirty unless it's funny. Nah, I'm gonna set one of my girls up with a six shooter and she's gonna walk you over there. Maybe even help you if they're feeling kindly. Thumper! Twinkletoes! Git over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of Jacks's goons walked up, two that the lawgirls actually recognized. Thumper was the definition of a chubby bunny. Short, squat and fat all over, with a nasty temprement and even more temperamental bowels. She had a horrible case of IBS that seemed to get worse when she got angry, so that her bowels were irritated the more irritated she was. Twinkletoes was a much different looking rabbit, slim and slender with a slack jawed expression. The girl was dim, but what she lacked in the head she made up for in height and more importantly foot size. Her monster stompers where way too large for boots, and way too stinky for words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Tex,\" Smiling Jacks said, \"I'm only sendin one girl with ya, the other's gonna wait by my pens for ya to get back with my pig. So I'll let you choose. Who's gonna go along with you and April?\"</span></div></div>",

Especially if they wanted to have any hope of sneaking around and stealing that pig without being detected. Thumper didn't seem horribly thrilled, but she knew she'd have to do it for her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever,\" Thumper said, hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two,\" Smiling Jacks stepped between the two of them, \"let's get our little thief team together. I'll let ya borrow one of my horses for the ride over the hill to the Porker's place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One horse?\" Texas said, \"But there's three of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas should've known what would've happened next. Her and April were tied up by their hands and led behind the horse while Thumper rode atop it. The entire way, the fat-assed horse kept blasting Texas in the face with horrid horse gas. And Thumper herself didn't let up at all, Texas found it horrifying that she was able to smell the rabbit's gas through the haze of horse farts.  It was a long, stinking slog through the desert, but thankfully the Porker estate wasn't too far. Thumper tied the horse nearby and untied her two accomplices, keeping a pistol trained on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't get any funny ideas...\" She said, \"C'mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching in the tall grass by Porker's fence, the three of them took in the lay of the land. There was a long stretch of front yard in front of the small manor, with a large enclosed stable attached to the side which they assumed would lead into Priscilla's pen. There was no visible entrance to the barn, though, which served as a bit of an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so we've only got a few options,\" Texas said, \"We can try to break into the barn, or we can head into the manor itself and try to get in through there. Hard to tell which is easier--.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThumper cut her off with a fart, \"Shut it! I'm the planner round here. Now we only got two options: Break into the barn or sneak into the manor and get in from there. What do you think, Sheriff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas sighed.</span></div></div>",

The front gate was locked, they could see that from their starting point, so they snuck around the perimeter to try and find any way at all inside. Right around the back corner Texas noticed a window that was open just a crack, through which a ghastly stink was radiating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gotta be a way in,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThumper said, \"Right right, but it's high up. We'd need to boost someone up so's they can get inside the pen by themselves, avoid that giant-ass pig, and open the barn door so we can rustle her up proper. 'Course anyone who tries is liable to get stuffed up a pork butt. Now uh, who's it gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth April and Thumper looked directly at Texas.

She was just barely able to get her upper half inside the window, but the sides of the barn were too sheer to find a foothold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey guys, gimme a boo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even finish the thought, Texas was shoved with full force into the window, easily pushing her ass-over-teakettle. She did a flip in midair, landing boots first into a familiar sensation, a gigantic pile of dung that she was buried up to her neck in from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consarn it! You idiots just-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas cut herself off. What was she doing screaming like that?! She was in the middle of a burglary for land's sake, she needed to be stealthy!

She was just as huge as Smiling Jacks had said, if not bigger, and covered with what Texas really, REALLY hoped was mud. However, she was also fast asleep, snoring loud enough to shake the walls of the barn. The weasel breathed a sigh of relief, then slowly pushed herself out of the pile of shit, noticing that her entire outfit was ruined. Luckily she had another ten identical outfits at home, but it wasn't a great start to the mission, and anyone pursuing them would probably be able to smell the weasel from a mile off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting free and scraping the muck off herself, Texas looked around for the door of the barn, growing more and more confused as to where it was, as it seemed to be nowhere in sight. Just as she was about to call back out the window, however, her eyes caught the corner of the door frame, which, she realised with growing horror, the colossal mass of porcine was lying against! Silently cursing everything in the universe for this fine mess she had gotten herself into, the weasel crept forwards as quietly as she could, avoiding the more... 'muddy' parts of the floors just in case she slipped. By the time she reached the pig, she had to hold her breath or risk being knocked out cold from the stench, but this close up she could clearly see that the pig had fallen asleep right in front of the door, with one of her gigantic sides resting against it. If Texas wanted to open that door, she'd need to move the pig, and that meant either waking her up, or coming up with a clever plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Texas was thinking this, an enormous fart ripped from the pig's backside and filled the air with the fresh stench of manure and year-old vegetables sauteed in in a garbage can. The weasel gagged, her eyes watering. She would need to make a decision soon, or she was gonna be knocked out cold by the fumes.</span></div></div>",

Texas reached out to grab onto April's arm, but before she could reach her Bessie came crashing down again. She slammed her butt onto April repeatedly, farting on each impact, until she had reduced the fox to paste. Then the cow looked back at Texas smugly as she slowly ground her ass back and forth across the hardwood floors of the pen. Texas could only watch in hopeless horror as her ex-deputy was smeared across the ground in a big, barely recognizable stain that stunk of cow excrement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get much time to mourn though. A large, thuggish looking rabbit accomplice of Jacks grabbed her from behind while she was distracted. The rabbit's hefty hands wrapped around her slim body and effortlessly squeezed and squashed her into a ball no bigger than an orange. The rabbit then lifted her burly arms and wiped the weasel ball up and down in her sweaty armpits to get Texas really saturated in her salty sweat. Then finally she took Texas and crammed her into Bessie's fat butt cheeks before slamming them closed herself. She clapped Bessie's cheeks open and closed to make it look like the cow's ass cheeks were \"chewing\" Texas up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now blow me a bubble!\" Jacks commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessie mooed and began forcing out a deliberate, methane-rich fart that slowly filled out Texas like she was a wad of bubble gum. She kept steadily pushing out those reeking fumes, inflating Texas like the world's worst party trick. Texas felt her crushed body be totally permeated by the atrocious stench and taste of Bessie's farts as she was filled up with them. She felt her body be painfully stretched by the gas more and more until finally her body popped and splattered against Bessie's cheeks. The concentrated gas that escaped made the gangsters cover their noses and fan the air with their hats, all except Jacks who was too excited over her victory to care. She scraped Texas's sticky self off of Bessie's ass and into a little burlap sack with the word \"Bounty\" on it. And then, of course, she farted in the bag herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lets go get us a reward, girls, so this day wasn't a complete waste.\"</span></div></div>",

She was still flat as a pancake and totally saturated in Jacks butt stuff, but she could at least see where she was now. Although, that didn't help much because she had absolutely no idea where in the wild west she actually was. It looked like the desert, sure, but she had never seen this tiny looking ranch she was in front of before in her life. All there was was a short farmhouse, a single fat pony, and a monstrous mountain of manure that couldn't have possibly come from that little thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my little dream ranch!\" Jacks said proudly, \"I always wanted a pony, ever since a  So I stole one from some brat's birthday! She's a real treasure. I call her 'Majesty!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas couldn't help but roll her eyes at that portly pony mare being called \"Majesty\" of all things. The messy pony looked like it was going to have a heart attack at any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But poor Majesty ain't feeling well, Tex.\" Jacks said, \"I been feeding her plenty, but she's just got the worst trots I ever did see. So I was thinking I'd massage her rump with a nice weaselfur rag to soothe her aching butt. Wanna help me out Tex? 'course you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas's eyes shot open, but she was pressed too flat to speak up. Jacks grabbed a washing pole and stuck Texas on the end of it before whistling for Majesty to come. The pony waddled over, turned around and lifted her tail (a trick all of Jacks's animals knew). Jacks took the pole and oh so gently plunged Texas into the manure filled canyon that was Majesty's fat ass. Jacks rolled her up and down, wiping every last corner of that muddy crack. But despite the vigorous wiping that Jacks was giving the pony's ass, it didn't seem to get any cleaner. There was just too much crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacks pulled out Texas to have a look at her, and saw that the sheriff was now more dung than weasel. She stuck her tongue out in disgust and shook the washing pole to drop her off the end of it. She landed in the filthy mud of the pen with a sickening splat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sorry Tex, looks like it didn't work. I think I need more ass wipes.\" Jacks hopped on her horse, \"I'll be right back with your buddy April! Majesty, you keep our friend busy while I'm gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMajesty responded by raising her tail again, right over the shit-stained mess that was Texas, and blowing out a tremendous fart. Then a cascade of rotten horseapples piled out of her ass, completely burying the sheriff in reeking pony poop.</span></div></div>",

Striding over to the mayor's office, gun in hand and fire in her heart, Texas was unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least she thought she was, until she kicked down the door to the mayor's office, only to find half a dozen of the mayor's thugs all waiting, and Mayor Vivian herself sitting behind her desk with her feet up, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Texas...

From there, it was all over for Texas, as the thugs took great pleasure trampling her, bellyflopping on her, sitting on her, gassing her and using her as a sweat rag for hours on end, the girls all taking turns obliterating the sheriff. The mayor had spent the entire time watching and laughing her ass off as she witnessed the defeat of the biggest thorn in her side, but as the novelty wore off, she nodded to one of the thugs, who peeled up the flattened sheriff and dragged her, beaten, smelly and twitching, over to the mayor's desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That really wasn't smart, was it, Tex?

The sheriff winced, but wasted no time in diving into the trash, quickly burying herself in it and disappearing out of sight, her senses completely overwhelmed by the smell of weeks-old rotten garbage. Still, sometimes this was a dirty job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hid in amongst the trash, Texas tried to listen to the world outside despite everything being muffled. As she listened, the footsteps dashed up to where she had been, and paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Where'd she go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, she's fast... Uhhh, want to just lie and say we disintergrated her with our gas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... Though the mayor's gonna be pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you have no idea, girls.\" Texas's ears pricked up. A new set of footsteps approached to accompany this voice, a voice that was so familiar to Texas. \"Mayor Vivian gave you ten men to take out one stick-thin weasel, and despite all odds, you managed to screw it up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Georgia, we didn't-\" The voice was cut off by the sound of a meaty punch and a yelp of pain, but Texas's mind went elsewhere. Georgia, her old deputy, a twelve foot mare made of fat. Texas had fired her for taking bribes, but that made her the obvious choice to be the mayor's new sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough. Texas doesn't matter. If she knows what's good for her she'll leave town, or try to, and we'll catch her. She's a dead girl, she just hasn't realised it yet.\" The footsteps turned and walked away, quickly followed by the other pairs of feet, until there was nothing but silence. Texas lay amidst the garbage for a while, just to be safe, and thought through her options. Really, she could only see two main ones. She could go and see her deputy, April, and try to get her help, which would be the smart move, as she needed all the help she could get. Or, alternatively, she could take a risk and call Georgia out. She had always been a proud one, and a bit of a show-off too, so she'd like nothing more than to humiliate Texas publically. Therefore, if Texas challenged her to a duel for the role of Sheriff, a showdown at high noon for all to see, the mare likely wouldn't refuse.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Confident that all her pursuers had left, the weasel quietly snuck out of the trash. Peeking out from the alley she could see several of Vivian's burly henchmen posted around the town. Getting in or out without being seen would prove a challenge. Walking up and down the street was Georgia, an angry glare on her face. She was grumbling to herself loud enough for the sheriff to pick up on. Apparently the massive mare was offered her position in exchange for her arrest. If she showed up to Vivian empty-handed the mayor would probably look into assigning a more competent sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently the disgraced weasel sheriff stalked from building to building, keeping her head on a swivel to make sure nobody was onto her. Georgia's heavy steps were easy to track and provided Texas the opportunity to muffle her own footsteps. She was getting close to April's place. She spotted a hippo thug standing in the doorway, glaring out into the street. Did they get to her before she could? No, April was a resourceful one. She must've heard the commotion and slipped away before anyone came looking for her. Or so Texas hoped. She really didn't look forward to resolving this situation all on her own. She gritted her teeth and mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah varmints, now how am I gonna get to her? Think Texas, where'd she go in a situation like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril had talked about hiding weapons and provisions in an abandoned farmhouse, just in case they'd find themselves separated from their things. But getting out of town unseen would be impossible until nightfall. Maybe she was hiding out in her house? Texas would have to weasel her way in without alerting the hippo bandit. Neither option felt very good to the sheriff, but desperate times call for desperate measures.</span></div></div>",

The heavy-set rhino lit a match and covered it with her hand. The wind nearly blew it out again, but the building along with her hand provided enough cover for her to light up. She quickly shook the match to extinguish it and flicked it away, looking up to see the petrified weasel. The freshly lit cigarette fell from her lip as her eyes widened. Texas didn't wait to see what would happen next and started running. Behind her she could hear the thug bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEXAS IS HERE! Georgia! Texas is hidin out in the alleys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" the distinct voice of her former deputy boomed through the town. She was always a loud one, but this time the weasel was positively surprised her volume didn't shatter any windows. No time for curiosity though. Every one of Vivian's goons along with Georgia was after her and none of them were going to treat her with any kindness. She dashed into an alley and through an open window into the hotel. The sheriff excused herself as quickly as she could to the shrieking guests whose rooms she barged through to escape her pursuers. Her lithe frame made popping through the rooms easy and she quickly found herself on the other side of the hotel, leaping out of a window into another alleyway. She ran past several more buildings, slowly getting a headstart on the thugs chasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy footfalls announced the arrival of Georgia in the pursuit. She was leading the charge, chasing after Texas with malicious determination. Her equine nature shone as the large horse woman started to gain on her victim. The loud thumps of each weighty step drawing closer to the terrified sheriff. Straight line speed wasn't going to win this. Texas needed to be cunning. Ahead of her was the back of the prison and sheriff's office. Her gun might still be there. Out front she might also find her horse to escape this nightmare of a town. First things first, she had some pursuers to slip away from. An open window caught her eye and without thinking she bolted through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of stench hit the sheriff right in the face as she'd stumbled into the backroom of the wash-house. Tubs full of unwashed laundry were awaiting service and their stink was unbearable. Texas didn't have the luxury to complain as she heard the many footsteps outside of her pursuers. She quickly bolted through several doors to end up on the main street in front of the wash-house. Salvation was near as she could see the sheriff's office, her horse tied up in front of it. She ran for it as fast as her little legs could carry her. Screw going inside and getting her gun, there was no time for that. A panicked look behind her confirmed it as Vivian's thugs poured out from the alleys to give chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff ran towards her escape, hopping up onto the boardwalk so she'd be able to untie her horse's reins on the double. The tiniest smile grew on her face as she saw a glimmer of hope. Hope that her near future did not involve getting flattened by Georgia or the mayor's goons.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Texas was making good progress towards her salvation, but from the alley between the sheriff's office and the neighbouring store emerged Georgia. The horse had never bothered to wait around the wash-house to see which hole the weasel would pop out of. The former deputy knew the sheriff was unarmed. She'd either be looking for her gun or for a way to get out of town. With thugs everywhere the only chance Texas had was her horse. Delighted by her own cunning the towering mare savoured the moment. The sheriff was both moving far too fast and running far too close to her to turn and escape. Like a little gift from heaven the weasel skidded towards her. She would not provide her victim a single ounce of mercy, starting by reaching down and wrapping her large hand around the sheriff's neck. Her immense strength effortlessly lifted the weasel off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must confess, 'sheriff', I've been fantasizin' about this moment for a looooong time. Finally I got you right where I done want you.\" She tightened her grip, wrenching Texas' neck even further until it was a thin as a piece of string. The weasel sputtered for air and freedom in equal measure, grabbing hold of the large hand holding her up. Even with all her strength, the sheriff was unable to move a single finger as Georgia laughed at the pathetic attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha's that, 'sheriff'? You need air? Don'tcha worry, deputy Georgia's got ya covered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big mare swung the flailing weasel around to her butt, mashing Texas headfirst into the tough fabric of her pants. Her bowels gurgled almost on command and soon a noisy fart blew into the weasel's face. Her struggles began to grow faint. Georgia felt a pang of regret rush through her. Regret that she couldn't torment her nemesis longer. In a flash her crushing grip lightened. With a devious glint in her eye she nodded at the goons that had caught up. They stood back and watched the show, smiling as they saw the sheriff getting humiliated. A glance over her shoulder informed Georgia that even more goons had come to back her up. Texas was so disoriented by the foul stench she couldn't quite catch what her former deputy said to the thugs. Nor did their movements make any sense to her. Only when her senses started to return did she see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Le's have some more fun, 'sheriff'. How's about a good 'ol backalley brawl? Jus' you an' me, fists only.\" Georgia threw the weasel into the alley she'd emerged from earlier. Two heavyset thugs blocked the exit. Behind the mare two more thugs formed a wall of hostile bodies. The house had no windows to escape through and the sheriff's office only had windows with bars in front of them at this side. The sheriff was trapped in the alley with Georgia. To show how serious she was about keeping everything hand to hand, the mare made a big show of removing her holster and revolver, handing them to one of the goons to hold onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'right, Texas.\" She sneered. \"Put 'em up. Let's see those little fists fly. Oh, and the winner gets that pretty little badge.\" Georgia said, jealously pointing at the gleaming star on Texas' vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready or not, here I come!\" Georgia yelled out, thundering towards the quivering weasel.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With all the grace of a runaway train the mare closed the distance, reaching down to grab the sheriff once more. Texas was still wobbly on her feet, but she managed to dodge it. She was in no rush to have those wrenching fingers throttling her again. Amused her victim still had some fight in her the towering mare raised a foot. The weasel's eyes grew wide as it came down. She sidestepped it but it was so close she felt the air rush past as the huge booted foot slammed down mere inches from where she was standing. Several more attempts to grab and stomp her followed, but the lawbringer managed to dodge them all. Georgia began to get a little annoyed, but she knew there was no way out for the weasel. She needed to dodge every blow or suffer the consequences. The mare on the other hand only needed to land a hit once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you didn't throw a single punch yet, 'sheriff'. Are you gettin tired of escapin' your well-deserved fate yet? Tell ya what, I'll be a generous sheriff after I squash you, so how about I give you a shot right now. One punch, make it count.\" Georgia squatted down, bringing her face close to the panting weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was brimming with righteous fury. She would not be reduced to Georgia's little plaything. The massive mare would feel her wrath. She'd brought down plenty of criminals with her fists, and this would be no different. She straightened her form, putting up her fists and breathing deeply. Georgia almost felt concerned seeing the sheriff shake off her earlier fatigue, but the mare was about to call her bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon sheriff, today please. I got more to do than squashin' a rodent and gettin' my promotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel did not keep her waiting any longer. With all the strength she could draw from her exhausted body Texas reared back and threw a punch for the ages. Unfortunately her weariness outmatched her righteous anger and her fist merely gently squished into Georgia's cheek. The deputy's smile grew a mile wide, seeing her opponent's spirit break. The thugs all laughed at the pathetic display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn!\" The massive mare announced joyfully. Still squatting down she brought her hand down on the ground, pinning Texas' feet in place. Georgia's other hand formed a massive fist, rearing up as far as she could manage. The sheriff was trapped helplessly and soon to be on the receiving end of that fist. She meekly put up her arms to block it but they both knew it would be pointless. The weasel could only wait for the inevitable as the immense fist flew towards her, finding a home in her gut. The air was driven from her lungs and were it not for the mare holding her feet down she was certain it would've sent her flying clean over the wall of thugs. The mare let go of the weasel, allowing her to slump to her knees in pain. With her opponent still recovering she felt the only right thing to do was speed along said recovery in the only way she knew how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas gritted her teeth, fiercely trying to get on her feet. She needed a way out. The huge mare had the upper hand and there was no way in hell she was going to overpower her in a fistfight anymore. Maybe if the both of them were fresh and ready, but not like this. Before she could get on her feet though the sheriff was surprised by a visitor. Georgia's massive butt hovered just before her, the round glutes looking ready to crush her flat. She heard a snorting laugh erupt from the far side of that immense butt before it erupted, blowing several rancid farts right in the sheriff's face. Again laughter rang out from the alleyway as Georgia stood up to inspect her handiwork. The weasel was beaten and exhausted. Defiantly she was on her feet, but she looked ready to be knocked over again at the merest touch. Georgia had so much more in mind than just a touch. It was time to finish this.</span></div></div>",

Texas sputtered and coughed, helpless to act as the large mare sat down. Her eyes widened when she saw her large opponent spread her legs and roll onto her side a little. Each of her deputy's thighs were as wide as she was tall, and the weasel was about to feel how much pain that could bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna enjoy this, 'sheriff'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was thick with malice as the large horse brought her squirming victim inbetween those massive thighs. Texas' struggles grew more and more violent as she was laid out on the vast surface of her thigh, the other slowly lowering. A faint hint of arousal pierced the sheriff's nostrils. There was no doubt about it, Georgia was getting off on this. She milked the moment for as long as she could, gradually bringing her thighs together around the unfortunate weasel. Her violent thrashing seized when her body was sandwiched between the two huge flanks. The hand around her throat disappeared but the weasel was hopelessly pinned between those immense thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this takes me back a long time, you know? I used to be a safecracker for a while before I realized you could just be given money for looking the other way.\" Texas looked up at the gloating mare in disbelief. Was she really to believe her brutish deputy had the finesse and patience for safecracking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my methods were somewhat... unconventional.\" Georgia added with a big smirk. She squeezed the weasel between her thighs. Lightly at first, so she could watch Texas' pained expression. Not a noise came from the weasel, her lungs too flattened to utter a word. Even with minimum effort she felt the sheriff go flatter and flatter between her legs. She didn't expect much resistance when squashing her, but this was outright laughable. The thugs standing around spectating the fight reacted with a mixture of laughter and awe. The massive mare would be a sheriff feared far and wide. It's a good thing she was on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, even the toughest safe would buckle once I got my legs around it. Of course I could always squeeze the key or combination out of the owner. But sometimes you want to challenge yourself, you know?\" Texas felt her body turn flat as a bedsheet, squashed mercilessly between those immense thighs. Adding insult to injury, the mare grabbed the sheriff's head and pushed it into her groin. A tiny moan escaped the massive mare before she opened her legs, revealing the flattened form of the sheriff. With a satisfied grunt she pulled her free, only to place the weasel's head inbetween her thighs. Texas' expression turned to sheer panic as Georgia brought her legs together in a flash, squashing the little lawbringer completely. No slow buildup this time, just a quick and decisive crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the weasel thoroughly flattened, Georgia picked her up by the paper-thin waist. Sitting proudly on Texas' vest was her sheriff's star. The mare could barely contain her glee as she ripped it off of the weasel's jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas Stanton, you are officially relieved of your duties. I will take over your position as sheriff of Gold Springs. My first order is to assign you a new duty, more fitting of your skillset.\" The disgraced weasel didn't have the energy left to act shocked or surprised at the inevitable usurping of her position by the jealous mare. Her horrified expression was stamped on her face when those immense thighs squashed it flat. A fitting expression it would turn out as she is lifted towards the huge mare's hindquarters. Georgia pulls open her pants and nonchalantly drops the flattened weasel in. It takes some adjusting, but eventually Texas finds herself spread out along a large section of her former deputy's buttocks. Her face is stuck near the mare's gassy butthole whilst her feet nearly reach her privates. With a loud burst of gas the former sheriff is formally introduced into her new position as Georgia's fart sniffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, go tell Vivian the little weasel has been dealt with. An' tell her of my promotion. I'm gonna go rearrange the sheriff's office to my tastes and break in my new fart sniffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays turned to weeks turned to months as Texas could only witness all the work she'd done in Gold Springs fall apart. Under Georgia's easily bribed watch crime skyrocketed once more. The cells were reserved only for those who dared speak out against mayor Vivian and her cronies. Any who objected to the new sheriff were treated even worse, subjected to the same sadistic beatdown as her. The massive mare took a near perverse joy in crushing them, either between her thighs or with another part of her oversized body. The only thing she didn't do anymore was cram people into her pants. That spot belonged to Texas and Texas alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former sheriff soon learned that Georgia rarely bathed. When she did, the squished weasel was tied around a post, her stretchy body turned into a fuzzy knot. The only other time Texas was spared the horse's ass was when the mare needed to use the toilet. Of course she never wiped anymore, having a useful little weasel to deal with the filth now. The stink of the huge horse's farts would never again leave, permanently seared into Texas' nostrils. For the rest of her days, the weasel would be the most terrifying reminder never to cross Georgia.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There really couldn't be any other way to finish this. The cruel horse woman didn't have such a fabulous and massive butt for nothing. The shaking little weasel was practically begging to be flattened beneath it. First things first, she had to made sure her target wouldn't try dodging out of the way. Georgia didn't waste any time determining the best strategy and simply grabbed the sheriff by the throat. Once more Texas found herself lifted off her feet as her former deputy set about crushing her throat. It squished and squelched in the mare's powerful grip, becoming thin as a noodle. Without any fanfare the weasel is dropped back on the ground, gasping for air and massaging her neck to help it reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia laughed, ready to deliver her final blow. \"Ya thought that was breathtaking, just you wait 'till you get a load o' <i>this</i>!\" She taunted as she pushed down her pants to reveal her bare ass. The thugs on either side grimaced, a pitiless smile on their faces as they get a front row seat to Texas' smelly demise. They'd seen Georgia with her pants down before and all of them knew better than to comment on it. Not after the things she did to the last goon that thought he was being clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff's vision darkened as the sun was eclipsed by the huge, looming buttcheeks of Georgia. Slowly the horse squatted down, those enormous cheeks filling Texas' view. Just before they made contact the mare paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last chance, give me your badge and ah'll go easy on ya.\" She commanded, but the sheriff wasn't having any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat shit in hell, ya gatdamn varm-\" With a dull <i>THUMP</i> the weasel was interrupted as her former deputy didn't need to hear another sound from her. In an instant the entire sheriff had been swallowed up beneath the immense rear of Georgia. One immense flabby cheek to cover her torso, another to flatten anything from the waist down. Not content with merely flattening the sheriff, the massive mare begins to lean from side to side, grinding her overwhelming ass down onto the weasel. The coarse-furred buttcheeks brushed heavily against Texas' face, only stopping when the mare needed to add insult to injury and let out a smelly fart. It assisted the already pungent sweaty stench and helped make the sheriff just that bit more miserable beneath the mare's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of intense grinding the mare stopped, sitting back and smiling broadly. She looks at the thugs that helped ensure the weasel wouldn't flee. \"Thanks gals, ah think ah got it from here.\" They all chuckled in response. \"Go on, you guys, go tell Vivian ah've taken care of our little weasel problem. Ah'm just gotta sit here for a while and feel those last struggles fade. The thugs all smiled and left, leaving just Texas and Georgia in the abandoned alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta think, ya were <i>this</i> close ta skippin town. Not so fun when the law turns its back on ya, is it? But don't ya worry your little head, Tex. I'll make sure the law is upheld fairly and evenly... hahahahaha. I almost managed to say it with a straight face.\" The horse was incredibly amused with herself, but her victim offered nothing. Even when the brutal mare ground her massive cheeks into the flattened weasel there was no response. Texas was out cold. With a gleeful smirk Georgia stood up, reaching around to feel the weasel plastered to her butt. Even after being crushed flat by it, Texas just couldn't get enough of that ass and the cruel mare would not be the one to deprive her from it. She peeled the perfectly flat sheriff's star from the weasel-shaped smear on her butt and pulled up her pants, their tight fit trapping the former sheriff in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn this feels good.\" Georgia announced to herself as she pinned the shiny star on her vest and walked out of the alley. She shook her butt a little extra with each step, swaying her colossal rear and pinning the trapped weasel even more tightly. Slowly she felt Texas slip between those monstrous cheeks and she gladly abused it with several powerful clenches, further pulverizing what's left of the sheriff. For weeks on end she wouldn't even think about taking her pants off, with the exception of toilet breaks. Texas savored those brief moments of somewhat fresh air before being entombed once more with the horse woman's unwashed butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian was quick to promote Georgia to sheriff officially and soon the two held the town of Gold Springs in an iron grip. Anyone who dared cross the mayor would find themselves under arrest. Those who weren't intimidated by such a show of force would soon regret it as Georgia took a liking to publicly beating them down and sitting on them, letting them feel who was in charge. If the brutal grinding didn't knock them out, the stench almost certainly did. Vivian's new policies ensured both her and Georgia became rich beyond their wildest imagination. As for the weasel, she was soon forgotten, her efforts to bring law and order quickly replaced with greed and intimidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so ends the story of Texas Stanton, reduced to the new sheriff's cushion, fart sniffer and toilet paper, trapped between those massive buttcheeks until the end of her days.</span></div></div>",

Even the smartest of people would be dumbstruck, so considering that Vivian\u2019s goons were of below average intelligence, they just looked puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFAN OUT, FIND HER\u201d came the voice of the angry former deputy. They searched high and low, anywhere near the sheriff\u2019s office but there was no sign of Texas anywhere. <br>\r\n\u201cRRGH, if Vivian asks, I squashed her too much to recover her body\u201d she decreed to her followers. With that, the mob disbanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas breathed in the smell of intense incense, nearly coughing on the lavender like smell. <br>\r\n\u201cWha, where in tarnation am I?\u201d She asked herself, confused as to her current predicament.<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to me humble shop sheriff\u201d a voice came from before her, possessing a strong accent.<br>\r\n\u201cYour shop?\u201d She asked, looking around for the source of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the shadows stepped a Cheetah woman, dressed elegantly in purple clothing and an abundance of golden jewellery. Her belly had a slight bit of pudge to it but far less than the average resident of Gold Springs. Not to mention that she was even shorter than Texas. <br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, only available to do\u2019es who need it most\u201d she grinned. \u201cI be watchin\u2019 your little escape, and there was no way you was goin\u2019 to be escapin\u2019.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat before Texas, seeming quite calm. \u201cSo, I offer my services to any who be in dire need of dem, and you be in need most certainly\u201d she reasoned. \u201cOf course, they not free. But I don\u2019t take money, de spirits not permit me to. But, I take what you value most, which for you Sheriff, is dat shiny star dere\u201d she grinned and pointed to Texas\u2019 badge, her badge of honour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at it, at first thinking it was just a piece of metal. It soon sunk in though, it wasn\u2019t the badge, she was going to take the Sheriff\u2019s position from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo dese are your options sheriff, you take my deal and I give you the power to defeat any bad guys you want. Or you don\u2019t. You go back to bein Sheriff, but maybe I be making said bad guys a bit more of a challenge to you\u201d she grinned maliciously as she said it.</span></div></div>",

She knew her young deputy was a good and loyal officer, and that she would follow Texas to the ends of the earth, but if something should happen to her because Texas got her involved... No. Texas couldn't have that on her conscience. This was something she had to do alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel hopped out of the dumpster she had been hiding in and brushed herself off, getting the worst of the rubbish though the smell would remain for a while. She took a deep breath, then started walking towards the sheriff's office to meet her foe head-on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the office, Georgia was leaning back in Texas's old chair, which was creaking alarmingly beneath her, and talking on the phone. Around the room sat a few of the mayor's thugs, all now wearing badges of their own, having been deputised moments beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yep. Don't worry 'bout a thing, missus mayor. I've got some of my girls out watching the edge of town. If she tries to escape, we'll get her.\" The mare grinned and put the phone down, then went back to cleaning her fingernails with a knife. \"If my old boss knows what's good for her, she'll find somewhere quiet to curl up and die...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Texas booted the door down and stormed in. The few new deputies stood up instantly, their hands moving to their guns, but Georgia held up a hand, stopping them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas... You're even more stupid than I remember. Any last words before I lock you up and throw away the key?\" The mare asked, grinning widely. Texas just glared back at her with an unwavering gaze and an iron will, not showing any fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheriff Georgia. Ah challenge you to a duel. A showdown at high noon. If ah win, you're handin' the sheriff's office back over to me. If you win... Well, ah think we both know what happens if you win...\" She says grimly. Georgia raises an eyebrow, then placed her knife down and stood up, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wholeheartedly agree, Texas!\" Georgia laughed much to the collective confusion of her hired goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't think of a better way to close the book on our relationship. You always were the better shot... but today I'm feelin' mighty lucky!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took Texas some amount of effort to keep herself from laughing as she continued to glare at her corrupt replacement. Little did Georgia know, her enthused response was exactly what Texas was hoping for. It didn't take a genius to see that Georgia held all the cards in this dispute. She was officially on the mayor's payroll and as such, was granted access to her near limitless supply of manpower and resources. Not that she even needed all of that to pose a threat. She had once been Texas' deputy for a reason, after all. Even if Texas wanted to skip town, it was only a matter of time before she was ambushed by her thugs and dragged back kicking and screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n All that said, the massive mare was far from unbeatable. She possessed two glaring weaknesses that Texas was had picked up on in all the time they had known each other. The first was her sub par marksmanship. While decent shot in her own right, the lumbering brute quick draw skills left a lot to be desired. This what in sharp contrast to Texas, who carried a reputation for her phenomenal marksmanship. Her second weakness was her compulsive need to one-up Texas. Nothing would bring Georgia greater joy than to beat Texas at her own game in front of the entire town of Gold Springs. It was simply too good of an idea for her to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, criminal. We'll meet at high noon in front of townsquare. Ten paces, turn--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me howda duel! This ain't mah first rodeo\" Texas spat back bitterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her vitriolic response didn't sit well with Georgia's henchwomen as they began advance on the fearless weasel only to be reeled in yet again by Georgia's silent command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I want you to keep that fire in your belly, Texas. Hold onto it reeeeeal tight...\" She said before standing up from her seat (or rather, Texas' seat) and gradually closed the distance between the two of them. Texas remained stonefaced even as the towering mare stood inches from her face. Georgia\u2019s massive gut and heaving breast partially obscured her face from Texas\u2019 view, though she could still sense that her long time rival was sneering down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll make it all the more enjoyable once I trounce you\u201d she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh wouldn\u2019t put mah money on it, Georgia. Ah\u2019ve seen ol\u2019 ladies who can draw faster than you\u201d Texas said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Georgia\u2019s smug grin quickly turned into a scowl as her fists clenched angrily. She wasn\u2019t so badly to turn the former sheriff into a smear beneath her boot, but she restrained herself for the time being. She had been given the unique chance to beat Texas at the one thing she prided herself in, humiliating her in front of the whole town before whisking her away to a life of servitude beneath her flank. Plus, it would also serve as a deterrent from the potential do-gooders who had it in their head that they could depose the new sheriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReal cute. You won\u2019t be talkin\u2019 all that smack after I\u2019ve embarrassed you in front of the whole town\u201d she growled before walking back over to the desk and plopping her enormous rear back onto Texas\u2019 chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on, git! You got two hours to get ready. If I find out you skipped town, I\u2019ll have you hunted down and made into Mayor Vivian\u2019s personal placemat\u201d She said as she kicked her feet and leaned back. A smug smile crossed her face as she let loose a thunderous fart, her gaze fixed on Texas the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know ah don\u2019t run\u201d Texas said with a smirk before slowly backing out of the sheriff\u2019s office, her eyes fixed onto Georgia\u2019s trigger happy thugs. She made a mental note to have her chair thoroughly scrubbed down after everything was settled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Two Hours Later</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n An eerie silence hung over the town of Gold Springs. Word of the encroaching duel had spread quick and all the townsfolk had taken shelter either within their homes. Texas could still feel them peering in on the town square where the two opposing figures began to advance on one another from opposite sides. Their hands were fixed on their respective holsters, though neither made any attempts to open fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn\u2019t long before they stood toe to toe with one another, their gazes meeting with intense focus. They felt no need to trade quips, as it no longer fit the mood of what was to come. Everything was on the line, for both the noble Texas and her corrupt ex-deputy. Texas was fighting for her badge and the good people of Gold Springs while Georgia was fighting for both the badge and to prove once and for all that she was more equipped for the job of town sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After they let the tension build for a solid minute, they drew their weapons and turned their backs to each other. In a moment of weakness, Georgia backed up and gently pressed her massive rear end onto Texas\u2019 back, giving her a very minor sample of what was to come should she lose. Texas grimaced, though remained resolute. No amount of mind games could change the outcome of this duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As far as Texas was concerned, her victory was a foregone conclusion. Even if Georgia improved since the last time they had duked it out, there was no way that she could best the greatest marksman in all of Gold Springs. The only way should could even imagine Georgia coming out on top was if she cheated and while it certainly wouldn\u2019t be out of character for her to do, Texas was confident that her ruse had done its job. By challenging her in front of her hired thugs, she had set up a situation where Georgia would have to make an example out of her or run the risk of having her abilities called into question. There were plenty of criminals who would do anything to be in her position the last thing she\u2019d want was for them to think that she couldn\u2019t fight her own battles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two rivals began to slowly was away, the both of them counting with each step they took.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\u201c1\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c2\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c3\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c4\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c5\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c6\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c7\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c8\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c9\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c10!\u201d</b></span></div></div>",

With out unevenly matched they were, it wasn't even a fair competition. Georgia's pride had gotten her to sign off in a challenge that she couldn't possibly win. It would take nothing less than divine intervention for her to come out on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At least, that's what Texas thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the two of them went for their guns, something happened that ruined what was supposed to be the sheriff's moment of triumph. Her hand darted for the holster and she went to yank her gun free... only for it to get stuck. That momentary flounder hindered her for just long enough for Georgia to pull out her gun and take aim. After a few tugs, Texas managed to free her gun only to have it blown away mere seconds later. She yelped and fell to her knees as she clutched her stinging hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The once confident woman stood completely frozen, her mind reeling from the shock of what just occurred. She lost in a gunfight. She <i>lost</i> in a gunfight. And not just to anyone, but to Georgia, the slowest marksman she had ever known. There was no way that could possibly be the case. How could Georgia beat her, but do it fair and square? If she had cheated in some fashion, then Texas could almost forgive the embarrassing loss, but that wasn't how it went down. She just got outgunned... by <i><b>Georgia</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Texas sat stewing in the muck of her defeat, Georgia was soaking up the adulation of her goons as they watched the whole thing unfold from the windows of the sheriff's office. She had often fantasized about this exact moment playing out and it was even sweeter than she thought it'd be. Now everyone in town knew who was the better woman. No one would ever question her authority after today. All that was left for her to do was claim her prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cruel mare whistled a hardy tune as she gradually walked over to Texas who still sat staring at her hand in shock. The former sheriff was so stunned by what happened, she didn't even notice Georgia approaching until she was in arms distance. She was brought out of her trance by the sound Georgia clearing her throat and she looked up to meet her gaze. As her replacement leered down at her with a sinister grin, it finally occurred to Texas just how frightening she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any last words before introduce you to your new life?\" she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-best two out of three?\" Texas stammered with a hopeful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that addressed, Georgia turned her back to Texas, letting the mortified weasel soak in the image of her enormous rear end. From where she sat, Texas could already smell the rank fumes immigrating from her crack and a wave of fear induced nausea washed over her. She wasn't sure what Georgia had in store for her, but she didn't need to be a mind reader to know that she would never get to enjoy the taste of fresh air ever again. After Georgia sufficiently frightened her former rival, she hooked her fingers into her waistband and lowered her tight black jeans onto the ground, exposing her sweat soaked ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayor Vivian's been running me ragged all day. I've been on my feet for a while now, so you'll forgive me if I smell a little rank\" she said with a grin as she looked back at Texas, a shiver running down her spine as she drank in her fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Georgia, please\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Texas whimpered as she fell back with her hands out in a pitiful attempt to stave off what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Texas? Are you really trying to get out of our agreement? I expected better from someone as honest as you\u201d She teased as she wiggled her smelly rump in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas tried to think of a something she could say to rebuke her, but she knew that Georgia had her dead to rights. The incorruptible lawman prided herself on her integrity, and as such never went back on a promise or an agreement. She had staked everything on her ability to outshoot Georgia and came up short. As sick as it made her, she had no choice but to abide by her personal code of ethics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, b-but--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ah, I don\u2019t wanna hear it! The only \u2018but\u2019 that you should be concerned with is the one in front of you!\u201d Georgia chided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas\u2019 eyes widened to the size of dinner plates as Georgia jumped up into the air and came down onto her butt aimed squarely at her face. As she came crashing down, Texas opened her mouth to scream, but it would end up being a huge mistake as her mouth was soon filled with the taste of Georgia\u2019s sweaty ass flesh. The impact completely flattened her and left an ass-shaped groove where she once stood. Everything was dark and her senses were completely dominated by the metric ton of rank horse booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While she was in absolute hell, Georgia was in a state of pure euphoria as she ground her massive flank on top of her long time rival, revelling in every crack and squelch that came from beneath her.. After years of playing second banana to her goody-goody boss, she couldn\u2019t think of a more fitting way to celebrate her promotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After grinding her into the dirt for almost half an hour, she stood up to admire her handiwork. Texas\u2019 face was frozen in a look of utter horror, her flattened body all but glued to Georgia\u2019s meaty flank. The pitiful sight was enough to make the heartless mare bust out in laughter, though she wasn\u2019t quite satisfied yet. She needed to make sure that Texas really knew where her place was in life and she knew just how to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She grabbed Texas by her paper thin ponytail and slowly peeled her body off of her butt before holding it up in front of her face. The crushed weasel whimpered helplessly she looked at Georgia with pleading eyes. She prayed that there to be a sliver of mercy buried deep down in her ex-deputy\u2019s heart, but it was for not as Georgia snickered at her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me that look. You\u2019ve had this comin\u2019 for a long time. All those years I spent bein\u2019 your lacky are gonna come back to haunt ya, because now things are gonna be different around here. I bet you\u2019re expecting me to lock you up now, right? For me to haul you over to jail so you\u2019ll never have to see my face again? Oh, if only you were that lucky. Nah, I got somethin\u2019 better in mind for you, Texas. Startin\u2019 now, you\u2019re gonna be my deputy!\u201d she cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas\u2019 gasped and her eyes went wide once again. Back when Georgia worked for her, she would often throw out snide remarks about what she would do if the roles were refused. She paid no mind to it at the time, but now her comment took on a terrifying new light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! Please! Anything but that!\u201d she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScream all you want, but it\u2019s already been done. While I was gettin\u2019 ready for our showdown, I called up Vivian and pitched her my idea. It took me a while to sell her on it, but then I told her a brief rundown one what the job entails. After that, she thought you were perfect for the job! Speakin\u2019 of which\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She grinned from ear to her as her other hand grabbed onto Texas\u2019 dangling legs and stretched the flattened weasel out as much as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about time you got started!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, she whipped Texas' stretched out body between her legs and began using her to floss her rancid buttcrack. She hit every nook and cranny, leaving no part of her crack untouched. This went on for some time before she grew bored with the game and decided to bring it to a end. She bent her knees and pulled on Texas\u2019 body as hard as she could, wedging her so deep into her crack that she could feel her face pressing against her pucker. The smelly mare bit down on her bottom lip as she let loose an earth shattering fart directly into Texas\u2019 face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Georgia sighed in content before pulling the former sheriff out of her sweaty crevice, her smile widening she admired her handiwork. Texas was absolutely soaked in her sweat and judging by the weary, glassy eyed expression on her face, it was clear that she had all but given up on resisting. Georgia snickered and unceremoniously deposited her new deputy into the back of pants before pulling them back up and giving her right cheek a slap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome aboard, deputy! I\u2019m sure you and I are gonna along juuuuust fine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that business settle, she happily trotted back to the office with her prize pressed tightly against her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 today was a good day\u201d Georgia mused before letting out another brassy fart.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her new position called on her to wait on Georgia hand and foot, acting more as a servant rather than her partner in law enforcement. She would have cook her meals, wash her clothes, serve her drinks, give her back and foot massages, and so on. That was the part of the job that she could almost tolerate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n When she wasn't serving her boss, Georgia would use the poor woman as her plaything. Texas would be stomped flat, sat on, and chewed up, with little to no warning or provocation. This cruel treatment used to only happen whenever Texas tried to assert herself, though it wasn't long before the fight had been thoroughly beaten out of her. She grew to truly fear Georgia, more so than even her most sycophantic of underlings and it was this fear that kept her stepping out of line. Not that it really helped all that much. Georgia had demonstrated many times that she didn't need any justification to abuse her hapless deputy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That day had been particularly draining for Texas as she was tasked with massaging Georgia's naked rear while she laid flat on her stomach. Every few minutes she would blast Texas in the face with a noxious fart which she was required to inhale in deep breathes. Not only that, but the heartless sheriff actually expected Texas to serve her drinks while massaging continuing to massage her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas soon stood before her boss with a big fake smile permanently decorated onto her face and a bottle of whiskey in her outstretched hand. She had been reprimanded for not being cheerful on the job and had to force herself to smile at every waking moment of they day. Georgia nodded her head in approval before snatching the drink out or her hand and downing the whole bottle in one quick shot before letting out a belch that rattled the windows of her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour response time has been lacking as of late, Texas. This job isn\u2019t getting too hard for ya, is it?\u201d Georgia asked with a tone of mock concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No! Course not! Ah love mah job!\u201d Texas\u2019 said hastedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, but I can\u2019t in good conscience allow you to carry such a harsh workload\u201d Georgia said as she rolled off of her lounge chair and onto her feet. She surprised her laughter as she looked down at her deputy\u2019s horrified expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t gotta worry none, Texas. There are plenty of folks in these parts who\u2019d be happy to pick up the slack for ya\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoss, no\u2026!\u201d Texas cried as she trembled violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I\u2019ve made up my mind. Get your stuff packed up while I go sign your pink slip\u201d Georgia said sternly before she began walking over to her desk. She was stopped mid-stride as Texas lounged forward and latched onto her ankle, her eyes wide and her expression conveying intense emotional distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t fire me, Georgia! Ah promise ah won\u2019t be so slow no more! Ah\u2019ll work twice as hard and ah won\u2019t never complain!\u201d she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Georgia grinned down at her once respected rival. One could be forgiven for assuming that Texas had actually grown to enjoy her job, but they\u2019d be wrong. When Georgia saddled her with the position of deputy, she wanted to make sure that there was nothing for her to go back to should she rebel. She did this by making sure that every act of violence, extortion and strong arming done to the good people of Gold Springs were done under the orders of the deputy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Or course, Texas would never commit such heinous acts even by proxy, but that didn\u2019t stop the townsfolk from thinking it. They were quick to turn on their once noble protector, viewing her with more scorn and disdain than they did any criminal. As bad as it was working for Georgia, Texas knew that she was the only thing protecting her from a town full of people who wanted her head on a pike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 well\u2026 I guess I can give you another chance. But if I see you slacking off even once, you\u2019re outta here! Get me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas sighed in relief and wiped the sweat from her brow. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Georgia\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t quite catch that. What did you just say?\u201d Georgia asked as she narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I said, \u2018thank you so much, Boss\u2019!\u201d Texas said with as wide a smile as she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought I heard. Now. It\u2019s gettin\u2019 late and I need to get some paperwork done. You know what to do\u201d Georgia said as she pointed a thumb at her massive office chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas didn\u2019t even hesitate as she crawled over to the chair and laid down squarely in the middle. She wasn\u2019t a stranger to this kind of treatment and while she never quite got used to it, she was just grateful to have not been fed to the proverbial lions. Georgia smiled at her excellent response time and got into position, her naked rear hovering precariously over Texas\u2019 body. No longer did she beg Georgia for mercy like she used to, but she could still feel the fear radiating off of her as she awaited her fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Georgia decided to forgo her usual teasing as she had quite a bit of paperwork to get through. She brought her massive rear down onto Texas with a satisfying <b>*squish* </b>and after grinding her but back and forth to get herself comfortable, went to work. She shivered in delight as she felt Texas' tongue lapping up the sweat from her meaty flank, desperate to have her approval under the threat of termination. Her hard work was rewarded with a quick but powerful fart directly into her face, though that didn't deter Texas in the slightest as she continued to service her boss' rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that's it... keep at it Tex, and you just might make employee of the month!\" Georgia cooed condescendingly as she glanced back at her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This routine would carry on for years to come, with Texas playing her part as Georgia's servant, waiting on her hand and foot while inhaling more of her rancid body odors. Eventually, Texas' mind began to break down from the constant abuse and she began to legitimately enjoy her job. She became Georgia's loyal slave, happily serving her boss and performing any task asked of her no matter how degrading. Gold Springs became a hive of criminal activity as Vivian established her absolute control over it and it wasn't long after Georgia retired to her new estate built at the edge of town. No one would ever see Texas again, though those brave enough to get within five feet of Georgia's home swear that they would occasionally see her and Georgia lounging out on the lawn, the former sheriff resting her head on her arms while Texas happily rested her head between her owner's colossal buttcheeks. Such talk was disregarded as rumor, but Georgia did nothing to deny it when asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now my new deputy lets let you soak up my stink for a good while I explain your new duties to you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas groaned under her ass, how could this have happened?  The entire world was upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be doing a lot of ass licking and worship as my new deputy.  You see you'll be more of a moral officer than anything else.  Now don't that sound nice?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo it didn't... it sounded horrible!  Her muffled cries were music to Georgia's ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not all you'll be doing of course!  You see you are going to be below me in every possible way and the lowest part of my body, my feet, are going to be where you will be at the most!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she got up off of Texas who breathed in some clean air only for it to be immediately fouled up by Georgia's foot being pressed down on her nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a big whiff!  Yeah sniff it bitch!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so gross and rancid, and the idea of being under them all day was a literal nightmare.  She wanted to cry but didn't want to give her former deputy the satisfaction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hearing sniffing, do it, you have no choice!  Or do you want to smother under my ass for the rest of the day?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas couldn't handle that so quickly complied and sniffed up the gross cheesy stench.  She coughed and the cruel female above her laughed in triumph.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know as fun as this is, lets get an actual audience.  Come now deputy crawl behind me as we make our way to the center of the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no choice but to obey she crawled after her tormentor and soon the entire town turned out to see what was going on.  Georgia let the crowd gather for awhile and went it got to the right size she announced what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is the day this town has a new sheriff!  And today is the day Texas here becomes my deputy.  I'm going to demonstrate to all of y'all just what this little bitch will be doing from here on out.  Well?  Let's go plant the first of many kisses on my smelly feet!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gasped in surprise.  Was this really going to happen?  Yes it was!  Texas crawled her much smaller frame forward and then began kissing Georgia's feet.  This went on for several minutes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but don't think that's all she'll be doing.  Why don't you go ahead and lick them all nice and clean you silly weasel.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas whimpered she really didn't want to do this but she knew she was beaten and didn't have a choice.  She stuck out her tongue and began lapping at the broad and now dirty soles of her opponent's feet.  She hated how she was now in this inferior position.  She still couldn't believe she had lost.  And the taste... it was so awful!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was now starting to laugh and jeer at her.  How quick the tables turned!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You silly girl, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do her feet taste good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By golly I bet those feet reek!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humiliating taunts and phrases hurt Texas to the core of her soul.  She felt less than the dirt she was licking up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh that's nice, yeah get every little crevice and inch of my foot.  What a good little foot lapping girl you are!  You know what they say, idle hands are the tool of the devil.  Why don't you massage one foot while you lick the other!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cruel suggestion was put into action and now Texas had to rub one stinky foot while licking the other.  Her entire world had shrunk down to the new sheriff's feet.  The odor hadn't gotten much better despite her diligent cleaning.  The air was still full of the vinegar stench of sweaty feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough for the moment my loyal deputy.  Why don't you tell the crowd how weak you are.  How I'm the better shot and how you love serving me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... please don't make me say that.\"  Texas asked in a quiet pleading voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what I say!  You whiny weasel, I own you!  Do you want to be back under my ass??  Get to it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no choice Texas loudly proclaimed what had happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost... she's the better person for the job.  I failed as the sheriff.  She's the better shot.  Georgia owns me.  I'm going to be her deputy and serve her every day of my life.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd lost it, they laughed and mocked her even more.  Her once proud visage was now full of shame, embarrassment and despair.  All Texas wanted to do was curl up into a ball and block out the sounds of their mockery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure you've all been quite entertained but I need to be heading back home and really putting my deputy to use.  So ta ta for now, you'll be seeing me around I'm sure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved the townsfolk off and told Texas to crawl after her.  Once more she was on all fours following behind the new sheriff and her new master.  She had been stripped of her position, humiliated, sat on and been forced to clean nasty feet.  That was in public.. what would the cruel monster do to her in private?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah home sweet home.  You know you'll be doing all the little household chores around here when you aren't serving my feet.  I sometimes let this place go a little so you might have to give up some sleep for the first few nights as you'll need to be serving me directly when I'm awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould this nightmare get worse?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right time to sit and relax on my recliner while you properly worship my feet.  I don't just want you to lick and kiss 'em I want you to really get into it.  Make me believe they are the most wonderful tasting morsels you've ever tasted.  Make me believe you think their smell is heavenly.  Get to it before I have to punish you!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying the commands had now become second nature and she quickly bent to the awful task.  The feet had gotten dirty again from the trip to the house and the taste of dirt soon coated Texas's tongue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on more enthusiasm!  And thank me for teaching you your place!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas redoubled her efforts to please the sheriff.  She took long broad licks and planted french kisses on every part of her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Georgia!  I should have been at your feet the first time we met.  Thank you so much, they are just delightful.  I love your feet, thank you for teaching me where I belong!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha ain't life grand?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas of course would disagree but she didn't have that luxury.  Instead she continued to serve at the feet of her former lackey.  Her sense of self diminished as she debased herself from the amusement of Georgia!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Georgia was enjoying life but Texas really wasn't that good at foot worshiping.  Probably wasn't her fault since this was the first time she had to do something like this but Georgia wasn't about to tolerate no excuses!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call that foot service?  Pathetic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Georgia, I'm trying my...\"  Texas's statement was interrupted by a rather vicious kick to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare use my name like we are friends, you will address me as ma'am or boss from now on.  Is that clear?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"  Texas replied meekly.  She was terrified of what Georgia would do to her if she didn't instantly comply with her demands.  \"I'll try to do better boss.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes  you will but first you need to be punished for your incompetence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia pulls Texas across her lap and begins to spank her something fierce.  The poor weasel cried out in humiliation and in pain as Georgia showed her rear end no mercy!  After at least a hundred powerful smacks from the mare she was pushed to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for not taking care of  your feet better boss.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now keep worshiping them until I say stop, and put some feeling into it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas tried, she put on a fake smile on her face and pretended to greedily lick her soles like they were the sweetest tasting pudding. It was hard since she hated every second of it.  Georgia was amused at her pathetic groveling and attempts to avoid further punishment, ah life was good for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was going down and it was now about 7:30.  Most folks stayed up until about midnight and then rose up at 8:00.  So it was a surprise when Georgia said.  \"All right, bed time bitch.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't even 8:00 though ma'am.\"  Texas protested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SLAP* In an instant slap to the face sends Texas to the ground.  Georgia's foot engulfs her face as she pushes down on it adding pressure to her mouth and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never disrespect me again!  Never challenge one of my instructions again!   You will go to bed like a disobedient baby every day at 7:30.  Now go crawl to your room and go to sleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas again meekly obeyed and crawled away.  She got into bed and cried, she wasn't tired despite the exhausting day, it was too early to go to sleep!  Instead she tossed and turned for hours before finally drifting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning she was given some gruel to eat on the ground out of a bowl and then she was taken back into the town square.  There Georgia once again sat down and demanded a massage.  Of course this attracted a rather large crowd of curious onlookers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell the public how much you love serving at my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas, now totally shamed spoke up so people could hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love serving your feet Georgia!  This is the highlight of my day.  Thank you for letting me massage your feet, it makes me so happy to know that I'm helping you feel good.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd thought this was quite amusing.  Texas pushed her thumbs into the arches of her owner's feet, rubbed all over the soles and rubbed her toes.  Sadly for the former sheriff her efforts simply were not good enough for Gerogia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call that a massage?  Pathetic!  You must want to get punished!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia stomped down on Texas's body with her feet.  She focused mostly on the breasts and stomach as she didn't want to knock her slave out but a few milder strikes targeted the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that bitch!?  You like how everyone in the town is laughing at you for being such a fuck up.  That's it cry for me, cry in front of the whole town you weak little baby!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mocking laughter and the pain were too much for poor Texas.  She was broken as her body unleashed a torrent of tears.  Her sobs were loud and pathetic as the whole town realized the sheriff was all hat and no cattle.  She was pathetic.  The people she used to bring to justice walked up now and laughed at her as she sobbed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all want to use her whore mouth?  She's not that good at worshiping feet and could use some practice but I bet it will still be fun for you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fun it was.  The villains of the town throughout enjoyed making the once uppity sheriff thoroughly clean their feet.  They mocked her and spat on her and told her she was scum.  Texas started believing it was true.  What kind of sheriff cleaned the corrupt citizens of a town in full view of everyone?  She was pathetic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for trying to interfere with your lives.  Please forgive me.\"  Texas begged as the townsfolk laughed and jeered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent the day licking feet clean, massage and worshiping.  At one point she had a known cattle rustler's feet down her throat while massage another criminal's foot as a third sat on her stomach waiting for her turn.  It was sheer hell.  Hours in the hot sun servicing dirty, sweaty and foul feet.  She wasn't even given water to drink, Georgia just had townsfolk spit in her mouth for hydration.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was time to return to her new home.  Georgia was very pleased with how worn out and pathetic her slave looked.  Of course her day was not complete, it was time for her feet to be serviced now!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss every part of them, worship them.  Then you can get started on sucking each toe individual, give them lots of attention you foot slut.  And smile, I want to see your face bright and cheery as you pay homage to your Master's feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas knew she was being conditioned to obey and accept her place.  This knowledge did nothing to ease her sorrow and shame.  For the hundredth time she cursed her failure in defeating her one time deputy.  As she lapped at Georgia's soles she realized that this was only the second day of her servitude.  How much worse were things going to get?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour on her knees it was once again 7:30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for bed, no crying or you don't get breakfast tomorrow.  Go crawl into bed.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas obeyed but again, sleep was difficult.  As she closed her eyes and tried to will her tired body to pass out she heard Georgia on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah things are going quite well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I plan to.  No I don't expect she'll try to escape, she had no where to go and she knows I'll skin her if she tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh now that's an idea.  She sucks as massages anyway so losing her paws wouldn't be that big of a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror spiked through Texas's mind.  Was she talking... amputation?  She didn't know if Georgia was being serious or if this was some kind of sick mind game.  Georgia probably knew Texas couldn't get to sleep that early... but still.  It worried her.  She vowed to get better at massaging feet with her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her life now.  She needed to be the best possible slave she could be to avoid permanent harm to her body!  With that chilling though she cried herself to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night Texas was tormented with nightmares of being a limbless circus freak.  She woke up frightened multiple times panting and in a cold sweat.  It was awful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning she was given gruel to eat from a dog bowl again and Georgia questioned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you scream last night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry boss, I did not realize I did.  I had... nightmares.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared and embarrassed Texas told her about overhearing the conversation and how it had given her nightmares.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you eavesdropped on my conversations you disrespectful lackey.  You serve me, you don't spy on my conversations.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't try to spy, its just that the walls are thing and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia interrupted her words with a kick to the face followed by a hearty stomp to her already sore ribs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"  The mare pressed her bare solo onto Texas's face making sure she couldn't open her mouth to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are getting too damn lippy, quit being difficult.  For the crime of spying on me you'll be punished.  Just so that you know, I was talking with your old friend Roxxie Roo on what fun things to do to you.  I wasn't really going to cut off your limbs you stupid fool.  Why would I cripple my new slave?  Your massages could use some work but you'll get better.  I certainly don't want to have to take care of you as a useless cripple, you'll be the one who does all the household chores and work around here.  So get that stupid thought out of your empty brain and worry more about how you are going to be punished for your transgression!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was relieved she wouldn't have her limbs taken from her!  Roxxie Roo was such an awful person though, she and her had butted heads a long time.  She was a corrupt outlaw and they had fought for years back and forth.  The thought that she had some say on what was going to happen to her was a scary thing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a frightened little girl, Roxxie is going to have so much fun playing with you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas let out a little whine but didn't dare speak out against it happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww little baby afraid of getting punished, well you should be.  Roxxie is on her way over and she's bringing a few things we are going to use on your disrespectful ass.  While we wait for her massage my feet and get yourself prepared.   Once she walks in the door you will crawl to her, kiss her toes and then humbly apologize for ever giving her a hard time.  Do I make myself clear, girl?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"  Texas replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas massaged to the best of her ability for 30 minutes until her arch rival arrived.  Not wanting even further punishment she crawled over to Roxxie Roo and kissed her toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry for all the things I've done in the past.  You were always the better woman, please forgive me for my improper behavior ma'am.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoo laughed and laughed.  \"Holy shit Georgia you got this little bitch trained already!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh not yet but soon.  She was eavesdropping on us earlier so we're going to use your toys to teach her not to pull that shit again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie grinned broadly as she opened her bag and pulled out cane and a paddle.  Texas shivered a bit, both devices looked quite mean.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bend your ass over the table here, its time for  your punishment.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas bowed her head, \"Yes ma'am.\"  And stiffly got into position.  Roxxie had the cane and s he gave a firm whack to her ass caused her to flinch badly.  The second strike was even harder and it elicited a sharp cry of pain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, look at the tough law woman now.  Remember when you arrested me for tax evasion?  Little petty shit charge like that really ruined my day.  Well now I'm about to ruin yours!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WHACK* *WHACK* *WHACK*  Three strikes in rapid succession from the criminal led to further cries of pain from Texas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Roxxie don't take all the fun, its my turn too!\"  Georgia instructed and began slamming the broader spanking implement into Texas's already pained rear end.  The pain wasn't as concentrated in a narrow band like the cane was, but the blow struck her entire ass all at once.  Texas honestly wasn't sure what was worse!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was crying freely now as the two alternated in beating her.  Her skin was raw and blistered from the combined assault from the two of them.  Texas began sobbing and begging for mercy as the two laughed at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah let me hear your cries, little bitch!\"  Roo in particular liked hitting her as hard as she could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they hit her a few more times, just to teach her that her begging wasn't the reason they stopped, they let her collapse onto the ground.  Her nose was runny and her ass and face were red.  Tears coated her fur and she looked an absolute mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now time for you to worship 4 feet at the time time, cunt!\"  Georgia demanded and they had Texas lay down on the ground while they both sat in chairs with their feet propped up on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pressed their feet hard into Texas's face.  Texas was forced to lick their soles and suck on their toes.  At times they even playfully smothered her beneath their feet.  Something that terrified the poor girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us who calls the shot around this town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do ma'am, Georgia and Roxxie call the shots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right and are just our lackey, our slave, our foot licking chore monkey.  Ain't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed some more and continued forcing her to worship their feet.  Time passed slowly for Texas as she served the two but eventually the hours started to catch up to them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look  here, its 7:00, time for bed time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss.\"  The fight had completely left Texas, she couldn't even protest or argue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas planted one last kiss on each of their toes and then crawled to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right do what your mommy tells you to do.\"  Roxxie laughed as Texas obeyed her owner.  Texas flushed with shame and wanted so badly to attack her but she was the weaker woman.  Georgia had taught her that, her fate was to obey her betters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crawled into her room and into bed she overheard the two chatting.  She tried to block it out as to not get in trouble for \"spying\" on them again but she couldn't help but hear Roxxie's comments to Georgia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn girl you really have her under foot.  She didn't even try to fight back or argue against going to be at 7:00.  She even let me, her hated arch rival, cane her ass until she was practically bleeding.  She'll have welts for days.  You really are stronger and smarter than she ever was.  The town is going to be yours to control for as long as you want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a chilling thought.  Texas believed in law and order and it was clear the two villains who had beat her did not.  She was beaten down and utterly destroyed physically, mentally and emotionally.  But could she truly allow the town she loved to fall to ruins without at least trying to fight back against her new master?  Could she?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Texas was in no condition to fight back, not only was she physically weaker having to subsist on gruel and ingesting dirt and pathogens from nasty feet she was also mentally in a shattered and depressed state.  There wasn't much fight left in her, and certainly not enough for a physical confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning she was once again worshiping Georgia's feet.  Her tongue snaking in between her toes and her lips paying homage to her new boss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know foot slut I've been thinking.  You might not think what's happened to is all that fair so tonight I'm going to have the town decide who will be the new sheriff.  We'll hold us a good old fashioned election.  If you win then you'll be done with my feet but if I win this it for the rest of your life.  Aren't you glad you have a chance to win back your position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"  Texas automatically said while continuing to kiss and lick her toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only been a few days and your training has come along so well.  You know exactly how I like to be addressed and your food cleanin and servin abilities have improved.  This is really your rightful place and after today you won't be questioning it. Now, stay on your knees and keep worshiping my feet for the next couple of hours and then its time to to back to the town square.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day Georgia arranged it with the mayor.  They were each going to give a speech in front of the town and then the town would vote that day. Texas saw light at the end of the tunnel, surely the town would recognize all the good she had down?  Surely they would see what an awful person Georgia was and vote against the mare.  She had hope and Georgia saw that in her eyes, instead of being mad she was ecstatic, seeing that hope die would be such a turn on!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was the first to give her speech.  She begin by talking about how she had reduced crime and made sure the people were safe and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH BUT YOU LICK FEET!\"  Roxxie interrupted.  The crown tittered and giggled as Texas looked embarrassed and uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to shake it off but now she was off her game and stuttering as she tried to get through her plea to elect her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking isn't your strong suit Texas, your mouth was made for licking my feet.\"  This time it was Georgia who interrupted.  She didn't shout out as loud as Roxxie but everyone heard her and everyone had seen Texas licking Georgia.  More laughter and mummer of general agreement.  Clearly Texas's mouth wasn't meant for public speaking!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely derailed now Texas ended quickly before she could be embarrassed any further.  As she walked away Roxxie began chanting \"Foot slut, Foot slut, Foot slut.\"  Almost everyone in the crowd joined her and Texas returned to her seat utterly mortified.  It was Georgia's turn now but before she went up she grabbed Texas by the ear and pulled her to where Roxxie was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit in her lap while you listen to a real woman of the world speak!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia begins her speech and she is eloquent and poised.  Texas could see she had the crowd eating out of the palm of her hand and needed to do something.  She opened her mouth to heckle her like she was heckled only to have Roxxie to cover her mouth with her paw and shush her loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh no talking, here let me rock you back and forth little baby girl.\"  Roxxie mocked as she prevented Texas from speaking.  The people around her laughed and pointed and Georgia grinned at the team work she and Roxxie had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas tried a couple times more but each time she was shushed like a little child.  In the end she gave up trying to interfere and just sat there and hoped the townsfolk could see how wrong all of this was!  They had to!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was time to vote and the mayor began to count the votes.  Vivian smirked as she looked through the votes, the town wasn't a big city so it didn't take that long.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well folks this is a new one!  For the first time ever, this town has elected a new sheriff with a unanimous vote!\"  Texas waited with baited breath, had the entire town seen through Georgia's lies?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Sheriff Georgia!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas collapsed to the ground.  She didn't get a single vote?  Not one vote?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia thanked the crowd and promised to be a great sheriff.  \"Also feel free to step by the sheriff's office anytime you like.  If my little foot girl ain't working on my feet y'all are free to use her anyway you want!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd roared in delight and began chanting.  \"GEORGIA!  GEORGIA GEORGIA!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor walked up and said a few words.  \"Now I'm going to pin the sheriff badge on our wonderful new sheriff.  I think it is fitting that while I do so, her stupid useless pea-brained opponent come kiss my feet and then her owner's feet.  What say you people of Gold Springs?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas is such a loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make her suck your toes!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas had no fight in her and pathetically kissed the feet of the mayor who smirked down with amusement.  And then she kissed the now familiar feet of her former deputy.  Georgia accepted the badge and then attached a leash to her now lifetime lackey and foot bitch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you townsfolk, now I'm going to go home but before I do please line up, I'd like to shake your hand, paw or whatever and then this little weasel here can kiss your feet.  She's the lowest bitch in this town, and she should pay homage to her superiors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crown loved it and Texas ended up kissing the feet of every single person who voted against her!  Most made remarks about how wonderful Georgia was and  how pathetic Texas was in comparison.  Shame and humiliation filled Texas's body to the brim.  It was the worst day of her entire life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas crawled behind Georgia as they went back to her place.  Her knees and hands hurt but she didn't dare complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless we are in a hurry, you'll crawl when we go into town.  Got it, you lazy foot licking piece of trash?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss.\"  Georgia intoned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a good minion.  I honestly thought it would take me awhile to fully break you, but your all done aren't you?  Your too scared to fight back.  Your too ashamed at how the town views you to even think of yourself as a normal person anymore.  This is what I wanted but wow, this wasn't even a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas felt tears well in her eyes.  Georgia was right, this was pathetic.  She was pathetic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived home she had to massage her owner's feet.  It was around 8:00 so the foot massage didn't last long before Georgia ordered her to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will always win at everything, and you will always lose.  Now go to bed like a naughty little child.  You wretched little baby, I can't believe you couldn't even get one pity vote from someone in the town.  What a wimpy loser.  Go on, git.  Got bed while I chat with my friends on the phone about how easy it was to make you my bitch.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas obeyed feeling lower than she had ever been in her life!  Her fate was sealed, there was new sheriff in town!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Texas woke up to another day of hell.  She was fed gruel and had to thank Georgia by kissing her feet and repeating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for feeding me boss.  Thank you for teaching my place ma\u2019am.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia delighted in showing her former employer just where she fell in the pecking order of things.  After the feeding and humiliation Georgia decided that it was time to play a new game with Texas. For this game she trussed her slave up in a classic hog tie, her feet left inches in front Georgia\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToday I\u2019m going to show you that even the air you breathe is mine to give or to deny.  Let\u2019s start with some nice loving foot worship, and for your sake it had better be impeccable.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas didn\u2019t quite know what her owner meant but she quickly replied, \u201cYes ma\u2019am\u201d and got to work licking the large soles of her ruler.  Her tongue caressed the arches and every inch of her feet.  Her mouth suckled on her toes and ensured every bit of the foot was paid attention to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll be darned; you are actually taking care of my feet pretty much perfectly.  But you know I still want to play with you, and what the boss wants, the boss gets!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was in a horribly uncomfortable and helpless position.  Georgia soon made it worse by gagging the former sheriff with her used handkerchief and then tied it in place.  She returned to her seat and then casually placed her toes in front of Texas\u2019s nostrils.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy feet smell nice, don\u2019t they?  Tell me you love them.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas couldn\u2019t speak but she tried to speak around the gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, being a disobedient little cuss, are you?\u201d  Georgia knew she couldn\u2019t speak but it was fun to do this to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helpless weasel tried again but it was futile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI give you a simple order and you can\u2019t even follow it.  Well then, if you don\u2019t want to continue sniffing my feet, I\u2019ll do you a favor and make sure you can\u2019t smell them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was utterly confused by the comment, until the toes of her boss wrapped themselves around her nose!  Now she couldn\u2019t get in any air at all between the handkerchief and the toes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go!  No chance of smelling my feet now.  That\u2019s what you wanted right?  Since you didn\u2019t praise my foot odor you must want me to do this.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas squirmed in her restraints.  The hog tie made it so she couldn\u2019t move her arms and legs.  Her neck was free to move though.  As her oxygen began to run out and the pain in her lungs started to increase, she began to try to shake her head side to side in order to dislodge the hold on her nose.  Unfortunately for her Georgia simply followed her head with her foot keeping her grip all the while.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh you are turning red, is it starting to get painful?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas moaned in her gag, frantic to be able to get in life giving oxygen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel to know that I have the power to end your life with just my cute toes?  Isn\u2019t that amazing?  Feel how helpless you are, feel how I so completely own you that the very air you inhale is up to me.  Oooh yes, give me that look, beg with your eyes to let me let you live!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia cackled as Texas looked up at her with sheer unadulterated terror in her eyes.   With a smirk she released her toe grip on Texas\u2019s nose and her slave sucked in air.  She of course kept her feet right in front of her face so she inhaled her foot odor the entire time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, get a good sniff of my feet.  The way you are inhaling now, the desperate filling of your lungs, that\u2019s what I want to hear when I order you to sniff my feet.  Full blown desperate inhaling.  Do we understand each other my little foot bitch?\u201d <br>\r\nShe nodded her head fearfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do believe you\u2019ve learned your lesson but that was way too much fun so let\u2019s make sure you totally understand your place around her.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas frantically struggled in her bonds as Georgia\u2019s cruel toes effortlessly squeezed her nostrils shut once more\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******** ********** *********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas had been subjected to nearly an hour of asphyxiation at the feet of Georgia.  The juxtaposition of terror from the slave and pleasure from the owner had been a delightful reminder to both of them who was the boss and who was the subordinate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the morning's entertainment Texas had been untied and been forced to worship the feet of the person who had cruelly smothered her over and over again.  Made to say further humiliating things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for letting me live boss.  Thank you ma'am for letting me have air.  Thank you for letting me breathe your food odor, thank you, thank you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Georgia showed Texas what she would be doing chore wise.  Her life would consistent of serving at Georgia's feet, doing all the chores in the home and serving other townsfolk's feet.  There would be no leisure or relaxation for Texas, no rest breaks until it was time for her to turn in early for bed.  This would be her life of slavery and servitude to her superior, to the mare who had put her in her place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia went into town to leave Texas to the chores.  Texas was so beaten down and frankly so scared of Georgia's wrath she didn't even think about trying to escape the town.  The lung searing agony from that morning had taught her that her owner delighted in cruelty, how much worse would it be if she tried to escape?  The very thought sent shivers of paralytic dread coursing through her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon Georgia returned with Roxxie to the house.  Texas immediately crawled over and began raining kisses down on her toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home boss.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie laughed.  \"Holy cow she really is whipped ain't she?  Look at how fast she came scurrying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is, she's my bitch.  I completely own her and she knows better than to even think about defying me, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, I would never disobey you.  I am so thankful for being able to serve you, I am so grateful you allow me to breathe.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course was a lie, Texas hated her life and hated Georgia but fear kept her in line and fear kept her obedient.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie found this too hilarious.  She roared in laughter, rather unladylike as tears welled in her eyes from amusement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for allowing me to breathe?  What the fuck?  You are so ridiculously pathetic Texas.  How you ever managed to be a thorn in my side I'll never know.  You really are  lower than the dirt on our feet... oh and speaking of which lets see you clean that dirt off.  Its all that you are good for after all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas obeyed and soon found herself licking two pairs of feet.  They both were a bit dusty and dirty from walking in the town but not obscenely so.   As she licked the dirt and gently needed their feet with her mouth Roxxie wanted to hear about how Georgia kept such a tight leash on her slave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its really quite simple.  Just reinforce how weak she is and remind her how much power I have.  You know the line you found so funny?  That happened because I was making her suffocate with my toes this morning.  The little foot worm was so scared, she would never dare defy me again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie wanted to know more and Texas grew worried about hearing Georgia recount what happened that morning.  She was worried because Roxxie seemed far too interested in the idea of suffocating her!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh I really want to try this!  The thought of her squirming for air and being utterly helpless is making me all sorts of excited.  Come no Georgia let me borrow her tonight and let me use her that way!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm well I suppose I could but you have to be careful, I want to keep my foot slave for awhile.  You can't be offing her accidentally if you get too excited.  She's my property and I get to decide if and when I dispose her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was deeply scared about that sort of talk.  Was it just more cruel bluffing or was Georgia serious about one day \"disposing her.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know I get carried away but I'll be careful... I promise.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Georgia's answer going to be?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you want to suffocate her and put her under your feet until she's begging for air then by all means do so.  But you do it right here where I can watch and intervene if you get too gung ho.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was both relieved and scared.  Happy that at least Georgia could save her from being accidentally killed but also scared to have to deal with being suffocated by feet!   It wasn't just scary it was so humbling for a former warrior and gunslinger like her to be brought low by something as minor as someone's toes!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie clapped her hands eager to make her rival suffer.  \"This is going to be so much fun, so where's your rope, I want to see  her hog tied and helpless.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia laughed.  \"So eager!  But you know I like variety so instead of a hog tie let's try something a little different.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas did not like the sound of that!  She shook a little in fear before Georgia commanded her to go to the kitchen and come back with the plastic wrap used for the perishables.  She didn't quite understand what it would be used for but she hurried to complete the task her mistress gave her.  Dawdling would not do her any favors!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned with the wrap and Georgia took the wrap and told Texas to move closer.  \"No, don't kneel though I like that instinct in you.  You'll stand for now.\"  Texas obeyed and Georgia pulled apart the roll of plastic and attached it to her shoulder.  \"Now slowly turn so this wraps around you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Texas understood as the plastic wrapped its way around her fur.  The plastic wrapped around her shoulders and arms effectively trapping them at her sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling nice and snug?  All swaddled up like a baby?  Haha you aren't quite done yet.  Here Roxxie you do her legs, since you want to play with her you can lower yourself to get her wrapped up good and proper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie shrugged, it was a small price to pay for the entertainment that would come next!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered herself to the ground and continued to have the now dizzy Texas spin around as the plastic wrap prison fully sealed her in a helpless state.  Texas couldn't help but test the confinement by trying to push her arms out but Georgia had used too many layers, it was like trying to move concrete.  She began getting very catastrophic and fearful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a laugh Georgia and Roxxie admired their handiwork and Georgia unceremoniously gave Texas a shove.  With her knees locked in place thanks to the plastic around her legs all she could do was fall backward and land painfully on the ground.  Georgia approached and put one of her big feet on Texas's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little pathetic foot slave, my foot is on your face and you can't do anything about it.  Not that you would even if you weren't restrained but still, I bet the thought of being so utterly helpless is frustrating, isn't it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"  Texas said around her foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie laughed.  \"What a pathetic foot sniffing loser!  All right let me at her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia grinned, \"Oh but wait there's one final little piece to this package.\"  The former deputy pulled out a small sealed bag and out came a once white sock that was now utterly filthy.  It was damp with sweat but also foul beyond belief with dirt.  As soon as the bag opened Roxxie gagged a bit and moved away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh so nasty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas could also smell it and she knew exactly where it was going to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please boss, please don't, please, please I'll do whatever you want.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia stomped down hard on her plastic wrapped slave.  The plastic blunted the blow a bit but most of the force still hit and since Georgia was larger and stronger it was rather painful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stupid shit, you will do whatever I want anyway, you are my SLAVE.  And when you ask for mercy or ask to not do something I want you to do; you just make it worse for yourself.  You are an inferior worm beneath my feet, your only use is to provide me amusement.  Now I'm going to shove my rancid sock in your mouth while Roxxie plays with you.  Had you not said anything I would have taken it out of your mouth and let you sleep in peace when I sent you to bed, instead you get to keep this sock in your mouth all night long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas wanted to cry in despair but she knew speaking up more would just cause further suffering.  Instead she opened her mouth and Georgia put her nauseatingly filthy sock inside.  The taste curdled her tongue and she lout a muffled whimper of horror.  The taste... it was so foul, beyond any word she could think of it was the most disgusting thing she had ever tasted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia took a bit more of t he plastic and wrapped it around the weasel's head, careful to keep the eyes and nose free.  Now her nasty socks were trapped inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now she's ready to play with.\"  Georgia told Roxxie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie moved back into the room now that the socks were safely trapped in their victim's mouth and couldn't be smelled in the room anymore.  It took a few minutes for the lasting bit of that stench to dissipate but Roxxie didn't mind it too much because she now had a helpless little toy to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie pulled up a chair and placed both of her feet on Texas's face.  She rubbed all over, forcing Texas to get all the nasty foot stink transferred from feet to face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that former sheriff?  Remember when you were all high and mighty wearing a badge?  Now you're nothing!  Nothing but a foot sniffing slut!  Hahah, that's right inhale my cheesy feet, you don't have a choice!  You wait air its coming from in between my toes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her toes right over Texas's nose.  Every breath of air was filtered between those wiggling toes.  Texas hated being reminded that she used to be someone, something important before Georgia reduced her to nothing but a foot slave.  The air she was inhaling was awful and all of this was combined with the wretched taste of the socks in her mouth!  Her situation and the sensory overload made her weep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahah look Georgia my feet made her cry!  Awww poor little baby girl, crying over some smelly feet.  What a loser you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas certainly felt like a loser!  She couldn't do anything but lay there and sniff feet, how could she have ended up in such a lowly position.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so far above you now Texas.  I remember when you arrested me, it nearly ruined my life.  But now I could so easily just take yours with just a little bit of pressure...\"  With those words she trapped Texas's nose between her two big toes, pushing her feet together and sealing the air passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, look at you turn colors.  Feel that  pain in your chest?  Feel your lungs trying to get air?  Well I get to decide that now, so lay there and squirm in helpless agony!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogically Texas knew Roxxie couldn't kill her.  Her owner, Georgia, was right there watching.  But it was hard to think logically when all your air was gone and another woman had her feet in your face!  It was hard to be rational when you were completely bound from head to toe in plastic wrap!  It was so hard not to feel anything but pain and all consuming terror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... Roxxie lifted her feet and she could breathe again!  And then back down the feet went and her eyes bugged out, she hadn't gotten a good breath of air!  Fortunately Roxxie was amused by her little game of lifting her feet and then bringing them back down over and over again so each inhale was her foot smell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lowly little cunt.  You are so weak and pathetic, maybe I'll buy you off Georgia one day.  I promise you, I'd make your life a living hell.  That's right look at me with those fear filled eyes, hahaha, hahaha!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia was amused by the insane power trip her friend was going through.  She doubted she'd ever sell Texas but it might be amusing to threaten her slave that way.  She let Roxxie continue torturing and verbally abusing her until she saw the sun start to set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah look at the time, its bedtime for my little girl.\"  She took out a knife and cut away the plastic wrap and the release did much to relieve Texas's anxiety and fear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said Texas, you get to keep that sock in your mouth all night.  If you take it out for any reason I'll make you sleep fully wrapped in plastic and gagged!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas pressed her head to Georgia's feet and hurried off to bed, her two tormentors laughing at the fact she was going to sleep at such an early hour!  The humiliation was bad but the worst was those socks... they coated the inside of her mouth with the most vile flavor.  It was going to be a horrible hellish night!  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The release was complete catharsis after years of building up an annoyance for the sheriff under her rules. She cast a loving look down at her plump rear and couldn't help but let loose a cackle at the brown ponytail protruding out from underneath it. It was the only sign left that the squashed weasel ever even existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas gave a muffled scream of displeasure, but it barely managed to escape the thick skin of the moist rump she was squished beneath. She never would have imagined one of her own deputies would be pressing her flatter than Roxxie. The humiliation only increased with the shifting of the hefty weight above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Tex.\" Georgia gave a smug giggle as she stared back at her handiwork again. \"Wasn't this more fun than a dumb old duel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA barely audible \"MMMMMMPH\" managed to crawl out from beneath the grounded bum like a bubble of air in an ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\"</span></div></div>",

The mare swung the weakened weasel off her shoulder and in front of her face \"Alright, let's get started with the pits.\" the mare said. Texas was afraid this is where it was going to start. The warm hot water was slamming down on the two, the large mare lifted up her pit, and when Texas saw this she was horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pit was drenched with sweat, she knew it wasn't water as it hadn't reached her pits yet. Not only just sweat but also steamy, it was so rank and been unwashed for so long her arm pits started to emit steam. It wasn't long when the mare shoved Texas's face into the rank pits. Her face slid across her arm pit like someone sliding on some black ice, her face continued to glide across the pits, the massive amount of sweat made it incredibly easy. As she had finished, she pulled out Texas's face who had looked like she had gotten done running ten miles with sweat covering her entire face and hair, having it entirely drenched. \"Daw, don't you look cute? But we ain't done yet Texas\" the mare giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next area was her nether regions, were the mare pulled Texas long enough so she could be used easily to floss her under carriage. The first thing that hit her nose was her unwashed vagina, it reeked of dead fish, and rotten cabbage, and just like the mares pit, her pussy was emitting a cloud of steam. Slipping back and forth into her pussy and near her butt crack. The mare actually started to moan in pleasure as the slippery weasel, was being pushed up against her G-spot, she continued to pant and rub the weasel about, until climaxing all over Texas. She continued to pant and pulled the damp weasel up in the air \"Alright who's next!?\" the mare yelled while the line of inmates cheered \"Me! Me! Me!\" </span></div></div>",

And now, here you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Mary's grasp, and this close to her, Texas could only gag and kick weakly as the smell was overwhelming her, her face slowly turning green.

And you just need to do one thing for me.\" Mary released her grasp, and Texas fell onto the hard concrete floor with a yelp. In front of her, the pig's grin just widened as she turned around, until her gigantic ass was on full display in all it's horrific glory, and Texas could see all the sweat, dirt and large brown stains adorning her hellish butt crack. This close the smell was even worse, completely overpowering the weasel's senses with the putrid stench of pig manure and unwashed ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss my ass.\"</span></div></div>",

The difference this time was that, all around her, were walls made of filthy looking orange fabric. And they didn't just look nasty, they smelled it too. Texas wished she could cover her nose just to not have to smell the confines of her tight prison. Suddenly, one of the walls ripped a fart right into her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she's awake! Let her have it girls!\" Mary shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grim reality of her predicament dawned on Texas, she was surrounded by inmate ass on all sides. All at once, the gang of fat asses started ripping monster farts in her face. Mary ground her fat ass in Texas's face, then ripped a muggy, pants-staining fart on her. She backed off and a gator wrapped her tail around Texas to pull her in close for a bare-ass fart barrage. She was released and almost immediately a cat and rat straddled up both sides of her head and let a simultaneous stinker go. The two barely had enough time to get out of the way before a massive bear clapped Texas's head flat between her furry cheeks and ripped a rumbler that shook the entire cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, that's enough of a warm welcome,\" Mary said, presumably so they didn't knock Texas out again, \"Now let's decide who's gonna get to play with the sheriff first, huh?

Texas whimpered and scrambled back over to the cell dorr, banging on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out! LET ME OUT!!\" She screamed, but it was too late for her. From the bathroom, an absolutely colossal pig emerged, standing at least twenty feet tall, and being almost spherical with layers of fat.

Looks like you're gonna get SQUASHED, mate!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's body slammed into an exit door and her hands flung themselves onto the handle in a desperate attempt to pry it open.

April had to put all of her energy into resisting the temptation to scream in terror at the fact that the gargantuan mare was now onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that an intruder, trying to foil our plans?\" she asked, her long nose scanning the room for any sign of the invader. \"I know from the fact that I can't see you right now that you're much smaller than me... you'd better hope your hiding spot isn't goo obvious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse threw open a few cupboards and began digging through them, and April watched her do so from the holes in the laundry hamper. Georgia leaned forward as her hands swept the contents of the shelves to the side, and in doing so unintentionally showed poor April just how enormous her infamous rump was. The villain's girthy buttcheeks swayed back and forth as she cleared out more possible hiding spaces, almost taunting the fox with what she would have to deal with were she caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second...\" Georgia laughed as she stopped her search and turned around, her body now facing the hamper April was crouched within. \"I would've heard the stairs squeak if you had come down that way. You MUST have came through that blasted chute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril realized she could no longer safely hide here, and the stillness of the scene jumped into action as she tried to scamper out. Roxxie's dirty underpants scattered all over the room as April's emergence from the basket sent them flying as if a volcano were erupting. She darted right for the stairs, but she only got halfway up before she felt a hand grip around her leg and start yanking her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please, no, I'm sorry!\" April shouted as her head thudded on each stair she was dragged down. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dice, foxy!\" Georgia shouted as she pulled the tiny deputy over to her wooden chair like a ragdoll. \"You're about to get SAT ON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, PLEASE, ANYTHING BUT...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril's screams for mercy were converted to desperate \"MMMMPHS\" as the enormous mare's disgusting butt engulfed the surface of the chair, smothering her beneath a rump ten times thicker than her own body. She had thought an up-close encounter with Roxxie's dirty underwear was an unpleasant experience, but having her face packed between her gigantic foe's asscheeks as she could hear the smug victor's jeering taunts proved to be way worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excuse me, I'm so rude.\" Georgia laughed as she felt the powerless fox squish underneath her like a grape. \"I interrupted you. What was it you didn't want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox couldn't even entertain a reply; her lips were buried so deeply in the rippling fabric of Georgia's tight shorts that they weren't capable of doing anything of struggling. She was no longer able to fight back in any way; she had been turned to a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How excellent, we got both you and your dumb sheriff on the same day...\" Georgia commented to the twitching hand jutting out from underneath her plump bottom. \"I think I'm gonna go do the same thing to her right after this...\"</span></div></div>",

April heard what was said and started to panic internally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril peaked an eye out of the mountain of soiled underwear just in time to see a landslide of horse panties collapse on top of her. \"Ugh the bin is full! I'm only halfway done!\" Georgia said angrily. \"What do you think your gargantuan rump is for? Crush it down girl!\" Roxxie said. Meanwhile April was gagging in disgust as the new panties were stained with sweat and... other things. Georgia started crushing the pile with her hands first to get it lower, this act just mildly inconvenienced April as she was forced down as well. Next Georgia plopped her butt down on the stack with tremendous force. This absolutely creamed April flattening her instantly! Georgia ground her rear back and forth driving the pile down. April groaned as she was ingrained into varies fabrics of the panties belonging to the fat women. Georgia got up and examined her handy work, the underwear had been crushed into a smelly cube like what trash compactors do. Satisfied, Georgia dumped the remainder of her undies the walked out of the laundry room with Roxie leading the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril couldn't believe her luck, she was currently a flattened decoration on a BBW's panties! After the pressure left the stink set in, it was awful she thought. April tried to move any part of her battered body but nothing was responding. Another whiff was all it took then she passed out amongst the undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Wakey, wakey, little fox!\" Roxxie laughed, as she and Georgia stared down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're supposed to be here, deputy. Do you have a warrent? No? Well it doesn't matter. You're not leaving either way.\" The huge mare laughed. Instantly April tried to roll to her feet and run, but Roxxie had been expecting it, and with a powerful stomp, flattened the fox to the floor, an imprint of the roo's huge foot squashed into her body. Georgia just chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now you get to hang around with us for a little while.\" Georgia grinned. \"So, you like my underwear, hmmm? Well, you're in luck. Because I think I can make your life heaven.\" Her evil grin widening, Georgia grabbed a particular pair of underwear from the pile, looking much filthier and much more ragged than the rest, and reeking of horse ass. \"These here are my lucky panties, but sadly they're a little worse for wear because I use them so much... I think they need patching. And you're just the patch for it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril screamed in fear, but in her flattened state there was little she could do as Georgia peeled her up with one hand, placed her in the inside back of the disgusting underwear, then yanked them on. Immediately the fox's screams were silenced with a loud squish, as she was buried deep, deep within Georgia's ass crack and drenched with her foul sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... Her fur feels so nice buried in there... I think in a few days or running and riding she should be bonded to them permanently. Just as she should be...\" The mare purred. Next to her, Roxxie just laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Sounds perfect... In fact, I might do the same with Tex. Seems like a perfect place for her...\" The roo turned and stomped upstairs to get the weasel, leaving Georgia alone to enjoy her new underwear. True to her word, in a few days April became a permanent part of her underwear, just as Tex became a permanent part of Roxxie's. The two lawgirls lived out the rest of their lives dealing with the sweat, stink and constant crushing of their rival's asses, doomed to be stuck with them forever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>April had a rough night's sleep in the panty bin waking up periodically attempting escape but her form was much to flattened for it. Just then she jolted awake once more, but this time it was an actual jolt! She was moving again but she still wasn't a hundred percent. That being said she still climbed out of the underwear pile. It seems that they had washed Georgia's half while she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril was worse for wear but she was on a mission, a mission to find Tex! She noticed that it was sunny out, this surprised her considering that she showed up to this place around sundown. Currently one of April's legs was completely reformed, but the other one was about the width of a pancake. Despite this she still climbed up the stairs to the main floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she was up there she spotted Georgia at the front door talking to a short armadillo woman with an odd looking black bag. April ran to cover behind a large chair that hid her easily and listened in on their conversation. \"I can't thank you enough for what you've done for us. Tex has been a problem for too long, and because of you she won't bother us anymore! You've made us very happy, especially Roxxie.\" Georgia said with glee. \"Oh it was my pleasure, I'm always happy to help out girls like yourselves. I never much cared for Tex she seemed too intrusive, thank goodness she's done for.\" The armadillo woman said. \"Ha ha yeah. Hey can I get your phone number we're gonna face more pests like Tex's deputies and some outlaw lizard guy, your methods could really scare some people outta town lickety split.\" Georgia asked admiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril was concerned over this conversation, as her leg finally reformed to the appropriate width she began to search the house for Tex. They couldn't be telling the truth, Tex has been squashed before but they couldn't permanently keep her that way. Could they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril checked high and low concerned about her friend's wellbeing. Finally there was one last room she hadn't checked. A room with a big wooden door that said \"Roxxie's Room\" in big white letters. She creaked open the door and saw the massive Roo asleep on a massive reinforced bed. Roxxie was sleeping on her stomach so her butt was up in the air. Currently she was wearing a thong letting the stench of her rear fill the room. April checked the room but still didn't see Tex. Meaning that there was one place left to check, Roxxie's body. April looked all over her body keeping her ears open for any small groans or whimpers but came up short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to leave she noticed something out of place on Roxxie's rump. It was a small brown speck resembling the tip of a finger. April sprang to action eager to save the sheriff. She quickly picked up a rifle on the ground and began to pry Roxxie's cheeks apart. It wasn't easy but April's adrenaline was kicking in and used all her might to pull apart the giant butt before her. The smell was awful as April came face to face with the Roo's disgusting butt crack. As soon as April felt that they were apart enough she shoved the rifle between them to keep it open. Next she looked at Tex, but what she saw terrified her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril couldn't believe what had become of Tex. She had become a tattoo! Literally! The outline of her body was covered with dark blue ink. She was also looked like a cartoon in a stance that resembled Porky Pig's at the end of a Looney Tunes episode. Also her tongue was sticking out, and right above that was a speech bubble that said \"I love kangaroo booty more than anything!\". It dawned on April that the armadillo lady talking to Georgia was a tattoo artist. The only thing to indicate that there was a real living thing beneath the ink was her darting bloodshot eyes that were staring at April. The worst part however was that Tex's new body was completely ingrained into Roxxie's skin! April scratched every inch but there was nowhere to peel off Tex. This was it Tex would never reform, she'd live out the rest of her life as a tattoo on one of the grossest rears in the west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex shed one tear then darted her eyes at the door. April was confused then realized she was telling her to go. \"I can't just leave you here.\" April said concerned. Tex's eyes went back to the door, April then reluctantly grabbed the rifle and said \"Bye Tex.\" she yanked it out and the cheeks clapped together sealing her doom. April ran to the doorway and tried to formulate an escape plan, but it wasn't going very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The fox sprinted towards the door, but the roo's lasso was faster. It flew over April's head and snagged shut around her waist, stopping her dead in her tracks and causing her to fall down. The bandit quickly began to reel in her catch whilst heavy footsteps thundered closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia quickly came to see what all the commotion was about and cracked the biggest smile as she saw her partner in crime pulling April within arm's reach. Roxxie showed no mercy, grabbing the fox by the throat and wringing her little neck until she nearly fainted.

We can get you a nice matchin pair o dumbass tattoos.\" The mare suggested, but Roxxie just chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's sweet, but ah can't have all the fun.

I'll get this one all prepped and ready for her big moment\" The kangaroo bandit spoke ominously, looking April in the eye. The fox's gaze was wavering after the roo's savage treatment. Again Roxxie squeezed the deputy's throat in her strong hands before throwing the fox onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril tried to get on her feet, but she was dazed from being throttled by the roo. She struggled to find her feet and shake off the lasso that put her into this mess. She just about finished slipping the heavy rope from her waist when a heavy foot planted itself on her back. The heavy stomp immediately pushed her down onto her belly and forced the air from her lungs. When the cruel bandit stepped off her victim the fox was barely given time to prepare. Roxxie already had her pants on her ankles and a huge exposed butt looming over the helpless deputy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud thump Roxxie made the whole hideout creak and groan. Her fearsome butt had ended more fights than she could count and thanks to it's intimidating size there wasn't a trace visible of the fox being smothered beneath it. To make things worse the bandit began to grind her big rear back and forth on top of the pinned fox. Slowly April felt herself getting shoved inbetween the flabby cheeks. Where it was mainly the crushing weight she had to deal with before, the deputy found her new predicament to be even more horrifying. The dirty cheeks pressed against her from all sides, squeezing her tightly with every clench of the roo's butt. All manner of grime and filth was rubbed into her whilst the stench began to sting in her nose. The foul bandit felt her victim slowly flatten between her asscheeks and gleefully made the fox even more miserable with a loud fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deputy can scarcely believe the smelly hell she has entered at the hands of the bandit. Suddenly April feels her world shift. The evil roo had stood up, but she was stuck firmly between those massive asscheeks. With a big smile Roxxie carried her prey over to Georgia, who was waiting for her along with the tattoo artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, Rox. Look who's still here.\" The mare joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I heard you had another... job for me?\" The armadillo calmly inquired, seemingly indifferent to the roo's missing pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ah do. Already got 'er wedged back there. Should be almost flat enough for ya to work the magic.\" The kangaroo said excitedly. The tattoo artist nodded and prepared her tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie Roo grunted loudly and began to clench her buttcheeks together with unbelievable force. The fox couldn't move a muscle as she was slowly squashed flat between the two heavy walls of flesh. The pressure on her skull was enough to nearly make her faint, but it was a silent, stinky fart that pushed her over the edge. When the roo bandit felt her prey go limp she calmed herself down again and parted her smelly cheeks wide. The armadillo moved in and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the deepest depths of Roxxie's asscrack two new tattoos graced her dirty hide. Sheriff Texas and her favorite deputy, both reduced to two-dimensional images, infused into the roo's skin. Between the two of them was the roo's twitching butthole. It expelled farts on the regular, frequently nauseating the two lawbringers turned tattoos. When April finally came to she panicked, but she no longer had limbs to move or a mouth to scream with. Instead she could only concentrate of the wretched stink. How was she able to smell it without a nose? Light barely reached this deep between the roo's cheeks, but there was enough to see the weasel on the other cheek. They both looked horrified at one another. Nobody would ever look for them here. They were doomed to be stuck right next to the kangaroo's butthole forever. A fact the cruel bandit was quick to rub in with several nasty bursts of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any law enforcement Georgia quickly and heroically took it upon herself to be the town's new sheriff. Together with her partner in crime she robbed the people of Gold Springs blind. Any unfortunate saps who tried to stand up to the duo were quickly shown where the last lawmen had gone before getting shoved up Roxxie's ass or meeting a similarly gruesome fate at Georgia's hands. Their reign of terror lasted decades, just like the roo's special weasel and fox tattoos.</span></div></div>",

Before she could process all this however, the dryer she had been dumped in started to spin to life, whirring the poor fox girl around like a centrifuge, all while blasting her with hot air. April screamed with terror as she was flung around with the rest of the now-clean laundry and dried out, but with a stroke of luck, she managed to kick the door open from the inside and was flung out onto the cold stone floor, landing with a thud. Slowly, the fox pushed herself to her feet, groaning from the thoroughly unpleasant experience she had just gone through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok... Not the best start... but I'm in now! And... kinda clean. I've still got a chance of finding Tex...\" The fox shook herself off, took a deep breath, then began to sneak back up to the house, climbing the wooden stairs from the basement to an old, rickety door, which rested slightly ajar. April peered through the gap, and just barely stifled a gasp at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the door was Roxxie's living room, which was dominated by two large chairs, currently filled by Roxxie and Georgia. However, what had made her gasp was the sight of the tiny weasel hand sticking out from beneath the oversized kangaroo's ass, occasionally giving a weak twitch to show she was still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Of all the bodies in the west, Tex, yours is the most fun to crush into a pulp!\" Roxxie laughed, bouncing in her chair and clearly enjoying the loud squishing noises that came from beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when I become sheriff, she's yours permanently.\" Georgia said with a grin. \"My first act of office will be to close the case on the whereabouts of that weasel, and my second will be to appoint her deputy to my ass! No-one will ever come looking for either of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the door, April gulped fearfully. If she didn't do something, Texas could be crushed into a permanent tattoo on Roxxie's ass... but those two were some of the toughest fighters in the west.

Much to her horror, the trusty sheriff had been turned into a living seat cushion, and there was no way she could let this atrocity go on another second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril wondered how she should best enter the living room to catch both crooks off guard. They might have dwarfed her in size, but they weren\u2019t immortal; if she kept them at a distance and trained her weapon on both of them, she could force them to let her and Texas slip out the back. They certainly wouldn\u2019t be willing to take a bullet for the flattened officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl took a step into the room and held her pistol in the air. \u201cFreeze, you oversized rats!\u201d she barked with authority. \u201cYou get off the sheriff right now, kangaroo, or the only place you\u2019ll be bouncing to is the MORGUE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, crabapples!\u201d Georgia sarcastically feigned defeat at the sight of the tiny fox standing in the doorway to Roxxie\u2019s room. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019ve been caught by the law! Whatever shall we do??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d April called back with dead seriousness as she took turns training her gun on the two gigantic targets in the room. \u201cI\u2019ve got you in my sights, and if one of you takes even a single step towards me your eggs are gonna be scrambled like\u2026 AH!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril gasped with surprise and pain as a wooden stick of some sort smacked her across the back of the head, knocking her to the ground. Her body hit the living room\u2019s carpet and her new perspective showed her that there was a third target she should have been keeping track of: Smiling Jacks. The small rabbit was standing over her with a sheepish grin, a herding rod held in her hand like a baseball bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Jacks! I don\u2019t think she expected to see all of us here in one place.\u201d Georgia called out as she placed her oversized boot on April\u2019s gun and slid it away from the hands of the downed deputy. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t coordinate sooner. Now what should we do with this little nuisance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi, I\u2019ve got an idea!\u201d Roxxiee called from the couch as she shifted her weight onto her right side, exposing the sweat-drenched furniture beneath her and the squelched sheriff plastered across the seat. \u201cHow about you slide \u2018er down under so she\u2019s niiice and comfy with her best friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHHHHH!\u201d The space between sticky underside of the kangaroo\u2019s rump and her filthy chair looked like the worst crevice in the world, and there was nothing the deputy would like less.

She looked over and made eye contact with the Sheriff, whose body was a completely pancaked mess, her skin slicked with Roxxie\u2019s sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApril, no\u2026\u201d Texas\u2019s windpipes managed to wheeze out as she realized her friend was caught. \u201cNot you too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you look so cute together!\u201d Roxxie laughed as she wriggled her bottom tauntingly above the heads of the two helpless foxes. \"I\u2019ve gotta say goodbye for now, but you\u2019ll have plenty of time to catch up in the next few hour!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas and April both burst into cries for mercy as the gigantic lass\u2019s disgusting bum started moving back into place, its rancid smell registering more and more in their nostrils as it approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bodies were slowly pressed into pancakes as Roxxiee took her time letting her ass sink into her favorite chair. Now, much to her delight, she felt the desperate squirms of two squished goody-two-shoes beneath her instead of just one. The tickly feeling of their bodies getting smushed to putty beneath her made her laugh out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get a turn next, right Rox?\u201d Georgia said with a snicker as she watched her enemies vanish completely underneath the jiggling cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha.\u201d the kangaroo was now sitting still, and the feeling of her sweat pooling onto the squelched bodies beneath her filled her with contentment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Sheriff Georgia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She heaved with all her might for a while. Midway through taking a break, April noticed a crowbar propped up against the wall. She shoved the bar beneath Tex and tried as hard as she good. Eventually her body flew off the chair and into the kitchen. This created a loud banging noises as Tex ricocheted wildly. Finally it stopped and April rushed in.

Having lost her gun, this was the closest thing to a weapon she had, things had changed, it was time for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching almost all of the cabinets Roxxie crumpled up the flattened Tex into a ball in anger. She arrived at the last cabinet she hadn't checked. She slowly creaked it open hoping to terrify the small fox, but something was wrong. She didn't hear any yapping or pleas of mercy. Roxxie's flung open the door to see what was wrong only to be met with a metallic force that smashed her face into a disk. Roxxie was her unaccustomed to any part of her being flattened and showed this as she dropped Tex and fell to the floor in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith lightening speed April scooped up Tex and tucked her under her arm like a football player. She sprinted to the door only to see that it was bolted up tight. Her hopes were dashed but then she saw a back screen door. April kicked it into high gear running to their last shred of hope. \"Don't worry Tex we're almost to safety.\" She said to the squashed ball that was her friend. However as soon as they reached the door she accidentally rammed into a khaki clad butt that blocked the doorway. The smell stained her nostrils and she was pushed back by a massive fart that came from the rump. April writhed on the ground for a moment then looked up to see a smirking Georgia squeezing her hips past the tiny doorway. April desperately needed a new escape route, but it's not going to be in front of her, April looks back and sees...</span></div></div>",

April began to lose her shape, right as Georgia came in. \"What's going on here,\" she moaned. \"We got us a stowaway,\" Roxie sneered. \"I think it's only fair I let you handle her,\" she said tossing the flattened deputy to Georgia. \"Good.

The fox took a deep breath, checking that she still had her water bottle on her belt, then set off through the back door of Roxxie's house and started walking, first over the hills it was nestled in, then through the flatter scrub-land, then finally, the dry, endless desert, sun shimmering off the golden sand. This wasn't going to be pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost an hour later, April stumbled out of the desert back onto the dusty trail near the gold mines. The fox was an absolute mess. Five minutes in a snake had stolen her water bottle, ten minutes after that she had lost a shoe, and 15 minutes after that she had been trampled by a herd of stampeding bison, leaving her dishevelled, her clothing torn, her fur covered in hoofprints, and to top it all off she was absolutely drenched in sweat, looking like she had just emerged form a swimming pool. As she staggered along, her vision blurry and her head cloudy, she nearly walked straight into Roxxie and Georgia, emerging from one of the many now-empty goldmines that littered the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop right there, evildoers!\" Deputy Briggs stammered, drawing her gun, but it felt like it was made of lead. She could barely raise it, let alone aim, and her arm shook like mad. She wouldn't be able to hit the broad side of a barn. The two 'evildoers' looked up, then smirked and cracked their knuckles, advancing on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I said stop! I-I'm warning you! I really am! I-\" *click* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox pulled the trigger on the gun, and was rewarded only with a click. Apparently the snake had stolen her bullets too. April gulped and looked up, just in time to be pulled into a smothering bearhug, her face and most of her upper body being lost in Georgia's cleavage, completely smothering her. With no air, and the energy already drained from her body, it was all she could do to give a few weak kicks before passing out, completely at the villains' mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen April slowly awoke, she was in a cool, dark place, and tied up tight. She groaned and opened her eyes, finding herself looking at the inside of a rocky cave, with the two villains busying themselves around the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April... that you? Are ya'll awake?\" A familiar voice whispered behind her. The fox turned her head, and realised that she had finally found the sheriff, and was tied back-to-back with her, bound tightly to one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex... I'm sorry, I screwed everything up... What are they gonna do to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya'll didn't screw anythin' up that wasn't already screwed, Deputy.\" Texas said soothingly. \"As to what those varmints are up to... I ain't sure. But I guess I know one way to find out... Ah don't know what you're plannin, ya scum, but ya'll won't get away with it!

In order to do this, she rolled a dusty old chalkboard from her workstation and began to scribble out a diagram of what looked like some strange double-sided plank the two foxes would be strapped onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kangaroo was running through the rigamaroo of her planned squelching and Georgia was absent-mindedly waiting for her partner to finish so she could begin crushing, Texas decided to make a move. Her hands wove into her toolbelt and managed to grab her trusty hunting knife, something her captors had foolishly failed to deprived her of. All it took was five seconds of wittling and she had snapped the binds of both her and her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, RUN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two foxes sprinted away from the scene, their tiny legs carrying them as swiftly as they possibly could. Behind them they heard the thundering footsteps of the two gigantic villains, and they knew that if they were caught they'd be squished flatter than imaginable. Their opponents had the height advantage, and the longer strides of their longer legs had them gaining on the fleeing canines at a startling rate. The sheriff and her deputy needed a steed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group rounded the corner of a cave and found not a steed, but the next best thing; a mine cart. The rolling box-on-wheels was standing at the front of the chamber with a long stretch of track before it on a downhill slope. The two foxes hopped in and shoved off, leaving their gigantic pursuers in the dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them, there were 2 other minecart tracks to the right and left of the one they had entered. Georgia and Roxxie were each big enough to fill up an entire minecart on their own and still have their over-inflated butts jutting out over the edges, so they each had to take their own ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the hostage situation had turned into a high speed chase. Texas and April were rocketing down the track, the two cart-riding villainesses just barely behind them to the right and left. If the terrifying horse and her gigantic kangaroo friend managed to get their carts paralell to Texas and April's, they could easily leap the gap between them and royally ruin the weeks of the poor officers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pray this cart goes faster, April...\" Texas whispered as the track they had selected continued rocketing on its downhill descent. \"If they catch up to us, we're mincemeat!\"</span></div></div>",

Their hefty bodies gave them the weight to rocket the metal vessels downhill, but Tex and April's head start was keeping them a fair distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're really gonna make it, Tex!\" April said with relief. \"There's no way those two are gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the deputy uttered the last word of her sentence, the track turned around a sharp corner and revealed a steep uphill climb. The creaky old wheels of the cart began to heave as it struggled to make the ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cackling laughter of the two criminals coming from behind grew louder and louder as Roxxie and Georgia closed the distance. The sheer momentum of their weight made the upward climb easy for their carts, and the two lawgirls could only watch in horror as the distance between them shrunk with each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, looks like you two got the short end of the stick!\" Roxxie shouted between giggles. \"I'm gonna make some PANCAKES out of you goody two-shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villain leaped from her cart with a kangaroo-sized hop that sent her soaring through the air.

The evildoer's cheeks jiggled from the impact as they completely filled up the little metal vehicle, reducing its contents to a flattened paste buried somewhere deep beneath them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the carts finally came to a stop at the top of the hill, there was much rejoicing to be done between the two sheriff-slayers. Georgia couldn't contain her joy at the sight of her partner-in-crime sitting where Texas and April had been only a moment ago. They had been completely trapped beneath the weight of Roxxie's rump, which was practically overflowing the tiny cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a sight!\" Georgia said between snorts. \"You absolutely SQUASHED them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did, mate!\" Roxxie replied as she wriggled her sweat-drenched butt back and forth on top of her defeated enemies, squelching them even flatter. \"Trapped 'em down under... oi... their struggling is even tickling me a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive criminal attempted to stand up off the pulverized sheriff and her poor deputy, but her cheeks failed to move an inch. Her ass was simply too big for the cart she had hopped into; it was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, blast it!\" The roo complained as she jiggled her buttcheeks even more atop the obliterated pair in an attempt to stand up. \"I'm gonna need you to pull this thing off of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia grabbed hold of the scrawny metal square attached to Roxxie's enormous hips and pulled with all her equestrian strength, but it didn't budge an inch. The darn thing was stuck to her rump like superglue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use...\" Georgia fell over backwards from the sheer force of her pulling. \"We're gonna have to walk back to town and use some kinda jelly or something....that thing is jammed on you good and tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie's ass cheeks were crammed into the cart so intensely that they had practically formed a sound-proof seal, but some sound managed to escape the thing. It was the tiniest hint of an \"MMMMMPH\", a sort of moan of dissaproval that sounded like it was coming from two different sets of windpipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, quit your complaining!\" Roxxie said to the lawgirls smeared beneath her rump. \"This isn't fun for me, either! I'm gonna be sweating like a hog in there. I'm gonna be one sticky 'roo by the end of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Roxxie took April's plank and did the same, standing it back-to-back with the piece of wood Texas was tied to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" the kangaroo laughed devilishly as she took her blowtorch and ran it along the center of the planks, fusing them together into one piece of wood with the squirming sheriff on one side and her stone-faced deputy on the other. It almost looked like some kind of totem pole dedicated to the world's unluckiest two law enforcement officials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrified girls had no idea what they were in for, but knew something awful was about to happen when Georgia began to lay down on her stomach, her enormous butt hanging up in the air behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Rox!\" the future sheriff called out. \"It's SQUELCHING TIME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOO!\" came the unified scream of dissaproval from the trapped canines as Roxxie shoved poor Texas's end of the pole right into Georgia's asscrack, the poor fox squishing into a flat paste as her body was crammed into the desert-sweat-drenched crevice that was her former deupty's rump. Her squealing voice couldn't be heard outside the squooshy confines of the jiggling cheeks, but everyone in the room knew the unfortunate sheriff was enduring the most disgusting thrashing she had ever received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Texas buried in Georgia's overbearing butt, April was left lying face-up on the plank, her eyesight aimed at the rocky ceiling of the gold mine's interior. It was clear to her now that she had been lured into a trap, and due to her own incompetence the villains had practically just turned her beloved boss into a sentient piece of toilet paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of guilt was replaced by the overwhelming feeling of fear as Roxxie Roo glared down at the pathetic deputy, her arms still pathetically trying to wriggle out of their perdicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's my turn now...\" the kangaroo said with a sensous tone as she slowly swung her hits around, her gigantic bum inching in on April's vision a s a reminder of just how massive she was. \"We're gonna make a goodie-two-shoes sandwich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do this!\" April cried out as Roxxie's rump came closer and closer to burying her alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I don't!\" Roxxie tickled the deputy's nose with her tail in a taunting display of dominance. \"I WANT to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the kangaroo completely her descent, the fox's screams for help being slowly converted to muffled mumbles for mercy as the marsupial's heaving buttcheeks slowly sank down into their new seat. April's body was compressed like a pea being rolled over by a truck tire, her figure becoming a completely smushed mess beneath the kangaroo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, there was peace. The incredibly cruel and sadistic villainesses held their positions, a newfound quiet taking over the cold insides of the gold mine. There was a serene warmth in knowing that, beneath the silence, the pain-in-the-ass police officers were completely trapped, their faces crammed so tightly into the sweaty crevices of their enemies' nether regions that they were almost inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that takes care of that...\" Georgia said with a laugh as she let a little fart erupt onto the sheriff's poor little face. \"You wanna go get some gold?</span></div></div>",

There was a nearby farm that could lend her a horse, but before she left the building she spotted something unusual in the living room. Laid out on a table was a tattered map of the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world...\" She hummed to herself. It wasn't like Roxxie to keep a map. Maybe someone else is involved in this. The thought sent a shiver of fear down her spine. That vile kangaroo on her own was already a nightmare to deal with. If she had help the odds would not be in April's favor. The deputy studied the map closely, talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's where you're taking her... or is it?\" The longer she stared at the aged paper the more worried she got. In the hills one of the old gold mines was marked. If Roxxie had taken Texas into the hills, that's where the roo bandit would be. But a similar circle was drawn around Ghost Town. There was nothing there but misery. Everyone had long abandoned it except for Molly, one of the weasel's fiercest rivals. A corpulent rat unlike any other with a cruel streak a mile long and a burning hatred for the weasel. Her disdain stretched out to anyone who dared set foot in Ghost Town, disturbing the vast network of rat warrens beneath. Even the bandits in the region knew better than to go there. What could Roxxie possibly have planned for the sheriff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril snatched the map off the table and took off, racing for the nearby farm. After a short round of negotiations she had gotten herself a horse and she was ready to save Texas. But a new dilemma presented itself. Where had Roxxie taken the sheriff? The helmet suggested the gold mine, but the map added Ghost Town as a second option. April's gut told her the mine was the right answer, but she was doubting her judgment. The odds were good she would run into Molly if she went to the abandoned town. The deputy shivered at the thought. But she couldn't let her fears stand in her way. If Texas was in Molly's hands, she had to intervene fast. The monstrously fat rat proudly kept a tally tattooed on her butt of all the sheriffs and deputies that met their demise at her hands. The young fox woman would not let Texas become another notch in that grim score.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With no further evidence to hand April followed her gut feeling. And unfortunately it told her that she would find Texas in the abandoned ghost town. She gulped, shaking off the pangs of fear that place gave her. Maybe if she was fast she could stop the sheriff from ending up in Molly's ratty paws. Soon the familiar boggy smell of swampland filled her nose. This place used to be a bustling little town called Silver Lakes. But one day a nearby river flooded the whole town, turning the surrounding lands into a soggy mire. For reasons unknown however, the waters never really receded and the town was abandoned shortly after. Most of the buildings in Silver Lake have now sunken into the ground, some nearly vanishing completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swamp surrounding Silver Lakes had begun to grow it's own ecosystem, plantlife teeming wildly in the muddy ground. It was a strangely green patch in the middle of the unforgiving desert. Mosquitos started to plague April as she ventured closer to the town itself. Not a hint of activity could be seen amidst the sunken buildings, but the deputy knew this place was not abandoned. She felt like something had been watching her ever since she entered the narrow road through the swamp. Suddenly her eyes widened as she spotted a familiar figure just outside of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... Roxxie?\" The deputy said, squinting her eyes. The roo bandit was laid out against a small tree, covered in cuts and bruises, her right eye swollen and blackened. April didn't need to guess to understand what had happened here. Molly had betrayed her partner in crime and taken Texas. But once she got close the roo gasped and shook awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, you loon. You wanna end up like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox had no time for the bandit's antics and got off her horse, grabbing a length of rope from the saddle. As she got closer to Roxxie the bandit's one functioning eye widened with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" She stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makin' sure you don't go anywhere. Roxxie Roo, you're under arrest.\" She said with no small amount of satisfaction in her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, beats dying out here.\" The roo replied, surprising the deputy. April had expected more swearing, shouting and fighting. But the bandit was in a pretty dire state. Whilst she got to work tying the bruised villain up Roxxie continued muttering to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it. We had a deal. I'd bring that damn weasel over here and that fucking voodoo rat would make sure she never leaves. But then I show up as promised and she has her minions beat me up and steal Texas from me. Ow!\" She yelps as April pulls her bindings tight. Molly might have a burning hatred for the weasel, but she was too scatterbrained to stick with any of her fiendish plans for more than a day. The deputy finishes her handiwork, leaving the roo tied to the tree and walking off into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" Roxxie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gettin' Texas back.\" April replied without looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't tie me to a tree and then commit suicide you maniac! You wanna take on Molly on her home turf? Did you breathe too much swamp gas or are you deputies just naturally insane?! She's got more henchmen than you have bullets!\" April gulped. She knew Roxxie was exaggerating, but there was some truth to her words. She was about to take on a whole bandit lair full of enemies by herself. But Texas would do the same for her. No time for cold feet now. She ignored the kangaroo's ravings and walked into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main road was the only thing still intact in Silver Lakes. Most of the houses and shops had sunken into the soggy ground, only the rooftops still visible. The small church tower still poked defiantly from the earth. With every step April took into this spooky village the hairs on her neck rose up further. She was certain Molly or one of her goons was looking at her, but there wasn't a hint of light anywhere. She knew that the fat rat bandit lived in a network of tunnels and warrens beneath Silver Lakes from having interrogated one of her minions. All she had to do was find an entrance. The little church tower almost seemed like a clich\u00e9, April smirked bitterly as she got closer. With her revolver in hand she got more and more jumpy, every noise from the bog adding another bead of sweat to the nervous fox' forehead.</span></div></div>",

A feeling in the pit of her stomach began to creep up as she saw the gigantic horse sleeping in the center of the room, its body easily dwarfing her 5 to 1. She had to hope that a horse whose job was carrying around a thousand-pound kangaroo could stomach a new passenger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the things I have to do for you, April...\" she said to herself as she prepared to leap onto the sleeping beast's saddle and wrangle it into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HYAH!\" the slim fox leapt onto Butterscotch's saddle and tugged on her reigns, trying to wrestle her into obedience. \"Up, girl, up! I'm gonna take you for a ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch was NOT going to let that happen without a fight. As the haze of sleep faded into consciousness, she realized she was being boarded by someone who was not her master, and she began bucking back and forth like a malfunctioning mechanical bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah girl, woah girl!\" April shouted as she struggled to stay on top of the jerking mount. \"Calm down! Calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox gulped as she felt her hands lose their grip on the rope, and without her hold she had no way to remain on the blasted horse. Butterscotch bucked her backside in the air, sending April flying up towards the ceiling of the stable. Her head hit the woody surface above with a \"thud\", and before she knew it she had fallen back to the earth and smacked into the muck-covered floor with a wet \"splat\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril was collecting herself and beginning to pry herself out of the mud when she realized that she was now lying in a large shadow. Her eyes slowly scanned upwards and her pupils grew into huge saucers as she saw Butterscotch's gigantic butt looming over her like a guillotine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gulp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch bucked her legs up in the air and threw them out to the side, sending her massive rump falling down towards the poor fox at mach speed. April tried to leap out of the way, but her shoes had sunk a little too far into the muddy floor to escape in time. For a split second, she realized just how helpless she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch slammed her rear onto the ground, crushing poor April like a bug. Much to the fox's displeasure, the animal let out an absent-minded fart only seconds after buying the pathetic creature. The loud commotion of the fight for control had subsided, and now there was just the silence of the horse sitting contentedly in its own stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie and the other crooks had no idea it was happening, but they were the luckiest villains in the world: They had taken Texas out of the game for good, and her dumb deputy had accidentally got herself squashed by a stupid horse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hands trembled as his eyes locked with hers. \"Y-You're...\" Tex stuttered out as her gun readied hand now went dead in it's grip, dropping her revolver to the dusty ground below her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My oh my, does my reputation go this far as well? Well IF that is the case, then I suppose I don't need to say anything about myself, Mrs. Sheriff~\" The lone wolf slyly said as he walked passed the once strong heart ranger, his tail gently wrapping around her as he now stood right beside Texas, sending a hellish shiver down her spine. \"Now about you though Mrs.Sheriff~ I hear you're one of the sharpest shooters out here in this grubbish town, but also... you have a... how did they put it...

Taking a fighting stance, Texas was ready for anything he had. \"That's a total pile of bull manure! Do you take me for some sort of idiot!\" She roared at the gunsman in front of her, not taking so much as a glance away from him.\"Whatever you want to believe Mrs.... I don't believe I've actually gotten a name yet from you actually.

I must tell you, my rump and feet feelin awful sore from sitting and standing all over the place... So a nice cushion of some sort would be nice to have when we get there. Hope you have one, cause if you don't... I'll just have to... improvise then~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Texas couldn't say anything snappy back at Baxter.

The best part's about to start now~ get ready to take a big'o whiff of your boss's big ass now~\" With one deep breath in, it soon came flying out from his back side.

And what she got was horrid. from rancid meat, to a sour milk scent, to what even smelt like rotten vegetables, Tex's eyes were like waterfalls as she gagged and wheezed at her master's rancid fart. \"Mmmm, there we go~ I know you liked that Tex~ I know you love the smell of a rancid ass like mine~\" Teasing the defeated Texas, she didn't respond back with any words... All she did was press her nose against his rear, and sniff.

The second her hood came down and her face was revealed, Tex couldn't put her as the criminal type. So calming down now, Tex released her grip on her gun and walked over to this mysterious rabbit. \"And just how do you intend on doin that Mrs?\" Tex asked honestly as her curiosity grew slightly by the woman's words. \"Why, by the power... of the hypnosis of course.\" Well Texas lost a lot of interest in her now. The sheriff wasn't into much of that sorta hoo-haw growing up, magic and such just not being something she liked as a child (she always loved playing cops and robbers as a kid).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeh, I'm not much into that sorta stuff Mrs... Sorry, but i better get back to m'ah work now. Have a good day now.\" Tex said as she turned away from the rabbit now, only to have her hand grabbed in a blink of an eye. \"Oh please Mrs.Sheriff, I promise That this will only take a moment of your time!\" The rabbit woman pleaded for Tex's agreement, almost sounding desperate for her as she jumped towards her hand. Sighing in annoyance with this rabbit, Texas decided that it'd be faster to just let this woman have her make believe fun. \"Alright, alright, fine. But you got 3 minutes before I walk off again, no if's, and's, or but's. got it?\" The Rabbit was giggling in delight as Tex agreed to the Rabbit's request. \"Of course! I completely understand~ And I'll only need 1 minute of your time Mrs.Sheriff! (Although, I wouldn't say \"no butts though~)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving Tex sit down at a nearby bench, Penelope was now scrounging in her bag for her tools. \"Just a moment, I just need... to ffffiiiiiiii-got it!\" Popping out from inside her bag, the small rabbit woman came up to Tex with a pendulum. \"Now just sit back, relax, empty that tired head of yours,  and follow this with your eyes~\" Dangling it in front of Texas now, the sheriff did as instructed, following the swinging, hypnotic pendulum slowly... \"Wow.... I haven't felt this.... calm headed.... before... in m'ah entire....l-l-li...mmmm....\" Texas had completely shut down now. Her mind was gone, but willing to take in a new information, and follow them to the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodie! Another happy customer~ And now, Let's make your life a little better.

Truly, Billy was most likely the best choice out of anyone in town if they were looking for someone sweet to be with, and fortunately for Tex, Penelope was their to kick things off with him for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, when i snap my fingers, I want you to go in there, and pour your heart out to him, okay Tex!\" Penelope said as she readied to snap her fingers again. \"Ready.... and.... go!\" With the snap of her fingers, Tex soon came back to her senses, but yet... suddenly, her heart pounded a an incredible pace. She had quickly saw Billy at his workplace, sitting firmly, wiggling his derriere in his seat. He was so cute and handsome in her eyes now, she was practically already out of breath just at the sight of him! and yet, she found herself slowly making her way to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way through his doors, Texas was quickly greeted by Billy himself. \"Morn'in sheriff, What can i do for you today? got one of those big paychecks you always have when you come to see me?\" He chuckled in his seat as he got up and approached Texas now, her face going bright red as she almost shook where she stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh.... Actually, Billy.... I was hope'in to find out.... I-if you were-uh,,,, fancy'in...getting together with me, and uh....\" She was so flustered now, stopping at each word she said, looking away from Billy as she got closer to her point.

B-B-But what brought this on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex quickly dropped to her knees now, bringing Billy into her grip, and pressing her lips onto his. \"Oh Billy boy, I just don't know myself, but I love ya! I love everythin about ya! ah... one thing most in particular though...\" Tex trailed off again now, Billy in a daze from the kiss quickly snaps back, his curiosity going through the roof  as Tex had just dropped so much on him. \"W-What pray tell would that be! Please Tex, tell me, I promise ya, Whatever it is, I'll do it all the time for'ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex's face couldn't get any brighter now. gone completely red from this all, Tex slowly leaned towards Billy's ear, whispering away what Penelope had told her. \"Oh my... I-I-I never knew... ah... O-O-Of course. From here on out, my rump won't be too far from you, Darlin!\" Billy smiled and giggled as he hugged Texas tightly. Everything had gone perfectly, just what Penelope was hoping for. Texas and Billy had quickly formed an odd relationship now, living and working together at the bank, as Texas as now served as his chair, his wiggling rump now pressed against Texas's willing face. The two, strangely enough, couldn't be happier now. The next day at Billy's job, Billy was once more sitting on his new girlfriend's face, ready to start his workday with a smile across his face, and gas pouring down Tex's giggling face.</span></div></div>",

She was a painted lady of the most extravagant kind, and had quite the reputation about her in the little town. Her name was Paris, but most people knew her as The Madame. She was famous for three things: Her gorgeous looks, her brothel, and her unbearable cheesy odor. Madame would probably be the hottest ticket in the entire town, given that she's got both money and looks, but nobody can stand to be around her for more than a few minutes due to the intense stench she gives off. Her all cheese diet has her practically sweating raw curds out of her pores, and it comes with intense breath and gas issues that made talking to her nearly impossible. All that made for the perfect target for Penelope's hypnotism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get 'er,\" The rabbit chuckled, and Texas stumbled off towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame was outside of her brothel at the moment, enjoying a quiet cigarette to herself, when Texas slammed into her ass from behind,almost tackling her. The shock made her let out a thick, cheesy fart that was palpable even through the folds of her extravagant dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who in the world,\" she turned to see Texas, clinging to her ass and nuzzling into it despite the stench, \"Well hello there sheriff! Always a pleasure to see you. Especially so enthusiastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no secret that Madame had a passing interest in Texas, but the two kept it purely business given that Madame was running a bit of an unsavory business (And that Texas had absolutely no interest in her whatsoever, until hypnosis was involved).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you think you're doing?\" Madame asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas replied in a mentally distant drone, \"Anything... I love you, I'll do anything for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame whipped her fan out and fluttered it in front of her face. She was starting to get a bit of the vapors, vapors that she was about to share with Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?

Madame giggled and took her by the collar, leading her to the stuffy carriage that would be taking the two across the hot, hot desert. Texas laid her head down first, nestling it into the seat with her face pointing straight up. Madame followed, flipping her frilly skirt up so that she could rest her bare, bloomer-clad butt right on Texas's face. She wiggled back and forth a bit, getting comfortable, and let out a hissing fart that reeked of bad cheese. Texas sniffed it down, totally braindead at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage took off, and as the time rolled on the heat of the ride truly started to show itself. Sweat was pouring down Madame's cheeks and every one of her farts only made it muggier beneath her dress. Texas would be in utter hell, if she wasn't totally brainwashed. In fact, she was loving this treatment so much that she couldn't stop herself from burying her nose against Madame's behind and giving it a quick kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, she heard Madame gasp.

Seeing as Texas was lost in her cheesy derriere, Madame decided to cross her left leg over her right and give Texas's face a true ride now, pressing down on the young sheriff's face gently, and yet with enough force to sink Texas's head into the seat, forcing her nose to be pressed right against Madame's rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her love giving her just what she wanted, Texas pressed her legs together and moaned out into Madame's rear once more, hiding the damp spot in her pants as she kept huffing in her release's. \"mmm...Perfect...smelly...Madame's rear....\" Texas moaned out in between her kisses on Madame's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a half hour gone by of their two hour long trip, the carriage itself now had been completely turned into a rancid hotbox, trapping Madame and her completely bewitched masseur, Madame began to hum out a song to pass the time, passing more and more quiet winds along Texas's face, her hands now pulling up her dress and releasing a trapped fog of gas that had built up from her excessive farting, they traveled along her body and towards her now damp vagina. Rubbing herself as she hummed, Both Madame and Texas began pleasuring themselves to the smelly scenario the two were in. Texas still proceeding to rub Madame's large rear with her face, mouth, and her left hand, she let her right hand travel down her waist and through her pants, slowly rubbing her own vagina in the process of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh my, Sheriff...I may be the proud owner of the brothel back in town, but i ain't neveh had such a wild experience like this before...I think I'm beginning to like this new you a lot more than I first expected! And it seems you're just cozy with the new you as well~\" Giving Texas one more wiggle across her face before sitting up, Madame puffed up her breasts and rests her arms underneath them. Texas still in a huge daze after laying still for the last half hour, breathing in nothing but Madame's farts, the sheriff slowly turned her head towards her love, right hand still rubbing her crotch in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aaah...A-ah'm sorry if I upset ya...I promise, ah'll do betteh for you, Madame...\" Texas said as she felt ashamed now, seeing such a serious tone on Madame's face. However, Madame was far from upset with Texas now. Much rather, she wanted to enjoy this carriage ride MUCH more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheriff. If were gonna get serious about all this fun, then ah'm gonna need a real answer from you right now. Now, sheriff Texas, do you want a piece of this rat? Do you want to just ravish me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas couldn't stop herself at the thought. the more and more Madame spoke in such a tone to her, the more she wanted to just shove herself against her soft fur and smelly body. With a deep breath in, Texas managed now t moan out \"Yes! Gawd yes Mrs.Madame, Ah just want to be with you completely!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame now received her answer from masseur. One she was more than hoping for. \"...Take off those cloths of yours then, cause the rest of trip...is gonna get real steamy~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting their cloths and dress off of their persons, Texas and Madame now laid on the carriage seats completely naked, lips locked together as Madame let loose yet another airy fart out from her rear, flowing out from between her cheeks like that of a whistle, as the rotten smell of it merged with the rest of the gas that lingered in the carriage with both girls. With the heat rising and fumes growing, both girls had one another in their grasps. But, could this trip go so perfectly for them both? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She let out a smoking hot fart that stunk of sour fondue and garlic. Texas got a deep whiff of that pungent, sour cheese gas and she couldn't control herself. She dove in, slurping and sniffing in turn. She licked from clit to asshole, gliding her tongue over that sweaty taint and drawing circles around Madame's tight mousehole until she blasted her in the face with another deadly whiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You incorrigible beast!\" Madame moaned, \"You fart-eating animal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dove back into Texas's muff, eating it with the precision and vigor you'd expect from a lady of the night. Madame's callgirls were some of the best oral specialists in the wild west, and it was no mystery where they learned that skill. Especially not for Texas, who had fireworks going off in her brain from the sensations Madame's masterful mouth work was sending through her labia. Were she not so totally devoted to eating out Madame's stinking, gas-spewing ass, she wouldn't be able to focus on anything other than that incredible oral stimulation. It was a good thing she was so dedicated and didn't let up on that mousey ass for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas felt an orgasm rock through her body as Madame diddled her throbbing clit, and she splattered juices across the seats of the carriage as she screamed into the folds of Madame's sex. Feeling overwhelmed herself, Madame leaned back into Texas and grabbed the weasel's head with one hand while she fondled her own breast with the other. She forced Texas deep into her ass crack so that the weasel could do nothing but slurp and suck on that puckering asshole. The only air she got came from Madame's frequent, stinking gas outbursts. Electricity crackled between the two of them and Madame entire body rolled. She hit her wall, shouting loud enough for the entire desert to hear. Her cunt cream splashed across Texas's tits all the way down to her own sex, and her ass blew out a bombastic fart that heralded her sexual peak. The gas was too great for even hypnotized Texas, who was knocked out at the first whiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a voice, distant in her sex and hypnosis rattled head,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas dear?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and Madame was next to her, dressed in just her underwear. Madame's dress was draped over her to cover her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetness,\" Madame said, \"I just wanted to let you know we're almost there, so you can get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a painful silence, before Madame spoke up again,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But uh, ah.\" She bit her lip, \"Before we go I was wondering: Do you think the two of us could be... exclusive? Committed? I think we've got something incredible going on here. Just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas looked into Madame's pleading eyes. There was a fire in those eyes.

Texas remembered everything they did together in this carriage, she could still smell it, even taste it all still. And yet...despite coming back to her old senses, at least what she thought were her old senses now, she still had a desire for the Madame, and still had a burning lust for the one thing she found disgusting the most, flatulence. Texas couldn't put the pieces of this puzzle together, all she knew now though, was that she was tied between two things now: Going back home and continuing her work as a sheriff, or staying here with the Madame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I-ah...\" Texas couldn't come to a decision. clenching the dress that was laid atop of her as tightly as possible, Texas stood up and looked the Madame.

Just thinking of being with her, and being apart of a brothel made her feel so dirty, and she loved the feeling of it. closing her legs again with her left hand traveling back between her legs, Texas tried to hold back a the lustful moan she knew would blow out from her mouth, only for The Madame to pull her in towards her face and giving her a deep,wet,passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Texas...Stay with me. Ah've been so lonely all ma life...I just want someone, someone who can love me...Like you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was at the crossroad now, deciding her fate of her future. Would she stay with the pleasant white rat with beauty and gas that couldn't be topped by anyone back at golden springs, or would she return home and return to her normal life as the sheriff. Closing her eyes, Texas got in close to The Madame, whispering into her ear...</span></div></div>",

She took a hand to Madame's cheek and lifted her head to look her in the eyes. Madame could see that Texas was just as broken up as her, but still resolute in her decision. She took a long, hard moment to compose herself before she told Madame exactly what she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer incredible. You really are. Yer the most beautiful, wonderful woman ah've ever met. But ah need to do my job, ah need to keep Gold Springs safe. And ah feel like, if people knew about us, they might go after ya. Ah couldn't let that happen.

We both need to tend to our lives. Just like how I need to think about my business and scoping out this new town for my new establishment. Can I ask you to accompany me along the way?

It looked to be expanding, as if it would soon be the largest city in the south. But for now, it was the potential spot for Madame's new and improved brothel and show house. Deciding to check out the land the next day, Texas and Madame quietly checked into the Inn and went to bed early.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>H-how could this of all happened without her waking up to it all,Texas thought to herself as she rubbed the back of her head as it pounded terribly for some reason. It was still the middle of the night, the stars blanketing the night sky completely as the cool breeze of the desert blew through the area. After adjusting herself and sitting up in her cage, Texas soon realized that she was in some form of cart, Just who could have done this to Texas, here of all places, a town she had never been to before! Someone must've followed her back from Golden Springs, that must be it. But who would go out of their way just to follow her here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these things rushed through Texas's mind as she struggled to break free of her ropes, growling and gnawing down on the cloth that covered her mouth. Soon enough though, after all her moving and thrashing, the cart came to a stop. Whoever was driving this cart now pulled over and hopped off the front and coming back to Texas. Feeling worried of the unknown captor, Texas once again began to yell and cry out as best she could, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her captor now standing above Texas as she clenched her eyes shut, suddenly, a familiar bright voice hit her ears. \"Now you weren't supposed snap out of the hypnosis, Sheriff!\" It was Penelope Rabbit, the hypnotist! eyes going wide as she saw the tiny rabbit stand in front of her, Texas was almost completely confused by all of this...Until she realized just what Penelope just said. \"mmrrrph mrrph mmmmrrrrrrph!!!!\" Texas cried out to Penelope as she plopped right beside Texas, opening her bag in front of her as she bent over into it, wagging her tiny rump at the sheriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Sheriff, I know you must be heartbroken now that you're having second doubts about love now that my hypnosis is no longer in affect, but Penelope rabbit always makes sure her customers are happy! And that's why, I'm going to put you under a much stronger dose of Hypnotism! And this time, You'll have a much better partner than that silly rat, jeez what was I thinking back there!\" Penelope rambled on about how the Madame was a bad choice for her original hypnosis on Texas, only to cause the anger rising inside Texas to reach new heights, ones that not even Texas knew she had. \"Such a silly decision, I'm very sorry, Texas. But now, I know the perfect match for you is. She's got a nice personality, a charming voice, a funny sense of humor-hehe~\" Texas dreaded where Penelope was going with this. She wasn't seriously about to say herself? She fit none of what she just said at all! \"Nice plump butt~ and..hnnnggg!!\" With a little grunt and strain, Penelope forced her tiny body to push out a rather brassy fart towards Texas, actually managing to cause somewhat of a stink with it, as Texas groaned at the smell (though, with her mindset still in play, even she had to admit that she liked the smell of it). \"Smelly gas that you'll just love~! That's right, Texas, I'll be you're dream woman! hehehe!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing this, Texas now kicked and howled as loud as she could, forcing herself as far away from Penelope as she could, only for the rabbit to hop right on top of her, sitting right on her chest and in front of her face. \"Calm down Texas, I'm doing this for us now! Think about how happy we'll BOTH be after this is all over! Gotta admit, his job's been a real lonely one, so having you around we'll make this a lot more fun! And you'll be able to get away from all those scary criminals that infest Golden springs! Just trust me on this, Texas. After we're done, all your worries will just disappear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said and done, Penelope pulled out her old pendulum from Texas's first encounter with her. Breathing heavily in a panic, Texas did her best to avoid eye contact with the mysterious item, unwilling to go back into another dream like state and unable to control her body. But her eyes were just drawn to the pendulum as it swung in front of her, with Penelope's voice coaxing her to watch it as it swung. \"That's it Texas, just look right into it, don't think about anything else~ Just calm yourself down, and let me take over~\" Texas was fading again, and much faster than before. She was still exhausted from all of yesterday, she had no energy left that she could muster up to fight back Penelope's control. Soon enough, Texas's eyes dulled and her mind shut down. She was back in Penelope's control...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould this be the how it ends for Tex? Would she be the mindless lover of the hypnotist rabbit? would anyone come to rescue her?  </span></div></div>",

The hypnotized weasel snapped up onto her knees and sat obediently, watching her new mistress intently. Penelope walked past her, shaking her little butt so that Texas would follow Penelope's little cotton tail with her eyes. Penelope climbed up onto a nearby chair and knelt on it backwards, so that her butt was facing towards her devoted weasel slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, girl!\" She said, wiggling her rump and letting out a quick toot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas scrambled on her hands and knees, rushing her face into that plump white behind to ravenously snort down that carrot-y gas. She dug her weasel snout into Penelope's crack and wiped her nose up and down the sweaty crevice, desperate to snort down whatever residual fumes that were still clinging to Penelope's butt fur. Penelope, meanwhile, couldn't get enough of this tireless butt worship. Even with her hypnosis she wasn't expecting this kind of excitement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my!\" Penelope said, \"You're quite the stink snorter. How about another toot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope didn't wait for an answer. She let another steamy fart out into Texas's face, and the braindead sheriff drank down every last drop of that awful smell. Part of Texas thought about how she should absolutely hate it, but that part of her was drowned out by the sheer force of Penelope's potent hypnosis. All she could think of was how much she loved Penelope's horrible, reeking ass. She was so enraptured that she started to lick Penelope's sweaty crack, surprising the rabbit even more. She looked over her shoulder to see that Texas was not only eating out her ass, but pleasuring herself while she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracious! You disgusting horndog, you're lucky I like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope squeezed another stinker out into Texas's mouth, and it seemed like this would be the rest of poor Texas's life, trapped in such a powerful hypnosis spell that she would be nothing more than the rabbit's ass slave. But right in the middle of their passionate ass-worship session, there came a knock at the door. Then, that knock was followed by a high heel kicking in the door. It was Madame, standing defiantly in the doorway. She had received a ransom note from Penelope, telling her to come alone, but she couldn't believe what she had walked in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sheriff?!\" She gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope smiled at her guest, \"Sorry sweets, the Sheriff is too busy eating my ass to answer you, so I'll fill you in: She played you. This ass-breath slut is only interested in one thing: Hot blasts of ass gas. So she's with me now, you oughta just move right along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame's face was flush with emotion. She shot back from shock, to embarrassment, to pure anger. She was a lady after all, and you should never disrespect a lady. Her anger reached a boiling point and she knew she had to act upon it. And her vengeance would be swifter and smellier than anyone could be able to handle. But who was the target of Madame's new ire?</span></div></div>",

Texas still to busy following Penelope's orders and slurping on her ass, Penelope nearly jumped from the spot she sat as The Madame tackled her to the ground, leaving Texas sitting on her knees as she waited for Penelope to present herself to her again. \"You damn little rabbit, stealing my girl like this! There's no damn way in hell that Texas would do something so dirty!\" The Madame roared at Penelope, defending Texas with all her heart, causing the weasel's ears to twitch at the sound of her name being mentioned, as Penelope gagged at the tight grip around her neck! \"The girl's got a heart of gold, and the purest soul imaginable! If this were anyone else we were talkin about, then maybe I'd believe you...But not with Texas! Not with my girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope wasn't expecting for this to happen at all! She thought for sure that Texas would have been the target of her rage in this situation, she hadn't planned for the Madame to still treat Texas so highly after seeing her lick her own ass so gleefully! Mustering up all the strength she could, the little bunny rabbit put both her feet onto the Madame's chest and kicked her off, sending her colliding with the wooden floor they stood on! \"Ugh, today is not my day! You were supposed to get Texas so I could hypnotize you as well! Gosh, are all girls from golden springs so stubborn and annoying?\" Penelope snapped at The Madame as she let her pants slip off to the floor that she had lowered originally for Texas to dig into her bare bottom. Now having her tiny, yet plump rear end looming over The Madame's face, Penelope attempted to drop her butt onto The Madame's face, only for Paris to catch Penelope's butt just before contact, to Penelope's dismay! \"Oh would you stop struggling already! Texas, come here and help me out, would you, sweetie~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEars twitching yet again at the sound of her name from Penelope, Texas nodded and slowly got up onto her feet and made her way towards the two women fighting. In the midst of holding Penelope back, as the white rabbit was still trying her best to force herself down onto her, hopping vigorously on her hands and even letting a brassy fart slip pass her hands and hit The Madame directly in her face, Paris managed to call out to Texas as well, pleading for her help! \"Please, Texas darlin, I know you this ain't you! Whatever this woman's got on you, I know you're tougher than her! Please Texas, help m-Gah!\" another fart hitting her right in her face, Penelope now ground her butt against Paris's hands as she felt her grip weaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Texas, let's wrap this up already. Get over here and help you're REAL lover out, pweeeease~ hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas,Don't listen to her! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas, listen to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to her. Texas, darlin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex's mind was boggling now back and forth, who was she supposed to listen to now! On one hand, Penelope was her lover, her everything, she was hers! And yet...Something was also trying to pull her towards The Madame, but what was it...Her heart was torn, what was she to do! Unable to find the answer, Texas stood there and stuttered, frightened and worried what to do next! what was she to do, what was she to do! \"Umm-uhhh...Y-Yes, A-A-Ah'll come and help ya...uhhh!\" It was now or never, her mind and heart both had to come to an agreement now or else she'd have nothing in the end! And like that, the answer was clear to Texas now. Her eyes went wide before sinking down in realization. Yes, she was the right one for her, how could she have been so blind. Finally at ease with her choice, Texas approached both women, as they both looked at her, waiting for her next move. and to both of their shock and surprise, Texas then bent over, assisting...   </span></div></div>",

But instead, Texas grabbed onto Madame's wrists and tugged them apart so that Penelope could finally push her ass fully down. Madame's look of momentary relief turned to one of shocked horror before her face was completely enveloped in bunny buns. Penelope wiggled her butt back and forth, smearing the smell of her ass into the Madame's face while the poor rat kicked and struggled. But she couldn't kick Penelope off and was at the complete mercy of the rancid rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, s'about time I end this. Pull my finger, Texas!\"  Penelope laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas, still in her mind-addled state, could think of nothing she wanted to do more. She yanked Penelope's pinky and the rabbit ripped out an absolutely horrendous fart straight into Madame's face. She let out a muffled cry of agony, her heels scraping against the floor in a weak attempt to crawl away from the nose-searing stink. But she could find no escape and quickly passed out. Penelope bounced her butt on Madame's face a few more times and nearly flattened the rat's head completely before having Texas pull her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now that we've taken out the trash, it's time you take me out to dinner, sheriff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Texas's last shot at breaking Penelope's mind control was squashed beneath the bunny's butt. Texas publicly gave up her position as Sheriff shortly after and renounced Gold Springs, electing to spend her time traveling with Penelope and aiding her in her shows. People spread rumors about her and how she doted on Penelope, especially when they got close to her and smelled rabbit butt on her breath.

Her mind was bombarded with memories of being squashed by her titanic derriere in an attempt to dissuade her from advancing, but it yielded no results as the scent of sweaty ass compelled her to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she was mere inches from her butt, Roxxie stopped her swaying and let out a low groan. Without warning, she caught the full brunt of a long, brassy fart, the stench driving away the rest of the towns people as they clenched their hands over their nose. Butterscotch let out an amused whinny at their disgust before letting loose a powerful fart of her own, drawing a snicker from her owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn, Butterscotch! You gotta take it easy on the candied apples!\" she laughed as she waved her hand on front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Butterscotch huffed and rolled her eyes and in doing so caught sight of Texas standing behind Roxxie with a deliriously happy expression on her face as she breathed in the noxious fumes. Her owner didn't seem to notice the sheriff as she leaned forward and peered into one of the saddlebags with her list in hand. Butterscotch whinnied to try and draw her attention to it, but she didn't pay her any mind as she continued to do inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We're still a little short on gunpowder. Need a least three more kegs if we're gonna blow down that-- SAFE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her last word came out in a surprised gasp as she felt something being pushed between her massive cheeks. Looking over her shoulder, she was stunned to find her most hated rival Texas, her arms wrapped around her waist as her face was buried in her ass. She wasn't sure of what to make of what she was seeing, though she was quick to come to the conclusion that there was some trickery afoot. She reached down and grabbed Texas by the scuff of her, picking her up and bringing her to eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well well, lookie what I found, Butterscotch. Looks like little ol' Texas decided to try and thwart our plans before they even began!\" she said as she waved the mesmerized weasel back and forward with a cruel sneer. Butterscotch narrowed her eyes and snorted aggressively, eager to trample Texas into a fine paste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's a good thing you came when you did. See, I got this itch in the crack of my ass that I just can't reach and... well, you got more experience back there than anyone else...\" she said with a sinister grin. She had expected the sheriff to start struggling in a desperate attempt to flee, but was instead treated to uncharacteristic squeal of delight from her captive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ya really mean it?! Ah git ta scratch that big beautiful booty o'yours?!\" she cried happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Roxxie gave her a blank stare as she found herself at a lost for words. Her initial belief was that she was being lured into a false sense of security but the the earnestness in her voice left her uncertain. In all the times she dealt with Texas, couldn't recall a single time where she tried such a tactic. She soon concluded that the sheriff was attempting to use reverse psychology in order to escape. The bandit sneered and brought Texas to her giant rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nice try, Texas. Now, if you do a good job I might just let you go--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was cut off as she felt Texas' push herself deep in between her cheeks, rubbing her body along the fleshy walls to scratch as much as she could while her fur soaked in her rancid ass sweat. Roxxie and her stead glanced at each other with a mutual look of uncertainty as they were completely caught off guard by what they were witnessing. As much as she enjoyed the feeling of her fur brushing walls of her asscheeks, she found herself struggling to think of a reason why Texas would willingly demean herself in such a way. Eventually she decided to...</span></div></div>",

The bandit's laughs quickly began to turn into moans as Texas switched from scratching the larger woman's cheeks to massaging them with both hands all over, squeezing and moving the large mounds of flesh.  Butterscotch could only watch the action with her jaw nearly on the ground while watching the sheriff, the hardass weasel who had been both a thorn and a comfortable pillow to all the thugs, was now even roughly French kissing her master's pucker, thrusting her tongue against her new lover's fleshy wet walls. A tender kiss that shocked Roxxie so much that she let out an almighty gas cloud right into Texa's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie quickly looked  behind, waiting for the usual screams, cries of anger, the sounds that were complete melodies to her ears whenever she had Texas deep in her crack but there was no such sound. Instead, all she heard was a deep inhale, followed by a loud and satisfied POP as Texas released the bandit's asshole from her lips. The nose twisting stench drenched the ravenous sheriff's upper body, her fur drenched in a thick layer of sweat from Roxxie's titanic cheeks. The 'roo simply just looked at Texas from the corner of her eye, shaking her head with a growing smile, keeping an eye on the filthy weasel as she looked up at the bandit longingly, waiting for a review of her first, and hopefully many experiences servicing her love of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... I don't know what the sandy devil got into you Tex... But dang! I LOVE this new you!\" The bandit busted out laughing, using one finger  to close Butterscotch;s still open maw before wrapping her tail around Texa's body and pulling her to eye level, noticing how wide the sheriff's smile and pupils were getting. It looked like the once proud weasel was going to faint from just seeing that she pleased the girl she once hated with every fibre of her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had plenty of ass kissers but you, now that was something else! I always thought you were underqualified as a sheriff but this 'new career choice, I see a lot of potential.~\" Roxxie cooed her rival teasingly, trying to avoid bursting out laughing as she could feel Texa's heartbeat literally going faster as she swooned over her better's 'compliments.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how about we head home and discuss, this little arrangement further. I will need a new saddle. My old one was feeling a little worn out.~\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roxxie took the opportunity to strip the hypnotized sheriff, keeping Texas' gun and badge for herself while tossing the rest of her clothing onto the dirt in a heap. The naked weasel didn't even try to resist, simply holding still as her arch nemesis left her completely exposed. There was still a niggling voice in the back of her mind begging her to do something, <i>anything</i> to resist but she was too enamored with the stinky roo before her to seriously consider escaping. All she could think about was how happy she was to be with the love of her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Roxxie dropped Texas onto the ground and turned around, once again giving the weasel a view of that colossal ass. Her grin was wider than ever and her heart was pounding out of her chest as she knew what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this: you can run along now, or you can beg to become my saddle. What's it gonna be?\" the roo chuckled, knowing full well that Texas was too far gone to try escaping. The voice in the back of Texas' mind was screaming for her to run away and escape the stinking torment of the roo's backside. Now was her chance! All she had to do was--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE sit yer big, fat, stinkin' ass down on me Roxxie! There's nothin' I want more than t' slurp sweat outta yer asscrack while you fart right onto m' nose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, so much for overcoming the hypnosis escaping. Roxxie quit teasing the desperate weasel and finally brought her ass down with a resounding <b>SLAM</b>, instantly reducing the sheriff into a fuzzy butt print. The roo reveled in squashing her longtime rival flat, grinding left and right and blasting out a nasty fart right into the weasel's face for good measure. Texas meanwhile was in Heaven. She happily took long, deep sniffs of the roo's ass as she was mercilessly crushed beneath Roxxie's backside. Her face made up her top side which was buried in the stinking kangaroo's ass while her underside was her nethers, framed on either side by her flattened footpaws. The roo's nasty fart was what finally pushed Texas over the edge: she tensed up, let out a moan heavily muffled by the fat ass bearing down on her, and orgasmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie bounced up and down a few times to ensure the weasel was firmly stuck before standing up and curiously examining the butt-shaped crater Texas was just occupying. What she saw made her burst out laughing, even rolling around on the ground as she cackled like mad. A large wet spot was left behind from where the weasel's nethers let loose, Texas having let out all that pent up lust with a powerful climax. Texas couldn't do anything even if she wanted to, but she was perfectly happy to stay stuck on the kangaroo's big, jiggly ass while said roo laughed at her perversion. Her privates were fully visible as well, her pancaked form spread across Roxxie's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came! Honest to goodness <i>came</i> from sniffing my ass! I never thought I'd see the day you'd ask to sniff my gas, let alone <i>get off on it</i>!\" Roxxie was out of breath, wiping a tear from her eye as she stood up. Texas was still firmly stuck to her butt so all she had to do was climb up onto Butterrscotch's back and make herself comfy. Texas made for a fantastic cushion, easily making her ratty fart-scented saddle far more comfortable to use. Roxxie pressed her ass down onto the cushion so forcefully that Texas molded to conform with the seat, squeezed into the perfect shape to make her new \"lover\" comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis should have been the worst day of Texas' life, but instead she felt happier than she'd ever been. Her body was horribly squashed and her face was grinding up against the rancid, sweaty asshole of her biggest rival. Her vagina ground against the leather of the saddle, giving her even further conflicting feelings of pain and pleasure. Once Butterscotch started moving the grinding on her cunt got much worse. This wasn't helped by the fact that Roxxie was farting right onto her face every couple of minutes, the horrid stench burning the weasel's nose and making her eyes water. Somehow the weasel thoroughly enjoyed all of these things, even orgasming every once in a while whenever she was forced to endure a particularly nasty fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.\" Roxxie said, smiling as she rode off toward her hideout.</span></div></div>",

Under her breath and without a word Tex crawled over to the side of Vivian's desk and was greeted by her toned backside. Hiding a gleeful chuckle Mayor Vivian slouched to the side so her asscrack invited Tex's idiotic looking face underneath and Tex accepted the invitation, her entire face snugged perfectly in between the lynx's ass cheeks while Vivian finished up her paperwork like nothing had happened. The occasional toot to warm up for the coming storm that Texas so anxiously accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, so Texas you finally accepted your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vibration, a warmth, and a reality defying smell soothed its way through Tex's nostrils to such effect that her mouth automatically reacted for the next, and the next, and the next ass breath that found its way from the Mayor's brownbox to its new weasel storage unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! A breath fit for an ass slave like you. Come, I've an announcement to make to Gold Springs out on the balcony and I've long awaited my seat fit for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex's dazed and smelly face fixated on stuffing itself in Mayor Vivian's backside followed without effort to its rightful owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gold Springs! I've a request of you, continue to satisfy them and we can all share in the wealth and fortune to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she simply leaned back and Tex reacted holding up Mayor Vivian's ass with her face, and her feet with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have Penelope to thank for my new seat, and soon to be personal toilet. Please, continue to use her services as I have. Just as well, I've put out a bounty on April. She's wanted for treason and you may carry out the punishment as you see fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tex's and April's fates were all but sealed. Another fart graced Tex's lungs as she escorted the seated lynx to the bathroom as hastily as Tex could on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Toilet? Just bring us back to the desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way Mayor Vivian honored her furry porcelain throne a pull down of her business slacks and panties and before Tex could hypnotically utter so much as a thank you a rumbling ass roar ripped its way down Tex's throat and served to cement Tex in her place just in time at Mayor Vivian's desk as her new desk toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I've some changes to make around here and your convenient appearance has made today able to go much more faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't, every bit of Mayor Vivian snaked its way down Tex's hypnotized and waiting gullet. What feels like an hour is two minutes. What's two days is just one. What feels like a month was just a week. Before long Texas accepts that her purpose in life always was and will be Mayor Vivian's personal desk toilet, and Texas hoped Penelope knew how thankful she was to help find her place with her one true purpose. To be the seat of power in Gold Springs to Mayor Vivian.</span></div></div>",

The weasel's looking perfectly fine to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas spat on Sarah-Mae's dress,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right I am! You need better stuff to take me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah-Mae was flabbergasted. She crossed her arms, stomped her heel in the muck and huffed. All the while, Smiling Jacks couldn't help but laugh at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess yer toots aint that tuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah-Mae responded, \"Fine, your turn then, Jacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Jacks moved Bessie's ass closer to Texas and gave the cow a firm slap on the behind. The cow grunted, squatted down and blew a gigantic fart that was thick with the smell of manure straight into Texas's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, what are you doing?!\" Texas pleaded, \"You said she'd only bury me if I was dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah-Mae giggled, \"I didn't say anything like that. I said she'd bury you when I was finished, and I'm all finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas saw Bessie's foul, shit-caked asshole expand open and screamed. A deluge of stinking dung started to pile on top of her, completely covering her head in piping hot cow pie. If breathing Sarah-Mae's gas was hard, breathing dung was impossible! Texas was already short of breath, could she possibly manage to extricate herself from this dookie doom, or would she be buried alive?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't move her arms or legs, and she had a horrible pain in her head. She was tied up! Sarah-mae had knocked her unconscious and kidnapped her! Before she could call out into the darkness for help, Sarah-mae stepped out in front of her. But there was something strange about her; Sarah-mae was upside down?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sunshine,\" She said, \"You slept well for a gal tied upside-down over a pit of sewage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Texas thought, of course. She looked up (or really down) and saw that pit of reeking sewage that Sarah-mae was speaking of. Much to her disgust, it looked fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah-Mae continued, \"Now, I'm sure you're wondering where you are. You ain't in Gold Springs, lemme tell ya. You're about two counties over, at the grounds of the annual southern food fair. Course you're not really in the food fair. You're below it. And right now, they should be finishing up with the chili eating contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfectly on time, there was an echoing flush from somewhere in the sewer and the septic pit below Texas rose up just an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara-Mae giggled, \"Y'see? Told ya. Now there's an awful big reward for your corpse, and an even bigger one if you get done in with a real embarrassing way. So I figure I'll drown you in shit, then fish ya out in a few hours and collect my reward with your turd-soaked stiff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna get away with this!\" Texas shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah-Mae didn't seem fazed, \"Sure I won't. I should get going, I want to try some of the hors d'oeuvres and then flush my shit into your face! Tata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara-Mae skipped off into the darkness of the sewer. Another flush sounded out at the shit water beneath Texas grew closer, causing her to panic. She started shouting out, but she had no idea how deep in the sewers she was and she had a strong feeling nobody would be coming to her aid anytime soon. She needed to think!</span></div></div>",

If the weasel wasted her time trying to struggle free, she would be going under that press in no time, and that was not something she wanted to think about... Instead, as the two villains were busy, the weasel rolled right off the edge of the belt, landing on the dusty floor next to it and starting to inch her way to a nearby crate she could hide behind, looking for anything to slice through the ropes. Meanwhile, Roxxie glanced up and grinned, not seeing Texas on the conveyor belt, then walked over happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hell, we musta missed the good bit... Well, whatever, let's put this weasel to use!\" She grabbed the tray that the counter fit coins would usually fall into and yanked it open, only to see that it was entirely empty. \"Oi! What the shit? Where is she!!\" She yelled angrily. Texas, hearing Roxxie's angry and disappointed cry, couldn't help but smirk a little at that, as she used a rusty nail to slice through the last of the rope, freeing herself. She paused and looked around, knowing that she'd have to move soon, but to where? To her left she could see her gun belt hanging on a nearby chair, no doubt meant to be kept as a trophy, but there were two of them and one of her... On the other hand, across the room from her was an open door, but the Sheriff couldn't be sure where it would lead, and they were sure to see her if she made a run for it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Texas was seething with anger. Not only had she let Diamond completely catch her off-guard, she didn't even see his obvious tricks from a mile away. Just because he had a cute smile. And he wanted to feed her to a machine and press her into a condom? The indignity alone set the weasel's blood ablaze. And then Roxxie. Of all the bandits in the west, he was working together with her?! Not just working together, it sounded like they were lovers. The weasel felt a scratch of jealousy amidst the anger as the slobby kangaroo had managed to snag someone as appealing as the cat. She wasn't going to let all of this stand unpunished. Her gun was close, and so was her vengeance. They could admire eachother from separate jail cells! With both bandits moving around to find their quarry the weasel quickly dashed towards her gun. She pulled it from its holster and pointed it at Diamond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze, varmint!\" the weasel yelled. The cat froze in his tracks, looking somewhat fearfully at the angry weasel pointing a gun at him. Texas glanced around a little to see where Roxxie had wandered off to, but Diamond grabbed her attention by letting out a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut yer hole, bandit! Ah'm gonna enjoy watchin you wither in jail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure of that.\" The cat replied, a sly grin creeping onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the sheriff could decipher the meaning of his words a strong arm came up from behind her and grabbed the weasel's arm, yanking it to the side. Roxxie growled a little as she used her overwhelming strength to squeeze Texas' arm. With a pained yelp the weasel dropped her gun and shortly thereafter the roo's other arm curled around her neck. The kangaroo bandit lifted the weasel up a little, pressing the back of the sheriff's head against her soft breasts and letting the weasel squirm. She looked up to Diamond, who was ready to make the weasel sorry for threatening him. He ran towards his love, jumping at her and turning his butt towards Roxxie, squashing the weasel in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo bandit thrust herself forward a little to brace for her lover's impact and she delighted in hearing the weasel's body squish between them. They both chuckled as Diamond blew a fart over the flattened weasel before Roxxie finally peeled the sheriff off her gut and handed her over to the cat. Texas was too dazed from the squashing and the gas to put up any kind of fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, since you want to play it that way, let's not waste any more time.\" He said, walking towards the old coin press. He folded the weasel's stretched out body double so she would fit on the conveyor belt again and placed her right in front of the machine. The bandit held her down as the sheriff felt the first few rollers catch onto her toes and pull them into the mechanism. The machine whirred and churned with industrial vigor. Mechanical grinding and creaking sounded as it pulled the squishy weasel into it's inner workings. The steady thrum of the engine began to sputter as the coin press had to work with this new material. It chugged for a minute until the noise finally cleared. Roxxie and Diamond stood on the other side, eager to see the results. They both nearly fell over laughing as a single brown disk emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, we can only squeeze a single rubber outta you? Ah whatever, It's all the protection we're gonna need.\" Diamond boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you think you only want to go once?\" Roxxie retorted with a big smirk. She already knew his answer, but she loved hearing him say it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll wash her out between rounds. This weasel ain't goin anywhere until we're done with her.\" The cat said proudly, picking up the stamped weasel and putting her in his vest pocket. He guides his lover along to the mint's floor to the old office, now refurbished into a bedroom. Along the way he grabs a bucket of water for the weasel. Roxxie gasps as the enter the spacious office. Against the back wall was a reinforced bed big enough for both the chubby roo and her wide-bottomed stud. He put the weasel on the end table and they both quickly stripped bare. If the squashed weasel still had any movement left in her, it would be spent wincing at the disgusting display. Roxxie was breathing deeply already and her lover's manhood was quickly rising up at the sight of the naked bandit. They weren't going to wait another minute.</span></div></div>",

The kangaroo just beckoned him closer, watching his length rise up between his legs. The heat between her own loins rose as she watched her lover apply the squashed weasel. With some finnicking and a whole lot of brute strength the cat thrust his manhood into the stretchy sheriff. Texas impressed both bandits by being able to contain the entirety of Diamond's throbbing shaft. She was stretched further than she could have ever imagined. Roxxie could swear she could hear the weasel's pathetic whimpering softly in the air, but it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond had been waiting all day for this moment and he would not disappoint his lover. He yearned to pleasure her pussy, but the way to Roxxie's heart was through her ass. Once he'd given that a good pounding she might let him take a shot and pleasing her snatch. Not a problem now, the feline thought. As murky as the roo's rear might be, he was packing proper protection. The stamped weasel was wrapped nicely around his throbbing cock, Texas' face somewhere near the tip. If the sheriff were able to scream now might be the time to start as the large shaft got ever closer to Roxxie's waiting butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, babe? Texas is about to fuck you over in a way she's never done before.\" He said with a snicker, the roo rolling her eyes at his terrible pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't keep the poor gal waitin now. Put her in me. My ass can't wait t' ruin her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweaty, grimy buttcheeks were pushed apart, leaving behind a trail of filth on the weasel turned condom. Diamond was going to take it nice and slow so Texas could soak in the horribleness of Roxxie's putrid depths. Texas soon felt the stained pucker of the roo press against her face. With a sloppy squelch it began to open, allowing the feline to slowly proceed. The stench defied all description, a noxious odour so foul not even the roo's farts could top it. The thought barely had time to cross Texas' mind before an ominous rumble echoed all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie grunted a little and let out a lengthy fart. Diamond just sniffed the air and murred in delight, intoxicated by his lover's fumes and delighted by the weasel that was no doubt enjoying them even more. Though she lacked any real semblance of a nose, the stench was still clear as day for the weasel turned condom. She could practically taste the foul remains of whatever had been rotting in the roo's bowels for the last few days. It twisted the sheriff's stomach to know that all the noxious farts she'd been subjected to so far were merely watered down versions of these putrid blasts coming straight from the kangaroo's foulest depths. The same depths that she was now exploring, stuck and stretched out over a cock that seemed to grow even bigger with every new bit of the roo's rectum it explored. The shit and slimy filth coating the walls rubbed into the stretchy weasel's fur and skin. If she ever got away the smell would hound her for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it... more... yes... more!\" The roo moaned loudly. The feline wanted to give a snarky response, but he was so lost in the experience he barely had a legible word in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond gladly kept pushing forward, listening to the delighted moans of his lover. He felt the vaguest hints of struggle coming from his condom, but that might just as easily be Roxxie's rear trying to squeeze his length. Whatever it was, it spurred him on to drive his member even deeper. He wouldn't stop until there was no more of his length to shove into her. The feline had been cautious with past lovers, not wanting his prodigious girth to hurt them. But Roxxie could take it and them some. Sating her desires let him be as vigorous as he always wanted to be. And with a nice weaselskin condom he pulled out all the stops. No longer content to simply push himself deeper he began to thrust in earnest. The kangaroo gasped a bit as she felt Texas venture deeper into her than ever before. The mere thought of the sheriff this deep in her ass made her pussy drool with barely restrained desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff finally felt her horrid advance stop as the rod that carried her had run out of length to insert into the roo's ass. The dark depths of the bandit's colon were enough of a nightmare without the long streaks of shit being rubbed long the sheriff's body. If she had a throat, she would almost certainly be heaving in disgust by now. The weasel had been on the receiving end of many a foul treatment, but this one took the grand prize with a distance. Most nauseating of all was the throbbing sensation echoing through her body as Diamond was getting ever closer to his climax, ready to fill his condom. The roo responded by clenching her rear, smothering the stretched weasel from all sides in with the filthy walls of her rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond couldn't hold it any longer. His lover's fierce clenches sent him into a moaning orgasm as he filled the malleable sheriff with a powerful shot of cum. It may not have been all that much, but the weasel felt like gallons of hot liquid were just shot into her. The immense shaft just kept on pumping more and more thick cum into the sheriff. She felt it trying to escape along the side, pushing itself ever further, trying to break free from the containment of the weasel's body. Neither bandit offered more that lewd moaning and heavy breathing and panting. This would be a night they won't soon forget. But how about Texas?</span></div></div>",

The feline's imposing shaft still throbbed inside of her stretched body. The outside was caked with filth, courtesy of Roxxie's ass, now fully penetrated by the cat. The intense pleasure of pushing the weasel condom this deep into the roo's putrid bowels had already delivered a mighty orgasm to the feline, leaving the weasel a bit loose. As he pulled out the kangaroo tried to no avail to hold onto the delightful intruder, clenching around his shaft. But the only thing the squeezing walls got a firm grip on was the weasel. Lubricated by the large volume of cum inside her the cat's meaty rod was slipping out without its condom. Panic set in as the sheriff now faced the very real possibility of getting stuck in Roxxie's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge shaft began to vacate the weasel, her tight rubbery grip dissipating as Diamond left without her. The roo's clenches ensured the weasel was not going anywhere and soon the feline had fully withdrawn himself, leaving the stretched weasel somewhere inside his lover. The sheriff could hear muffled voices. No doubt the bandits were having an argument about this development, but she had no idea what was being said. All the while the filth-caked walls kept pulsing, squeezing and undulating. Pungent clumps of shit were getting pressed into the weasel's short fur. The stench was unbearable, a steady steam of the worst of Roxxie's gas. This deep in her colon the stink of kangaroo farts was the only thing seared into the weasel's mind. It overpowered her every action, nullifying her escape attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond and Roxxie continued their passionate night without the weasel, making love until the early hours. Whatever would happen to her, they didn't care. With a whole town now barely defended they could make all the living condoms they'd ever need. For a laugh Roxxie did keep an eye on the results of her bowel movements for a few days before she concluded that the weasel was properly dealt with. She thought the sheriff to be dead, but the truth was so much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within the kangaroo bandit's bowels the sheriff remained. Her body was emaciated, sustained by nothing but the fetid gas of Roxxie's intestines. The intoxicating stench of the roo's innermost depths left the weasel unable to do anything other than breathing in even more of the rotten fumes. With the weasel entombed within her Roxxie and Diamond set off on a crime spree that would enter Wild West legend. But few would remember the first sheriff that stood against them, reduced to a toy for a steamy night of passion and never seen again.</span></div></div>",

His face and hair color almost matched Texas' completely, except his chin was a bit larger and his hair was a bit lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" Texas squealed rushing her cousin in a tender embrace. \"You scared me half to death!\" Texas said playfully shoving Dallas. \"Sorry cuz, I didn't want the sun to burn this lovely color scheme I got going on.\" Dallas said slyly as he threw off the cloak revealing the rest of his body. His attire also matched Texas' pretty well too. Light green short sleeve shirt, tan pants, and black belt. The only difference was no vest, hat, or boots. In place of the boots he had a knock off pair of Chuck Taylor's. But the real difference between Dallas and Texas was size. As Texas is fit and curvaceous, Dallas was weak and scrawny. Not that he was skinny but he had no muscles in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I almost forgot!\" Dallas said rummaging through his cloak before pulling out the cheesiest gigantic ten gallon hat Texas had ever seen. Dallas slid the hat slowly enjoying the feeling. Texas quickly burst into laughter as she saw how ridiculous her cousin looked. \"Yeah I don't think so.\" Texas said snatching the hat off his head and threw it into a nearby pig pin. \"Ah Texas why did you go and do that?! Now I won't look like a real cowboy.\" Dallas said annoyed. \"Well that's good, cuz you ain't a real cowboy. Speaking of that, not that I'm not pleased to see ya, but what brings you here Dallas? Big city life get too comfy?\" Texas said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardy har har, Texas! But if you must know, word around the \"big city\" is that you guys are a little short handed in this town, so me and my gracious heart called up the marshall in this area and he gave me this!\" Dallas said pulling out a gold star from his cloak that had the words deputy on the front. \"You're kidding?!\" Texas said in disbelief. \"You bet I thought it'd be fun y'know? Hang out like old times! Maybe find myself a thin pretty gal while I'm down here.\" Texas giggled and rolled her eyes. \"Um cuz, your down south. Ain't nothin' thin down here 'cept you!\" Texas said putting her hand on her hip popping her butt up and arching her back displaying her cleavage to illustrate a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas then took that time to look around noticing giant anthro women all around him. \"Point taken.\" He said a little intimidated. \"Well look I'm glad you're here though. Y'see me and my other deputy April have tracked Smiling Jacks gang to an old abandoned mine shaft in the middle of the desert. We weren't gonna go cuz we'd be gone too long, but now that you're here maybe this is s sign that we should go get 'em! Look the town is pretty peaceful right now a lot of the outlaws are locked up tight in our prison. Since I'll be gone a couple of days I'm leaving you in charge. It should be easy, things have been kinda slow this past month.\" Texas said explaining the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow thanks Tex! I won't let you down!\" Dallas said excited. \"One more thing, cuz. Law men and law women always wear hats around these parts, since you ain't a cowboy I think this hat I confiscated from an irish outlaw will fit ya.\" Texas said pulling out a brown cabby hat from her satchel and put it on Dallas' head. \"Alright, oh and one more thing I got a complaint a few minutes ago at this address take care of that for me cuz.\" Texas said as she rode off on her horse.

Immediately his ear drums were assaulted by thousands of angry women yelling and screaming. As Dallas approached the front desk he noticed a lynx women in a pantsuit looking as though she was expecting him. \"Uh hi. Are you in charge around here?\" He said towards the lynx lady. \"You could say that, I am Vivian the mayor of this town.\" She said reaching out her arm for a handshake. \"Oh um, sorry ma'am my name is-\" he was quickly cut off by Vivian. \"Dallas Stanton, cousin of Texas Stanton, and our new deputy. The marshall informed me of your arrival, this morning.\" Vivian said being coy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. If you don't mind me asking where's the prison guards at?\" Dallas asked. \"Oh they're deeper in the prison and the one that was posted here is indisposed at the moment. And being the kind mayor I am took it upon myself to help out my hardworking citizens.\" Vivian said. \"Oh well what's the problem, miss?\" Dallas asked. \"There's a disruptive prisoner down the hall there, we probably could've handled it but since you're new here I thought this would be the perfect opportunity for you to let the criminals know who is in charge around here.\" Vivian said buttering him up. \"Yeah that makes sense! I'd be happy to do this for you! Which cell is it?\" Dallas said amped up. \"Just go down that hallway you can't miss it!\" Vivian said pointing to a dark hallway. \"Thank you so much!\" He said running to the hall. \"No deputy thank you!\" Vivian said waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Vivian's Bear and Rhino thugs emerged from the shadows. There were about to chase Dallas when Vivian stopped them. \"Down girls, I've got a deal with one of the prisoners who's been dying for an officer to squash.\" Vivian said walking over to a desk chair. As she wheeled it out it revealed the very flattened face of a beaver guard. \"Please madame mayor let me go home I won't tell anyone about this!\" The pleading girl said. \"I know you won't, because you've been demoted from guard to cushion! Don't worry you won't be lonely, there's a Yak lady that's been begging for a job here for weeks and since there's an opening I'm going to make sure she gets it.\" The beaver woman sobbed not enjoying her new job. \"Get used to petite butts while you can!\" Vivian said slamming perky rump onto the quivering face of the beaver lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Dallas he was currently wandering around this quiet and dark hallway. \"I can't hear anything this must've been a bogus complaint. All of a sudden her heard a faint \"Pst!\" he turned around to see where it came from and his eyes widened. He saw a sexy mouse girl emerge from the shadows and towards the bars. She was exactly what Dallas was looking for! Shorter than him, plump yet not thick features, blonde hair, and a beautiful face with a flawless complexion. She had cut off her prison pants into a tight pair of orange shorts, she also had her prison shirt tied in a knot to show off her mid riff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas sauntered over to the gorgeous girl mouth wide open in disbelief. \"Hey there cutie!\" She said with an unexpected deep seductive voice. \"H-hey miss, what's your name.\" He asked. \"Trixie, just Trixie. What yours?\" She said flirting. \"Dallas Stanton. Are you the one making noise?\" He said. \"Stanton now why is that name familiar? And no that'd be my cell mate you'd like her she's a pretty gray thing like me.\" She said brushing her own fur. \"She didn't mean it, honest. It just gets so lonely in here, why don't you come on in and keep us company?\" She said walking back into the shadows. Dallas wanted to be in there more than anything, but then he realized he didn't have any keys. He looked down in disappointment, but as he did this he saw the roll of keys right in front the cell door. He would've been suspicious of this if that mouse babe was on the othe side of the door. He quickly picked up the keys, found the right one, and unlocked the door and walked right in searching for the mouse lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas couldn't see a thing, but suddenly his nose was filled with the overwhelming stench of buttcrack. Then the cell door behind him closed shut. He was afraid until he felt a warm sense behind him. Dallas thought this was Trixie until a much deeper voice said \"Gotcha!\" Just then Dallas was lifted off his feet! As the lights were switched on, he found himself staring face to face with a gigantic elephant lady groping him with her trunk. \"Oh yeah I know now why Stanton was so familiar. Texas Stanton is the whole reason we're all locked up here in the first place! Well since Texas is on vacation we'll just have to squash her cousin in her place.\" Trixie said on the ground. \"You said she was like you!\" Dallas said in the elephant woman's strong grip. \"She is! She's gray, beautiful, and wicked!\" Trixie said walking away being sure to pick up the keys on her way out. \"Aw thanks Trix!\" The elephant said blushing. \"Anytime Nat, I'm going to go break out my old gang!\" Trix said walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dallas tried to keep his cool he took a long look at this giant elephant lady! Her butt was enormous cracking the concrete bench she was on, there also we a small group of flies around her crack that had peaked above her pants. Further than that, he noticed that she had removed her long sleeve prison shirt and had tied it around her waist. It left a white and incredibly sweat stained tank to that barely contained her massive cleavage. Finally his gaze came up to her face that was actually kind of cute, with her long black hair tied into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to enjoy this!\" Nat said, quickly shoving Dallas into her stinking cheeks. His senses were immediately assaulted by unbelievable crap stench that was coating him in an awful slime. \"My name's Natasha by the way, and your name is not important. Starting today you are now my own personal boy toy until I say other wise!\" She said grinding her cheeks all over Dallas. Suddenly he sees a faint light at the top of her buttcrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Dallas felt the tremendous pressure flatten him paper thin, as her cheeks clapped crushing him thinner! Natasha was practically twerking as she smashed the deputy in her booty. The concrete bench bellow her had been crumbled into pebbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas groaned as Natasha's cheeks had become sweaty. As he layed in the gigantic pachyderm posterior, a stream of butt sweat worked it's way into his mouth. Natasha ground her cheeks back and forth on the young lawman. \"What is it about you Stanton's that is so comfy. Y'know I had Texas in this position before. Yeah she was causing trouble for the former warden of this place, some skunk girl. Anyway her and Smiling Jack and me struck a deal to send her to me and and old cell mate of mine, Tanya. We were at her for a whole month before her stupid paperwork went through. I had missed the weasel hair up my butt, then you came along. Turns out that soft fur is genetic!\" She said making her grinds more rough on Dallas. Just then a loud gurgling sound could be heard coming from Natasha's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically point blank at her anus Dallas began to panic at the ominous sounds above him, he tried to scream but that only welcomed her stinking butt flesh into his mouth. Natasha's bowels exploded, PPPPPPPBBBBBBBRRRRRRRAFFFFFFFTTTttt...t. \"Ah that was sooo good!\" Natasha said kneading her cheeks. Meanwhile Dallas had taken the full force of the horrible eggy force that annihilated his senses. He was practically a furry stain on the back of her pants. Suddenly a knock is heard on the bars of Natasha's cell. An old armadillo guard talks to her \"Recreational time, Nat!\" He then walked away. \"Ok, what she we do boy toy!\" Natasha said giving herself a wedgie with her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Natasha waited until all the other girls were gone and it was just her and Dallas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha reached around to the back of her pants and peeled Dallas out. \"Alright guy Texas here's the deal these pants are too hot to workout in, so I'm gonna need some more comfortable gear.\" She said. Dallas was wondering why she was telling him this, until he felt her stroking his flattened form. \"Ohhhh yeah\" Natasha said looking at Dallas' realization. Quickly Natasha began to stretch and tie up Dallas' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally got a grip on what was going on, Dallas looked into a nearby and couldn't believe what he saw! Natasha had turned him into a thong! With his head and upper body on the inside of her butt. \"Look at you! You're perfect!\" She said stripping off her pants. As she slid Dallas on she had to struggle at her thighs since he was at least three sizes too small. Dallas cringed as her look up at Natasha's stink rear end, he couldn't believe it, his first day on the job and he was already a pair of underwear for an aggressive convict. She finally shimmied on Dallas. He was currently in complete disgust as her butt was overbearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natasha waltzed into the gym, he cheeks ground Dallas's new thong body. What proceeded was a crazy amount of squating, running and sit-ups. By the end of it Dallas was completely drenched in sweat.

She made sure to clench her glutes tight on Dallas as she continued with her work out. She started off lifting with ease but the more she lifted the more of a strain it was. Sweat coated Dallas as his furry form soaked up all of the sweat in her rump. As she went further more sweat poured out of her making him swollen with liquid. As she finished up her workout the barbell came down as she let out and earth shatteringly smelly fart.

What idiot would have a noise complaint at the most rowdy place in the city? Even though he knew this was a crap job, Dallas needed to take his new position seriously. As he walked towards the entrance he flashed his deputy badge and a guard let him in. As soon as he entered, his eardrums were assaulted by the unintelligible cheers of drunken patrons. They were all excited about whatever show was happening. He tried to look and see, but his vision was blocked by fat anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his frustration reached its peak, Dallas squeezed his way past two giant possum ladies. The squeeze itself wasn't too bad because of Dallas' thin body, but the smell was putrid it was like these women had never bathed once in their lives. Dallas cringed at the stench, but shook it off. As he was about to get a good look at the show, a large gray paw grabbed his shoulder and spun him around. \"What do you think you're doin' string bean?\" The massive possum lady to the right said. \"Yeah we paid good money for these seats!\" The possum lady to the left said. Dallas was overwhelmed by the gargantuan females, but he mustered his courage and asserted himself. \"Alright listen girls I'm only-\" he was cut off by the possum on the left. \"Girls?! You did not just call us girls!\" The right possum fronted on Dallas \"How bout we take you to our trailer at the edge of town and show ya how girly we are!\" As the possum ladies savored that idea, Dallas tried to assert himself once more. \"Look ladies I'm the new deputy and I'm trying-\" He was cut off once again by the announcer overhead \"Oh! That's gonna leave a mark! Well now is the time when we open up the floor to any potential challengers! If you feel like you can take on Georgia, just jump right into the ring!\" As Dallas looked up at the speaker, the possum girls grinned wickedly and turned around pointing their bulbous behinds in Dallas' direction. He then turned around determined to set the women straight but was surprised to see their huge butts. Suddenly they unleashed a synchronized disgusting fart blast into his face. The force of the blast was so powerful it made his hat fly off and his hair mat back. The smell attacked his sense letting the butt stench knock him unconscious and he fell over the railing into the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dallas began to come to he was dazed at his surroundings. He spun around cautiously only seeing dirt and wooden walls, until his vision focused on a huge pair of gray boots. As he looked up he saw a giant horse woman. Wait Dallas knew this lady, she used to work for Tex, he had met her a couple of times while visiting his cousin. \"Well look at what we got here! I think this belongs to you.\" Georgia said tossing Dallas' hat on the ground in front of him. He picked it up slowly and put it on top of his head shaking the whole time. \"You don't look like most folks around here, let's get better acquainted!\" She said snatching up Dallas, she the stretched out his form like a rag and then flossed her deep sweaty cleavage with his body. \"Uh, yeah you feel so good... in fact you feel kinda familiar!\" Said Georgia. Dallas was in torment as the salty sweat ingrained itself in his fur, suddenly he was whipped out. She rung him out like a rag and looked him in the face. \"I knew it! You're that weasel Texas' cousin, Dallas!\" Georgia said lighting up. Dallas was both surprised and terrified that she remembered him so clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this changes everything, honey!\" Georgia said locking lips with Dallas inflating him. It lasted a bit long and Dallas jumped a bit as she tongued him as she broke away. \"Alright here are the rules, short stack. This is like the regular rodeo, except instead of us seeing how long you can stay on the horse, we're gonna see how long the horse can stay off of you!\" Georgia said with a menacing grin. Dallas was terrified of this game. \"If you avoid me for 30 seconds you walk away a free man, if you don't well why don't you listen up.\" Georgia said pointing to a speaker. \" We'd like to remind our challenger that if he does not avoid Georgia he will become her very own permanent slave!\" The announcer said. \"No way that's legal!\" Dallas yelled. Georgia giggled with glee \"It's the Wild West darling, it's a different set of rules. Y'see it's my retirement show and they all pitched in for this little prize, and as it says in all the pan-flits anyone who enters this arena agrees to those terms. Just be quick and you'll be fine.\" She said with a big toothy grin. Dallas was petrified at the unbelievable odds stacked against him. As the bell rang Dallas ran as fast as he could hoping that he can outrun this massive horse lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

As she gained on him he tried to serpentine, luckily Georgia's face slammed into one of the wooden walls causing her to fall over in pain. Dallas felt triumphant and the looked at the timer, but his heart sank after he realized only 5 seconds had passed. Georgia got on her feet teeming with anger \"That's it! I was gonna go easy on ya because of a little crush I have on you. But now I'm gonna teach you the meaning of the word crush.\" Georgia said. Dallas was scared out of his mind, now knowing that she had a crush on him he didn't want to be the fat slobs boyfriend forever. She charged full force, but Dallas quickly rolled out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the next 20 seconds passed Dallas mustered all of his energy into dodging Georgia, soon it became clear that he was faster than her. As the timer got to 25 seconds, Dallas cheered realizing he was almost free. That is until he looked up into the stands. The Possum girls he encountered earlier dumped both of their extra large sodas right in Dallas' path. There was no time to think as Dallas slipped on the hundreds of ice cubes and fell hard onto his back. Dazed at first he suddenly remembered what he was running from as he opened his eyes then saw that his fate was sealed, above him was Georgia Spread eagle about to body slam into him. Before she collided with Dallas he thought about his cushy life in the city partying and shirking responsibility, then he remembered embracing responsibility by moving to where his cousin fights crime bravely, now he thinks about where he currently is not even a day into his job and he already has lost his freedom to his old predecessor. At least he found a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia's gut flattened Dallas immediately upon impact! The dust cleared and she looked at the timer that was stopped at 29 seconds. Georgia yelled and ground her body all over her new property. She stood up revealing Dallas flattened form across her belly button, his body was practically infused due to the sticky pop that was all over him. With one quick rip, Georgia held up her prize before shoving him into her mouth as her tongue violated him to suck all the soda off. She then pulled Dallas' body tightly through her puckered lips. As he groaned while feeling how bartered and wet he was, he then looked up into the stands and noticed the possum girls laughing, blowing kisses, and slapping their butts at him. Georgia then shoved Dallas into the back of her panties, bowed to the crowd and walked backstage. Once backstage she pulled out Dallas then set him on a table as she filled out her slave papers a man with a tattoo gun came over to Dallas and tattooed the word \"Georgia's\" on his forehead, broadcasting who he belonged to. Then Georgia grabbed him smiling at the new tattoo on his forehead. \"Alright Dallas what should we do next something romantic, or something cruel.\" Georgia said batting her eyelashes. Both terrified Dallas beyond rational thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He was very familiar with Georgia's cruelty, his cousin having told him many horror stories of her days as deputy. Even before her shady dealings came to light, the massive mare had a mean streak a mile wide. Whenever Texas wasn't there to keep her in check, Georgia would subject offenders to her own unique brand of punishment, regardless of the severity of their offense. By the time she was done, Texas would have perps stumbling into the sheriff's department flattened, reeking of horse butt, and pleading desperately to be locked up and kept away from Georgia's wrathful hand. On the other hand, he had no idea what her idea of \"romance\" constituted. For all he knew, it could've been even more detrimental to his health than her cruelty. Still, he figured it would be in his best interest to remain on her good side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-how bout something romantic?\" he stuttered softly, trying his best to come off as genuine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He let out a startled yelp as he was snatched up by his throat and held up to eye level with colossal woman. At that moment, he wasn't sure what he found more intimidating: her normal, mean spirited sneer or the hungry, lustful gaze he was receiving at that moment. He didn't have much time to think about it as he was pulled in and his lips made rough contact with hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmph?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That was the only sound Dallas could get out as he struggled to push away from his enormous captor who seemed only seemed to get more and more enraptured as her thick tongue ravaged the inside of his mouth. Just when he thought he was going to pass out from lack of oxygen Georgia pulled him away, their lips parting with a wet smack. Georgia snickered as she watched the sheriff turned slave gasped for air, a thick strand of saliva still connecting their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mm... not bad. You ain't got a lot of experience I can tell, but still pretty good\" she chuckled. Her face suddenly soured and her eyes grew cold as she pulled him back in, staring daggers into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You thought I didn't notice, did you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-notice what?\" Dallas replied, trembling in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't play dumb, lover boy. I felt you tryin' to cop a feel on me. What, did you think you could get to second base on the first kiss?You really think I'm that easy?\" she growled as her grip on Dallas tightened. It took him a minute to register what she was even talking about. In his attempts to get some distance from her during the kiss, he had unintentionally pushed his hands against her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I didn't mean to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shut it\" Georgia growled sternly. She glared at the frightened weasel for a minute, the gears in her head turning before an amused smirk crossed her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I love a man who takes what he wants~\" she tittered in a husky voice much to Dallas' surprise. She then slipped a finger into the collar of her shirt and pulled down, exposing more of her already generous cleavage. Without saying another word, Dallas was shoved face first into the deep crevice, the rest of his body following suit as she force him with her index finger. With her prize properly secured, she pulled her collar back up and gave her breasts a squeeze ,mashing Dallas' body flat into the sweaty walls of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah... you and me are gonna get along just fine...\" she chuckled before setting out.</span></div></div>",

At one point a pair of possum twins ran up to her, begging to catch a glimpse of her prize. Georgia was more than happy to endure them, digging deep ino her cleavage and pulling him out just enough to expose his sweat drenched face. The girls giggled and cooed in a taunting manner as they waved at him. Dallas wanted to tell them off for putting him in such a situation, but was unable to so much a wheeze out a response as his body was being crushed in two tins of boob flesh. Once they got their fill, they blew him a kiss and Georgia pushed Dallas back down into her cleavage and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're a real ladies man, aren't ya? Not that it matters. I'm all the woman you'll ever need~\" she chuckled, giving her breasts another squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n For the next thirty minutes, all Dallas could see, smell, and taste was Georgia's huge, sweaty breasts. He tried to part them to get some fresh air but they had little to no give despite being soft to the touch. Eventually he stopped struggling and resigned himself to his fate. As he began to wonder what Georgia had in mind for him, he felt the pressure around him ease up, allowing his crumpled, flattened form to slip out of her cleavage and onto the cold hard floor.

Glancing around he was taken aback by the sheer size of everything. It was clear to him that all of the furnishings present where built to accommodate Georgia's generous frame. The toilet bowl alone looked like it could fit ten of him with room to spare. His gaze shifted upward as something caught his eye, chilling him to the very core. On the upraised toilet lid, the phrase \"KilL me PleAsE\" was crudely sprawled onto the smooth white surface with a brown, viscous substance. The last letter trailed off, the bottom end of the 'E' leading to the inside of the toilet bowl. He shuddered to think of what happened to the poor soul that had crossed Georgia's path prior to him arriving to town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A loud clicking sound drew his attention away from the horrific sight and over to his enormous captor. She was in the process of stripping out of her tight outfit, bending over and giving Dallas a good view of her bulbous rear end as she slipped out of her pants. As she struggled to pull her leg from from one of the pant legs, her cheeks jiggled in a hypnotic display.  It took Dallas a moment to register what he was doing, quickly looking away as his face flushed with embarrassment. Despite all that the monstrous mare had done to him, he was a gentleman first and foremost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Might as well drop the modesty, handsome\" Georgia snickered as she glanced back at him. Somehow, she could feel him leering at her ass as she stripped down, watching in amusement as his face grew more and more red. Dallas began to stammer out an apology, though he petered off when Georgia gave her right cheek a firm slap, her ass quaking and wobbling from the impact. The former deputy found himself unable to look away as his cruel captor continued to tease him with her meaty flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jeez, you're acting like you've never seen a girl's ass before\" Georgia mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her words seemed to spark a new found vigor in Dallas as he sprung to his feet, jabbing his finger at her as he launched into a tirade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"T-that ain't true! I'll have you know that back home, I had a whole gallop of gals itchin' at the bit to go out with me! I couldn't go five feet outside of my house without gettin' cat called by every girl in town! I got more experience with girls than every guy in this podunk little town combined and multiplied by ten! I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His rant was cut short as Georgia reached down and pinched his lips shut. Anyone who knew Georgia knew better than to even entertain the idea of raising their voice at her. The number of those foolish enough to try could be counted on one hand... although it was rather easy to keep track of them, considering how they were all currently squashed flat and taking up space in her underwear drawer. She didn't seem to show even the slightest bit of irritation towards Dallas as she looked down at him with a knowing smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Getting awfully defensive there, lover boy. Be honest with me: have you ever actually had a girlfriend?\" she asked as she leaned in, her face mere inches from his she stared deeply into his eyes. Dallas swallowed nervously, his gaze gradually shifting away from hers as he twiddled his fingers shyly. His refusal to answer told Georgia everything she needed to know as she stood back up to her full height, Dallas' lips stretching to an obsurd length as she pulled them back and released them. His lips flew back into his face and smacked him between the eyes before slooping down and giving him the look of an anteater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can't say I'm surprised. As cute as you are, you kiss like a chasted sunday school teacher\" Georgia chuckled as she gave him a condescending pat on the head. She could see that her mockery cut him deep as his hung his head in shame. Dallas wasn't lying when he said that he attracted the attention of many women. He was a reasonably attractive young man, a little on the scrawny side but handsome enough to turn heads on occasion. His lack of success when it dealing the opposite sex came down to his bashful nature. Any time he tried to speak to a girl he liked, he would get nervous and tongue tied. He gaze was pulled back up as Georgia forcefully tilted his head so he was looking her in the eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Turn that frown upside down, little man. Today's your lucky day! You know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dallas shook his head and swallowed as he saw the lustful glint in the massive mare's eyes. Instead of leaning down again, she lifted him up by the scruff of his neck until they were face to face. Dallas shivers as she licked her lips in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're lookin' at your new girlfriend, sugar. And after we finish washing up, your girlfriend's gonna give you your first piece of real action~\" she cooed in a seductive tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dallas felt his heart stop for a moment, all of the color draining from his body as he stared at his amorous tormentor. Of all the people to for him to form and consumate a relationship with, he never would've thought, not in the a million years, that it would be Georgia. He opened his mouth to protest but was silenced as she clinched her enormous fist onto his head, her other hand grabbing at his ankles and stretching him out until his body was paper thin. In one swift motion, Georgia ripped off her top, causing her massive mammaries to quake from the motion. Humming a pleasant tune, she slung the now flattened Dallas over her shoulder and stepped into the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dallas could hear the sound of the shower head coming to life, his fur becoming drenched as Georgia stood underneath it. Without warning, he was suddenly yanked from off her shoulder and soon enough, he was being dragged along her body. Up and down, along her breasts, underneath her gut, even inside her belly button. There wasn't a single area of her body that he wasn't forced to clean. The most uncomfortable moment was when she used him to floss between her legs, introducing him to faint yet powerful musk that he quickly deduced was from her crotch. The feel of his fur, along with the intoxicating surge of power she felt from dominating his puny form caused Georgia to let out a pleasured moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There ain't nothin' better than a weasel washrag...\" she sighed happily as she rubbed Dallas' crumpled up face up and down her exposed crotch, coating his abused body with her secretions and giving him a taste of what was to come. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dallas lost track of time as his small form was continuously rubbed against Georgia's drastically larger frame. Although he was in pain, Dallas dared not to voice it, for better or worse, Georgia was now his girlfriend, and if this was her idea of something romantic, he shuddered at the thought of an angry Georgia's ideas. Wanting to stay on the large mare's good side for as long as possible, Dallas remained quiet, hoping and praying for his torment to end. For the first time in a long while, Lady Luck was on Dallas' side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dallas felt Georgia release him from her crotch, bringing his crumpled and battered body to eye level with her. While Dallas was being abused Georgia was having the time of her life, her smile and lustful eyes making it very noticeable. \"Didya have fun down there hun?\" Georgia asked the weasel, who was far too busy gasping for air to come up with a response. The massive mare giggled to herself, probably laughing at his expense Dallas thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeems like the cleaning me got you dirty yourself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say,</i> Dallas thought, not daring to speak his thoughts out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLemme help you out with that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dallas braced himself, preparing for the worst that Georgia would so, being crumpled into a ball, crushed, or maybe being straight out flattened, however it would never come. As time passed and nothing happened, Dallas dared to open his eyes and was surprised by what he saw. As Georgia was holding Dallas in one hand, her other held a bar of soap, lathering it up to a foam. Turns out she was actually going to wash him; however, as Georgia placed the soap away and brought her hand to him, Dallas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fear quickly came back, anticipating the pain that he associated with her hands. As the mare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soapy hands approached the weasel, Dallas thought, this is going to hurt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the pain never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Dallas opened his eyes, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe what was happening. No tricks, no schemes, no squashing or crushing, Georgia was genuinely washing him, her massive hands delicately washing out not only the juices from his time being a washrag, to the dirt and grime that came with being outside. To be honest, this felt...nice, and unexpected,like a massage. Dallas fully expected Georgia to harass him in some way, but it never happened. From seeing a mare as big as Georgia, and  recognizing her mean streak, one wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think she would be capable of being gentle, and for once,  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dallas was glad to be wrong. For whatever reason, he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complaining, Dallas was just glad that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t being bullied. As Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fingers massaged into the weasel, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but let out a moan, enjoying the feeling of being caressed by the horse. Georgia couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but to let out a laugh, Dallas looking up to her, embarrassment soon starting to become apparent in his face, as well as his enjoyment of Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s washing in his lower regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you thought that felt good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Georgia said, a sly grin forming on her face, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust wait until you feel this.\" Without warning, Georgia lifted Dallas higher, leaving him dangling him right above her massive breasts. Not saying a word, Georgia simply dropped Dallas in, essentially swallowing him whole. The only evidence that Dallas was even there was that his head was the only thing lodged in between her rack, facing Georgia and her smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Dallas no time to react or even adjust to his new position, Georgia began to up the ante and began to squeeze her breasts, smothering Dallas as she slowly began to move each breast up and down, massaging the overwhelmed weasel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dallas had thought before that Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s washdown felt good, now he was in absolute heaven. He was lost in the sudden display of intimacy, losing any and all notion of fear, chivalry and embarrassment as his body, and more noticeably, his fast growing erection was enveloped. He was in pure bliss, and he wanted it to last forever. Dallas had already been between Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breasts before, but that was a different experience: that time, Georgia had merely stuffed him there, not caring about the weasel's  wellbeing. As a result, the experience for Dallas had been less than great. This however, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even compare; sure, there was still pressure from being in between Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boobs, yet it was gentler, more controlled, as if Georgia wanted to feel pleasure rather than pain, not that Dallas was complaining. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d take this over her normal antics anyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That left Dallas with an interesting question, why was Georgia acting like this? Sure, he had asked her for something romantic, but he never expected her to really act on it. Apparently, Dallas hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been doing such a great job masking his confusion, as he heard Georgia let out a giggle. He looked up to find a grinning Georgia, his confusion growing more and more as she leaned in closer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd kissed him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unexpected, sudden, and actually quite nice if he was being honest. It was a quick peck, but it had the same affection that Georgia had been giving him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can be nice when I want to be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Was all that Georgia offered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just like that, the shower was over, Georgia dried up, not even using the weasel as a towel, rather letting him use hers after she finished. Granted, it was several times larger than him, but Dallas still appreciated the gesture. Afterwards, the hefty mare had told Dallas to stay in the bathroom until she said so, as she was preparing something \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial\u00e2\u0080\u009d just for Dallas. Then she simply left, purposefully swinging her hips as she leaved, leaving Dallas alone, confused, and afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At this point, Dallas would have almost preferred for her to stay mean.<i> Almost</i>. When Georgia was...well before she took a shower with him, Dallas knew what to expect with her, it was cruel and sadistic, but it was the truth. Now he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to expect from the villain, was she really showing him a side rarely shown, or was she just playing with his emotions, tricking him into dropping his guard so the next punishment would hurt even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Dally, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ready for you hun!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looks like Dallas had no more time to think, whatever was waiting out there was calling, and like it or not, he had to get out there and face it. Dallas was just hoping that he could survive it, somehow.  Dallas steadied himself, took a deep breath, and opened the door. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dallas was paralyzed as he was now face to face with her gaping snatch. It was big enough to probably swallow him if she tried hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned him forward with a finger. Timidly, Dallas walks forward and climbs on the bed, crawling overtop of Georgia's massive frame. While he was crawling through her cleavage, he was almost face to face with her, wjen his hand slipped on her still slightly damp body. His arm slid out from out of him, and his head went down. He closed his eyes expecting an accidental headbutt, only to open his eyes and find himself in an accidental liplock with the horse woman. While trying to pull away, he found himself grabbing two handfuls of her titflesh, making her moan into his mouth. Before he could break off, she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him in tighter. However, at no point did Dallas feel any pain or discomfort, she was nice and careful not to hurt him. After almost a full minute, she released his mouth with a *pop*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Dally, I can be gentle even in bed. So... do you wanna make a woman out of me or not?\" Georgia asks with lidded eyes. Dallas fought the frog in his throat to say what he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-well ma'am, you're a mighty fine lady, and it is true that you're as gentle as a kitten when you want to.\" She blushes a little at his words. \"But if you want things to work out between us, there's one thing you gotta do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you.\"</span></div></div>",

But before we can do anything, he wants me to turn myself in to you. So here I am.\" She holds out her hands to be cuffed.

One way or another she'll understand you changed your ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation Dallas pulled the mare in for a kiss, surprising her with his newfound confidence, as they finished Georgia growled, \"Damn it, if I didn't promise you I wouldn't break anything I'd rip these bars off and take you here and now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel chuckled, \"And I'd love nothing more than that, but first things first.

I experienced it first hand.

Face it Dallas, she's using you, and when she's done she'll toss your heart away with a smile, you should be thanking me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas slammed his hands on the table, startling the sheriff, \"Dammit Texas! You're not listening to me! Besides...I've already put my sausage in Georgia's buns...among other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas gagged, just the though of Georgia's rear made her sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas continued, \"Do you know why Georgia hates you? It's because when she was fired and became an outlaw and you came along, you reminded her of when she used to be clean, and she hated herself for ever going dirty in the first place. If someone like you who, pardon my rudeness, constantly gets her ass kicked day in and out can continue to be on the right side of the law, then she had no excuse. She wanted to snuff you out because you were the one thing that reminded her of her past life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas sighed, seeing his words reach his cousin. \"You know she can break those bars easily right? The only thing stopping her is a promise she made to me. I get it, you have no reason to trust her, but I beg you, cousin to cousin. Give her a chance, let her be the mare she once was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas tried to find any tells on Texas' face, but she had a solid poker face. He had no idea what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas spoke one last time, \"Just know that if you do keep Georgia here, I'm going in with her, and there's not a damn thing you can do to stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas' face was emotionless. Dallas didn't even know if she took his words seriously or not. After minutes of silence, Texas made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas steeled himself. \"Crystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grumble the sheriff reaches into her desk and pulls out a ring of keys. Without a word she steps off, motioning Dallas to follow her with a finger. As they approach the mare's cell, Georgia looked shocked that Dallas actually managed to convince his cousin to let her out. When Texas confronted Georgia, she was standing straight, giving her a deadly glance, showing no signs of weakness. Dallas guessed that with the...relationship these two had it became the norm how his cousin addressed Georgia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I make the worst decision of my life, let me say a few things. If you so much as litter in my sight, I will <i>personally</i> lock both you and my cousin so far apart you will never see each other again. If you really do \"love\" Dallas like you say you do, this should be more than enough motivation to stay straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia looked like she was about to respond to the sheriff,  but she didn't get the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet.\" Reformed or not, Dallas saw the mare's eye start to twitch. Getting the two of them to get along was going to take a looooong time. But it was going to be worth it. \"Don't think you're getting off scot-free. I want names and locations of operations going on around town. If, and only if you tell the truth, I might begin to trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas blinked, clearly she was expecting some sort of rebuttal, even a sarcastic remark. To hear Georgia comply so willingly was something new to the weasel. \"Here goes nothing.\" Texas mumbled to herself, unlocking Georgia's cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the cell clicked it's gears, Georgia burst from it, nearly trampling Texas in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Dallas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes of Dallas' life could only be described as horsey heaven. The weasel was swept into her powerful arms, tight, but tight that made it hard to breathe. Georgia took turns kissing Dallas and thanking him for setting her free, all while pressing him deeper into her breasts. In the few seconds that he wasn't smothered by his girlfriend, he saw Texas' mouth wide open, an eyebrow raised in disbelief. All he could do was give her a chuckle before being pulled toward another round of kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Dallas was put down, his entire body was covered in kisses, the poor weasel left dizzy from all the affection. Georgia took this time to speak to Texas:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it seems hard to believe, but the lil' guy reminded me of the mare I used to be. And I found myself wanting to be that mare again...the mare that Dallas deserves. You can say he weaseled his way into my heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia couldn't help but laugh at her own pun as Texas rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But please don't tell anyone about this, at least until after we clean up this place. I don't want anyone hurting him cause of me...and also I don't want anyone seeing me as soft except for Dally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas simply responded, \"As long as you keep your word I'll keep mine.\" She raised her arm for a handshake, which Georgia perhaps too eagerly went for, nearly crushing the weasel's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare grinned, \"You know, how about we just skip the small fry and go for Vivian herself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas raised an eyebrow, \"What do you mean by that Georgia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, \"What, with how long I've been working with her you don't think I have any blackmail on her? I have enough dirt to put her away forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Texas consider her options, Georgia added, \"You're the boss, so we'll go with whatever you have in mind first, of course, I'd know what I'd go for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Texas' plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Especially since she was only here because of him. He wasn't expecting a full pardon, but at least some kind of lighter sentence like house arrest or community service. He made a promise that they would be together after she turned herself in, and he planned to keep that promise, no matter what, even if he had to turn criminal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll head out then, take you up on that day off.

First things first, he needs tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonning a poncho and an oversized hat to hide his identity, he set out for Smiling Jacks' ranch house. Not even a hundred yards near the compound, he was jumped by Jacks' goons. \"Freeze partner. State your business.\" One of them orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to make a purchase from your boss. Take me to Jacks so we can talk business.\" The goons gave a confused look among themselves before they searched him for weapons and took him inside to see Jacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this I hear about a sale?\" The Jackrabbit asks the concealed deputy. He was allowed to continue hiding his identity and was led into a room with Jacks and several dozen of her gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need explosives, and I hear you're the person to talk to.\" His request was met with laughter from the rabbit gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, three things. One, if you wanted to deal with me, you need to go through the right channels first, then you talk to me. Two, even if you had done that, I'll need a little more details then that before I give a complete stranger explosives, need to make sure you don't plan to use them on me. Three, you really expect to walk in here with enough money to afford my explosives by yourself and expect to walk out alive?\" The gang share another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figure thaty purpose is enough for me to skip the line. I plan to blast a hole in the wall in the Gold Springs sheriff's department. If memory serves, you get off on pissing in the sheriff's coffee, so my plan benefits us all.\" The room fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, anything that gets under that weasel's skin is cause enough for me. I'll even give you a discount. Half off. You two, get the man what he wants.\" Two of her henchmen bring out a massive crate. When they open it up, it has all sorts of explosives, from tnt to nitroglycerin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll work.\" He pays the rabbit and loads his bag with tnt. \"In fact, if you want in on this, I could use a diversion today to get Texas out of the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done. I was planning a cattle raid anyway. Just give me an hour and that weasel will come running.\" He bids farewell to the gang and heads back to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, an hour passed and Texas rushed out of town to respond to trouble. Dallas took this chance to set his plan into motion. He rigs his explosives up to the outside of Georgia's cell wall. Everything was set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Georgia. Georgia?!\" He sees his mare lover's eyes peek out of the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dallas? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else would it be? I'm busting you out. Get as far away from the wall as possible.\" He watched as she rushed away from the window before detonating.

She kicked her horse into full speed. When she arrived, she saw a massove hole in the back wall of the building, and her cousin Dallas burried under rubble. \"Dallas!!\" She hopped off her horse and raced to his side, throwing off the couple of stones that trapped him. \"What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard a commotion outside your office. When I came to see what it was, I saw three rabbits rigging bombs on the wall. I tried to stop them, but I was too late. They blew the wall and freed Georgia. She ran for the hills without a second look at me. I'm sorry Tex, I guess I was wrong about her.\" Dallas explained as he dusted himself off and rose to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas embraced her cousin in a hug. \"I don't care about that right now. All that matters is you're safe. Are you injured?\" She gives Dallas an impromptu check-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Tex. Just a few scrapes and a bruised ego. I can't believe that she was playing me this whole time.\" Texas couldn't help but feel pity for her heartbroken deputy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Right now we have to deal with catching her again before she gets away.\" If what Dallas said was true, then Jacks' gang must've sprung Georgia while she was away, meaning the cattle raid was just a decoy. \"If she's working with Jacks, then they might be at her hideout. Then again... you've been to Georgia's hideout, right? Maybe you can tell me where.\" Dallas raises a finger to silence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I can tell you that I heard them talking about a meetup spot before they ran off, and before you say it, I'm comin' or I ain't telling you where it is. I ain't about to let that woman play with my heart and then let someone else put her away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, just tell me where we're going so we can get moving.\" Dallas internally chuckled at how easily she was buying this before he told her where they were headed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does he lead her?</span></div></div>",

With the sheriff following him he had to fight the urge to giggle. He knew what would happen next and he felt giddy with anticipation. As the oversized house came into view he slowed down. The weasels dismounted and continued on foot, not wanting to lose the element of surprise. As they got close to the house Texas took point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'll go first, you're still a bit shaken from that blast.\" She urged her deputy, but Dallas shot back an angry glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No chance, I'm getting in there and giving that bitch what she deserves!\" He whispered back loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm not having this discussion! Stay behind me!\" Texas hissed back, pushing her deputy aside and walking up to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas couldn't believe how well this was going. Some part of him should feel bad for Texas, but after the way she treated his love, she deserved everything that was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a noisy creak the sheriff pulled open the large front door, scanning the room. The place was empty, but the lit lanterns told the sheriff that someone was home. She had her revolver at the ready, carefully sneaking through the house. She checked the bathroom and found nothing. The bedroom was empty too. The weasel winced a little at the nasty stench hanging in the air. Georgia had been busy, probably tormenting some poor fool. She pitied whatever man the mare had dragged into that bed. Remembering how Dallas had fallen for the mare, the weasel shuddered to imagine it might've been him that got given some rough loving. The thought alone made her gag a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All clear. Are ya sure she's here?\" The sheriff asked in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive. Maybe she's out back in the outhouse?\" Dallas suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas smirked. A chance to catch the massive mare quite literally with her pants down. She walked out the house when a loud crack disrupted the peace. Georgia stood proudly over the floored weasel, still holding on to the pieces of the old chair she shattered on Texas' head. The triumphant horse woman quickly kicked away the sheriff's revolver. The weasel was still conscious, but the massive blow to her head had knocked all sense out of her. She was unable to do a thing as the mare reached down and grabbed her by the throat. The horse woman glared at her target with a mix of anger and glee, carrying the struggling weasel into the house and throwing her down on a chair. The sheriff hit the reinforced wood with a loud smack, still gasping for air after the mare's savage assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia laughed loudly as she turned around and let herself fall into her chair. With a loud wheeze all the air was crushed from Texas lungs as she vanished completely beneath the mare's prodigious rear. Any guilt Dallas might've felt watching Texas get demolished was nullified when he saw the mare's pleased smile. If the woman he loved so madly was happy, then he was happy too. Texas could've avoided all of this, but she chose to imprison his love. And now she would feel the overwhelming strength of their bond first hand. The mare looked at her lover's sullen, enamored stare and laughed.</span></div></div>",

He then gave Georgia a smack on the rear, sending ripples down to the trapped sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally regaining awareness, Texas began to squirm and struggle against Georgia's fat butt. She heard what sounded like Dallas rushing Georgia, in what she thought was a desperate attempt to save her from this gassy fate.

It made her feel faint, too weak to react as the huge glutes crushed and squeezed her. She felt herself being carried along between the mare's massive cheeks. Georgia held her lover in her arms and took him to the bedroom. They kept kissing along the way and soon they reached the bedroom. The mare had already dropped off her pants in the living room and quickly shed her remaining clothes. Dallas too was quick to strip bare and follow her onto the oversized reinforced bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia pulled the enormous blanket up, covering everything below her midsection. \"Check this out.\" She said, snorting a little as she released a mighty trumpeting fart. Muffled gagging came from under the covers as Texas fought with everything she had to just stay conscious. The thick blanket kept all of Georgia's stench contained, polluting every breath the weasel took. With a devious grin the mare looked at her lover, who shuffled downwards a bit until he too was covered up to his torso. Dallas grunted a little and after some pushing let out a nasty big fart himself. He looked up at his love with a nervous smile. Georgia quickly grabbed hold of him and hugged him close to her chest. She then poked her large head under the covers to smell the result of his efforts. Compared to the rancid, gassy hell she'd unleashed it was a paltry effort, but she complimented him all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, you got a bit of spice in you, brave little weasel. Good thing nobody important is struggling for their lives in the blast zone, right?\" She said, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she blew another massive fart right in Texas' face. The only thing that excited Georgia more than the weasel pathetically squirming between her cheeks was the one wiggling in her arms. She smothered Dallas' face in kisses and soon Texas' fetid prison was provided with a background track featuring the ongoing slurping of the two lovers intimately kissing. The sheriff felt angry, betrayed by her own deputy and led straight into this nightmare. But against the mare's overwhelming strength there was nothing she could do but hope that the two would eventually tire of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas too began to wonder if the sheriff would get in the way of his plan to make love to the massive mare. When he voiced his concerns her sultry smile grew tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Dally. Ol' Texas has me feeling all kinds of wet and excited. Let's make this house quake with our love. But first we oughta deal with her.\" The mare sneers as she turns her attention to the sheriff wedged between her buttcheeks.</span></div></div>",

Dallas is still feeling a bit antsy and apologizes to the mare before slipping out of bed to tie up the sheriff. He didn't want anything to interrupt what was about to come. The unconscious weasel was secured to the sturdy chair and before long Dallas turned his attention back to his love. She awaited him with open arms and he leapt right into her soft embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelming couldn't begin to describe how it felt for the weasel. He was no taller than Texas and the massive mare would take full advantage of his slim frame. Her smothering hug wedged his head between her large breasts. She was in complete control, cuddling her lover intensely. They both knew this was but a precursor for everything still to come. Whenever Dallas could shoot a glance from the soft embrace of Georgia's rack he used it to look into her eyes lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You best buckle up, partner. 'Cause this horse is about to take you on a ride.\" She said seductively as she began to drag her lover down along her belly and between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the weasel squirm down there gave Georgia flashbacks of the time she tormented Texas like this. She had to fight the urge to squeeze her thighs together and squish Dallas flat like she'd done with the sheriff. She was about to ask if he's loving this as much as she was when she felt something prod against her belly. The weasel was rock hard and the massive mare smiled. He was trying to maneuver himself into position, but Georgia had him covered. Her large hand reached down and grabbed him by his butt, dragging him deeper between those enormous thighs until his throbbing prick was met by the wet embrace of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a low grunt she shoved his manhood inside of herself, taking the full length like it was nothing. The diminutive weasel felt big for his size, but it was still like throwing a sausage down a train tunnel. Georgia was not deterred by any of this and began to slide her lover back and forth, plunging him into her marehood over and over again. Dallas held on for dear life as his lover took charge. Her free hand grabbed his head and pressed it firmly into her soft belly whilst she smothered everything below his torso between her gigantic thighs. The pressure was bearable, but he still felt a bit nervous. She was treating him almost like a toy, not letting him do anything by himself. With a steady rhythm she drove his member into her depths, sliding him in up to the hilt every single time. He feared a woman of her large stature wouldn't be pleased, but the lewd moans said otherwise. Her pussy was soaking wet, slathering the lower half of his body in musky feminine juices. He eventually just stopped thinking about it and enjoyed the moment, letting the mare have her way with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe windows rattled as Georgia moaned loudly, flooding her lover's groin with warm juices. He reached his orgasm too, but with his face buried in her soft belly his moans didn't get as far. His spurts were lost in the surge of feminine slime washing over his lower half. For a solid minute the two lie motionless, basking in the glow of an act neither of them thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be damned, Dally. You're the first guy of your... stature that managed that.\" She said, blushing a little at the mess she'd made on her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I aim... to please...\" He says, panting from the intense action. \"...and you... make it... easy...\" He was almost ready to join Texas in unconsciousness, but mercifully the mare was content to let him catch his breath. She used the time to think of what she wanted from her lover next.</span></div></div>",

She rolled onto her back and let Dallas slip between their jiggling mass a little as his face got into kissing range. He could see this coming a mile away and puckered up, closing his eyes. The massive mare cooed a little, licking her lips and bringing them close. Her warm breath hit him moments before she pulled him into a lengthy, passionate kiss. Their tongues danced around one another, both lovers moaning a little. The mare could feel the fire in her loins still raging brightly. She knew the feeling was mutual as she felt the subtle prodding of his erection against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me have a taste, Dally.\" She cooed with a smile as she dragged him further up. He just smiled and laughed, scarcely able to believe his luck. His comments devolved into moans as those thick horse lips wrapped around his manhood, slurping up its full length in an instant. He held on to her head for all the good it did, gasping and moaning at the unbelievable sensation. Her thick tongue played with the throbbing length, squeezing it with surprising strength before lapping up and down to cover it in warm saliva. Against such stimulation he couldn't last long and with a haggard whine he shot his load all over the slithering tongue. Georgia looked up to stare him in the eye as she murred with delight and swallowed it all. She didn't need to say another word. He knew what she wanted next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Dallas, would you be so kind as to return the favor?\" The massive mare asked with a sly smile. She already felt him wriggling on top of her, desperate to turn around. \"Such enthusiasm.\" She said with a lewd voice. With little patience she grabbed her lover by his sides and span him around, parting her legs to give him a brief glimpse of what was to come. The smell of her arousal was potent enough to make his eyes water a little, but the treasure trove of feminine juices awaited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would not let his lover down and with a bit of her help he scrambled along her body until his head loomed over her soaking wet pussy. He leaned in and gently dragged his tongue across the slick surface. It tasted odd, but hearing the mare's shocked, pleasured gasp was completely worth it. He managed a few more calm licks before the mare's hands took hold of the weasel's head. He felt her grip intensify as Georgia did what she always did, use her brute strength to get what she wants. He was pushed face first into those soft folds, his tongue reaching deeper than he thought possible. Her first climax had left much to clean up, but she wanted him to go straight for the sweet spot. The juices he lapped up from between her moist labia somehow tasted even better, making him eagerly lap up every last drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia could barely believe what she was feeling. The only thing she wanted right now was more. Simply more of what was happening. She kept her lover's head firmly down and pushed harder and harder, rubbing her crotch onto his face just to try and get him that little bit further inbetween her moist folds. As she felt him probing the entrance to her love tunnel she whinnied with unparalleled pleasure. But even seeing half his face sunken into her pussy was not enough. She needed more, she had to have more. Without another thought she kept pushing on the back of his head, indifferent about his ability to breathe with his whole muzzle pushed into her nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas felt the wet walls around him part and with a noisy squelch he was suddenly surrounded in slimy warmth. Had his needy girlfriend really just managed this? His whole head, lodged into her pussy. It sounded like a fever dream, but with a lover as intense and big as Georgia, it was all too real. He knew his stay would be short, she sounded like she was on the very edge already. One last lick sent shockwaves through the warm cavern. She felt her inner walls squeeze all around his head, desperate to keep him in for just another second, but he could sense the impending climax rising up from her depths, closing his eyes and waiting for the rush of hot fluids. His ears were covered by her moist snatch, but he could hear her moan loudly. Everything around him shook as she bucked and cried out in unrestrained bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA torrent of feminine release crashed into Dallas, soaking his face and pushing up into his mouth. As much as his lover tried to keep his head pushed into her snatch, the surges of pleasure wracking Georgia's body made her strength waver and finally she released him. With a loud splurt his head was ejected from her love tunnel, utterly drenched in her innermost love juices. He simply rolled his head to its side and rested it on the still dribbling folds of her pussy, too exhausted to do anything but gasp for air. Neither of them knew how close she'd gotten to drowning him in her love, but they both knew that they wanted to do this more often. For now though, they were spent. After several minutes of heavy breathing the massive mare finally dragged her lover back towards her and held him snugly in a tight embrace. He wrapped his arms around as much of her as he could reach and the pair calmly drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Georgia is the first to wake up, looking down at Dallas amorously. She stifled a laugh as she felt the side of his head having been glued to her breasts by the slimy release from last night. With some effort she peels him off herself, waking him up in the process. It would be a night to remember, but for now they had more pressing things to worry about. Firstly, they cleaned themselves up a bit to remove the evidence from last night's adventure. But when that was all done they began to think of the future. For starters, what to do with Texas?</span></div></div>",

We could throw out half the bathroom with her around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else you got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option two, I throw her out back with my horse in his stable.

How about instead of going through all the 'joy' of childbirth, we just 'adopt'?\" She says with massive air quotes while hinting at the sheriff. \"There's a woman that lives in a wagon a couple miles out from Gold Springs who's supposed to be a master hypnotist. We could bring Texas to her and have her turn our little problem into our little bundle of joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really want that Georgia?

After that she kneeled down for a moment to let him stand on his own feet. With a mischievous smirk she peered over her shoulder at the sheriff. Texas sat bound to the back of the bedroom chair. But before that weasel would be thrown to Georgia's horse, the mare herself wanted a last little go at her. She menacingly wiggled her butt and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood creaked as it was filled with several tons of equine ass, the smelly cheeks squashing Texas and slipping her into a deep and horrid asscrack. With a huge grin on her face Georgia opened up the barrage, letting fart after fart pelt the weasel in her face. All that pent up stink poured over the weasel until the mare felt empty. Dallas used the time to cook them some breakfast. He'd already finished his portion by the time his lover emerged from the bedroom, holding Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you tie her up good, please? I don't want her hurting my horse. Strip her too, while you're at it. Don't need ma horse to get bellyaches from nibbling on her dirty clothes.\" She held out the sheriff before unceremoniously dumping her on the floor. Dallas nodded and grabbed some rope to get to work whilst the massive mare admired his cooking skills. In mere minutes all the remaining food he had cooked was gone and with a satisfied belch Georgia walked over to see her lover's handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll do fine, Dally. Now let's get this over with.\" She said as she grabbed the bound and now naked weasel off the floor and walked over to the stable. Georgia's horse was a reflection of herself. A large stallion with a fiery temper that only she herself could keep at bay. It was happy to see its master and even more delighted when the sheriff was thrown into his pen. Georgia petted her fierce steed for a while, cooing gentle reassurances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Momma won't forget about you. See? There's a nice weasel there for you to play with. Have fun.\" The stallion looked over Texas, seeming almost contemplative for a bit, as if he was thinking of all the things he might do with her. With a final round of petting Georgia went back into the house. Texas was still out cold, but that wasn't going to stop Georgia's horse from having some fun.</span></div></div>",

Many a night Georgia would come home furious at Texas, hooting and hollering about how she should be the Sheriff. Eventually it would end the same way. She would let her stallion mount her just to drive the thought of Texas from her mind. As of late, though, Georgia had found a new plaything. It had been so long since he mounted his master that it hurt to walk around. So pent up and without release the stallion had grown balls the size of watermelons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at Texas, the stallion blamed her for not having his master\u2019s touch. But now he was blessed to have a new plaything for the night. The reason for all his problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding above Texas, his fat belly swung low as he positioned himself. Muscle and fat flexed and swayed above the unfortunate sherif. His rod slowly emerged from it home, quivering in excitement. Just standing over her his flat tip prided against her slit. Only halfway out and already a foot and a half of meat pressed agaist her. Thick ropes of pre completely coating her raised rump. Texas started to stir from the attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacedown in the dirt, ass high in the air, Texas barely had time to open her mouth before the stallion bucked forward. The flat tip forced its way into her almost tearing her in two. A deafining howl broke the air. Screaming out in pain and terror Texas had nowhere to go. Trying to get away she inched her way forward, but to no avail. Tons of horse belly came crashing down on top of her. Both flattening and pushing farther in, the stallion whinnied triumphantly. Under the beast\u2019s belly the fat complexly covered Texas\u2019s upper body, creating a seal from the weight and size of the belly. Her muffled protests couldn\u2019t be heard as the stallion slowly rutted away at this trapped prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He snorted and huffed as he felt her stretching out to accommodate his proud manhood. the unreasonably thick shaft was buried halfway at most, but already it felt like the tip was poking around inside the weasel's chest. No problem for the eager horse, who steadily kept thrusting his hips, driving his powerful erection in ever deeper. His belly was a great help in keeping that pesky weasel pinned. Its coarse fur rubbed against her back as it shook with each painful thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ropes binding Texas were making it hard for the massive stallion to push deeper. But if he had the strength to endure Georgia as a rider, the poor weasel didn't stand a chance. Brute force would see him through and he kept pounding until he would feel that smooth weasel cover the full length. The thought alone made his cock throb with lust as it was forcibly packed into a pussy twenty sizes too small and stretched beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel had no chance to fight her way out of this. She could only lie there, tied up and abused by the enormous horse. The only thing that surprised her was that Georgia wasn't here right now to watch her suffer. Was her bond with Dallas really so strong that even this spectacle couldn't draw her attention? What in the world did he even see in her?! Even with the massive member shoved into her the sheriff shivered at the thought of what those two might be doing with eachother that would keep them preoccupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horny stallion felt his swollen balls ache with need and even though he hadn't gone as deep as he wanted there was nothing left to stop him. His willpower couldn't persist any longer and with a loud whinny he reached a legendary climax. A firehose would be jealous of the sheer ferocity with which he filled up the weasel with his piping hot seed. As more than a week's worth of pent up desire was pumped into the weasel her belly stretched and warped comically against the tight bindings. It almost seemed like the ropes holding the weasel down would snap from the pressure of her expanding belly. But thankfully Georgia had used a sturdy rope to tie the sheriff up. By the time he was finished his cock had slimmed down substantially, although still more than thick enough to stretch the weasel, and small dribbles of cum leaked from her mouth and pussy. The intense fucking had left the weasel teetering on the brink of unconsciousness. Gloria's steed gladly helped her with the final stretch, sitting down on his new toy's head and farting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Texas woke up to find her swollen belly gone and the crude rope replaced with an even tighter leather harness. Standing just outside the pen was Georgia, admiring her handiwork. \"You two had so much fun yesterday that I've decided you're his new toy. I hope you liked it too, because he's one needy big bastard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive mare let out a sharp whistle and her steed came trotting in, looking down happily at his new plaything. He already felt a fire building in his loins. Before Texas even had a chance to react his manhood was dangling in her face. The pudgy stallion rested his immense gut on top of the bound weasel, feeling himself get erect and working on the most important decision of his equine life: What hole on his new toy should he fuck today? Georgia smiled as she left her happy steed with his new toy, her mind wandering to her own 'toy' weasel.</span></div></div>",

The hot flesh throbbed with excitement as it rose up into a terrifying erection, pushing the weasel's butt high up in the air. She knew what it felt like squeezed into her body and she dreaded what was about to happen. But the bindings had her completely locked down. She couldn't move a muscle. When the heavy gut finally dragged itself off of her she felt the swollen tip press up against her ass. The warmth against her pucker sent an shiver down her spine, making the bound weasel moan softly. The stallion's ears perked up. If she was enjoying this too, how could he possibly deny her what she was looking for? He stepped forward a little, arching his back and increasing the pressure on Texas' asshole a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the flared head of his immense equine boner push on her butt, yearning for entry. With a drawn-out squelch the stallion slid himself in, pushing the wide tip to stretch open her backdoor. The stallion's breathing went heavy as he lined himself up. The weasel's head was still squashed under his belly, but the rest of her was ready to receive him. He whinnied loudly as he thrusted his hips forward, making his toy gasp loudly. Half his shaft had been taken in and more was eagerly waiting her warm embrace. The weasel's head was pulled free to allow the horse to penetrate deeper and her ragged breathing only made him more eager to fuck her. Every thrust visibly stretched her out, the throbbing spire pushing aside her innards to sink deeper into his toy. The weasel could barely breathe, partly due to her squished body and certainly also the shock of feeling something this big shoved into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion was insatiable, pushing ever deeper into the weasel's ass. His balls weren't as painfully swollen as before, but they held more than enough to fill this toy to the brim. But as delightful as that sounded, the stallion had even worse in mind. He wanted to prove the might of his manhood and to do so in a most humiliating way for his toy. To start he simply kept thrusting. Texas' butt seemed bottomless as it stretched wider to accommodate the massive shaft. With a large part of his member crammed into her depths the stallion moved to some haybales. They provided the raised platform he needed to take this fucking to the next level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas gasped and groaned as she felt the thick, flared head push up through her throat. She had no idea how the beast was doing this, but his lengthy shaft had traveled all the way through her intestines. Her last sputters were silenced as he pushed up further, the thick mass stretching wide the weasel's neck and pushing open her jaws. The foul taste polluted the former sheriff's tongue as the warmth of the horse's shaft filled her mouth. Pre was already flowing richly, lubricating the long journey through the weasel. With a final thrust the flared head broke free, poking out of Texas' mouth as she could do nothing but cry at the humiliation she endured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense shaft throbbed wildly as the stallion could no longer hold back. Thick ropes of cum raced through the whimpering weasel and splattered against the stable wall. Every spurt could be felt surging through his manhood, making Texas feel even more abused. She was nothing more than a cockwarmer to him, unfit to even carry his seed. Eventually the torrent of cum stopped and finally as the huge erection wilted the weasel began to slide free. Through dulled eyes she looked up at the floppy length, cum still dripping from the flared head. This was her fate now, a toy for that fearsome stallion to use and abuse as he saw fit for the rest of her days.</span></div></div>",

She grabbed a glass of water from the kitchen and brought it to her bedroom, where Dallas lay unconscious. She lightly shook his shoulder to wake him. He began to stir and smiled as he saw the blurry form of Georgia standing over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there my little trooper. You okay?\" She asks him, concerned. Last night, while Texas was being ridden senseless by Georgia's mount, Dallas had a similar experience. He had offered to let Georgia be on top this time, despite multiple protests from the mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reluctantly agreed and mounted him. For the several minus Dallas' legs were nearly broken by each of Georgia's thrusts with how much weight came with them. He was simultaneously being smothered by Georgia's sweaty gut. The combination left him on the brink of collapse near the end. Then, with his last bit of consciousness, he came into Georgia's snatch, with her coating his entire lower half once again. He passed out immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia took that time to check on Texas. After laughing at her unconscious form and pregnant-looking belly, as well as the gallons of cum that leaked out of her, she decided to make some changes. She rebound Texas with stronger stuff and left her in a good position for her horse to mount her easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDallas took the water and took a big gulp of it before speaking. \"I'm fine. It was just a bit more than I expected.\" She chuckled at his false bravado. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe next time when you are told that a weasel being mounted by a horse ten times his size is a bad idea, you'll listen to said horse.\" The two share a laugh at her scolding him like a married couple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is she?\" Dallas asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that my poor boy had his own 'fun' last night, so I made that her new job.

She walked with the terrified weasel in her fist who was trembling like a leaf. \"Yep any hope you had for a romantic getaway between me and you when out the the window when I slammed into that wall.\" She said balling up Dallas and shoving him into her bra. He rode between the fleshy orbs as she walked back to her house at the edge of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia opened up her underwear drawer taking out a parachute sized pair of panties. She removed Dallas from her cleavage then threw the undergarments right in front of him. He looked at the clothing in front of him and saw all sorts of colorful weasels frolicking in a detailed green meadow that made up the inner butt part. They all were close together but he noticed a huge gap right in the bottom center part. Georgia slammed down her fat index finger right on the open space and said \"I was saving that spot for Texas but I think her cousin will do just fine.\" Dallas tried to run but she was too quick for him as she slammed her fist down turning him into an accordion version of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia then reached into a drawer and pulled out a muzzle and a mason jar filled with a clear liquid material. She grabbed Dallas and inflated back into his original form, put the muzzle on his mouth and nose, and stripped off his clothes. She then dunked him into the jar coating him in the thick clear material. Georgia then set him down and removed the muzzle. \"Sticky isn't it, that little chemical on you is a glue substance known as the Forever Stick, and it does what it says. But only if a little heat is provided!\" She said ramming a hot iron on Dallas's legs. She lifted the iron after a few minutes his legs were so flattened they practically looked like part of the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia went to town flattening the rest of his body except for his nose and mouth which aren't covered in the Forever Stick. She lifted her masterpiece, his body was so flattened and stuck from the experience that his pupils couldn't even move. The only indication that he was alive was his nose and mouth that were hyperventilating. \"Welcome to my underwear drawer.\" She said sliding on Dallas acquainting him with the smell and taste he'd endure for the rest of his life. Georgia giggled then gave herself a wedgie walking out into the world with her new favorite pair of underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple of days Georgia wore Dallas everyday in the hot and sweaty days to follow. Eventually she came back with Smiling Jacks as her prisoner. Noticing her return, Georgia tried to rob a bank sloppily in hopes that the sheriff would catch her, and indeed she did. During the inspection of her belongings she found the weasel underwear. Then noticed the prominent male weasel that was her cousin, but Texas' logical mind believed that no living thing could stay flattened for that long by itself then had the underwear sent to Georgia at the town prison. Georgia was so happy as she rocked back and forth on Dallas, it seemed as though that this giant horse butt was what his life would consist of.</span></div></div>",

He turned around once to look and Georgia lunged forward with a bear hug trying to squash him. Luckily he ducked a the last second avoiding her massive girth by a centimeter. She crashed hard on the ground, growled, then got back up and continued the chase. As things continued, Dallas was about out of gas slowing down again and again after each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Dallas was pooped and fell onto a wall leaning against it tired beyond belief. Georgia didn't skip a beat after seeing this. She slammed her giant butt cheeks into the wall grinding them back and forth. Dallas was creamed instantly as the smelly globes flattened him into paste. \"Ha ha! You lose sucker, guess that means your my new sl- hey, what the heck?!\" Georgia said looking up at the screen showing a replay of her butt colliding with Dallas directly at the 31 second mark. \"Ooooo tough break Georgia! But rules are rules, this terribly unlucky man will not be able to serve under you for the rest of his life.\" The announcer said overhead. Dallas couldn't believe his luck, sure he was still currently a misshapen blob in a horse lady's butt crack, but at least he wouldn't have to do crap like this forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Georgia said angry. Her insides rumbled as she let loose a massive fart that shot Dallas into the sky. He came down hard into the center of the arena. Dallas was currently a paste like mess twitching and groaning, until his body formed back into it's original shape. He saw a shadow loom over him and turned around to see Georgia. \"Well we still live in the same town, maybe we could get together sometime.\" Georgia said picking him up by his shirt collar. \"I don't think s-\" He tried to say before Georgia shoved him into a kiss with lots of tongue. \"It wasn't an offer.\" She said pulling away and dropping him into the dirt. All he could taste was Georgia, Dallas scrubbed his tongue frantically but it seemed that her taste will be with him for a while, well it was time to move on to other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He was a gecko with an orange and white color scheme, although he tried to deter people away from his bright colors by wearing a black and white suit, matching pair of boots and solid black hat. Recently Percy had been in trouble with Texas for butting in on her investigations. If you asked Texas she would say that she had the town under control, but all Percy saw was the articles in the paper about her being scrapped off pavement or being a temporary tattoo for a fat criminal. He felt that he could do some good by stepping up and fighting crime, but Texas disagrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon April walked up to Percy's cell with a a set of keys. \"Ok Scales, you're free to go. You're gun is on the table by the door. \"Is Tex away?\" He said wondering why the deputy was letting him out. \"Yeah she got a tip that Roxxie was on the outskirts of town and went out there this morning, sadly Roxxie brought her back jiggling on her butt. She scrapped her butt across the steps of town hall leaving Tex as a crumpled up mess while she hopped off laughing. So she's at the doctor's office right now getting inflated back to normal, he said if Roxxie sat down just one more time, Tex would have been a backside tattoo forever. So her recovery might be a while.\" April explained. \"Yeah? What else is new.\" Percy said grabbing his gun about to leave. \"Smiling Jacks is, I got reports of her and her gang harassing a farm north of here. I want to chase down Roxxie before she leaves town, but I need to stop Smiling Jacks from hurting those farmers.\" She said feeling overwhelmed by criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I can help, you take one and I'll take the other.\" Percy said wanting to prove himself. \"I don't know Tex doesn't like you messing up our way of doing things.\" April said doubting him. \"We'll worry about Tex when she's 3D again, come on April what do ya say?\" He pleaded. \"Alright since I've got my hands full I'll let you help, but don't tell Tex.\" April said. Percy smiled and answered back \"I won't, I'll go after...\"</span></div></div>",

She's pretty aggressive and hard to find.\" April said. \"Don't worry I can handle her.\" Percy said smirking, holstering his gun, and walking out of the sheriff's office with a chip on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding Roxxie would normally be difficult, but Percy knew something that the sheriff didn't. Every time Percy attacked a criminal he would interrogate them thoroughly. About two days ago he came across a toad bandit with a vendetta against Texas, who worked with Roxxie and Smiling Jacks to trap the sheriff in the past. During the interrogation he told Percy about a cave well hidden in the mountains that Roxxie hides out in after attacking Tex. He even drew up a crude map on how to get there, which is what Percy was planning to use. It was about a half a day's journey which means he would arrive with Roxxie arrested just in time for Texas to see his success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy saddled up his horse and began his journey up north. Along the way he noticed humongous hoof prints in the dirt easily his size, meaning only one thing... Butterscotch, Roxxie's horse. He rode on until he arrived at a field of sunflowers at the bottom of a mountain range. In the field it looks like a great deal of them had been matted down. He investigated it only to find an enormous butt print with a small quivering coin of a man pressed right where the left cheek would have landed. Percy walked over to the man who's face was concealed by a red bandana implying that he was a mugger. Percy pulled down the bandana revealing a crushed raccoon guy groaning. \"What happened here?\" Percy asked. \"Ugh I was gonna try to rob some fat kangaroo lady, then I remember her jumping high in the air, then darkness, her rump was on me so long! I haven't reformed in like a day! What does this mean?! Is this.. ya know, the new me!\" The raccoon man said scared. \"It means you got what you deserve thief.\" Percy said riding off as the raccoon man cried at his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy searched the mountains up and down for Roxxie's hideout. At some point he felt as thought the toad man had lied to him, but as soon a night came he noticed the small glow of a campfire in the distance. He sneaked over to it and made a startling discovery. Sitting on the dirt stirring a vat of chili was Roxxie Roo. Percy thanked God as his ticket to the respect he deserved was within his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about his strategy, Percy concluded that being sneaky and knocking her out would be the safest way to apprehend her, but it was also the slowest and he had already spent too much time searching the mountains. Throwing caution to the wind Percy carefully slid down the mountain. He picked up speed towards the kangaroo and jumped off about 20 feet away from her. Roxxie turned around just in time for Percy's booted feet to smash into her face. This caught her off guard causing her to fall on her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy quickly pointed his gun at her. She looked up with a small dribble of blood coming out of her nostril, and an annoyed look on her face. She was about to charge him but then stopped as he cocked his revolver. \"Easy does it Roxxie, I know your not bulletproof.\" He said. \"Ouch... who are you?!\" She screamed as her nose throbbed. \"My name is Percy Scales, you'll find that I dispense justice a little bit differently than Texas. Now you're going to slap these cuffs on and come with me to the sheriff's office.\" He said throwing a pair of handcuffs towards her. \"Well you're certainly more direct than Tex, but I'm curious, how did you find me?\" She asked. \"Let's just say I know a lot about you.\" Percy said acting coy. \"Oh so you'd know about my horse Butterscotch then? Specifically that her butt is bigger than 10 of you?\" She said smiling. Percy was confused at her questions but as soon as he put two and two together he looked up at the mountain he slid down earlier just in time to see two enormous globes cream into him flattening him instantly. The horse behind slid across the mud shoving Percy up her crack ramming him into her anus. Butterscotch stopped about a foot away from Roxxie who was grinning wildly. Butterscotch then lifted up her tail and let out a huge burst of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPPPPPPBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFfffffftttt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the horrid burst of air escaped her bowels Percy was hit point blank with the stench that entered into his mouth and nostrils. On the outside a crushed ball of metal shot from under her bottom. Roxxie walked over to it then realized that it was Percy's gun squished into oblivion. She kicked it into the fire making sure he couldn't use it at all. Roxxie then looked at Butterscotch who was enjoying grinding her butt all over Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The diminutive lawman was deposited onto the ground with a wait \"splat\", his body slightly crumbled and soaking in horse sweat. He barely had a minute to adjust himself before Roxxie's massive foot came down onto his body, his legs and torso being squashed flat beneath her great weight. He yelped in pained and looked up at the towering kangaroo, a nervous sweat trailing down his cheek. This certainly wasn't going how he envisioned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly know how to make a memorable first impression, Percy. You might've actually gotten the better of me had I not had some company\" She said with in a tone that was much more friendly than Percy was expecting. \"It's a damn shame. If only you had targeted another big time crook. You could've gone down as one of the most famous lawmen in the wild west! Oh well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her friendly smile turned into a wicked scowl as she raised her foot and hovered it over Percy's head. The once fearless vigilante let out a frightened gasp and attempted to flee, only to find himself unable to so much as budge due to flattened legs being cemented to the ground. Roxxie took a moment to let his desperation grow before bringing her massive foot down and bringing his pitiful struggles to an abrupt halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SQUELCH!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Roxxie pressed her foot down as her as he could, leaving a slight grove in the stone floor as she ground his helpless body into the dirt as though she were putting out a cigerette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, a lot of people like to make assumptions about me just because of my chosen profession. They think that I'm some kinda hardass. That couldn't be farther from the truth. The thing is Percy, no matter how much of a thug I can be, I'm still a woman. And women are dainty and easy to hurt\" she explained as she leaned down. Had anyone walked in, they would assume that she was talking to her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are certain things you just don't do to a woman, Percy. Certain things like, I don't know, kicking one in the face\" She said before lifting her foot off the ground. Percy had been returned to a stain against her sole, his eyes dazed and looking in different directions. Roxxie chuckled at his predicament and peeled his pathetic body off before holding him in her palm. The flattened lizard looked up at the towering crook, his body trembling at the sinister smile that she was casting at him. His mind went back to the helpless raccoon he had left to dry and how he his body hadn't reformed in a day. He could only imagine what shape he'd be left in once Roxxie was done with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've hurt my feelings, Mr. Scales, and now you're gonna start making it up to me... <b><i>for the rest of your life</i></b>\" she snickered before closing her thick fingers around his body, encasing him in darkness. She hadn't expected to acquire a new plaything when she woke up in the morning, but she certainly wasn't complaining. The only question on her mind was what to do with the wannabe sheriff.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't ask you to go off and butt heads with top tier criminals\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What, you think I can't handle myself?\" Percy asked defensively as he folded his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lool, Percy... I'm not saying you're not capable, but I know how you like to operate. You like to go in head first, guns a blazing, rules be damned, and that's not what I need at the moment. Smiling Jack's got the numbers game and Roxxie has a track record of trouncing people who try to take her head on. Unless you want to end up a little green smear on a kangaroo's butt, you're gonna have to do things my way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy sighed and rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, fine. I'll play along for now, I guess\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good. Now I'm gonna go deal with Smiling Jack. Knowing Roxxie, she'll probably take her sweet time leaving town now that she's taken out Texas, so I can put that off for now. I want you to patrol the town while I'm gone and make sure that everything stays nice and orderly. Can you do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait, so basically I'm just an overglorified housesitter!?\" Percy cried angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course not! It's more like... townsitting\" April said with a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Unbelievable...\" Percy fumed as he looked away in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on Percy, this is important! Without a deputy to keep the peace, this place'll fall apart! You're helping me out more than you could possibly know!\" She said as she gave him a reassuring patting on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whatever you say, boss...\" Percy mumbled irritibly as looked away from her. It was bad enough that he had to forgo his usual methods of dispensing justice, that he had to abide by the very system drove him into being a vigilante in the first place, but he wasn't even allowed to get into the fray.The only solace he found in all of this was that he'd be able to say \"I told you so\" should anything to wrong on April's watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She began to list off a number of rules and regulations, though Percy was in no mood to listen as he walked out the station with his hand resting on his holster and the brim or his hat hanging over his eyes. He treaded through the town with chest puffed out and a toothpick hanging from the side of his mouth, trying his damned hardest to look intimidating. If he was going to act as deputy, it was only fitting that the towns people recognize him as a person of stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Several hours pass. Aside from the occasional loiterer or noise compaint, nothing much happened for the newly crowded deputy. He sat on the front steps of the sheriff's office with his head in his hands as his tail drew lines in the sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"'It'll fall apart', she said... bullcrap. All this time spent babysitting the town that I coulda spent kicking Roxxie's head in...\" He muttered under his breath. Just when it seemed as though he would drop dead from boredom something caught his attention. It was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was some commotion at the local dress shop. There were loud noises and crashes that sounded like glass shattering. Percy sighed, a local debacle at the town dress shop wasn't his idea of excitement, but nothing else was going on so he made his way over to the screaming match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry ma'am I can't mark this dress down any lower! The materials were hard to find and it's comprised of so much fabric.\" A small toad man said trying to negotiate with his unruly customer. Standing before him was an enormous pig lady fuming. She was wearing a pair of jean shorts turned panties as it hardly covered a fourth of her huge rump. She wore a red flannel shirt tied in a knot that hardly concealed her bra less beach ball sized breasts, it also showed off her prominent pot belly. She had black hair tied off into ponytails. And last but not least her cute yet chubby face was angry and as she was breathing heavily it showed the gap in her front teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'so much material' you tryna say something about my weight?!\" She said stomping down on the front desk flattening it beneath her barefeet. \"No, please stop breaking my things.\" The toad man said backing up into a corner. \"Now you're bossing me around?! You're cruising for a bruising buddy! Look my brother is gettin' married in a week, and I'm gonna have a dress to show off to all my snobby relatives! You can either be a nice guy or a pancake! What's it gonna be warty?!\" She said backing him further into a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy walked into the shop noticing all the crushed furniture and broken glass. He then saw the pig girl before him recognizing her immediately. Her name was Peggy Pork, the only girl in a household of four brothers with a pension for vandalizing and civil disorderliness. Every other day she was causing some ruckus about the simplest of things. Normally Texas can get her to calm down because of her father's respect for law enforcement, but he has a great distaste of vigilantes, in fact he's the reason why there's not a whole lot of them left, he was the sheriff before Texas and ran them out. Meaning that Peggy probably won't take too kindly to being ordered around by a vigilante outlaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here goes.\" Percy said pulling his pistol. \"Hey fatty you need to stop!\" He said not bothering with manners. Peggy looked over her shoulder even more angry and saw Percy, when she saw he had no badge or any indication that he was a law enforcement official she huffed. \"You need to mind your own business before you get hurt lizard boy!\" She said not caring about him at all. Percy grunted as he was written off as he started to walk towards her. She was so fat he thought as he approached her noticing that her butt cheeks were taller than he was. \"Listen up you blimp! I-\" PPPPPBBBBBBRRRRRTTtt.... Percy tried to say before an Earth shattering fart from Peggy hit him in the face and knocked him unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I thought he'd never shut up.\" Peggy said picking up his pistol crumpled it up into a ball then threw it through a window, destroying more glass. \"Now back to you! If you're going to be a jerk I'm just gonna have to use The Five Toe Discount.\" She said rising her barefoot over the poor toad man then slammed it down on him squashing him flat. She then took the dress and slung it over her shoulder, then raised her foot revealing the poor toad man crushed into a smelly footprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy slowly regained consciousness and cringed as his nostrils burned with Peggy's awful gas. He then noticed Peggy heading for the door. \"Hey you're really testing my patience.\" He said punching her rear doing no damage at all. \"No scaly you're testing mine!\" Peggy said falling back on her butt. Percy saw his impending doom and turned around attempting to run but he was too late as her booty crushed him into the floor. She ground her cheeks back and forth to really let the message set in then rose up. Plastered to her right butt cheek was Percy spread eagle. He groaned, as he had only been on the job for a couple of hoursbut he was already flattened to a large woman's rump like Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her business done, Peggy exited the shop with her dress in hand, the flattened outlaw jiggling along with her mountious rear end. She was completely oblivious to his presense, assuming that he had been left in the ass shaped crater she had left behind. The brutal squishing had left him too drained to yell out, though he wasn\"t sure she would've even heard it as she seemed to be in her own little world at the moment. She was still infuriated at the shopkeeper's insinuation that she was anything less than drop dead gorgeous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid jerk...how dare he call me fat?! That runt don't know true beauty when he sees it!\" she huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy wanted cringe at her narcissism, but he found himself completely unable to so much as budge. The towering sow had ground his body so flat that he might as well had been a sticker. Several townsfolk took notice to the desperate looking vigilante currently plastered onto her massive butt but did nothing to aide him. Peggy had a reputation for being hard to approach and they didn\u2019t want to run the risk of joining him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy had to endure an hour of her inane prattling before she finally arrived to her destination. The Pork estate was rested on a plot of land just outside of town. Upon retiring from law enforcement, Petey Pork decided to give back to the town that had given him so much by becoming a farmer and providing all manner of produce for the good townspeople. His children had taken to farm life rather well, save for his precious daughter who turned her nose at the thought of getting her hands dirty in the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Peggy stepped inside her house and slammed the door behind her. She looked around and smiled once she saw that her father and brothers weren\u2019t home. If her pappy had been home, he would grill her as to where and how she had acquired her dress and she was in no mood to hear another lecture about respect other people\u2019s property. She quickly trotted upstairs to her room, her asscheeks jiggling wildedly with each step further nassiating the flattened lizard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she stepped into her room, Percy\u2019s nose curled at the stench that surrounded him. It reeked of sweat and farts, making it unashamedly clear that it belonged to Peggy. Various posters hung from the walls, each of them depicting some famous pretty boy from the big city. The massive kiss marks that covered each poster lead Percy to believe that she spent a good deal of time fawning over them. A sudden jerk brought his attention back to Peggy as she wiggled out of her tight shorts and tossed it to the side, unintentionally discarding him along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 I been workin\u2019 out all month for this~\u201d Peggy giggled as she eyed the dress she had nabbed from the store. It was clearly too small for the hefty woman, but her ego told her otherwise. After freeing her heaving breasts from her tight top, she went to work putting the dress on, her teeth gritting from the effort. The dress did an admirable job of staying together, though it did little to cover her up. Peggy smiled at as she turned to face her full length mirror, enamoured with what she saw. Her breasts bulged from the opening at top and her hips stretched the fabric to its absolute limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2019ll Patty gets a load of this! She\u2019ll be so jealous!\u201d she giggled excitedly. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs she admired her reflection, Percy was working his body free from her jean shorts. His body was still partially flattened, but he had reformed just enough to drag himself from underneath them. After all he had been through, he swore to himself that he\u2019d never waste his time dealing with Peggy again. He was about to head crawl out of her home and over to the nearest saloon when suddenly Peggy let out a frightened squeal. She had seen him crawl from under her shorts from her mirror and was stunned to see a man in her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019re you!? What\u2019re you doing in my room?!\u201d she cried as she attempted to cover up her body with her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as quickly as she begun panicked, she quickly calmed herself as her eyes narrowed in focus. It took her a moment to recognize the wannabe lawman, but she was the type never forget the face of someone who had angered her previously. Her face soured as she stomped over to him, her meaty hand snatching him up and bringing him up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re that punk from the clothes store! What, did you follow me all the way home?\u201d she asked before shaking her head. \"It doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re trespassin\u2019 on our property and that means you gotta pay\u201d she said before dropping him harshly onto the ground and slowly lifting her foot up before hovering it over him. Percy remained frozen in fear at the intimidating sight, his mind racing for anything he could say that\u2019d save from from his impending doom. </span></div></div>",

A lady as lovely as yourself has to be used to all sorts of fellas following you, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Peggy's foot halted it's decent at that moment. The giant sow stared down at him with suspicious eyes, making Percy fear that his attempt at flattery had only succeed in agitating her somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not wrong... but most of em don't have the gall to <b><i>follow me into my house</i></b>\" she said slowly as she began to lower her foot again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself! I was so taken aback by your beauty that I just HAD to get a closer look!\" Percy cried with all the conviction of a preacher singing the praises of the lord. Once again, she halted. His impassioned words managed to do the trick as she stared down at him with wide eyes, her already pink face turner a deeper shade of pink. Percy breathed a sigh of relief once she finally pulled her leg back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you really think I'm beautiful?\" she asked as she fiddled with one her of pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kiddin' me? A heartbreaker like you belongs in the big city as one of them eh... movie type folk!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Peggy let out an airy giggle as she fanned herself. His mealy mouth and disingenuous platitudes made her hot under the collar and gave her butterflies. Despite her extreme narcissism, she was a very self-conscious young lady that yearned for approval, especially from the opposite sex. Her poor hygiene, bad temperament, and frightening size often made boys hesitant come within five feet of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll uh... just get out of your hair now, miss. Have fun at that weddin' of yours! Love the dress, by the way. Really brings out your curves!\" Percy said as he flashed her the most dashing smile he could. He almost felt bad for putting her on like that, but he was just glad to have been spared yet another squishing. He turned to exit when suddenly the door slammed shut. He blinked and looked up to see Peggy's arm stretched out with her palm pressed flat against the wooden surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving so soon...?\" she cooed in a sultry tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy swallowed and looked back at her, a chill going down his spine when he saw her staring at him with bedroom eyes. He was beginning to regret his decision to charm his way out of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't mean to be rude ma'am, but y-you uh, I really need t-to get back to work...\" he stammered with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, poor dear... you must be all tuckered out from all that hard work...\" she tittered as she advanced on him slowly, her hands running along her thick hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's tough b-b-but I uh... I can manage\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you take a load off, lawman? Let little ol' Peggy take care of you~\" she murmured before plucking the badge from his chest and tossing it into her mouth. Percy watched in a mixture of fear and awe as she effortlessly chewed up the piece of metal before sticking her tongue out and showing him what was left of it. She somehow managed to masterfully bend and twist his badge into the shape of a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do more things with my tongue if you wanna see~\" she said as she batted her eyelashes at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy trembled slightly as Peggy knelt and shut her eyes, her plush lips pursed as she moved in to kiss him. His eyes darted around the room for anything that could save him when his eyes landed on her window. He could probably duck underneath and dart over to it before she even knew what happened. Then again, that plan could go south in many different ways, the most disastrous being if he couldn't get her window open in time. He was already familiar with Peggy's bad side and he didn't want to risk offending her again. </span></div></div>",

Her thick lips smothered half his face and her breath was nearly vile enough to make him reconsider his actions on the spot. Too late, her hands reached down and grabbed his shoulders, helping to stabilize the amorous pig. She suckled and smacked loudly, her tongue teasingly dragging along his closed mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overwhelming affectations of the pudgy pig woman were hard to resist, even more so because she was starting to really lean into her kiss. Percy was forced to deal with more and more weight piled on to him until his legs could not keep up a moment longer. With a loud thump Peggy fell forward onto the floor. Her eyes shot open and the first thing she saw was her lover gone missing. A flash of anger raced through her as she thought he'd try to run off, but a funny feeling quickly doused her rage. A distinct wiggling coming from beneath her large breasts. She sat back up and saw Percy's tail waving around in the corner of her eye. She looked down at her impressive rack and between those precious globes of her rested the gecko's head. He'd gotten himself wedged between them when she fell over. He was lucky her dress had enough give in it not to tear or there'd be hell to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahaha... you got some balls, scales. Most men ain't got the guts to be that forward. But if you think you're ready to go whole hog with me, I won't leave you wanting.\" She snorted at her own pun, peeling Percy free and walking over to the bed with him in her arms. She unceremoniously dumped him on the smelly straw bedding and walked over to her dresser to prepare for what was to come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gecko's mind was racing. How did it get to this so quickly? He couldn't possibly go down on that? The stench alone would kill any boner and a lady of her size was going to need something a fair bit... bigger than him. He dreaded to think what she had in mind to solve this. He had to get out of this, but if she found out he got her all aroused and then tried to flee... Percy shuddered at the thought of what Peggy might do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, c'mon then big boy. Take a good look at this fine slice of pork.\" The pig cooed, making his scales stand on end. She hadn't just taken off the dress. Peggy was standing in front of him completely naked. Some depraved corner of his mind was turned on by all the bare flabby body on display. But his mind was mostly filled with fear as he pictured her trying to go down on him. But things were about to take a surprising turn.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the amorous pig sauntered over to him, Percy racked his brain to think of a way to excuse himself without potentially offending her. Reasoning her was completely out of the question, so the only option left to him was to appeal to her vanity. He cleared his throat and readied himself, as he needed to come off as cool and charming as he could possibly manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit Madam, your breathtaking beauty led me to reason that you were thr type to favor the more... conventional method\" he said placing a hand on his chin. He felt a weight lift of his shoulders once Peggy came to a halt with a confused look of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats that mean?\" She asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you jest!\" Percy laughed. \"Someone as lovely as yourself must be aware of the unspoken rules of courtship, right? Experienced lover know them like the back of their hand!\" He cried incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy's confusion quickly turned to anger as she glared down at thr mouthy little gecko. He was tredding on some dangerous territory suggesting that she wasn't experienced in lovemaking. Granted, he was literally the only man that she'd ever brought into her room, but she didn't want to be reminded of that fact. Her response was exactly what Percy expected and he was quick to clarify his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it goes without saying that someone like you would be well versed in matters of the heart. See, I haven't beem with a woman as classy and ravishing as you in a very long time and while I'd love to jump right into the lovemakin' aspect of the relationship, I know that classy women are the type to start slow and build up to that wonderful moment\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought the urge to grin as Peggy nodded with every word, her anger fading into genuine curiousity as she listened. As horny as she was, she was still self-conscious enough to not want her inexperience to be out in the open. She huffed and folded her arms, her gigantic breasts being pushed up by her meaty arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'course I know about that kinda stuff! I was just... testin' ya! To see if you were a real gentlemen! A lady has to have standards, you know\" she said with a smug chortle. Silence hung in the air as the two stared at each other, Percy waiting to see what move she made next. After a while she cleared her throat to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do experienced lovers do before thing get all hot n' heavy? And before you say anything smart, I already know the answer! I just... wanna make sure you know too!\" She added defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What they don't do is make love on the first date. That's the kinda behavior that only low brow types engage in. You and I have just met, so now we spend some time a'flirtin' with one another while we do our normal business. That's when we start datin' and by, oh say.. .the hundredth date, that's when we really hit it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy frowned as she listened to his explanation. Her ideal relationship consisted of long nights of passion and having every inch of body thoroughly worshiped throughout the day, so all his talk of waiting and flirting didn't exactly appeal to her. Her apprehension was exactly what the cunning deputy expected and he was quick to address it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me ask you something. What's the longest time you've gone without a nice home cooked meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... maybe about thirty minutes. That was way back when and it only happened cus' our stove wasn't workin' Why? You tryin' to say somethin' about my size?!\" she growled, her giant fists clenching. Percy darted over and calmed her down as he took hold of her and kissed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never even dream of it. If more girls were built like you, no man would ever wanna be single\" he said with a wink. Peggy couldn't hide her elation as she swooned at his praises, her heart beating faster and her lust for him growing ever more intense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good sex,\" he continued, fearing the suddne warmth he felt radiated from below her waist. \"Is like waitin' for a big meal. The longer you wait, the better it tastes when its time to eat! Get what I'm sayin' here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Bringing it down to a food metaphor seemed to do the trick as Peggy's body language relaxed. As badly as she wanted to pounce onto him and ride his tiny little body into the dirt, playing the waiting game seemed like a smarter choice. She sighed and backed away from him, the disappointment quite clear on her face. For a brief moment, pity overtook Percy and he couldn't help but try and bring her spirits back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to pout, madam. We got all the time in the world to get to know each other while we start datin'. I'll put on my best suit and you get all prettied up, and we'll go out the classiest establishment in all of Gold Springs! Doesn't that sound like somethin' you'd like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess so...\" Peggy said softly, a smile forming on her face as she blushed. The way he described it seemed so uniquely pleasant to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, I gots me a town to look after so I'll just see myself out\" Percy said as he slowly made his way over to the door. He was relieved to see that she wasn't following behind him like before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n While he talked a good game, he didn't plan on seeing her again any time soon. Avoiding her wouldn't be too difficult given much of a boisterous trouble maker she was. All he had to do was avoid answering any calls that pertained to her and her brothers. It wasn't the most honorable thing for him to do, but the alternative would be to spend even more time with her, he was didn't think he could stomach much more of her affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was about to leave when Peggy spoke up again, her voice heavy with desire.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> It was music. A light, whimsical melody could be heard playing in the distance, no doubt from some kind of wind instrument. With nothing better to do, Percy decided to follow the music to it's source with the intention of writing a ticket to the musician for disturbing the peace. It was petty of him, but he was tasked with making sure that everything was as April left it, plus he wasn't exactly in the best of moods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The music lead him to the outskirts of town and what he saw surprised him. Dozens of people were gathered together, dancing to the music freely without a care in the world. Percy recognized a few of them as residents from the town, one in particular standing out as he recognized her as the owner of a bakery he frequented. She was an imposingly large hippo woman that even most bandits would hesitate to cross due to her sheer size. Those who knew her personally however, could attest to her being a kind, sweet and hardworking woman who wouldn't hurt a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Merry! What're you doin' outta the shop?\" Percy called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She didn't seem to notice him as she continued to dance, her meaty frame moving with more grace than most people who even think possible from someone so large. Percy walked up to her, taking care to avoid the other dancers as he came up to her and gave her apron a few tugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Merry? Hello? What's gotten into you?\" he asked as his tone hinted a bit of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Even then, Merry didn't notice him as she lifted her leg up, doing a perfect mid-air split before bringing it her foot down onto Percy, crushing him instantly. She remained completely oblivious to his suffering as she pranced about happily, Percy's flattened body clinging to the bottom of her bare foot like a piece of old chewing gum. It was only when she stopped to do a pirouette that he was freed from his predicament as she ground him into the dirt and pressed all her weight onto the sole of her foot. As she moved her leg away he was left in a foot shaped grove, his body turned into a fine paste by the damage he suffered. It took a few minutes for his body to reform, though it was still crumpled and flatted in a few areas.He groaned and picked his hat up from the grove, dusting it off before putting it back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now he was certain that something was wrong. In all the years he had know Merry, she was always very conscious of her size and went to great lengths to make sure that she never squashed someone on accident. It was unlike her to so callously disregard those around her. His thoughts went back to the thing that brought him there in the first place: the music. Something about it was putting people in a trance like state where all they could do was dance. It was a shot in the dark, but it was the only explanation he could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He quickly went to work trying to find the musician, bobbing and weaving through the dancing towns people until he reached what he thought was the source. In front of him was the sign welcoming travelers to the town and by the sound of it, whomever the musician was, they were hiding on the others side. Percy smiled and readied his gun, eager to enact a bit of vengeance for being stomped on. He let out a battle cry as he leaped over the sign, ignoring the squelch beneath him as he aimed his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't move or I'll...! Um...\" he trailed off as he found no one on the other side. The music had stopped the moment he landed, leading him to believe that the musician had somehow managed to escape in literal seconds. He was about to leave when he felt something wiggling beneath his foot. Looking down he could see a small tuft of fur sticking to the bottom of his heel. He held his leg up and was surprised to find that he had stepped on and squished a tiny white mouse holding a minuscule flute in it's paws. It was dressed in rather odd garbs, consisting of a small wooden crown and a green embroidered cloak. Any anger Percy felt immediately evaporated and was replaced with overwhelming guilt, though the mouse didn't seem to mind as it looked up at him with cute eyes and warm smile.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Good day to you, friend\" it squeaked in a calm, even voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy blinked and quickly peeled it off of his foot, placing it gently in the palm of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um... sorry about that\" he said as he scratched the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No need to apologize. When you're my size, you get use to it\" it giggled once it's body reformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Right... so who are you anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah! Please pardon my lack of manners! I, my giant scaly friend, am Po. I hail from a land far, far away from here; a land where there is nothing but green and the trees stretch all the way to the sky. I've traveled a long way to this wondrous land of giants and sand, hoping to share the traditions of my people with all who would welcome me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh. Well, you're new here so it's best if I lay some ground rules on you. The name's Percy Scales, professional bounty hunter and as of three hours ago, deputy of this here town. That means, while you're in this town, I am the law. Are we clear on that?\" Percy said sternly, punctuating each word of his last sentence by with a poke to Po's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course! I am but a humble traveler, good sir. I would never do anything to undermine your authority. That is not the way of my people\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, ur... good! Glad we see eye to eye on that. Now, you mind explaining what's happening over here?\" he asked as he walked around sign, showing him the people that had been ensnared by his flute playing. Now that the music had stopped, they were back to their normal selves, conversing with one another as they didn't seem to have any recollection of what they had just been doing. Merry in particular seemed the most confused as was rubbing her thighs, wondering why they were so sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't understand. What am I supposed to be looking at?\" Po asked as he tilted his head curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You don't remember? You were playin' that flute of yours and it put them into some weird trance where all they wanted to do was dance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh!\" Po exclaimed before jumping up onto the sign with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That was the power of my people in action!\" he said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The power of-- what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Allow me to demonstrate\" Po said before closing its eyes and raising the flute to its lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It played a single note and within seconds, the people in front of them ceased their talking and stood with their eyes wide. Once it got their attention, it began to play a more complex melody, skipping along the edging of the sign gracefully as it performed. The town's residents remain still save for Merry, who walked over to the sign and gently picked the tiny flutist up, placing it down into the breast pocket of her apron. Once he was secure, he opened his eyes and lowered his flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You see, my people aren't adapt to dealing with those larger than us. We are a weak, fragile lot with no real means of defending ourselves\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was hard for Percy to disagree with that sentiment. When someone as small as him can crush you underfoot, you really are on the bottom of the food chain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That said...\" Po began before playing a more notes on his flute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Merry looked down at the Percy with a look that made a chill run down his spine. She reached down and grabbed him by his neck, bringing him up to eye level. Gone was the kindly, harmless baker and in her place was the cold, bitter looking monster before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"... we find that taming and befriending predators is far more effective\" it continued with an innocent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It played three more notes and Merry snorted, crushing the helpless deputy in her massive hand. Without warning, she tossed his squashed body into her mouth and chomped down, chewing on him like a piece of gum before spitting him back onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In my land, music is nothing more than a means to fend off those who would do us harm... that is why I chose to leave. Something as beautiful as music shouldn't be used as a mere tool. It should be shared and enjoyed by all, and it is here that my craft is truly appreciated...\" it said with a fond sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy could barely hear what he was saying as he was preoccupied with trying to reform his battered body. Once he collected himself he looked up at Po, trying to ignore the glare that Merry was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"R-right... listen Mister...um...Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am a boy\" Po giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Listen Mister Po... as much as I respect your intentions, I'm afraid I'm gonna hafta confiscate that flute from ya--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was cut off by Merry's foot slamming down on top of him, her toes grinding him like a used cigarette as Po played more notes. This went on for five minutes straight and by the end of it, Percy was almost unrecognizable as his body was reduced mangled mess of flattened limbs while his eyes were misplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that, sir. I would sooner perish then toss away my one true passion!\" he said with a huff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I shall depart for now, Mr. Scales. If you need me, I will be performing in the Den of Food and Refreshments... or as your people call it, the tavern. I will make sure there's a seat in the front row for you!\" he said giving the dazed deputy another innocent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, he went back to playing the same melody as before, herding his audience back into town while he rested comfortably in the large hippo's breast pocket. Percy in the meanwhile was helpless to stop her as her struggled to get himself together, his body aching all over and his clothes smelling of sweat and dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"First day on the job and I get brutalized...\" he muttered as he cracked his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shit, he said he was heading for town... gotta think about my next move...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> The thought of going to April came to mind, though it was immediately pushed aside. His pride was getting in the way of his sound judgement as he main concern was proving that he was just as capable a lawman as Texas, if not more so. With renewed vigor, he pulled his pants up and marched back into Gold Springs, keeping an ear out for the sound of Po's flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy searched high and low through for any clues that would point him in the right direction, but to his surprise the town was exactly as he left it. He had expected to find it in a state of complete chaos with the towns people roaming the streets as mesmerized, dance-happy zombies. Still, he couldn't help but feel uneasy. It was a bit TOO calm for his liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He thought back what Po said before he left him in a broken heap, that he was heading to the \"Den of Food and Refreshments\" before clarifying that he was referring to a tavern. Despite the obvious lead, Percy had little to work with as there numerous taverns scattered around Gold Springs. In a sweltering hot mining town where the primary commerce came from hard labor, it only made sense for there to be multiple watering holes for hard working stiffs to go and drink their cared away. He could only imagine the damage the little nuisance could do with a audience of large, drunken hooligans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He shuddered at the though and quickly went back to his search, turning to interrogating the civilians for any leads. His first target was an elderly old turtle reclining on a soapbox with a flask in hand. Judging by the vacant, dreary eyed look on his face it was clear that he didnt have much going on between the eyes, not that it stopped Percy from approaching him. The gecko tipped his hat respectfully then cleared his throat to get his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Scuse me, sir. I don't mean to trouble you none, but I'm currently on the lookout for an armed and potentially dangerous criminal. About five inches in height, wears a snot green cloak, tends to ramble on about music... ring any bells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The old man furrowed his brow in thought and swirled his finger along the opening of his flask. He did this minutes on end, occasionally opening his mouth to speak before immediately closing it. Just when Percy was about to move on for him, the old man's eyes lit up with activity and he jumped forward with a agility unexpected for one so ancient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You talkin bout the little feller what plays the flute, right? Yeah, I seen em! I was layin in that ditch over yonder, on accouna my back goin out on me. That little guy skipped right on over and played a song on that flute of his, and next thing I know, I'm good as new! I'm fact,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He paused and tossed his flask into the air before jumping up and performing a triple back flip and landing his a single hand, catching his flask with his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I feel fifty years younger!\" He guffawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's... good I guess. Did you happen to see where he was heading off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He cringed as he watched the old man contort his body in a way that allowed him to take a sip from his flask while he still held it between his feet. The power of Po's music was nothing short of surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hm? Oh yeah. After he fixed me up, I saw him head on over to Dead Man's Lane. I tried to tell him that he was heading to a bad part of town, but that only made him wanna go there even more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy blinked and placed a hand in his chin. Dead Man's Lane was the nickname of a street where the town's most noteworthy evildoers tended to congregate. It was also the street that housed one of mayor Vivian's many projects, a shady bar known as The Crushed Weasel. It was home to all manner of trouble makers, ranging from mercenaries, to cattle rustlers, to the occasional lawyer. He couldn\u2019t imagine such a puny thing waltzing to the most dangerous part of town without ending up being used as a buttplug. The very thought of it brought a sinister smile to Percy\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, I gotta see this! Thank you for you cooperation, sir\u201d he said tipping his hat and running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnytime, lawman!\u201d the old man said before going into a cackling fit and cartwheeling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy quickly screeched to a halt as the old man\u2019s words sunk in with him. Unlike Texas, his presence in The Crushed Weasel didn\u2019t draw the ire of the patrons. After all, he was a bounty hunter, rogue and unbound by the law. He brought in criminals at the roughly the same frequency as the sheriff, but his catches were so low tier that they slipped under the radar of most big name criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All that said, he had made one fatal mistake: upon being given the task of looking after the town, he went around announcing his position of authority to anyone he made eye contact with. lf there was one thing he learned in his time dealing with the scum of Gold Springs, it was that word traveled fast. No doubt the patrons The Crushed Weasel were informed of his position as temporary deputy and were eagerly awaiting his arrival. His skin crawled as he envisioned himself being squashed underfoot and placed in their filthy bathroom to be used as scaly toilet paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI better think up a disguise quick, or else I\u2019m gonna get my ass handed to me again\u201d he said before he looked around for something that would aid him in remaining inconspicuous, his eyes landing on an old bed sheet that someone left out to dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The scaly crime fighter came up on The Crushed Weasel with his hand resting on his concealed holster. He could faintly hear the sounds of music coming from within accompanied with much laughter and merriment. He looked over his outfit on last time, suddenly feeling unsure of himself. He had taken the bed sheet off of the clothesline and fashioned it into a makeshift cloak, tearing off a bit of the edge to make bandanna to cover the lower half of his mouth. It was far from subtle, but at the very least it did it\u2019s job of hiding his identity\u2026 at least he hoped so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Taking in a deep breath, he walked into the tavern expecting the absolute worst. What he found was quite unlike what he remembered from his last visit. Before, there was a lingering air of danger as the patrons drunk, fought, and hazed in a way that most normal people would interpret as hostile. Now\u2026 it was much of the same, but they were far more jovial as their attention was drawn to the piano player, who was playing a light, jaunty tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Standing on top of the piano, dancing and skipping along to rhythm was the tiny pain in the ass that he was looking for. He was playing his flute in tandem with the piano player in a tune that Percy couldn\u2019t help but tap his toes to. The deputy walked through the rowdy crowd and up to the bar, deciding to get a drink while he skulked his target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPretty good isn\u2019t he?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy glanced up at the towering cow woman known as Annabelle, who had already placed a glass of whiskey in front of him in an uncharacteristic display of good service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cFound him while I was taking the trash out. I accidentally stepped on him coming back in and didn\u2019t notice until I was back behind the counter. Didn\u2019t seem none too phased by it as he jumped up on the counter and offered to put on a show for us. I was gonna show him the back door, seeing as how we already have a piano guy, but he begged me to let him perform and... well, I guess even a crusty ol' gal like me can be suckered by cute face\u201d she said as she leaned onto the counter, watching the show with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThe little fella\u2019s got the place packed! Sure glad I didn\u2019t use him as a buttplug like I was planning on doing\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy nodded, though froze at the last thing she had said. It took him a moment to realize that she wasn't referring to the bar when she said that she would \u201cshow him the back door\u201d. He shuddered and brought the glass under his bandanna, taking care not to expose his face as he downed his drink and enjoyed the music. He felt his previous anger begin to melt away as he looked around at patrons. The sight of them laughing, clapping and having a good time warmed his spirits ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>Maybe the runt ain\u2019t so dangerous after all</i>, he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As soon as the thought came to mind, Annabelle whistled to get his attention. Percy glanced back at her and did a double take at what he saw. The barkeep was holding a young man, flattened and turned into a round disk shape, his eyes bulging in horror as his body was stained with sweat and other substances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWanna buy a seat cushion? With the influx of customers coming in, we got plenty to go around\u201d she said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy looked around him and it was then that he noticed that most of the patrons had flatten people underneath them, the edges of their bodies just barely showing beneath their large backsides. Person in particular, a monstrously large bull anthro stood up to stretch, revealing a number of flattened, twitching people stuck to his bulbous ass. Annabelle followed his gaze and looked over to the horrific sight with an amused chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry about him none. He\u2019s just keeping them warm for his friends while they\u2019re in the bathroom. Gotta one cushion per customer rule\u201d she explained, assuming that his concern was with the scarcity her \u201cproduct\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy sighed inwardly and shook his head as he quickly put two and two together. Normally, most people avoided the Crushed Weasel like the plague, but the mesmerizing sounds of Po\u2019s flute had managed to lure innocent bystanders inside, where they were flattened and turned into cushions for the regular customers. He would\u2019ve been impressed by Anna's business sense, had it not been so utterly devious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He shook his head at Annabelle, making her frown and place the poor sod back underneath the counter. His fingers drummed along the counter as he glared fiercely at Po. His mind was going through a list of plans to apprehend the rodent when all of a sudden...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You came!\u201d Po called out happily, his tiny voice managing to cut through the noise of the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Almost instantly, the laughter and mirth that was in the air came to a halt. The patrons followed Po's gaze and soon enough, all eyes were on the disguised deputy. Percy remained still, his face remaining calm and stoic\u2026 though on the inside, he was trembling with fear. He could feel the hot breath of Annabelle as she leaned over on the counter, her face inches from him as she glared down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cScales, huh? As in, Percy Scales? The discount sheriff?\u201d she asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy said nothing in response, trying his best to maintain his cool, collected demeanor as he reached over to pour himself another shot of whiskey. Unfortunately for him, his nerves had begun to show as his hands shook violently, making him spill most of the bottle\u2019s contents out onto the counter as he attempted to pour his drink. Normally Annabelle would\u2019ve used him as an ass rag for wasting perfectly good booze, but she was far too entertained by his nervousness to punish him for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat, you think we're just gonna dogpile you for filling in for Little Miss Do Gooder? This is The Crushed Weasel, little man. Texas is the official punching bag, not her substitute\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her words stung the aspiring crimefighter, though he couldn't help but feel relieved. While he wanted to be recognized with the same reverence and respect as Texas, his instincts of self-preservation won over his ego. He decided to depart while he was still in there dimensions, quickly fishing under his hat and pulling out fistful of gold coins that were worth far more than the cost of his drink and dropping them into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI was just making sure that this fine establishment met with health and safety standards. I'm happy to say that The Crushed Weasel has passed with--\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His speech was interrupted as Annabelle\u2019s meaty fist came down onto the counter, missing him by just an inch. She slowly lifted her hand back up, allowing Percy to catch a glimpse of the cockroach she had just decimated. With an annoyed snort she wiped the mess off on her pants before letting out a quick but powerful fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUgh, nasty little buggers. I'm sorry, continue\u201d she said as though nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c... The Crushed Weasel has passed with flying colors. Now that my investigation is done, I'll be on my way now\u201d Percy said before jumping up to leave. At that point, he could care less about apprehending Po. He just wanted to leave and go back to his cushy townsitting job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He didn't get very far before he was yoked back by the nape of his neck. Annabelle leaned over the counter, a lady smile on her face as she let the frightened deputy dangle in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAh ah, not so fast little man\u201d she snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy looked out to the sea of large, sweaty, stinking outlaws before him. All of them were on the edge of their seats as they waited for Annabelle to pass judgement on him. Meanwhile, Po stood on top of the piano chatting it up with the pianist, completely oblivious to the situation he forced the gecko into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou can't leave just yet. Not before\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes and readied himself for whatever cruel treatment that she had in mind for him and was surprised when he was placed gently back into his seat. He opened his eyes and blinked as a large mug of beer was placed in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's with the dumb look? I told you, Texas is enemy number one around these parts. We could give a rat's ass about a little wannabe lawman like you\" she snickered as she cleaned out one of the mugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's... good to know... I guess\" Percy said as he eyed his drink for any noticeable abnormalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Besides, the little guy spoke very fondly of you and I wanna keep my little meal ticket as happy as possible\" she explained as she pointed a thumb over to Po was chatting it up with the pianist about the next song they would play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy frowned, though he kept his comments to himself as he took a sip of his drink. He was a selfish, egotistical fellow with a massive inferiority complex, but he was still a straight laced man of justice that despised  those who would do harm to the good people of Gold Springs. As such, he didn't take kindly to being linked to someone he saw as a criminal, even tangentially. He glared daggers at Po who met his gaze and answers with a smile and a wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> I gotta out that little varmint behind bars before he lures anyone else in here...</i>, he thought as drummed his fingers along the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He knew that if he was to just go up and attempt to arrest him, Annabelle would turn him into a stain on the bottom of her heel. He thought of snatching him and running, relating on his impressive speed to get out of dodge, but there was a good chance that he'd get pounced on by the patrons. As he mulled over his options, his resolve began to wane. He had already tried his luck by wandering in the tavern in the first place and he wasn't keen on putting his neck on the line for nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Still, he had to try. As much as he feared for what might happen to him, it was his duty as deputy to bring Po into justice. He slowly stood up from his seat, placing another handful of coins onto the counter to keep Annabelle preoccupied while he walked over to Po. As he approached him, an idea began to form in his mind, one that if it worked, would ensure that he could get out of the tavern without harm coming to him. The little fellow greeted him with a bright smile, as though they had been friends for years prior to that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood day to you, my scalely friend! I told Miss Annabelle to expect your presence, so she could reserve a seat for you. I hope everything is to your liking\u201d He said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s been real\u2026 nice. Listen, I was thinking about what you said before, about how you can tame people with your music?\u201d Percy asked as he stroked his chin in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIndeed. You would be surprised how music can have an affect on one\u2019s very soul!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cRight. Can I see an example of that? Like, let\u2019s say a herd of wild stallions were charging towards you. What would you play in order to stop them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Po tilted his head as he eyed Percy curiously and for a moment, making the deputy nervous. If he caught on to his ruse, there was no telling what he would do. Fortunately for him, the little mouse was quite naive and couldn\u2019t read between the lines as he lifted up his flute in preparation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSimple. I would temper their hearts with a ballad and lull them into a long slumber. Like so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough, the tavern was filled with the sound of Po\u2019s flute. Where his previous song had been lighthearted and jovial, this one was much more subdued. Percy was quick to feel the effects of the music, a zen light calmness washing over him as he listened to the enchanting melody. He shook his head and clenched placed his hands over his ears, trying to block out any potential effects that came from listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n All around him, the patrons were slumped back in their seats, their eyes heavy and their heads hanging low. Annabelle herself was listening against the counter with her head resting in her arms. In less than a minute, the entire tavern was asleep save for Po and Percy. Once everyone was knocked out, Po brought his song to an end and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cEvery creature is a creation of the mother earth and as such, they are all entitled to compassion and care. That is why we befriend those who would do us harm, Mr.Scales. For we all share kinship with--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Po\u2019s flower speech was cut off as Percy grabbed onto him, forcing a light squeak from the mouse as he held a tight grip on him. The deputy smirked as he plucked the flute from Po\u2019s hands and placed it into his pocket, ensuring that he would have no way of escaping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBy the authority of Gold Springs, I\u2019m placing you under arrest for disturbing the peace, being an accomplice in a slave trafficking, and pissing me off\u201d he said before he started for the door. His captive tilted his head in confusion, unsure of what he was being told. He had little to no understanding of how the law worked in this new, foreign land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Everything was going swimmingly for Percy at first as he carefully tiptoed out of the tavern, his eyes scanning the area for anywhere he could hide should they wake up unexpectedly. His extreme caution would soon work against him as he came up on a sleeping patron's tail. His attention was on the front and he didn't notice the hazard until he tripped over it. Somehow he managed to from crying out as he stumbled slightly, his free hand grabbing onto the table to catch himself. Unfortunately, his hand grabbed onto the table clothe where a large mug of unfinished beer was resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he fell to the ground, the clothe was tugged from off the table and with it, the mug. Time seemed to come to a standstill as Percy watched it fall to the ground, shattering onto the ground the moment it make contact with it and spilling it's contents all over the tavern floor. Above him, he heard the sound of someone stirring and looked up to see a hulking gator anthro beginning to stir, the sudden noise jarring her from her slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>God, I don't ask you for much but please, PLEASE keep this lady from waking up </i>he thought to himself as he nervously watched the grumbling gator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Does God answer his prayer?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Fortune smiled on Percy as the patrons of the Crushed Weasel remained asleep despite the loud noise. He sighed and wiped the sweat from his forehead before jumping to his feet and bolting for the door. As soon as his feet touched the outside, a feeling of pride swelled within him. He had braved the crime ridden tavern and snagged with perp without a single scratch! He could imagine the look of amazement on Texas\u2019 face once he told her of his feats. There was no way she could deny him an official position of duty after what he had accomplished. Perhaps she would even make him her official partner, granting him more authority than April. The thought of made him snicker excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cExcuse me. Mr.Scales?\u201d Po called, speaking up for the first time since he had been nabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy blinked as he was brought out of his daydreams and looked down at his perp with an annoyed scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhen you are done with my flute, may I have it back? It was a parting gift from my mother, you see. Hand carved from dragon root. It\u2019s quite important to me\u201d he said with a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take a lot more than a sob story to get me to let you go\u201d Percy said rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh no, I don\u2019t mind being in your custody. I just want to keep track of my precious heirloom is all\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLike hell you\u2019ll get it back! I\u2019m not gonna let you brainwash anyone into doing whatever you want!\u201d he snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBrainwash? Whatever do you mean?\u201d Po asked a slight pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy chuckled and shook his head. He was beginning to lose his patience for Po and his innocent and naive act, as he didn\u2019t buy it for a minute. It didn\u2019t help that he had introduced himself by siccing a five hundred pound baker on him. He brought Po up to his face, glaring at him as intensely as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen. I\u2019m going to turn you in, you\u2019re gonna get locked up, and I\u2019m going use your flute to pick my teeth. Are we clear on that?\u201d he spoked in a slow and gruff tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His attempts at intimidating Po amounted to nothing as the mouse simply stared at him with a slight smile. The only reaction he seemed to get from him was when he started looking around with a focused expression, a large smile spreading onto his face once he found was he was looking for. Percy followed his gaze, but saw nothing but the local bank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMr.Scales\u201d Po began, drawing Percy\u2019s attention back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI cannot stress enough how sorry I am. I hope that one day, you and I can look back at this and laugh as friends, perhaps while sharing a cup of ginseng tea together\u201d he said with a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before Percy could question him, Po pursed his lips and began to whistle. The deputy was taken aback both by how loud the tiny creature could whistle and how skilled he was at it. Once Po was done he turned his attention back to the bank, his ears twitching in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat in the hell was that supposed to do?\u201d Percy asked with a sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His question was soon answered as heard a noise. It was the sound of heavy galloping footsteps and as they grew closer, the ground began to tremble with each step. He turned his attention back to the bank and paled as he saw met with the sight of a massive horse bolting towards him with great fury. He didn't even get a chance to run as a hoof came down and squashed him flat. The horse didn't let up as it trampled him into the ground, occasionally jumping up and landing on his body with a wet squelch. Eventually the mare stopped and looked down at its handiwork. Percy was but a green puddle in a small crater, his eyes floating along what was left of his body and looking disoriented. The only piece of him that remained in fact was his right hand\u2026 the hand that held Po.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mouse didn't have any trouble getting out of his grip as he pulled himself away and walked up to his decimated body. He offer Percy a sympathetic smile as reached down and picked his flute up from off the ground. Miraculously, it managed to survive the trampling completely intact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cForgive me, friend. I cannot allow someone to mistreat my instrument. It is an extension of me, of my family, of my land, of my people as a whole\u201d he said before playing a few notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mate whinnied and lowered her head, allowing Po to climb up onto her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI bid you good day, Mr.Scales. Come, noble steed! Let us spread the gift of music to all who would lend an ear to my craft!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mare snorted and kicked her front legs up, giving the helpless deputy one more stomp before taking off with Po performed his music atop her head. Percy let gurgling noise as his body slowly reformed itself. There wasn't a single part of him that wasn't in searing pain and his bones cracked and snapped once he finally put himself back together. He made a mental note to not underestimate the rodent again, lest he summon something even larger to trounce him. Taking in a deep breath, he quickly called his nerves and fell back onto the ground. He failed miserably in apprehending his target and was repeatedly beaten within an inch of his life, but at the very least he was whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n His forced optimism didn't stick as he heard a familiar voice; a voice that immediately made him freeze in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOi, Butterscotch! Where the hell are ya?!\u201d Roxxy shouted irritably as she exited the bank I'm front of him. Her arms were filled with sacks of cash and judging by the person shaped imprints on her rear, she had little trouble in dealing with the guards. She looked around swearing under her breath before her gaze landed on Percy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou! You're that fella who's standin\u2019 in for Texas! You here to stop me, lawman?\u201d she snickered as she walked over, casting a shadow as she loomed over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cN-no m-madam, that ain't uh\u2026 that ain't  my jurisdiction \u2026\u201d Percy stated meekly as he tried not to make eye contact with her. He yelped as Roxxy grabbed his jaw and forcibly turned his attention back into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIs that so? Well tell me something, peewee. What did you do with my horse?\u201d she asked as her smile turned to a scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cN-now hold now, I-I didn\u2019t do anything to--\u201d Percy stuttered before being silenced by Roxxie gently pinching his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI go inside to take care of business for five minutes, I hear all this noise outside and I come back to see Butterscotch gone and a deputy the only person in sight. See where I\u2019m coming from?\u201d she before pulling her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cTell you what. I\u2019m in a good mood, so I\u2019ll give you five minutes to explain yourself. If I don\u2019t like what I hear, Texas is gonna have herself a new roommate in the hospital\u201d she said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy swallowed and quickly began to recount everything that had led up to that point. Taking up for Texas, meeting Po and learning of his bizarre musical abilities, and getting trampled by Butterscotch (Roxxie\u2019s mouth curled into a proud smile on th at point). She placed a hand on her chin in thought, mulling over what she just heard. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Given the outlaw's reputation for violence and cruelty, Percy didn't at all expect her to buy into what he was saying. Even if she did, Roxxie wasn't the sort to abide by honor. If she wanted to beat him into the ground, she would do it in a heartbeat. That's why it came as such a shock to him when she began walking away, her expression stern and focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What're you wait'n for? Let's get a move on!\" she snapped back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy was quick to obey as he followed behind her, cringing as he was forced to stare at the roo's frighteningly large rear. Until then he had never once interacted with the infamous crook, but one glance at her ass was more than enough for him to understand how she put Texas out of commission. He could only pray that he'd be able to find the wily little rodent as soon as possible, lest he share her fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Once we find the varmint, feel free to do whatever you want with him. All I ask is that you let me bring him in afterwards\" Percy said in the hopes of finding some mutual ground with Roxxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry about that. There ain't gonna be much left of em' by the time I get through...\" she responded with such restrained fury that it sent a shiver up the scaly lawman's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-As much as I'd <i>love</i> to see that, I'm afraid I'll have to insist on you... um... you know, not killing him\" Percy said nervously. He was treading on thin ice by telling her how to conduct herself, but he wouldn't be able to live with himself should he allow her to murder people with impunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what? You gonna arrest me? Please. If Texas can't get the better of me, what makes you think you'd be able to do any better?\" Roxxie said with a snicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her snide dismissal managed to flip a switch in Percy's brain as his fear was replaced by righteous indignation. He already had a hair-trigger temper and the amount of things that got under his skin where too numerous to count, but there was nothing that infuriated him more than being compared to Texas. He busted his butt day in and day out just to get one tenth of her recognition yet time and time again he was disrespected and brushed aside, this day being no different. He came to a halt and folded his arms as he glared fiercely at the smug roo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That's exactly what I'll do. If you do anything to prevent me from bringing that little snot into justice, I'll throw your fat ass in the slammer so fast it'll make your head spin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Roxxie raised a brow as she stopped in her tracks. She peered over her shoulder and chuckled slightly, more amused than angered by his sudden show of bravado. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm a little hard o' hearing. Mind repeating what you just said\" she asked before turning around to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't stutter\" he barked back. By that point he was too far in. She could beat him into the dirt and he wouldn't back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Roxxie flashed him a toothy grin and stepped up to him with her pronounced gut being mere inches away from his face. The emboldened outlaw couldn't even see past her generous breasts as he winced internally at her stench. There was no doubt in his mind, she would utterly demolish him in a fight. If he had any sense of self preservation, he would have turned tail and ran, banking on his great speed to carry him far away from her. The only thing keeping him from doing so was his pride, as he was determined stand his ground against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make somethin' real clear here, Roxxie. You might have beaten Texas, but that don't mean you can suddenly do whatever you please. I'm the new law around these parts and don't you forget it!\" he said sternly, emphasizing his point by poking her in the stomach. \"Now, if you promise to behave, I'll let you come along and help me. If you don't wanna accept that offer, feel free to let me know so I can get to haulin' you off right here and now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Roxxie's eyes narrowed as she leered down at him. It must've been a curious sight to behold: a pint sized lizard mouthing off to one of the most feared criminals around. His thickheadedness would've gotten him killed on any other day, but Roxxie was feeling generous. She surprised the snippy little fellow as she leaned down and gave him a condescending pat on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ease up, Sheriff. I'll play nice\" she said with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She turned away from him and continued onward without another word. Percy didn't very much care for her nonchalant response in regards to his threat, but he knew better than to press his luck any further as he followed along. He had managed to maintain his composure amidst their stare off, but on the inside he was quaking in his boots. He was sure Roxxie would pick up on it, but her mind was on more pressing matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, when you're in my particular line of work, there ain't a whole lotta folk you can count on. Sure, there might be one or two people that you enjoy workin' with, but that don't mean that they'll have your back when somethin' goes down. Butterscotch ain't like that though. She's been my pal for as long as I can remember. If anything happens to her, I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She trailed off as she clenched her fists tight. The loss of her trusty steed hit her harder than the sheriff would've imagined. He like most people in Gold Spring, always viewed Roxxie as a vile brute who lacked the capacity for friendship. Seeing her so distraught actually managed to make Percy feel for her plight. He reached out with intention of comforting her when she suddenly came to a halt. She had stopped in front of Gold Spring's local hospice, her tail wagging excitedly as she looked up at the second story window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second\" she said with a sinister grin.<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Miss Stanton, it's time for lunch~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas responded with a grunt as she struggled to lift her head up so that she could meet the nurse's gaze. It was rather difficult with the fully body cast obstructing her movement, though there was a good chance that she wouldn't even be able to move given how beaten and worn her body was. She was accustomed to taking a few licks on the job, but Roxxie had gone out of her way to leave a lasting mark on her psyche. It took some time for the doctors to calm her down, as she would fall asleep and have nightmares of the roo's gigantic rear end coming down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The nurse, a dainty old sheep anthro with comically large reading glasses, walked back into her room with a small silver tray of soft, easy to chew foods with a small glass of water. From where she laid, Texas could make out the outline of a flask in her breast pocket. The doctor had been adamant about Texas ingesting any alcohol, but that didn't stop the nurse from sneaking in a bit of whiskey for the good sheriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor got your test results back. You'll be good to go after a week of physical therapy. You're quite lucky, you know. Most folks wouldn't be able to walk after sustaining so much damage, not without years of treatment. I'd expect nothing less from the toughest lawman in all of Gold Springs\" the nurse said as she delicately removed the bandage covering Texas' mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas wanted to make a quip about her being the <i>only</i> lawman in Gold Springs, but thought better of it. As she opened her mouth to let the nurse feed her, she heard something that made her blood run cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Hey Texas! You'd better be ready, cus' I'm comin' up there to finish the job!\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sheriff's eyes went wide, her heart racing as the memories came flooding back into her mind. Two tons of kangaroo ass plummeting down towards her again and again and <b>again</b>. In her panicked state, she could practically see Roxxie stomping over to her with that wicked smile of hers, her enormous backside poised to completely annihilate the weasel. Adrenaline propelled her out of her bed as she ran around the room, desperately searching for a way to escape her approaching demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"M-Miss Stanton! Please, you need to stop! You'll exacerbate your injuries if you don't-\" </i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"KEEP HER AWAY! DON'T LET HER GET ME!!\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Roxxie snickered as she heard the ruckus above her. Texas had always been so proud and bold, so it amused the outlaw to no end to see her in such a state. She could hardly blame her though. After a beating like that, anyone would be shaken to the core, herself included. Still, it wasn't like the little runt didn't have it coming. If she didn't want to get trounced like that, she should've chosen a different line of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! That never gets old! Alright, let's get going. That varmint's gotta be here somewhere\" Roxxie snorted as she kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Percy nodded, though it took a moment for him to stop his legs from trembling. Getting that kind of reaction out of Texas was no simple feat. If anything, it was a good reminder of what could happen to him if he ever got on the Roxxie's bad side. He sighed and went back to following her, his mind going back to the threat at hand. They needed to catch Po before he caused any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He began thinking of ways they could better track when down when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

She needed that dumb weasel just a little bit closer to her. A moment's distraction was all she needed. With a barely contained scowl she waves the sheriff goodbye. Texas sees the unsettling expression on Callie's face and walks just a little bit faster away from the tigress. She didn't know why, but her gut told her she just dodged a bullet. That conversation sure was odd, she was certain this strange baker was up to something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a town like Gold Springs it seemed everyone wanted a piece of her. Bringing law to a place so long devoid of it was bound to bring out heavy resistance. But Texas did not accept this job because it was easy. She had the grit to see it through and make this sleepy little town a beacon of order. Granted, she'd probably end up arresting half the town for it, but if that's what it would take she wouldn't hesitate to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer righteous determination had her walking down the main street proudly. She overheard some of the citizens talking to eachother, and the rumor she picked up piqued her interest immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya heard o this doctor that set up just outside town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A doctor? Why'd we need another doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is a magic doctor, uses all sorts o hokey trinkets an' chants to heal ya. Mah ankles have been killin' me. One little potion from her and a weird song 'n ritual later an' the pain's gone. She says she's a witch and a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you haven't been drinkin some bad tequila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tellin ya, ye should see this witch-doctor. She said she could even help you find love...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two citizens burst into giggles, but the sheriff was intrigued. Was this for real or was this just another con-merchant selling water for a fortune and claiming it's a magical cure-all. They didn't bother letting her know about their arrival, which Texas always found a little suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down the street she saw a group of Vivian's thugs loitering around, huddled together. Of course Vivian would deny high and low that she even knew these bear and rhino ladies, but Texas had been around long enough to know they were the ones that took care of the mayor's dirty work. They were muttering among eachother in hushed whispers. The sheriff could barely make out what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New bounty hunter... Texas. Stinkin' weasel... found again. Old coal mine...\" The last sentence trailed off in laughter before one of the thugs spotted the sheriff listening in. The conversation halted and the brutes dispersed, some whistling innocently to themselves. Is mayor Vivian trying her luck with another cheap bounty hunter? The last one was still waiting for release in a jail cell after Texas handily kicked his ass up and down main street. At least the thugs were helpful enough to drop a location for her. The old coal mine. Gold Springs may've earned it's name off all the gold mines in the mountains, but there were a scant few shafts that found a different prize. The old coal mine was large, the only nearby source of coal to smelt all the gold in town. There's no telling what she might find in there, but it sounded like something worth investigating.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take Texas long to find the wagon of the witchdoctor. It stood out quite starkly in the desert plain, richly covered in deep blue cloth and all manner of trinkets. On the side facing the sheriff two large eyes were painted. Though it was just a picture on cloth, the weasel got the unnerving feeling those eyes were looking right at her. Her hand hovered close to her revolver when a voice rang out from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah, I have a visitor. Just a moment please.\" The voice was feminine, deep and infused with an exotic accent the sheriff had never heard before. Wherever this stranger was from, she'd traveled a long way to end up in Gold Springs. None of it soothed Texas' nerves. This could be a clever ambush for all she knew. It was to her relief that when the small door at the back of the wagon opened, a petite cheetah woman stepped out. She moved with grace as she introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, miss Texas. Da spirits told me much about you. Dey see a heavy burden you bear. In a town like dis, few would willingly take up de mantle of de law.\" The sheriff was surprised she knew her. Had they met before and did she simply forget about it? Furthermore she was taken aback by the cheetah's appearance. She was about as tall as her, a welcome break from all the villains she usually dealt with that towered over her. She wore a revealing deep blue dress matching the fabric on her wagon. Much like it she wore many exotic trinkets. Her spots were intricate in design and she'd used black paint to make the ones on her arms even more elaborate, turning some into little suns and stars. The same was done to her eyes, surrounding them in an intriguing black outline. Her piercing yellow eyes darted up and down, thoroughly inspecting her visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come seeking answers, and I can help you with sight and spirit. Please, do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm.\" Her words were calming, but the sheriff remained apprehensive as she followed the cheetah into her wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was cozy and surprisingly spacious. Texas was invited into a seat with the mysterious witchdoctor sitting opposite of her. The dim lamplight gave the whole thing an air of mysticism, but the sheriff was here on business. She cleared her throat and began asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da spirits gave me many names, but most know me as Abrajin. You can call me Abra for short if dat pleases you, Texas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seek to help however I can. Be it with a tonic to aid de body or a spell to aid the spirit. My spells even help those in need find love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"spells?\" Texas scoffed. She'd met her fair share of two-bit illusionists selling their 'magic'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You reek of doubt, lawman. I cannot blame you. Many foolishly claim to posses the gifts I have. None I've met had anything other than regret in the face of what I can do. I assure you, my spells are no mere hollow words. And profiting off them is hard when I give them freely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freely? Then how do you make money to buy food and things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bit of an entertainer on de side. Fortune telling and all that. Just harmless fun, or so dey think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas raised a suspicious brow. \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing big, sheriff. It's just real hard to tell de difference between a clever story about one's future and a prophecy from da spirits themselves. If I can give an example, da spirits see much conflict in your future. But I think we could have both guessed that one already.\" The weasel smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing miss Abrajin, why did you never come to me when you arrived in Gold Springs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I not? Are you not here right now? Or did you think it to be a coincidence you overhead those two talking about me?\" She laughed ominously before continuing. \"Da spirits work in many ways to guide us. Keep an open mind and you can see much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or ya took your best guess at how ah came to know you were here. Much like how ya could tell ah'm a sheriff from the badge, which also conveniently has ma name on it. Let me warn you here 'an now. I've run plenty of con artists out of this town and if ah get so much as a hint that you're trying to scam anyone, you'll need more than spirits to stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra's voice turned sour. \"Very well, I see you prefer living in your own closed off world. Den I only hope you will handle it better when the walls of your reality come crashing down on you. Leave now. You came to know my name and you have it. Scams and con artists are the last thing you have to fear, sherrif Texas Stanton. There are pawns being moved in de shadows. Powerful foes looking to usurp you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, they're called Vivian and Georgia and they've been trying unsuccessfully for months now. Goodbye miss Jin, keep on the right side of the law or we're gonna have trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be wary on de way out.\" the cheetah call after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a threat?\" Texas spat back before bumping into a grizzly looking totem, scratching her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just a lot of people bump into dat thing.\" Abra replied with a smug grin. The sheriff muttered and cursed under her breath. She didn't have time for this. But as she went back about her business, the cheetah carefully picked the strands of weasel fur left behind on the totem. She dug up a small doll and stuffed the sheriff's fur in before stitching it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you and I will have some fun, miss Texas.\" She said sinisterly as she dug through her things to find the items she needed for her next big trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somewhere amidst the rush she even popped open the door to hang a 'in session'-sign on the outside. She'd been looking for someone to play with and the stubborn weasel seemed like just the right mark. The payment she'd gotten from Vivian was almost too sweet a bonus. The cheetah would let Texas feel the full range of her witchcraft. Incense was being burned and strange phrases sung as she entered a trance. Lying at the heart of her maze of trinkets was the small doll containing some of the sheriff's fur. The lamps inside flickered wildly as Abra channeled all her knowledge into the room. Be it spirits, magical trinkets or her wildly flailing arms, the spell seemed to affect the small items on the floor. They rattled and shook, twisting to face the doll. The witchdoctor was fully immersed in her trance, chanting ever faster until she spoke nothing but gibberish. Louder and louder she chanted until the final verse blew through the wagon, extinguishing all the lanterns. The only light left was the spark of mischief in Abra's eyes as she picked up the doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready, sheriff Texas. Because dis is goin to be one wild trip for you...\" The doll seemed to hum with life, a sign the spell had worked. Abrajin went about tidying up her wagon, pleased in the knowledge her spell had been a success. The weasel would be feeling the consequences of her insolence soon enough. Day quickly made way for night and without any further incidents the sheriff closed up shop and went home. That night she slept well, but in the morning she was in for a shock.</span></div></div>",

Her bed felt more comfortable than ever before, but another long day of upholding the law awaited. These criminals weren't going to arrest themselves. When the blur of just waking up faded reality set in. The sheriff's heart almost skipped a beat as she looked in awe at the sheer size of her room. Everything was enormous and with growing fear she turned to look at her bed and nightstand. No wonder her bed felt so comfy all of a sudden. She was no more than a foot tall! What the hell had happened to her?! Suddenly she smacked her forehead and knew there could be only one answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abra, that pest!\" She yelled out. Cursing under her breath the weasel took stock of her surroundings. She had the good fortune of still wearing her outfit, which had shrunk with her. Far less pleasant was the look of her gun. She'd put it on her nightstand before going to bed and as such it was spared the effects of the witchdoctor's tricks. It was the size of a large cannon to Texas, completely useless. Granted, a gun at her size probably wouldn't do much anyway, but she felt naked walking around without it. With some effort she clambered down the side of her bed and up to a window. Outside everything was still normal, she was the only one affected by Abra. No doubt her harsh words did not sit well with the strange cheetah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs loathe as she was to admit it, the sheriff needed her help now. But that required getting to her, which meant getting through town. If none of the townsfolk stepped on her by accident she still had to worry. Both Vivian and Georgia would love to get their hands on her in this state. Texas shudders at the mere thought of ending up in their grasp. She couldn't risk waiting either. Who knows if this was as small as she was going to get. She only had a precious dozen inches in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel hopped down from the window and walked to the door. It was ill-fitting enough to let her slip underneath, a small blessing in disguise. Texas doubted her ability to open the door normally, smiling wryly at the thought of all the acrobatics it would take to even reach the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at ground level and seeing the huge town stretch out before her further cemented the sheer enormity of her task. She had to find Abra and convince her to change her back to normal. With a deep breath she set off on her journey.</span></div></div>",

Her diminished size granted her easier access to hiding spots that she normally would've glossed over in her normal size. The ease of her task did little ease her fears however. At her height, even her weakest of foes posed a considerable threat to her. She couldn't afford to make even the smallest mistake, least she wind up squashed flat and used as an insole for the rest of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She stayed close to the walls as she progressed, her eyes darting back and forth as she made absolute sure that heads were turned her way. For the most part, the town was rather scarce, as most folks didn't share her daunting sleep schedule and were still asleep. The people that were out and about were the folks who worked long, thankless hours at high risk jobs. As such, they were too preoccupied on the day ahead to pay much attention to their surroundings, allowing Texas to skirt by unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was on instance where she thought someone had spotted her. A lumbering gator anthro was on his way to the coal mines we he suddenly stopped and turned her way. The sheriff froze and felt her heart begin to race. Even at her regular size, this man would cut quite the intimidating figure. Just when she thought that she would have to fight for her life, the gator sucked his teeth and walked away. She was puzzled by his behavior when she turned her attention upward. Above her head there was a notice on the wall from Mayor Vivian talking about her new tax plan. Judging by his irritable and dismissive demeanor, it was clear that his attention was on the poster rather than Texas herself. She breathed a sigh of relief and continued onward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Little by little, Texas made her way over to the wagon. She wasn't sure what she would even do once she arrived at her destination. She wasn't the type to beg, but if that's what it took to convince Abra to reverse the spell, she'd do it with little hesitation. She didn't have much time to considering her options when she spotted something quite troubling. The bear and rhino ladies she had previously eavesdropped on were standing outside of the post office, chatting it up as they awaited orders from Vivian. The road in front of them was completely barren due to people avoiding their general vicinity. Texas didn't want to run the risk of being spotted by them and opted to cut through the nearest alleyway in order to slip by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This would prove to be a problem as well. She didn't get very far before she found herself standing several feet away from a rat girl that she instantly recognized to be one of Vivian's goons. On any normal day, Texas would scoff at the idea of being intimidated by such a puny specimen, as she would stand almost a head above her. With her new height, the sheriff was seeing the runty little rodent in a whole new light. No longer was she a scrawny little punk that she could easily brush past. Now she was a towering amazon of a woman who could squash her flat beneath her plump rear and powerful thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, the rat didn't seem to notice her presence right away as she sat against the wall drinking her cares away. She was lucky enough to be off duty for a moment and was trying to get as much enjoyment out of her free time as she could. Texas slowly began to back away from her, taking great care to not make any noise as she did so. There was nothing for her to hide behind, so even the slightest sound could make the thug shift her gaze back upward. The sheriff was so preoccupied in keeping his attention on the woman in front of her that she didn't hear the light footsteps plodding behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah! You back here?!\" a voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas' eyes widened as the rat woman turned her attention to the source of the voice, which happened to be in her direction. She prayed that her presence would go unnoticed like it did with the gator, but that wasn't the case. The thug's eyes widened in shock as she stared at the sheriff, her gazes shifting to her bottle a couple of times as though she were debating whether what she was seeing was an alcohol induced hallucination. Texas wasn't going to wait for her to decide as she turned to make break for it, though she didn't get very far before she ran into a jean cladded wall. The woman who had called out to Sarah had rounded the corner and bumped into Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" the woman in front of her inquired as she looked down at the shrunken sheriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The woman in front of her was yet another rodent but with a slightly dark coat than Sarah. Now that she was up close to one of them, Texas was frozen in a mixture of awe and fear. It was nothing short of surreal to be put in such a position, where one of the tiniest and weakest of thugs was now might giant. And from her shrunken perspective, she couldn't help but finally take notice to how stacked rat anthros really were. So much so that the sheriff couldn't even see past the woman's hefty bosom. As if reading her mind, the woman before her reached down and picked her up by the scruff of her neck, bringing her to eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Texas? Is that you?\" she asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh... n-nope... ah ain't never heard'a no Texas, partner!\" Texas said with a nervous laugh. The thug seemed to disregard her response as she looked over to Sarah who was still sitting and looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Sarah! Get a loud of this! It's like a pint sized Texas!\" she called with a grin. The shock of her discovery was quick to wear off as her mind quickly shifted over to the opportunities it presented. Sarah nodded and tossed her beer bottle to the side as she ran over to join her friend in examining the puny creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think it's really her, Sandy?\" Sarah asked as she poked Texas a few times in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas' eyes widened as she was hit with a sudden epiphany. These weren't any ordinary rodents she was dealing with. She actually recognized them! They were two of Vivian's most skilled informants and runners, Sandy and Sarah Mayflower. She had more than a few run ins with them on her patrols, often catching them in the middle of a crooked exchange of some kind. Those instances would typically end with her beating the snot out of the two putting them away until the mayor used her connections to bail them out. All of a sudden, the sheriff didn't quite feel so confident in her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... but it don't really matter none, does it? Even if it ain't really Texas, it still looks like her!\" Sandy chortled before tossing Texas onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so... but what should we do with her? We do kinda owe her a beating from last time, don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do that... or we can bring her to the mayor and get a sweet promotion!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would the mayor want with a tiny Texas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. To use as a seat cushion or somethin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the two debated on what to do with the tiny lawman, Texas began to slowly crawl away from them. She barely made it an inch before a foot slammed onto her stomach knocking the wind out of her complete. Sandy had planted her foot onto her chest and didn't even bother to stop the conversation as she did so. After a bit of discussion, the two sisters decided to... </span></div></div>",

We's gonna get ourselves a sweet promotion handin you over to the mayor.\" Sandy proudly announced whilst reaching down to grab the sheriff. The weasel didn't get a chance to flee the approaching hand as she was still painfully pinned beneath the rat's large foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable, these two scrawny pukes were treating her like a prize to hand in to the mayor. When she got big again Texas would have to sort this injustice out with a beating like they've never felt before. But getting big seemed like a distant pipe dream in the crushing grip of Sandy. She kept the sheriff out of sight as she and her sister made her way to town hall. The weasel tried everything to escape, even biting down on the rat's finger. But all she earned was a painful squeeze from her captor. Overhead she could hear the two thugs talking to the clerk at town hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy, we'd like to see the mayor. It's related to important business, so make it snappy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got an appointment?\" The weary cat receptionist asked, politeness quickly fading from her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, this popped up kinda suddenly, and we think the mayor would be very interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline clerk was about to tell the pair to hit the road when the door to Vivian's office flew open. A furious mayor stared the two down, ready to knock them dead with an angry glare. Her cool demeanor was barely holding together. She loudly hissed at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two, in my office! NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas could hear the rats gulp as they shuffled into Vivian's office. If the mayor was in a foul mood already it won't bode well for her. She heard the mayor put on her friendliest voice, suggesting the clerk take an extra little break. The cat could always appreciate another excuse not to work and knew all too well what these breaks meant. Vivian needed to discuss something without any unwanted ears listening in. The mayor hung the 'closed'-sign on the town hall door and stomped back into her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you two knuckleheads better have a DAMN good reason for showing up here! I don't need anyone talking about us being seen together. I can't have that obnoxious weasel finding any evidence to tie me to your... 'activities'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian was ready to go on a full tirade, but Sandy interjected. \"That's precisely why we're here, Viv. I think you're gonna like this. Lookie here...\" She pulled her hand out of her pocket, revealing the shrunken sheriff and depositing her on the mayor's desk. Texas coughed and groaned from the rough treatment, struggling to adjust herself to the sudden light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the hell?! How is she this small? Is this the real Texas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the swearin's anythin to go by, there's no mistakin it. This is Texas. As to why she's suddenly so tiny, your guess is as good as mine. But we figger'd you might want to make use of her unfortunate condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian's eyes lit up with opportunity, each new idea more devious than the last. This was a golden opportunity to rid herself of that pesky sheriff for good. She might even be tempted to dirty her hands on this. Daintily she reached down towards the shrunken weasel, who quickly tried to bat her hand away. With a cruel smile the lynx grabbed hold of the tiny weasel, squeezing her a little just to hear her squeak. She found herself a little flustered, capable of subduing the sheriff so easily. Normally Texas would beat her handily in a fight. She relied on never being anywhere near the crimes she ordered to make sure the weasel had no legal reason to come after her. But now she could do anything to her. Texas was completely at her mercy. A tinge of her predatory nature ran down her spine like a pleasant shiver. The tiny weasel in her hand looked strangely appetizing. First things first, she needed to deal with the pair of rats that brought her the sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, you two. I'll see to it that you're handsomely rewarded once I'm done. For now, leave me. I have some business to attend to with our dear sheriff. If you see my clerk having a smoke outside, tell her to take the day off. I expect this might take some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas is held tightly by the mayor. She patiently waits for the rats to leave before sitting down at her desk. She gives the helpless sheriff another painful squeeze before dropping her on the large desk. The weasel tried to scrabble onto her feet but a large paw came down on top of her. Vivian relished the ease with which she could control her nemesis. She could make the sheriff do so many humiliating things. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toying with Texas brought a big smile to Vivian's face. Ever since that damn sheriff had arrived she had to be so careful not to get caught. That little weasel loved to make a big show of her wild accusations and the mayor had to keep her poker face up as she heard all her crimes laid out. Every time the sheriff managed to trace the actions of her goons back to her, but not once was there any proof. Well, until today that is. But with the tiny weasel helplessly struggling beneath her might that would soon stop being a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready the mayor was envisioning the horrible fates that could befall her nemesis. She could bring her to one of the bandit gangs living in the old mines and fields. They'd love to have some time with a shrunken Texas. Georgia too wouldn't mind handling the tiny weasel for her. With that enormous butt she could shove the sheriff in so deep she'd never be seen again. But her growling stomach made the call for Vivian. For once, she'd get her hands dirty. But not before having a lot more fun at the expense of this diminutive weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas scrambled onto her feet whenever the mayor stopped pushing, but the looming paw simply overwhelmed her and pressed her back down again. When she finally stopped the weasel was ready to give Vivian a piece of her mind. But before she could start yelling the mayor picked her up by her head, pinching it painfully between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? Did you want to say something? Was it how you were always in awe of me? Did you want to compliment me on how I run my town?\" Or did you just want to waste your breath on begging for mercy? No, you wouldn't do that. You're too proud to beg, and you've probably already figured out that witnessing my little exchange with those ladies sealed your fate. That and the laundry list of 'assaulting an officer of the law' of course.\" She squeezed the sheriff's head a little more to accentuate her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff squirmed even harder as Vivian brought her other paw close, claws out and ready. She'd be able to slash the weasel to ribbons in a single swipe, but mercifully the mayor didn't seem intent on making a mess. The sleek claw merely hooked itself around Texas' collar and slid down, tearing through the fabric of her jacket with ease. The same deliberate effort was applied to her pants and undergarments until the weasel was dangling in the air with not a thread of clothing left on her. She'd never felt so embarrassed in her life. Vivian put little Texas back down on the pile of scraps that used to be her outfit. The mayor couldn't help but salivate a little, seeing the naked weasel standing on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you looking tasty right now...\" She murmured, before her next cruel plan unfolded. She couldn't just east the sheriff, that's barbaric. Texas would probably be all stringy and chewy. She needed to be tenderized and Vivian knew exactly how. The weasel wasn't given a moment's pause before she found herself in the mayor's crushing grasp once more. This time Vivian stood up, reaching behind her and dropping the sheriff on the soft seat of her chair. The quilted fabric was still warm and Texas could only scream in terror as the now enormous butt of Vivian came back to add to that warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor laughed heartily as she felt the little weasel get crushed beneath her. She'd taken care to ensure only a single buttcheek would land on her. No reprieves by hiding between her cute little buns, the sheriff would feel the full weight of her vengeance. In mere moments she felt the body of Texas squish flat and with a gleeful smirk she rubbed her butt back and forth. Rubbing it in further didn't seem to do much, but damn did it feel good. She could keep the flattened weasel here for the rest of her days and never grow tired of it. But keeping Texas around was too much of a risk. It was time to end this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vivian leaned down on the flattened weasel one last time before standing up and retrieving Texas. Her smile grew a mile wide just seeing the pathetic little stain her cute butt had reduced the sheriff to. If only all lawbringers were as good at kissing her ass. She'd squished the weasel so thoroughly it actually took a bit of effort to peel her free from the cushioned seat. Finally as the sheriff began to reform a little she came loose. The mayor held her by one of her feet, dangling her before that massive smile. The huge toothy grin was nothing short of unnerving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, in a strange way I'm going to miss this, Texas. Sure you were a constant pain in my neck with your baseless allegations, but my girls have had so much fun with you over the years. Remember that time we locked you in your own prison so all the inmates could have a few days of fun?\" The weasel cringed at the thought. It had taken her weeks to wash out the stench of that little encounter. \"Or when we strapped you to Roxxie Roo's horse? I didn't think you'd walk away from that one. But now it seems like our time has run out. Let's hope the next sheriff has enough common sense to know who's in charge around here. Then again, if they can be presented to me like a tasty morsel too, maybe I can get used to this. By the way, how <i>did</i> you end up so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah got a strong suggestion, but ah'm never gonna tell that to the likes o' you.\" The tiny weasel huffed proudly. She was almost certain Abra was behind this. Who else could pull tricks like this off? But the less Vivian knew about the witchdoctor, the better. Maybe she'll end up getting shrunk too somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncooperative to the very end, right?\" Vivian said with a giggle. \"Wouldn't have expected any different. Very well, time to end this.\" She leaned back a little and opened her maw wide. The glistening teeth sent a shiver of fear through the little weasel. Slowly the mayor moved her prey directly above her mouth, the yawning chasm of her gullet eager to receive its meal. She closed her eyes and listened intently for any tiny pleas for mercy, but Texas merely tried to struggle and shake herself free. The two fingers holding her by the ankle pinched a little, just to make the sheriff yelp in pain for a second. Such a shame she couldn't be kept around any longer, but as mayor Vivian had appearances to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel shrieked with horror and shock as she was dropped into the mayor's waiting maw. The last faint glimmer of hope that this was all some elaborate extortion attempt faded away as she fell headfirst into the wet tunnel of Vivian's throat. The lynx didn't even bother to chew on her. A loud gulp sucked most of Texas' body into that narrow fleshy tunnel and a few more sealed the deal. Slowly she felt herself sliding down the mayor's neck and towards her belly. Of all the ways the crooked mayor might be her end, she never pictured her being swallowed whole by Vivian. The undulating tunnel gave way to a cramped stomach. She fell headfirst into the stinky sludge at the base of the mayor's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lynx contently pats her belly. It would make short work of that infernal sheriff. Things were about to change a lot in Gold Springs. First she'd promote Georgia to sheriff, then she'd be free to use her goons to shake down every wealthy citizen in town. Anyone who spoke up could count on a painful visit from the new face of the law. Her evil machinations were interrupted by a loud belch. Vivian covered her mouth and smiled. Today would be a good day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mayor looked at her tiny prey with disdain. Every second with the puny sheriff in her office was one too much. She needed to be sure nobody would ever come across the weasel again. For a while she thought about just dealing with this herself. She hadn't eaten lunch yet and the tiny critter looked mighty appetizing. But the thought of eating something that all of her thugs had sat on at least once put the sheriff firmly off the menu. She needed someone or something far less scrupulous to ensure the weasel would vanish forever. Already a shortlist of names crossed her mind. Texas wasn't short on enemies in this town. But how does she get the tiny weasel to them without her screaming blue murder. She contemplated her options whilst using the puny sheriff as a stress ball, smiling whenever she forces a pained squeak out of the weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Vivian had a plan. She squeezed her little stress ball extra hard, crushing the shape out of the weasel. The mayor dropped her little toy on her desk and started rummaging around her office for the required items. She hunted down thick paper and wads of cotton. She deftly folded together a small box, intermittently slamming a palm or fist down on Texas to stop her from reforming into a shape capable of running away. The mayor couldn't recall the last time she had this much fun. She lined the small box with cotton and stuffed the sheriff inside. The thick padding stopped her from shaking about and made it hard to move. A last wad of cotton was stuffed in Texas' mouth, so she wouldn't draw any unwanted attention with her high-pitched squeaking. The sheriff looked up to the mayor in fear as the she folded the box shut and taped it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmothered in her fluffy prison Texas can barely hear what's going on outside. Suddenly her world was shaken up as Vivian carried the small box with her. The sheriff could hear muffled words, but nothing could pierce the padded cell she was in. She was surprised to say the least the mayor would make her journey this comfortable. But she was no fool. The padding was only there to make sure no undue attention was drawn to the package. She tried to push aside the cotton wad crammed into her mouth, but there was barely any space to maneuver. By the time she'd pushed it away the courier was already out of town. He or she would be the only one that would hear her pleas. And knowing Vivian, the only people she'd trust a package like this to were her goons. The sheriff began tearing away some of the padding, letting in more sound. Fast hoofbeats told her what she feared already. She was being taken somewhere out of town. She could only hope there'd be a long journey ahead to give her a chance to escape. Then she'd be faced with a grueling journey back to town. Then she'd have to hope Abra was still around to reverse this curse. How did things get this much out of hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no more time for pity. The hoofbeats slowed down and came to a halt. She heard the courier dismount, her boots thudding on the ground. A voice rang out. It was too garbled still to determine who it was, but stuck in the box the sheriff could listen in. What words she could make out didn't fill her with confidence. \"present\", \"disappear\", \"never seen again\", \"have fun\". The box shook wildly again. A short knife poked in, scaring Texas half to death. It slid through the tape and the box folded open. The piercing sunlight blinded the sheriff. As her eyes adjusted she saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She still felt half asleep when someone knocked on her door. Whoever was disturbing her better be ready for the fallout, she was in the market for a new fart cushion. To her surprise she found one of Vivian's more loyal henchmen at the door. The rat handed her a package, a present from the mayor, apparently. The messenger kept talking, but Roxxie had already stopped paying attention. She went back inside, throwing the door shut in the rat's face. Puzzled, she grabbed a knife and opened the package. She was surprised to hear a sudden peep come from it, but her eyes got even bigger when she laid eyes on the tiny weasel carefully packaged inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? A doll? Th' heck is Vivian sendin me a doll for?\" She was overwhelmed with curiosity, reaching in to poke the small thing in its belly. The kangaroo yelped when the weasel slapped the chubby digit away, swearing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get yer damn mitts of me, bandit! Lemme outta here, I got a boot to shove up Vivian's ass! That damn varmint's got a world of hurt comin her way!\" Before the little critter could get up and jump out of the box Roxxie grabbed hold of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't no doubt about it, you're the real Texas. But how in the world did ya get this small? I could fit yer whole body under half a buttcheek.\" The weasel glared up at her, staring daggers as she got more and more angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None 'o yer damn business! Now unhand me and let me-\" The large roo frowned at the shouty weasel, squeezing the air out of her lungs. Just for good measure Roxxie gave the sheriff a few more painful squeezes before lifting the groaning weasel to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody gets ta mouth off 't me like that and walk away.\" A cruel smile formed on the bandit's face. A tiny sheriff is something she wouldn't be seeing again for a long time. She wanted to make the most of this opportunity. There was plenty of time later to ask Vivian where she found a way to shrink Texas. With a triumphant grin she walked up to her favorite chair and dumped the weasel in the seat. The sheriff had been here before. Roxxie Roo had gassed her nearly unconscious flattening her in this very chair. She was lucky her deputies busted in right on time. But today nobody knew she was here. And that horrible butt looming over her is now several times bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie Roo doesnt offer the sheriff an ounce of mercy and drops her butt down on the shrunken weasel. She snorts with laughter as her massive rear flattens the weasel so thoroughly she couldn't tell whether she'd actually sat down on her or not. But after raising her butt for a second and hearing a defeated groan she had all the confirmation she needed. The bandit sat back down and slowly shuffled back and forth, grinding her enormous rear atop the sheriff. And just when it seemed things couldn't get any worse a loud rumbly fart fills the air with noxious fumes. Texas was already struggling against the overwhelming weight. The heavy roo was a fearsome enemy even at their normal sizes. Right now she was pulverizing her entiry body without even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the sheriff receives a small mercy as the vast bottom of Roxxie rises. Chubby fingers reach in and with some difficulty the flattened weasel is peeled free from the colossal roo butt. She can't recall a time where she'd been squashed more thoroughly than just now. Not even Georgia or Vivian's fattest thugs could compare. No time to spare though, as the joyous smirk of the bandit came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter the size, yer always a right delight ta sit on, sheriff. Now, since you're not goin anywhere in a hurry, how about we get you a little more acquainted with the 'ol place. I'm sure Butterscotch would be delighted to get to know your new size better. Or I suppose I could just keep ya to meself. Can't lie, there's lotsa things I wanna try now that yer this puny.\"</span></div></div>",

She simply leaned onto the side of the pen, resting her head on her arms and watching her horse rise up to inspect the tiny interloper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas is shocked silent at the heavy thumps behind her. She turns around to see Butterscotch towering over her. Roxxie Roo's horse was big under normal circumstances, but now the sheriff looked no larger than a carrot to the horse. Her large head dipped down for a closer look, unsure of what to make of this strange critter in her pen. The horse loudly sniffed the air, the gale force making the tiny sheriff unsteady on her feet. Butterscotch couldn't make sense of this. It smelled just like that sheriff she'd tormented so many times. But it was too small. Did it matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie had seen her horse deal with mice in her pen before, cornering them and gassing them with her massive farts until they'd fled or passed out. Those that fell unconscious were quickly dispatched, either by a devastating butt slam or simply by eating them. The bandit kept looking closely at the shivering weasel. She smiled calmly as Texas' threats turned to desperate pleas for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please get me outta here! Ah promise ya won't be persecuted if ya let me walk away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch had seen and heard enough of this little nuisance in her pen. It was time to show this puny thing why she was the most feared horse in the West. She didn't know why the roo seemed so interested in her reaction, but she'd make Roxxie proud by dealing with this weird critter that smelled like Texas. </span></div></div>",

The hoof easily matches her in size and she does not want to find out what happens if Butterscotch lands a hit. She makes a run for it, chased by more heavy impacts, each more closely nipping at her heels than the last. The sheriff zigs and zags, dodging the heavy hooves slamming down left and right of her. Even Roxxie was briefly impressed by the weasel's dexterity, but against such overwhelming force she wouldn't last. The horse only needed to be lucky once and Texas was beginning to waver. Finally the towering equine predicted her prey's movements correctly and landed a hoof right on top of the sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment between feeling the hard surface collide with her head and the hoof landing on the floor seemed nearly instantaneous. In a flash Texas' world went dark, covered by the horse's hoof. She flattened out like a pancake, sticking to the coarse surface that just squashed her. Roxxie Roo burst out laughing, seeing the little sheriff all but vanish beneath her horse's hooves. Butterscotch made it look so easy, simply putting her hoof down on Texas and just squashing her flat like that. The horse, encouraged by her owner, lifted her hoof and brought it down on the flattened sheriff a few more times. The weasel produced a strained squeak every single time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, ya should see yerself right now!\" Roxxie hollered, wiping away tears of laughter. Butterscotch was less impressed. The little critter bored her to no end. She didn't even feel much like eating it. The horse simply trotted back to the corner she'd been relaxing in, leaving the sheriff a miserable heap slowly reforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie Roo sighs a little, seeing her partner in crime's disinterest. It was clear she needed to help this situation out. She couldn't let Texas off with just one measly little stomping. She hopped into the pen, carefully ensuring she'd land on the weasel. Her heavy feet quickly squashed any chances of reforming. The cruel bandit twisted her big feet a little, feeling the flattened sheriff rub against her soles. A small moan escaped her, causing Butterscotch to look at her with bemusement. The roo smiled. This puny weasel hadn't seen nearly enough of her magnificent horse just yet. She lifted her long foot up and peeled the sheriff off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Texas firmly in hand, Roxxie Roo approached her trusty steed. \"It's okay, girl. We're just gonna play a little with our tiny friend here. You remember mean 'ol Texas, right?\" The horse snorted and huffed, equal parts angered and gleeful. \"Easy girl, this here is Texas. She just managed 't get shrunk since last we saw her.\" Butterscotch immediately understood her rider's fascination with the little critter. If she'd let her loose in the pen again, the horse was going to make a real show of punishing this little thing. But Roxxie didn't want to be on the sidelines for this adventure. She stroked the mane of her partner in crime and brought the tiny sheriff to...</span></div></div>",

Many sheriffs, deputies and other victims had met their smelly end between the massive jiggling cheeks of Butterscotch. Her farts rendered those trapped between her buttcheeks unconscious or worse. The horse didn't care much which, as long as Roxxie was pleased. When mere stench alone was not enough she happily brought her weight to bear, sitting down on her helpless victims. The feeling of their squirming bodies flattening out beneath her filled the horse with joy. And of all the things she'd smashed flat and gassed unconscious, Texas was her favorite. Butterscotch couldn't wait for what was about to happen as the roo bandit brought the shrunken weasel close to those enormous asscheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie felt the sheriff's puny struggles grow stronger, but it was futile. Texas was at their mercy and they were going to make the most out of this situation. But as the bandit looked over the vast surface of Butterscotch's butt, she realizes there's more than one way to make the weasel miserable. First a little starter. She brought the weasel right up to one of the immense, smelly asscheeks and squeezed, drawing a pained squeak from Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it.\" The roo commanded sternly. When the weasel refused she squeezed again and demanded the same thing. It took a few more rounds of crushing torment before a whimpering sheriff finally pushed out her tongue and licked the contaminated fur. It tasted like nothing she could've imagined in her worst nightmares. Roxxie smirked as the weasel fought hard not to gag and throw up. Butterscotch let out a content little fart to show her appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the big guns...\" Roxxie growled, her voice both intimidating and overflowing with malicious glee.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Texas was helpless to resist the tight grip of the roo bandit. Every struggle was punished with a powerful squeeze. Roxxie demanded complete submission as she poked Butterscotch's vast asscheeks with the little sheriff. Their surface was nasty, coated in sweat and the foul, caustic stench of horse farts and worse. Whenever it was commanded, the weasel stuck out her tongue, forced to clean the putrid cheeks. Her belly ached from the foul residue she lapped away, but stopping was not an option in the roo's cruel task. As this nightmare progressed the only thing new was an increasingly potent stench in the air. Not just the small farts steadily sputtering out of Butterscotch's rear, but something else. A strange, musky scent. The sheriff looked around and began to fear the worst. Either Roxxie, her horse or both of them were getting off on this. Texas hoped against all hopes that this was an elaborate nightmare, but the roo quickly squeezed her for slacking off, shouting orders at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I tell ya to stop? You ain't goin nowhere until you licked clean Butterscotch's entire ass. Now hop to it!\" She gleefully dragged the little weasel along the massive surface of her horse's ass. But long before Texas would have been able to finish the job the bandit was growing bored. At this pace this was going to take hours, and she couldn't make the sheriff go any faster. With a reluctant sigh she pulled the weasel back, looking at her sad little face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, Ah think we both know how this is gonna end. So let's skip all this here foreplay and go straight for the main attraction.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas wanted to throw a snarky response back at her, but her words turned to incoherent screaming as she was brought towards the horse's twitching butthole. The sheriff was no stranger to Butterscotch's rear. She'd felt that nasty little hole pressed against her nose, suffocating her in a barrage of nasty farts. But now that same pucker was big enough to cover her nose, her entire head and then some. It utterly reeked of horse manure and glistened with sweat and who knows what else. The sheriff fought with everything she had, but in Roxxie's grip it was useless. Slowly that intimidating fleshy ring came closer until she was in licking distance. She feared the order coming from behind her. Anything but that. But it wasn't Roxxie that spoke up next. Instead the nasty butthole opened a little and a hot stream of gas washed over the sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie watched with sadistic delight as the little weasel squirmed in her hand. She felt the rush of hot air too. The bandit could only imagine the smelly hell she'd put her victim in. But she wasn't done yet. Odds are she'll never get this chance again. She had the tiny sheriff in her hand and she knew annoying little weasels that small could only go one place. She pushed her victim against the twitching butthole, drawing a surprised snort and whinny from her horse. Butterscotch quickly accepted the situation and in a nightmarish display her asshole opened just a little to accept the weasel's head. Unbelievable, the sheriff in her hand was now so small she'd fit right up a horse's ass. How could Roxxie not capitalize on this? She began pushing more of the weasel inside, Butterscotch leaning back to greedily accept her new prisoner. When only a dangling pair of legs were left outside the bandit let go, stepping back to admire her handiwork. It was now up to Butterscotch to determine Texas' fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panicked sheriff squeaked and squirmed, but none of it did anything but arouse the horse more. She was packed in a cramped tunnel, Butterscotch's fleshy pucker squeezing around her waist. She could feel the cold air just outside brushing against her legs. Inside Texas was forced to breathe a pestilent miasma of stale air and horse farts. The squishy walls were coated in thick slime and spots of horse manure. They bore down on the weasel with remarkable strength, crushing her almost as heavily as the roo's grip before. What other horrifying feats was this horse capable of?</span></div></div>",

The walls trembled, squeezing and releasing the sheriff over and over, coating her with nasty slime and making simply breathing a herculean challenge. In spite of being stuck halfway up Butterscotch's ass the weasel could still hear Roxxie Roo laughing. That bandit was going to pay for this. Texas didn't know how yet, but she was going to find Abra and convince her to shrink the roo. Then we'll see how much she likes being stuck up a horse's ass herself. It almost felt like a poetic piece of justice, shoving Roxxie Roo up her own horse's butt. Butterscotch probably wouldn't even care. But Texas' vindictive daydreams were rudely interrupted when she felt the fleshy pucker around her waist loosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch felt her prey wiggling more fiercely than ever before. But she had no plans to release the sheriff. Instead she snorted and huffed, the narrow passage holding the weasel slowly shifting. Texas didn't quite catch what happened, but when the sensitive pucker closed again it was clear as day. Roxxie Roo looked on with fascination as the horse had pulled its victim in a little bit deeper. The bandit never thought it was possible. Her laughter stopped and she looked at those little legs as the horse grunted again. The bandit's house could be on fire and she wouldn't know it, her gaze fixed on her steed's backside. Seeing it slowly suck in Texas made her feel almost uncomfortably aroused. Roxxie had dreamed about getting rid of Texas for years, but this was not how she imagined it to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel struggled with everything she had, but against the enormous horse butt there was nothing she could do. Her every move was easily suppressed when the passage tightened around her, squeezing her from all sides. More and more of her legs entered the warmth of Butterscotch's ass and she didn't need to be psychic to know the horse would only stop once she'd claimed Texas completely. The only option left was to pray to whatever might listen that the horse pushes her back out before the horrible stench would be the sheriff's doom. Her odds were slim, but she would not give up. She'd endure this torment, escape and recover her normal size. Then she would bring down such righteous fury on Roxxie Roo no bandit in the Wild West would ever dare cross the sheriff of Gold Springs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now though, she shuddered at the feeling of her lower legs and feet slowly disappearing up the horse's ass. She was completely enveloped by slimy flesh, spots of manure and a stench so dense you could lean on it. Her nose ached and her eyes watered. Whatever weak squirming she manages is repaid with a crushing squeeze from the narrow tunnel. Whatever happened to her next was entirely up to the cruel horse. </span></div></div>",

Her legs flailed outside of the twitching pucker, helpless to assist in her escape. The slimy surfaces of Butterscotch's rectum squeezed the weasel, coating her in filth. The only reprieve for Texas was the absence of a colon full of shit waiting to get out. The sheriff shudders at the thought. With her current size each of those horse apples would be as big as her if not bigger. But though the rectum was almost empty, the stench didn't diminish one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of horse farts hung so thickly in the air that if there was any light in there Texas would expect a visible green haze hanging all around her. The acidic stench scorched her nose and chest, filling her lungs with nasty, contaminated air. It was nothing short of a miracle she could still breathe in here, but Texas knew her time was limited. To add insult to injury, it seemed Butterscotch was far from done when it came to making the sheriff's stay as unpleasant as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie Roo watched the little legs sticking out of her horse's ass twitch and spasm as Butterscotch let out a nasty, hissing fart. The smell was bad enough to give even the roo pause for thought. Somewhere, far back in her mind, she felt a little bad for putting the weasel directly in the line of fire. But after everything Texas had done to thwart her and make her life miserable, the bandit couldn't watch her suffer long enough. The temptation arose to shove those little legs inside too, but her partner in crime seemed to have no issue gassing the sheriff as it were. When the weasel had been dealt with Roxxie had to go out and find whoever did this. Maybe they  could be convinced to shrink a few others too. The thought of April and every other good-for-nothing deputy meeting their doom beneath her and Butterscotch's vile butts filled her with near erotic pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch drew her owner's enraptured gaze back to her butt with a loud fart. The rush of gas was so potent it pushed the little weasel out a bit. But there wasn't a chance in hell the foul horse was going to let her escape. With ravenous determination the inner walls and muscular ring worked to pull the sheriff back in. Only when her pucker was pinching around Texas' waist again did the horse resume her farting. Slowly and steadily she unleashed a continuous stream of gas, never enough to move the weasel again. The air grew dense and what oxygen there was wouldn't last much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas couldn't handle much more of this. She'd been stuck in this smelly hell for what felt like hours now. Her nostrils stung with pain and her lungs ached from the foul air. Her breathing grew shallow as the bitter truth began to settle in. This was the end of the line. She stood strong, defending the law at every opportunity. But today she was going to die, shrunken down and shoved halfway up a horse's butt. She could only hope nobody else would have to suffer this cruel fate, but knowing Roxxie Roo, that was unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roo bandit watched the little sheriff's legs flail and twitch one last time. A final, desperate attempt to survive. But against Butterscotch's overwhelming size it was futile. Soon after the legs fell still, dangling from the twitching pucker. Roxxie could scarcely believe it. After years of rivalry she finally managed to rid herself of that pesky weasel. Her eyes widened as a smile crept on her face. Butterscotch celebrated their victory by finally pulling the remainder of the sheriff into her rear. The bandit eagerly watched those motionless little legs get sucked into the ravenous hole. Her horse let out one final victorious fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day Roxxie Roo spent celebrating her revenge on the sheriff. She scrounged up every bottle of beer and other spirits she could find in her house and drank it all. She slept for nearly two days straight before finally feeling sober enough to get to work. Though the bandit sought far and wide, she never found Abra, who had already left Gold Springs in search of other towns needing her services. Roxxie Roo's crime spree would enter legend and any lawman that found him- or herself at the bandit's mercy would be told the story of how Texas Stanton met her demise, shrunken down and shoved into a horse's ass to be farted to death.</span></div></div>",

Said bandit was busy in her wardrobe for a moment, leaving the horse to look after their prisoner. Though Butterscotch was curious to see what was about to happen, she couldn't help but hope the weasel would slip off her back. If the sheriff fell, the horse would have free reign to stomp, chomp or otherwise flatten that pest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie didn't leave her steed waiting for long, showing up in a pair of tattered old pants. They were her favorite in spite of their poor state. She loved feeling the finely worn fabric against her body and she kept it for moments just like this. Texas was sure to love them too. They were so utterly suffused with the roo's worst smells that even washing it for a month straight wouldn't get rid of them. Worst of all, the bandit's horrible farts had blown a hole right through the back of them. The sheriff didn't know yet, but her gut feeling had her all kinds of worried. Those worries only grew when Roxxie pushed open the stable doors and led Butterscotch outside with her. They stood in the blistering sun when the bandit announced her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a great day to go for a ride, don'tcha think, pardner?\" It suddenly clicked in Butterscotch's head what her owner was up to and she whinnied happily. Texas was about back on her feet and getting ready to jump off the horse's back when a looming shadow eclipsed the sun. With a big bounce the roo was getting on her horse, her hefty butt about to land on the weasel. The dull thump of her landing was enriched by a subtle squelch from the sheriff's flattening body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant tiny Texas was squashed flat as a sheet of paper beneath Roxxie's big butt. Worse yet, the roo's broad buttcheeks had parted precisely over the weasel, bringing her face to face with the bandit's exposed asshole. It introduced itself with a stinky fart, adding only slightly to the pervasive foul aroma of the roo's pants. Butterscotch felt the squashed weasel on her back, enjoying the feeling and preparing to add to her discomfort with the piercing stench of horse sweat. With barely a suggestion the horse began moving. Roxxie didn't have a destination in mind, but as long as she felt the sheriff get mashed between her rear and her horse, she had no plans to stop.</span></div></div>",

The only thing she'd experienced during this nightmare of a journey was the roo's nasty butthole occasionally coming down on her hard enough to press down directly onto her face. Her body and limbs were all flat as a sheet of paper, mercilessly crushed beneath Roxxie Roo's overwhelming butt. Worst of all was the stench. Not only did Texas receive a near constant stream of noxious farts, Butterscotch added her own touch through the medium of horse sweat. The hot weather and long ride had made the horse quite uncomfortable, and Texas was slowly feeling the sour-smelling sweat drench her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie didn't say a word to her nemesis, instead daydreaming about how to make the most out of this unusual situation. She had Texas Stanton, the sheriff that made her life hell for the last few months, at her mercy. Whatever she was going to do to her, the bandit wanted it to be something the weasel would remember for the rest of her days, no matter how many of those there would be. When she felt a faint wiggle coming from underneath her she punished it with a fart. But that wiggle felt remarkably good. That gave the vicious bandit an idea. She wanted to show all of Gold Springs what happens if the law wants to chase Roxxie Roo. With renewed focus she steered her horse down the mountains and onto the unsuspecting town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arrival was met with shocked gasps. The bandit rarely showed herself in Gold Springs anymore due to her high bounty. But today she didn't seem the same. Her usual bandana-covered grin was replaced with a calm smile. She wasn't as heavily armed, just a revolver on her side. Her horse didn't even have its saddle on. She'd have almost no way of carrying any loot she might steal. The townsfolk stared at her from behind their windows. A rat thug scurried to inform Vivian and by the time Roxxie arrived at the town center, an eerie quiet had fallen over Gold Springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roo bandit slid off her steed, smiling broadly as she felt the little weasel coming along for the ride. The sheriff was plastered to her rear, a few keen-eyed citizens spotting her and pointing it out. Roxxie Roo reached back and pulled the squashed little lawbringer free. She held Texas up for all to see and spoke loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This! This is what happens ta those who dare cross me! This is what happens ta those who stand up ta me! An' above all, this is what happens to anyone who thinks they'll bring the law to me!\" She squeezed her victim, drawing a pained shriek from the weasel. The amassed crowd gasped in fear. Without their sheriff, nobody would dare stand up to the roo. The only spectator who didn't seem bothered was Vivian, who coldly observed the results of her plan. She hadn't expected the bandit to bring Texas all the way back to town, but it didn't matter. Seeing the brutal treatment Texas was receiving at the hands of Roxxie, the weasel wouldn't last long. And without that little pest, she'd have free reign to rule this town with an iron fist. Any who stepped out of line could expect fierce retribution. Perhaps she could hand their names and addresses to Roxxie, keep her happy too. Plans for later. Right now she just watched as the bandit humiliated the shrunken sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Texas, ah reckon you've been a major pain in ma butt for long enough. So how about you bring some pleasure instead to 'ol Butterscotch here.\" The crowd winced in disgust as the steed presented her rear to them. They knew all too well the horrifying gas that erupted from that hellish horse. If you didn't know whether Roxxie had robbed someone, the stench of Butterscotch's farts was usually the giveaway. But today Roxxie's attention is drawn a little bit lower. She was clearly not the only one feeling a little hot and bothered by squashing Texas during her ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chorus of groans from the crowd the bandit dragged Texas along the glistening pussy of Butterscotch. Up and down, leaving an amazingly stinky coat of thick slime on the weasel's head. Not content with merely teasing her horse, Roxxie presses the weasel's whole body against the sopping wet snatch. The potent musk dazed the sheriff as her clothes were once again bathed in the smelly bodily fluids of the horse. Between the nauseating stench and Roxxie's forceful rubbing the sheriff was powerless to stop this humiliation. Nobody dared to intervene, lest they found themselves on the receiving end of the bandit's wrath. And now that said wrath could apparently shrink people, they were all the more terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse had to apply every ounce of her willpower not to ruin the moment. She wanted to step back, to have the sheriff mashed into her sensitive areas even more forcefully. She wanted her pussy to part and take in the squirming weasel. Already she felt herself gushing sexual fluids all over the puny body being used to pleasure her. She looked at her master with the horse version of puppy eyes and hoped Roxxie would end this teasing already. She knew what she wanted. She wanted to feel that pathetic, bothersome weasel squirm inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie gives herself a little breather, showcasing the barely breathing sheriff to the crowd. She'd squashed and humiliated her opponent. But was she done with Texas?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roxxie threw another look at her horse. Butterscotch's eyes weren't pleading anymore. They were filled with a need the bandit could not deny. Of all the ways she imagined the struggle between her and Texas to end, shoving a shrunken sheriff up her horse's love tunnel was not something she saw coming. But right here, in front of all these terrified spectators, she couldn't think of a more fitting and humiliating demise for the weasel. She squeezed the slime-drenched sheriff one last time to hear her squeak in pain. Then she brought her close to her horse's pussy once more. \"Ah don't know who's gonna enjoy this more, me or Butterscotch. But you best believe this is the end for you, sheriff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was done for. The violent squashing had completely worn her out and the dense feminine musk wafting off the glistening snatch was overwhelming her senses. She could barely manage a weak squirm with the strength she had left, and Roxxie gleefully punished those with an even tighter grip. Not a hair on her body wasn't soaked in thick, gooey horse arousal. Even if she somehow escaped her approaching doom, she wouldn't ever feel clean again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit's horse braced herself for her master's touch. With a loud <i>splat</i> the weasel was pressed against her sensitive folds once more. Butterscotch whinnied with delight, feeling the weak little pest of a sheriff get dominated between her pussy and Roxxie's hand. The feeling only got better when she felt the roo poke a finger between her pussylips and guiding the weasel's legs inside. The sensation of Texas' limbs touching her inner walls brought the horse and all new level of pleasure. Her arousal began to leak out steadily, the slimy dripping drawing sounds of disgust from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie calmly guided more and more of the weasel into her partner in crime. The legs went in without a hitch and the waist followed soon after. With every little bit of Texas that vanished inside the horse's pussy became more needy. The roo felt the inner walls squeeze together, trying in vain to claim more of the sheriff. The bandit took care to calmly and gently insert the sheriff. As much as she wanted Texas to suffer, the roo didn't want to hurt Butterscotch in the process. But when her horse started to subtly back herself up, the bandit sped up the action. She deftly pushed the weasel's arms next to her body before sliding her even deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gasped as they saw the sadistic spectacle unfold. They wanted to turn around and walk away, but the sheer unique depravity on display forced them to look. Even Vivian couldn't pull her eyes away from what she was seeing. She knew Roxxie was merciless, but this was something else. All of them watched, enraptured by the grotesque display, as Roxxie pulled her hand away to reveal the sheriff slowly sinking deeper into Butterscotch. Like a hungry beast the horse's pussy was trying to devour the weasel. And very slowly, it was succeeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas felt herself get sucked in. The inexorable advance of the warm tunnel that encased most of her body was horrifying. With her arms pinned to her sides and her legs in the powerful grip of Butterscotch's inner walls there was no hope of escape. Nobody in that crowd of dumbfounded stares would dare lift a finger, let alone reach into a horse's pussy, to save her. The horse's netherlips met around the weasel's neck, but their hunger was insatiable. With one last deathly shriek the remainder of the weasel is slowly sucked out of sight. The horse let out a satisfied neigh, glad to have silenced that annoying screaming pest. She felt the little body inside of her, and even her wildest dreams couldn't compare. She felt the last of Texas' struggles fade to nothing as her inner walls bore down on the tiny body with unmatched ferocity. They squeezed and squished, moulding the weasel trapped within their powerful embrace. This was her home now, and as far as the horse was concerned, she wouldn't be leaving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody in Gold Springs ever saw Texas again after that grim day. Only Roxxie caught one last glimpse of the sheriff's existence when she found a small star in a puddle of Butterscotch's feminine juices. She'd helped her horse when she was in heat, but even with her entire hand inside her partner's snatch, she never felt as much as a trace of the sheriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold Springs changed remarkably little after the sheriff's humiliating departure. Roxxie Roo visited more often to shake down those that had displeased Vivian in the world's most obvious secret partnership. Neither of them ever discovered Abra's involvement in the weasel's mysterious downsizing, and the witchdoctor was long gone before they thought about asking her. Unsurprisingly the position of sheriff went to Georgia, who proceeded to deal with Roxxie's menace by leaning back and taking bribes to look the other way. For all her efforts, Texas would be remembered as the sheriff who was shrunken by mysterious forces, only to be shoved up a horse's vagina, never to be seen again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roxxie Roo couldn't help but remember all the times Texas had caused her trouble. Thwarting her robberies, rescuing people she was trying to ransom off, even retrieving property. Roxxie had been thrown in a jail cell more times than she could count and it was all because of the tiny weasel that had just popped back into shape in the palm of her hand. Things definitely weren't going to end well for the sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas groaned and rubbed her head, still dazed by the painful crushing she'd just received. Her clothes were tainted with the scent of Roxxie's rancid gas that made her gag as she got her bearings. The small weasel let out a startled squeak as Roxxie's other hand came down upon her, though only enough to keep her in place. \"Roxxie, you big stinkin' sumbitch! Let me go!\" Texas screamed, her high-pitched voice making her kangaroo captor laugh and press down even harder. Texas was brought to her knees, desperately pressing against the palm bearing down on her. She was forced lower and lower while Roxxie just grinned sadistically, watching her nemesis literally kneel before her now that there was only a few inches left between her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ya start beggin' now I might not turn ya into a stain in my asscrack.\" Roxxie said, obviously relishing in tormenting the shrunken weasel. By now Texas was fuming, a look of pure rage on her face as the hands around her drew ever closer. \"Ah'd rather di--\" <i>SQUISH!</i> Texas didn't even get to finish her retort before being mercilessly pressed flat between the roo's palms. Roxxie ground her hands together for good measure, reveling in the squelches and muffled screams coming from the squishy sheriff. She spent several minutes grinding the weasel into paste before finally parting her hands, busting out laughing at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Texas was nothing but a wad of putty. Her fur and clothing were now just a mottled pattern of various shades of brown on her amorphous form, though a pair of toony eyes peered up at the roo with a look of pain and anger. At least, that's what it looked like to Roxxie. It was impossible to tell exactly what expression Texas was trying to make now that she didn't have much of a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Tex? Had somethin' to say ta me?\" Roxxie said, taunting the helpless wad of weasel as Texas started to stretch upward, trying to pop herself back into shape. Eventually she reformed with an audible <i>pop</i>, leaning against the kangaroo's fingers to balance herself. She was panting hard, tired from all the effort of reforming, though that didn't make her any less furious. The tiny weasel glared up at her captor. \"Yeah, ah wanted ta say ah'd never beg to a fat, stupid, ug--\" <i>SQUELCH!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Texas was squished between Roxxie's palms and ground harshly, just as badly as last time. And once again she strained upwards once the roo let up, though this time she couldn't pop back into shape immediately. Texas bulged upwards several times, each time needing to take a couple seconds of rest before trying again, finally managing to reform herself. \"I can do this aaaaall day.\" Roxxie said smugly, quietly impressed with Texas' resolve. \"So... can... I!\" The weasel snapped back, clearly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process repeated several times. Texas would get squashed into mush between Roxxie's palms and then pop back into shape, and each time took a little longer. Again and again this happened. Squelch, pop, squelch, pop, squelch... eventually the weasel was too exhausted to pull herself back together, staying as a wad of mush in her nemesis' hand. The roo looked genuinely disappointed once Texas stopped reforming, though there was a great deal of satisfaction in besting the do-gooder. \"Guess ya ain't as tough as I thought, Tex. Ah well, I got the perfect place for ya ta get some rest!\" She said, a big grin on her face as Texas' eyes went wide, knowing exactly where Roxxie meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as a whip the roo was up on her feet, tugging the back of her pants open and dangling the wadded-up weasel over the noxious abyss that was Roxxie's massive ass. Texas wanted to scream but all she could manage was a muffled whine as she was dropped right into the soft, stinking crevasse. Within moments the sheriff was gone, Roxxie letting go of her waistband and wiggling her butt to make sure Texas got nice and deep into her buttcrack. Roxxie's big butt jiggled with every step she took and sweated up a storm; Texas was subjected to the worst case of swamp ass the kangaroo could muster. Pretty soon she found herself drenched in ass sweat and rubbing up against Roxxie reeking asshole. Once the bandit sat down Texas' suffering became complete, squashed flat from both sides until she was nothing but a splotch on the inside of Roxxie's rancid ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah warned ya! A couple hours in there oughta teach ya a valuable lesson not ta pick on folks bigger than you!\" Roxxie said before letting out a long, loud, noxious fart right onto her new weasel fartcushion. Poor Texas was given the worst treatment imaginable, sniffing up the bandit's gas straight from the source. The constant pressure pressing her flat made things much worse, her mushy body squeezed as thin as paper while she soaked up nasty ass sweat. This was far worse than any prison cell. Would she ever be free again?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Of all the ways for this to end, I never thought it'd happen this way...\" she sighed before climbing onto her desk and sitting down with her legs cross as she leered down at her puny nemesis. The giddiness she felt was so overwhelming that it overrode her normally pragmatic mind. Deep down, she had always held a very thin layer of jealousy towards the sheriff for her ability to impose her will others physically. While the mayor certainly was no slouch in that department, she couldn't even dream intimidating anyone with brute force alone, especially in a town like Gold Springs. For once in her life, she didn't need to use her brain to get the better of her long time foe. She could do whatever she wanted to Texas and there'd be nothing she could do to stop her. That thought alone sent chills throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... this feels so right...\" she murmured as she toyed with the sheriff's body as though she were nothing more than a doll. Texas grunted and tried to fight her off, but her struggles only served to amuse the giant lynx. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is how it should be... a woman of consequence like myself shouldn't have to go behind closed doors to get what I want. A simpleminded country bumpkin like you serves only two purposes: to take orders and to be used. And seeing as how you refused to do the former, the universe finally decided to teach you your place. It makes no sense for you to be bigger and stronger than me. I think that's why you've shrunk, Texas; this is justice in it's purist form. And it's absolutely wonderful\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are ya talkin' about ya lunati--\" Texas began only to get cut off as Vivian gave her body a tight squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get to talk to me like that, Texas. Not anymore\" the mayor giggled, a sliver of drool beginning to exit the corner of her mouth as her excitement was pushing her into a state of pure euphoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my equal. Not even close. See?\" she said as she pulled the sheriff into her chest. She laughed and leaned forward, allowing her rather generous rack to come crashing down on top of her head. It felt as though she were being crushed beneath three hundred pounds of silk covered flesh as she struggled to pushed them off to no avail. The pathetic display caused the mayor to go into a giggling fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so puny! This is amazing!\" she sang before tossing her back down onto the table and pinning her beneath her finger to prevent her from scrambling away. Texas stared up at the mayor in wide-eyed horror as she leered down her with an a look that was quite unlike anything she had ever seen before. Gone was the perpetually smug and posed Vivian and in it's place was a bestial predator with an almost carnal hunger. She stared wordlessly at Texas for several minutes before the crazed look on her face eventually waned. The mayor was hit with a sudden epiphany that she deemed it necessary to address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny. All this time I've been fighting against you using every once of my genius to work around actually confronting you one on one. I've always been the type to champion the use of one's mental faculties to overcome any obstacles, but as it stands my greatest victory seems to have come out of nothing more than sheer luck. I've mocked people like Georgia and Roxxie for using nothing but brawn to get what they want, yet what I'm doing right now is no better... not that I really care. It's just... the irony of it is stunning...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas quickly realized that Vivian wasn't really talking to anyone in particular so much as she was thinking out loud. The wicked mayor seemed to be lost in her thoughts as she looked up in the air and pontificated about the obscurity of someone of her class and intellect having finally gaining the upper hand against her greatest enemy by virtue of being bigger. With her thoughts preoccupied, the sheriff decided to take the opportunity to try and make a break for it. The door leading into the office was closed and locked tight, meaning she couldn't exit through there. The option available to her was the window which was cracked open just enough that Texas was confident that she could squeeze through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She kept her eye on the mayor as she very slowly wormed her way from underneath her finger. Vivian took no notice to her sudden absence as she continued rambling on, Lucky for Texas, the desk she sat on happened to be stationed right beside the window, no doubt due to Vivian's desire to keep an eye on the townsfolk even while resting comfortably in her office. She tip toed over to the window, glancing back at Vivian with every step to make sure she was still distracted. This proved to be her undoing as she was so focused on Vivian that she failed to spot the inkwell and quill she was approaching. She pumped into it abruptly, sending the contents spilling all over the table. The sudden clunking noise brought the mayor back to the present as she looked down at the mess. Texas froze in place as she felt the giant's eyes lock onto her and she could let out a nervous laugh. To her surprise, Vivian's gaze was trained not on her but the ground beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... my new tax plan!\" she screeched in despair. Texas glanced down and raised a brow as she saw that she had been standing on some kind of written document. At least that's what she assumed it was, as the ink quickly washed over it and made it all but unreadable. She looked back up at the mayor and yelped as she quickly darted out of the way of her lunge. To her surprise, Vivian wasn't aiming for her but was rushing to try and salvage what was left of the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, NO! I worked all week on this!\" she whined as she fruitlessly attempted to brush away the ink. Once it became clear to her that it wasn't working, she decided to turn her attention to the cause of her woes. She looked over to see Texas halfway out of her window and struggling to wiggle her way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i>YOU!</i></b>\" she snarled, her eyes burning bright with barely contained rage. She dove to grab her tiny little legs and came very close to doing so before the wily sheriff managed to pull herself through. After enduring the pain a six foot drop into the dirt, Texas took off running with the Mayor screeching angrily behind her. She ran as far as her tiny legs could take her before ducking behind the nearest building to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... t'day's just not mah day...\" she muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With Vivian now in the know regarding her decreased size, things had just became significantly harder for the sheriff. It wouldn't be long until there were people on her payroll actively looking for her, eager to dish out punishment before dragging her carcass back to Vivian kicking and screaming. And if she was feeling especially vindictive, Vivian would no doubt put a hit on her head under the guise of finding a pint sized fraud masquerading as the sheriff. While she knew that the citizens would have her back through and through, there was no telling how many of them would be quick to either turn her in or use her to sate their own closeted fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With the weight of her journey finally settling in, the brave lawwoman decided to... </span></div></div>",

Texas still clung to one sliver of hope. Neither the mayor nor any of her henchmen knew why she was so small. They'd guard any potential allies, but they wouldn't suspect Abra's involvement in her situation. Unfortunately, her little detour to the mayor's office had put an even greater distance between her and her goal. For now she had to get into hiding in the few minutes she had where Vivian was contacting her men. She crossed the street with little effort and hid behind a house. As she ran down the alley she could suddenly hear Vivian's distraught voice ring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread the word, there's an impostor in town! Some lowly weasel is trying to make a mockery of our fair justice system by dressing up as our sheriff. She's about a foot tall and dressed just like Texas. Bring her to me and I'll see to it you're well rewarded!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sonofa...\" Texas hissed under her breath. The mayor had effectively riled up the whole town to go after her. Now more than ever she needed to be stealthy. For once her small size became a benefit, letting her scurry into impossibly small hiding places whenever footsteps drew near. gaps in walls she'd normally never even glance at became safe havens as large boots stomped by. She even hid in old tins and other clutter, but this would prove a dangerous idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff came eye to eye with one of Vivian's henchmen and hid quickly. But when the frustrated goon couldn't find her target, she angrily kicked a nearby can on the ground, unaware the tiny sheriff was inside. Texas needed every ounce of her iron will not to scream her lungs out as she flew through the air inside of her shelter. It tumbled along before finally coming to a stop. The weasel felt a little nauseous, but when she saw the thug had kicked her closer to her destination she managed a smile. She ached from the sudden and rough ride, but she could finally see the first signs of Abra's wagon in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey from building to building seemed to go on for hours. The pint-sized sheriff kept up her guard, carefully snooping around every corner. The closer she got to the outskirts of town, the fewer people there were to spot her. But these houses were newer and didn't have nearly as many hiding places for her. Similarly the alleys around them were far less messy. Only a few more buildings until she'd have to dash through the open to reach Abra's place. With her goal close by a sliver of hope glowed within the sheriff. Maybe she could finally rid herself of this curse. She didn't know yet how to persuade the witchdoctor, but humility seemed like a good start. And when she got her size back she'd go right up to Vivian and punch her stupid head in before arresting her. That might be the biggest boon she'd gotten out of this crazy adventure. She'd caught the mayor red-handed assaulting her and trying to kill her. But at this size that information was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother goon approaches through an alley and Texas looks around in a panic. Nothing around her could be used to hide in and in mere seconds this henchwoman would turn the corner and see her. In desperation she hides in the only place she can think of, the sand she was standing on. She scoops away the loose, soft sand and lays down, quickly covering herself and holding her breath, hoping it didn't look too obvious. She could hear the voice of Vivian's thug muttering to herself and trudging along. She'd turned the corner and the heavy footsteps drew nearer. In her makeshift tomb the sheriff could only hope she wouldn't be unlucky enough to be caught in those footfalls, but at the rate her day was going it seemed almost bound to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the ground above her compacts and an immense weight bears down on her body. She feels herself flatten but mercifully it only lasts mere seconds. The thug seemed completely unaware she'd just stepped on the sheriff and kept on walking, turning the corner into another alley and letting Texas rise up from the sand. She coughed a little, looking around skittishly before holding her own aching chest. The weasel never even caught a glimpse of the goon that trampled her, but it felt like it had to be an elephant or something similarly heavy. She dusts herself off and keeps going.</span></div></div>",

There was just one last precarious stretch remaining. A mad dash to Abra's wagon. There'd be no hiding places along the way. If the weasel got spotted now she would almost certainly be caught. Far behind her she could hear the mayor barking orders. Vivian was out for blood, and at her size the sheriff wouldn't last long in the lynx' hands. With a few short breaths she amps herself up and after one last thorough look around for any people the weasel ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step brought her closer to salvation, but it also brought her further out in the open. Texas ran faster than she'd ever done before. Not even Roxxie Roo barreling down on her inspired such action in her legs. Fatigue from the long journey to Abra's wagon was setting in, but there was no time to be tired. Every creak and whisper had the sheriff look behind her, fearing someone would see her and cut her journey short so close to the finish line. Be it through luck, determination or a mystical helping hand from that witchdoctor the sheriff finally reaches the wagon. Just getting inside would take some effort, but first she dove behind the little set of steps leading up to the entrance. Breathing heavily, the weasel took a minute to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking the coast was clear Texas started the next leg of her journey, getting up those steps. Each of them was at least as tall as the sheriff. She had to jump up and grab the large wooden ledge, then hoist herself up. It was slow and exhausting, but doable. As the weasel finally crawled up onto the wagon she prepared herself for her next encounter with Abra. The petite cheetah would be enormous from down where the sheriff was. To top it all off, they didn't exactly part on the friendliest terms last time. Getting back to her normal size would be a challenge. She shuffled past the heavy azure cloth that made up the door and walked in. The first thing she noticed is that the cozy surroundings were now massive, bigger than any house she'd been in. Walls covered in strange trinkets and a heavy scent of incense. It hardly looked like the same wagon in which she spoke to Abra. The sheriff looked around to find the witchdoctor, preparing herself to deal with an almost insufferable amount of smugness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the far end of the wagon Texas saw the witchdoctor. It didn't look like she'd moved an inch since last they met. She seemed to be in a trance of some kind, her eyes closed and a strange talisman in her hand. A low humming filled the air. The tiny weasel cautiously drew closer and Abra suddenly spoke up, her eyes still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, someone familiar. De spirits have shown me a mighty sheriff on a long journey. Tell me Texas, what brings you to me wagon again?\" A smile grew on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know damn well why ah'm here. Ah need you to fix this!\" The weasel angrily replied, pointing at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be doing dat? I be just a fraud, no? A fake, a con merchant, here to take advantage of de good people of Gold Springs.\" Her grin grew more smug with every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, don't play around with me Abra. You and me both know ah'm tiny because of your voodoo bullshit. Ya nearly got me killed already an' most of the town is out lookin for me. Now change me back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, presume I can. Why would I be helpin you? Not only have I not heard anyting approachin an apology out of you, how do I know you won't immediately lock me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas gritted her teeth. She knew this was going to happen. The damn cheetah had her by the proverbial balls though. What was the alternative? Staying tiny and being a plaything for every single villain, even Vivian? With barely suppressed anger the sheriff spat out an apology. \"Fine. Ah'm sorry I doubted yer abilities. But you gotta give me some credit here. You're the first magician that actually does real magic here. Ya said yerself how many frauds there are out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De spirits tell me dat's about as much of an apology as I'll ever get from ya. Very well. Now promise me ya won't try to arrest me the moment you be big again.\" Texas' sense of justice made her scowl. She couldn't just let this damn cheetah walk away. She'd put an officer of the law in grave danger. Because of her voodoo Abra had nearly served Texas to Vivian on a silver platter. She wholly deserved to be clapped in irons, but something overruled her determination. Perhaps it was seeing the cheetah towering over her or the grueling trek to her wagon, but something put a very real tinge of fear running up Texas' spine. What if her attempted arrest ended up with the sheriff right back down to this size again? And this time, there'd be nothing she could do to convince the witchdoctor to change her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra just sat back, finally having opened her eyes to watch the tiny weasel struggle with herself. Her urge to do the right thing was overshadowed by her need to placate the cheetah. Finally, after a lot of grumbling the sheriff growled a reluctant promise. She rolled her eyes at the weasel, amused by her internal fight. If she thought this was all it would take to change her back, she was in for a rude awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I will change you back, but I demand someting be done in return first.\" Her smug grin grew malicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Ah already apologized! Ah even gave you ma word you wouldn't be persecuted for endangering ma life! What more do ya want?!\" Texas was getting angry. What twisted game was this witchdoctor playing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Words be easy, words be cheap. I knew you were gonna say all dem tings to me, and it don't take a spirit to see why. You'll say whatever I want to hear just to stop being tiny. But de spirits don't be placated so easily. Dey demand commitment, dey demand action.\" Abra's smile grew a mile wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dey demand submission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas shot her a look of incredulous rage. She couldn't be serious, right? Abra looked down at the weasel with a nearly disturbed grimace. \"It only be for a few minutes, an after dat I will grow you back. If ye can bear to look at me after, I might even be willing 't help ya get back at Vivian.\"</span></div></div>",

Texas wasn't satisfied yet with her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk straight, woman. Am I goin to survive it?\" Abra just laughed. \"Of course, little sheriff. De memory will sting much more den any pain I can inflict to someone as hardy as you. Now, enough questions. De spirits seek your submission, not an argument.\" She takes another step closer to the weasel. Already the cheetah is nearly upon her, standing tall over her prey. One more step and the sheriff would get flattened. Mercifully she squats down instead, taking a closer look at the little weasel. Her breath washes over the terrified sheriff, but Texas knows that there's nothing she can do at this stage. Whether she agreed to submit to her or not, Abra was in complete control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De first ting demanded is a show of humility. De spirits want you to kneel down and bow before dem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm not gon-\" Texas' protests were brought to a halt when the cheetah slammed her hand down in front of the weasel. Before the startled sheriff could act, the witchdoctor's dainty fingers delicately grabbed the weasel by the torso and pushed her down. Her legs gave out almost immediately and the sheriff was forced onto her knees. Abra let go of her prey only to plant two fingers on the weasel's back, forcing her to the ground, pinning her down with minimal effort. The tiny squeaks of panic and pain told Abra she was doing it right. Texas' face was forced against the thick cloth of one of the many rugs that adorned the wagon floor. She had never felt so humiliated in her whole life. Nobody but Abra would know about this, yet the helpless feeling of being so brutally manhandled by someone so petite and waifish was burned into the back of the sheriff's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold yourself down like dat for let's say... ten seconds. If I gotta help you kneel again it will be with my foot, and it will be a whole lot more... unpleasant for you.\" She lifted her fingers from the weasel, but Texas did not rise up. Abra looked at her work with pride. The mighty sheriff of Gold Springs, her obedient little servant. She could watch the little weasel kneeling before her all day long, but the moment those ten seconds passed the sheriff rose up. Her angry scowl was lessened a little by Abra's harsh lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What next?\" She spat up to the witchdoctor sarcastically. Her reward was a heavy hand coming down on her back, flattening the weasel against the rug. Abra sighed. Texas' defiance was not unexpected, but tiresome all the same. With the squashed weasel unable to move or talk the cheetah peeled her off the rug and looked her in the eye. The witchdoctor's intense stare looked straight through her victim, making the slowly reforming weasel sweat nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not speak unless spoken to, is dat clear?\" Abra slowly commands. The weasel meekly nods. \"Good, now it be time. De spirits have judged your actions and dey command you to serve me without question for fifteen minutes.\" Fifteen minutes? That sounded almost easy. But before the sheriff could inquire about the catch the cheetah continued. \"But dey are strict. Every time you question or complain, de time is reset and you must endure another fifteen minutes of service. De spirits already be bettin on how many hours you'll be here tending to me every desire.\" Suddenly the challenge sounded a lot more real. The sheriff had to stop that big mouth of hers from getting her into trouble, and that was a bigger task than anything the cheetah could throw at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your time be startin now.\" Abra announces as she turns a small hourglass. </span></div></div>",

I almost pity you, did I not know just how good this is gonna feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah's accent grew thick with desire, making Texas shiver with fear. She had to be strong, to endure the upcoming torment without a word. Any protests and she would just be subjected to even more 'pleasure'. The weasel looked up to see one of Abra's hands descend. But before it picked her up, the hand paused. The cheetah gave her servant more commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make dis easy, sheriff. Take off ya clothes. Unless ya want me to rip them to shreds.\" Abra commanded with an evil smirk. She watched her little toy fidget with doubt for a second before obeying her words and stripping down. At least she'd still have something to wear after this was Texas' reasoning. She'd barely finished before Abra's hand wrapped around her, lifting the sheriff off her feet and holding her in front of the cheetah's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be de time for you to prove yourself. Make me happy and I might even forgive you for any accidental slip-ups. De spirits be lookin and dey want to see you squirm. And now... so do I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff didn't understand the witchdoctor's cryptic words, but she was quickly lowered to Abra's waist. A strange, pungent smell radiated from between the cheetah's legs. With her free hand Abra revealed that her robes had a gap in them and Texas was quickly brought in, plunged into the darkness inside of the cheetah's robes. The lusty feline moaned a little at the thought of having the clueless weasel so close to her goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas couldn't see a thing in the pitch blackness inside of Abra's robe. Barely any light came in where the large arm was poking through the thick cloth, save for the odd ray of candlelight revealing Abra's dainty legs. The stench was heavy and pervasive. The sheriff's gut ached something fierce, danger was afoot. But held firmly in Abra's hand there was nothing the weasel could do but keep her mouth shut and hope this will all be over soon. This challenge became a hundred times harder when a stray ray of light managed to slip in and reveal the horrible truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere inches above the sheriff's head was the cheetah's crotch. And to her absolute terror Texas had to determine that Abra wasn't wearing a thing beneath that robe. Directly above her was the witchdoctor's waiting pussy, restless for some weasel-shaped entertainment. With an evil laugh she sets her plan into motion, bringing the weasel up to her snatch and rubbing the sheriff's face against her lower lips. They twitched and shook, sending waves of pleasure up Abra's spine. Her whole body tingled with glee as she rubbed the weasel's face against her most sensitive region. Soon mere rubbing wasn't enough and Texas found herself plunged halfway into the slimy passage. She silently fumed. The stalwart lawbringer of Gold Springs, reduced to a sex toy for this freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra could barely contain her lustful desires as he pushed the sheriff deep into herself. She diligently kept hold of Texas' leg to make sure the weasel wouldn't be completely lost. The sensation of the little sheriff filling her narrow love tunnel was out of this world. Were it not for the timer the cheetah wouldn't mind doing this all day long. But the witchdoctor always kept her end of the bargain. She gave the weasel an easy task. After all, it's difficult to hear someone complain when they're shoved into your pussy. But with a minute left on the clock Texas is pulled free from her slimy prison and hoisted out from under Abra's robes. She dangled the little weasel in front of her, smiling as she saw her juices slowly leaking off her toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the true test. Texas could see the hourglass. She was still on the clock. Any comment about the humiliation she just suffered would give Abra the right to do it all over again, probably pushing her in ever further. The sheriff held her maw clamped shut, fighting off the urge to scream and shout. Seconds ticked by agonizingly slowly. Can Texas keep her composure after such foul treatment or does she fail to meet Abra's demands for silence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyting you want to add dere, me little toy?\" Abra taunted, watching the sheriff slowly turn red with rage.</span></div></div>",

In an almost insufferably smug tone she kept taunting her little toy. \"C'mon, don' tell me ya didn't enjoy yaself in dere. De squirming felt great, ya know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witchdoctor is about to relent when her tiny victim offers a response. The cheetah's eyes flit to the hourglass. It was still trickling. Quickly she returned her attention to the weasel, curious to hear what she had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These magics of yours would be a lot easier to believe if you lead with things like <i>freakin shrinkin me</i>! Any old crook can do some fortune tellin, but this right here...\" Texas lost her train of thought, but Abra was kind enough to keep going. \"Maybe you be right, little weasel. Very well, I'm done toying with you. I could argue you be startin that little rant when time wasn't up yet, but dat be feelin kinda cheap now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large hand carried the sheriff down to the floor and Abra deposited the slimy weasel as gently as she could. The cheetah rummaged around in a chest and gave her toy a washcloth. It was easily the size of a towel to Texas and she eagerly used it to wipe away the thick coat of cheetah arousal. The witchdoctor just sat nearby, looming over the weasel and teasing her. \"Ya know, ya not be de first doubter that got dis... intimate wit me. But I be lyin if you weren't da best of em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, spare me. I'm sure you enjoyed this a lot, but could ya kindly do me a favor and not mention this to anyone?\" Texas huffed, still angry to be humiliated by the petite cheetah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lips be sealed. But I reckon dere be other tings you want to talk about. Ya seen me magics when they be against you. But don't ya wonder wat might happen if they be havin your back?\" Abra's voice was thick with intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" The weasel muttered, trying to hide her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been seein de world from de view of a tiny mouse, but what if you were de biggest sheriff in de west? To tower over your enemies like I tower over you now. Tell me dat does not sound at least a little interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, what's in this for you?\" Texas' eyes narrowed. She knew something like this always carried a price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said during our introduction, I do not charge for my spells. Now, do I have your interest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow me back to normal first.\" Texas replied dryly, finally slipping back into her old outfit after ridding herself of all the cheetah's foul sexual juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, of course. I be thinkin de small life, probably not for a weasel, no?\" The witchdoctor reached down, cupping the little sheriff in both hands. Sitting back, Abra began to chant in a language unlike anything Texas had ever heard. Amidst verses and spells of mysterious origin the weasel began to feel energized. Power surged through her and shortly after the weasel could feel her first bit of growth. The cheetah leaned in, kissing the sheriff on the forehead and opening her hands. With a loud yelp the sheriff fell, but the landing was unexpectedly soft, as she had grow to full size in little more than an instant. After shaking off the disorientation and blurry vision the weasel found herself sitting across from Abra, who had put three vials in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya brought me great fun, sheriff Texas Stanton. Now it be my turn to return de favor. Each of dese contains a spell to be cast on you right away. De first vial is me special formula. It will grow you big as a house an' strong as an army. Perfect for puttin dose big bullies in place. Next up a special little concoction I learned when runnin in politics. It forces whoever you be lookin at to only speak de truth. Lastly dere be dis little showpiece. Drink it an everyone will adore you. Dese people be walkin on hands and feet jus' to be in your shadow. Even ya worst enemies become your thralls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah no, tha's a bit too much.\" Texas cuts in, stopping the sales pitch. That leaves her with two others left. But was this the right thing to do? Forcing others to obey out of fear was Vivian's thing. The weasel felt conflicted about the offer presented. She wanted to indulge herself and have some fun. Was this really all that bad, especially after the hell these bandits have put her through? And would anyone really object if she brought Roxxie Roo to justice by just sitting on her? Does Texas' sense of honour interfere or does she agree to receive one of Abra's blessings?</span></div></div>",

Abra smiles and takes the small bottle, whispering unknown phrases into it to imbue it with her magic. Before she hands it to Texas she gives her a stern warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two tings, sheriff. One, don't drink dis brew right away. I don't want you growin big inside me wagon. Made dat mistake once meself, had to rebuild the whole damn ting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas chuckles a little at the mental image of a giant robed cheetah sitting amidst the splinters of her own shattered wagon. She can only imagine how often Abra's tricks might have backfired before she had mastered them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And two, don't be tryin to attack me when you turn giant. De wards protectin me will shatter yer mind and surrender yer will to me. Ya would not be de first to tink dat I don't foresee dese tings. De spirits do not take kindly to those who would turn my gifts against me.\" Her smile never faded, but her tone was intimidating. Though with the righteous rampage Texas had in mind, attacking Abra was low on her list of priorities. She nodded at the witchdoctor and received her blessing. The sheriff carefully put away the small bottle and bid the cheetah farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the sheriff had left, Abra stood back up and began to tidy up her trinkets from the last ritual. She couldn't deny how good it felt to have Texas squirming in her most intimate places. Normally it's just some hapless town member that falls prey to her desires. But her fun wasn't done yet. As she rifled through her things she came across the small doll of the sheriff, pausing for a moment to look at it. The cheetah laughed to herself, already imagining her next steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas didn't know how to feel about this yet. She walked back to the sheriff's office, calming citizens along the way that she really was the real Texas and that the tiny impostor had been dealt with. Now she almost wished she'd picked the other potion, just so she could watch Vivian squirm. Forcing her to speak the truth was like forcing a priest to drink. After that little stunt she pulled she'd more than earned such a punishment. But she didn't want to scare the entire town by growing huge just yet. She needed something remote to test this stuff. Immediately a target sprang to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie Roo had long been a thorn in Texas' side. A kangaroo bandit with a list of crimes too long to remember. She'd humiliated and tormented the sheriff many times over the years, using her strength, size and stench to flatten the weasel beneath her and subject her to horrible gas. And if she didn't feel like squashing the sheriff she could count on her horse, Butterscotch. Roxxie's trusty steed always took great joy in crushing the weasel under her big butt and serving up lethal farts. Now the tables would be turned. The sheriff got on her horse and rode off, racing for the hills. The abandoned huts and shacks from the gold rush still dotted the landscape, but the stench kept away any potential residents. Roxxie's place was nearby. The sheriff parked her horse behind a rock and grabbed the potion from her vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at it one last time. The things she could do to Roxxie as a giant were terrifying. Did anyone, even someone as foul as the roo bandit, deserve such treatment? Texas thought back on all the times she'd been abused, farted on or shoved up against the roo's nasty butt. That sealed the deal. Just this once she might make an exception. Texas pulled the cork and chugged the potion, surprised by the implacable taste. It was like nothing she'd ever experienced. She couldn't ponder on the taste much longer as she felt a strong buzz overtake her every limb. It itched and glowed and soon her perspective began to change. The growing sheriff tried her best to calm her horse, but she could see the confusion in its eyes. Texas stepped away from her steed, staring down at the shack before her. The bandit was none the wiser that the long arm of the law was about to introduce itself in spectacular fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie was planning her next heist, preparing her weapons and having a drink. She didn't even notice the heavy thumping at first, nor her horse's sudden nervous twitching. Butterscotch could tell something was up, but her master was too lost in thought to pay attention to her whinnying. Only when the roo bandit turned to tell her horse to pipe down did she hear a heavy slam on the roof. She let out a scream as the roof of her house was torn off like it was made of cardboard. Towering over her was Texas, easily four times taller than the house she just peeled open. Roxxie shot a look at the bottle of whiskey in her hand, then back up. Was she really that drunk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy there, scrawny. As the sheriff o' Gold Springs, I hereby place you under arrest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Texas 'arrest' the bandit?</span></div></div>",

She dodges the descending hand and bolts for the door. Before she can open it one of Texas' boots comes crashing through, reducing both the door and most of the wall it was in to rubble. The force of the impact sent the roo flying onto her table, landing on her back and unable to get up when her sight is filled with the sheriff's hand again. This time she's too slow and short, thick weasel fingers envelop her in a painful squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, ya varmint!\" Texas cheers triumphantly. At long last she had captured one of the most feared bandits in the area. The citizens of Gold Springs could sleep a lot easier now. Just as soon as they had adjusted themselves to the fact their sheriff was now a giant. The weasel gave her victim a powerful squeeze, feeling the roo's body squish in her hand and listening to the pained shout interrupting the constant stream of swearing. This shouldn't be as enjoyable as it is, but after so many years of enduring Roxxie's bullshit Texas couldn't help but feel a little gleeful that the roo was completely at her mercy. Out here, she could do anything to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she got to work on the bandit the sheriff looked back at the ruined house one last time. Butterscotch was still stuck in her pen, shaking in every limb at the sight of  the giant weasel. With as much care as she could manage the sheriff tore down one of the pen's walls, letting the horse escape and run free. As much as she had suffered from that foul beast, Texas couldn't find it in her heart to take out her frustrations on Butterscotch too. Being raised by Roxxie Roo probably meant it didn't know any better. With that little detail out of the way the giant weasel turned her attention to the squirming bandit in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When everythin's back ta normal, ah'm gonna cram you so far up ma ass ye'll be eatin ma shit for th' rest o' your life!\" The roo bandit fumed. Texas just laughed in her face. Like she'd ever give her the chance. \"Ah think ah got a much better idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th' hell are ya doin?\" Roxxie protested as she was brought down. When she realized the sheriff was reaching around and bringing her close to her butt the struggles intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! You can't do this! You're the sheriff! You're not a bandit. You-\" Texas cuts her off with a loud, thundering fart. The smell is unbearable, sending the roo into a coughing fit. Even the giant weasel is surprised by the potency. Damn, that felt good. The sheriff clenches her teeth and produces another loud fart, further shattering the roo's thoughts. She couldn't deny it, she was beginning to like this power. It felt a little wrong to torment someone else like this, but this was Roxxie Roo. If anyone deserved it, it had to be her. But as the bandit's struggles began to weaken Texas started to imagine who else might deserve being handed some smelly justice. Vivian looked about ready to eat her when she was shrunken. Maybe it's finally time to take her down a peg. Her rat pack of thugs wouldn't be able to do anything to stop the law now. Dangling that little bitch over her maw to return the favor. But before Texas could daydream any further a stinging pain in her finger brought her back to reality. In her anger, Roxxie had bitten the hand holding her. Texas brought her back to the front and stared daggers at the bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really just bite me, you rotten little bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in... ever the sheriff saw something in Roxxie Roo that she never thought she'd actually see. The mighty bandit looked scared. She was terrified by the giant weasel and Texas was about to give her another very good reason to fear her. One last mighty squeeze was given before she unceremoniously dropped the bandit on the floor. Not giving her a chance to recover, the sheriff quickly turned around and sat down. She took no mercy upon the roo, slamming her butt down hard on the ground, producing a THUMP that echoed through the empty hills. So often Texas had been sat on by the cruel roo. Now it was time for a little payback. She ground her buttcheeks back and forth, further flattening the helpless bandit. The only time the giant weasel stopped was to unleash another fart. Texas felt a little ashamed of herself for enjoying this so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunishing Roxxie Roo felt good, like <i>really</i> good. Texas began to feel a little flustered from all the joy she was experiencing. Was this really turning her on? Maybe it's a side effect of the blessing? She should ask Abra when she got back to town. She could also quickly ask the witchdoctor just how long she was going to stay gigantic. In hindsight she should've brought that up sooner, but the prospect of sweet revenge on the bandits of Gold Springs was too exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the roo squirming beneath her the giant sheriff quickly realized she'd forgotten something. Her horse wouldn't be of much use to get back to town with her current stature and she didn't have any spare blessings to give it. She was going to have to walk back to Gold Springs to put Roxxie in a cell. It wasn't too far, and at her current size she could probably move quite fast just walking back to town. Nevertheless she probably shouldn't wait too long before setting off. Then again, out here in the middle of nowhere she could do anything to this foul bandit. </span></div></div>",

She could torture Roxie all she wanted to after she talked with Abra for more of this growth blessing. She debated just carrying the roo  in her hand normally, but then she remembered one especially bad day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a real scorcher that day. Damn near a hundred and one degrees. Texas had gotten a tip that her former partner Georgia was planning to rob a gold convoy along this side road. Hours had passed, no sign of Georgia or the convoy. Texas was beginning to question the legitimacy of the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WHAM!!! Texas felt something hit her from behind. It wasn't enough to knock her out, but she was staggered, fighting just to stand and seeing triple, and the thing she was seeing was three Roxies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late Tex. I was just finishing up lunch. It's part of this new baked beans only diet I've been trying for the last week. What do you think, am I thinning out?\" She says, giving her ass a taunting smack. Still dazed from the blow to the head, Texas could do nothing as Roxie took her lasso and bound her tight. \"I guess we I should've told that rat to have you come a little later. Oh well. Time to take my new toy home with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs Tex's body and wedges it between her sweaty ass cheeks. As she started to head home, Tex could feel a rumble coming from Roxie. \"Oops, that must be the diet finally kicking in.\" Before she can think to close her mouth, Texas gets blasted by fart after rancid fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torture continued all the way back to Roxies home. For the next week, Texas was bound and forced to experience the newfound diet of Roxie, one she also passed along to her horse Butterscotch. It was hell the whole time. Salvation only came when April tracked her down and cuffed Roxie while she was passed out drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Roxie had to suffer. For that if not for everything else she's done. Taking a piece of string out of her pocket, she sees that it grew with her, now resembles a full rope to a normal person. She wrapped the string around her captive, all the while hearing her curse the giant sheriff's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the coup de grace. Texas pulled back the waistband of her pants and underwear, giving Roxie a good view of what's to come. She lowers the hand with the roo in it into her pants, jamming her into her ass crack to the point where she's kissing her asshole. Texas snaps her pants shut, trapping Roxie fully. She let one last massive fart loose in the bandit's face before walking back to town. Oh yeah, she was liking this blessing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roxxie's now ruined lair was nestled deep in the hills. Getting back to Gold Springs was going to take hours, especially without a horse. But for once Texas didn't mind. She would be kept company by the roo bandit, who was firmly squeezed between her buttcheeks. The giant weasel set off with a broad smile on her face. This had been a long time coming for the bandit, and Texas was going to make the most out of every last second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step she could feel the bandit wiggle a little, still attempting to escape the smelly prison she was in. The sheriff didn't bother even clenching her cheeks together, just relaxing and letting out a noisy fart. Roxxie's face was almost directly pushed up against the weasel's butthole, receiving the hot volley of stench at point blank range. The giant sheriff enjoyed the muffled coughing coming from her prisoner. After all the times Roxxie had forced Texas to endure similar things, it felt very cathartic to return the favor. The roo had so often mercilessly gassed her, using her as a seat or a saddle. And now she was crammed between the giant buttcheeks of the law. Not content with just farting, the sheriff took a moment and sat down on an immense boulder. She wiggled her butt a little to ensure as much of her weight was squashing the bandit flat as possible. The only thing Roxxie offered in return was more swearing and  threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! When ah get outta here ah'll-\" Another fart cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye'll what? Sit on me? Fart on me? Use me like a rag or yer damn toilet?! Like that's anythin new. Now shut yer hole and endure what's been comin to ya for so many years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me, you little shit!\" Roxxie screamed defiantly. Texas was going to make her regret those words. She stood up, reaching into the back of her pants and planting a finger against the back of the bandit's head. The roo tried to fight it, but she was pushed face first into the shuddering pucker. It opened up just enough for her face to begin slipping inside. But the giant didn't stop pushing until the bandit's whole head had been swallowed by the fetid hole. She let the roo have a taste of the pure, unfettered stink the sheriff's enormous rear could produce before pulling her free again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now ah don't wanna hear another word outta you, or ah might consider puttin you in there instead of in jail.\" Roxxie Roo bit her tongue, not wanting to experience that again. For all the stuck-up attitude, she never realized the sheriff could be as big a stinker as herself. Texas resumed her journey back to town, still frequently letting out farts of all calibers onto her prisoner. As time passed in the arid heat the stink of farts was joined by the heavy scent of weasel sweat. In the crevasse of Texas' crack the roo bandit could feel things getting more humid. Her nose was already aching from the gassy weasel, but this was becoming too much. She tried to wiggle away, but to no avail. The slippery sweat helped a little, but she was still far too close for comfort to the towering weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas began to discover some of the other perks of being a giant. Whilst some of the trails in the hills were difficult to traverse, she could quite easily climb some of the cliffs that would've led to large detours before. She didn't have to look for bridges, simply hopping over the narrow gorges in her path. To make sure the trip wasn't too short Texas made sure she took plenty of breaks, enjoying the scenery and taking a seat to relax. Any opportunity to feel the roo squash flat beneath her was put to good use. Near the end of the trip the giant weasel almost began to feel bad for her prisoner. But with Gold Springs mere minutes away she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would the townsfolk react? She was bigger than any building in town by quite a margin. Texas didn't want to cause a panic, but she couldn't just sit around and hope the blessing would wear of. It might be days before that happens, if it happens at all. The sheriff really regretted not asking Abra about the duration now. But there were bigger fish to fry. She would have to drop off Roxxie Roo at the sheriff's office so her deputies could lock the bandit up. But more than ever a seductive whisper leaned onto the giant weasel's mind. Just putting her nemesis in jail didn't seem good enough. Sure, it was the law and all that, but couldn't she serve the law even better by imprisoning the bandit somewhere a bit... smellier?</span></div></div>",

Besides, jail offered her a chance to just break out once more. No, Tex wanted her to suffer like she's suffered ten fold. She wanted the roo to spend the rest of her life trapped in the giant sheriff's ass. But she couldn't have her die from lack of food or water, that would be too quick. Then she got an idea. She turned around and went back into the wilds, where a certain cheetah's wagon was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying her hardest not to break anything, Texas lightly tapped the door to the wagon with a finger. Even as gentle as she was, her taps still shook the whole wagon, forcing Abra out to discover the source of these quakes. She looks up to see the smiling face of the weasel sheriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ah see you like my miracle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It amazing Abra. I regret ever doubting your powers.\" The cheetah girl blushed at the compliment. \"I got a question for you, do you have any sort of magic that can make someone not need to eat, drink, or sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still doubt ma power sheriff? Such a ting is child's play for me. Why, do you wish to no longer bother with such matters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ain't for me Abra.\" She pulled back her pants and removed the struggling roo. \"It's for this varmit. I plan to shove her further in ma butt but I don't want her croaking too soon.\" Both Tex and Abra share a laugh at Roxie's struggles and curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring her here and open her mouth, I have just dey ting.\" Tex lowers down the bound roo in front of Abra, holding her mouth open with a finger. Abra pulls out a purple vial and pours it's contents into Roxie's mouth. \"Done, she no longer needs sustenance or rest.\" Tex lifts up Roxie to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Roxie, enjoy your new life as my personal butt slave.\" She shoves the screaming roo back into her ass and past her sphincter. \"Mmmmm, that feels nice. You know Roxie, I'm thinking about taking up that bean diet you recommended me all that time ago.\" She knew Roxie heard her as she could feel the struggling inside her get more intense. The giant weasel responds by letting a big gas bomb loose, and with Roxie being in the very source, she felt and tasted it much more powerfully then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that Abra. Say, while I have you, how long does this giant thing last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be large forever unless someone shrinks you. May I ask, now that you have bested this one, what is your plan now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good question. At this size, she could easily take down crime. She could even get a win-win and use her old enemies as pleasure toys like with Roxie. The question was, who first?</span></div></div>",

Thanks again for the blessin, Abra. Gold Springs will be the safest town in the West.\" The giant weasel proudly boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra managed to contain her snickering and beckoned for the sheriff to wait up for a minute whilst she got something from her wagon. Texas could hear the cheetah rummaging around in there and a moment later she came back out holding three vials. She held them out for the giant weasel to take. With the greatest care Texas took the witchdoctor's tiny gift and stuffed them in one of her vest pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dese be de same concoction I gave ya little roo friend. Jus' in case you be tinkin about keepin anyone else close to ya. A fair warning though. While it removes de need for sustenance and rest, I never tested them in situations like de one you put dat roo in. So it may only last several years instead of forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hehe, that'll do.\" The giant sheriff responded with a small giggle. She clenched her butt a little so she could feel the trapped kangaroo struggle. With a cheerful spring in her step the weasel bid the witchdoctor goodbye and sauntered off towards town. Along the way she came up with a plan of action. Her first target is Vivian. The moment she would see the sheriff's new size, she'd try to flee. Texas had to be fast to stop the mayor from slipping through her large fingers. She could finally arrest that bitch and ensure justice would be served. Better yet, after today's little incident when the weasel was tiny, she had a good reason to arrest her. Vivian had always managed to remain unconnected to the crimes she orchestrated, but after plotting to murder the sheriff directly when she was tiny she couldn't pretend to be innocent any longer. The weasel couldn't let an opportunity like this slip by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud scream called for Texas' attention. She looked at the outskirts of town and saw a terrified fox-man stare at her, pointing his finger. Before he could scream more the sheriff threw up her hands and calmly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't be scared. Ah just got a little bigger. It's still the same good ol' Texas ya'll know an love.\" The man calmed down a little, but was still very nervous as the giant weasel approached the town. She stood taller than any of the buildings present by a good margin. Daily life in Gold Springs fell still as everyone huddled away in fear of the giant. The sheriff took great care not to step on anything, tip-toeing through main street and reassuring everyone that everything would be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't know how ah got broiled up in all this, folks. But through methods ah don't understand ah got made into the biggest sheriff in the country. So ah'm gonna do what good sheriffs do an' fight crime, startin with mayor Vivian.\" The giant weasel pointed an accusing finger at town hall. It might not be the smartest plan to announce who she was going after, but she figured one of her thugs probably informed her of the sheriff's new size by now. None of Vivian's henchmen dared to show their face, lest the sheriff might grab them too. But the weasel wasn't after the small fries. She wanted the mayor all to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra sat in her wagon, immensely content with herself. Her eyes were glazed over, her mind deep in a trance. She saw through Texas' eyes, seeing the fear the sheriff caused. Her 'blessing' was working like a charm and the weasel was none the wiser. She never once questioned the cheetah's actions. Now the witchdoctor watched as her 'blessing' did its work. The giant weasel would slowly discover that it wasn't just her body that grew in size. Abra had already seen how the sheriff had convinced herself Roxxie needed to be punished directly instead of being given a fair trial. Pride and arrogance were beginning to overwhelm the weasel's sense of justice. Would she even consider putting Vivian in jail at all? With baited breath the witchdoctor kept watching through Texas' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas stepped towards town hall, leaning down a little to peer into Vivian's office. Unsurprisingly it was empty. The giant sheriff couldn't just rip the roof of this building to check either. Not without causing mass panic. But Vivian probably wouldn't have the balls to stay in town with her around. She would try to escape somehow. Quietly the sheriff hoped she would try to run off on horseback. That way she could chase the lynx down and catch her somewhere outside of town, where there wouldn't be a soul around to see what she might do next. The sheriff hadn't forgotten the humiliation she suffered at the lynx's hands earlier today. Now it would be her turn to get squished between the sheriff's massive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gleeful smile the weasel calls out to the mayor. \"Mayor Vivian, you and I have some things to discuss. Most notably how you assaulted me earlier today and tried to put a bounty on my head.\" She could hear the incredulous whisperings from the townsfolk as they realized their mayor had duped them into hunting down the sheriff. The lynx was running out of time. She had to make a move, fast. But what would she do?</span></div></div>",

The weasel had still not bothered to actually run after her, instead opting for what seemed to be a light jog. This, however, was still enough for her to slowly gain ground on the lynx. It didn't matter though, Vivian had a plan. Not much further was a narrow ravine. She had no intention of jumping it, Texas would just jump after her. Instead, she would ride into the ravine so the sheriff would be too big to give chase effectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading her mind about the plan, Texas broke into a run. Vivian was just about to head into the ravine when Texas got right on top of her. Her horse panicked, and rather than run down the trail, it decided to jump instead.

She then stretched her legs under her armpits and her arms behind her neck, while her stretched torso served as the cups. Vivian was now a living, breathing lynx skin bra.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Texas adjusted her shirt and rubbed her chest. Her new bra offered surprisingly good support, given how jelly-spined the mayor usually is. Maybe she'd finally found her purpose in life. Vivian tried to protest, but whenever she got too noisy the sheriff would just push down on her head, wedging it deep between those soft globes. The sweaty smell they produced after a long day of hard work would stay with the lynx for years to come. With a big smile the sheriff stood up, getting ready to return to town when something caught her eye. Dust clouds were approaching from the nearby pass. Someone was following her. She grew immensely curious, wondering who it would be. Maybe it's just some travelers who happen to follow this trail. Or maybe it was Vivian's goons, trying to either help out or skip town themselves. Texas gleefully wrung her hands. Please let it be the thugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust clouds got close the sheriff's giddy smile couldn't get bigger. Finally the mysterious pursuer was revealed. Riding atop her oversized horse was Georgia, Texas' old corrupt deputy. Normally the horse woman towered over the weasel, but now she tables were turned. But she didn't seem to care, charging right up to the giant weasel and hopping off her horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas! This madness ends here. Ah don't care how you managed to blow yourself up. Ah'm gonna blow you away.\" She drew her revolver and aimed straight for the weasel's face. The sheriff threw up her hand, commanding her former deputy to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BANG</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff felt a small sting in her palm. Like someone had pricked it with a needle. She looked down at the mare, who seemed shocked her shot did so little. She lifted her revolver back up and emptied it on the giant weasel. Texas didn't even flinch, feeling the minute impact of Georgia's bullets. She looked down at the now terrified horse woman. Part of the weasel wanted to return the favor and fire her own revolver. At this size it would put even the biggest cannons to shame. But seeing the mare realize just how much she was in over her head was an absolute delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia tried to reload her weapon, but the weasel wasn't going to let her. A large hand came down and grabbed the gun from her with two thick digits. The weasel crushed her former deputy's firearm into scrap metal and reached down to pick the horse woman up. Georgia tried to run away, but she'd never been the fastest. She let out a surprised shriek when the weasel's large fingers wrapped around her, lifting her off the ground and bringing her to Texas' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Georgia, ah can safely say you've earned every little bit of what ah'm about t' do to ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bite me, ya bitch!\" the horse woman snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are ya sure?\" Texas cooed, showing off her huge, toothy smile. Her former deputy quickly realized how poorly she had chosen her words as those jaws parted and showed off the sheriff's hungry gullet. Texas didn't suffer Georgia's foul-mouthed protests any longer and stuffed her halfway into her slavering maw. The big lips sealed around the horse woman's waist, reducing her to a squirming lollipop. Texas' tongue got busy humiliating her opponent, squeezing itself into the mare's vest and ripping it open. The slobbery organ quickly managed to peel the clothes off the mare whilst Texas tended to the parts sticking out of her mouth. She pulled Georgia's boots away and tore off her large pants, leaving her jiggling butt exposed in the desert sun. Texas had been up close to that butt many times before as the horse woman often liked to squash the sheriff flat beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her victim undressed the weasel quickly got to work on her own pants, undoing the belt and popping open the front. She already had a passenger in the back and it left her wanting more. She had an aching need that Georgia was going to help her fulfill. Vivian wouldn't have been big enough for her lustful desires and Roxxie didn't deserve to be her dildo, but the horse was perfect. Her relatively large frame would be a match for the weasel's snatch, which was beginning to dribble out its arousal in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia was freed from her slobbery prison and spat out onto the sheriff's palm. Strong fingers wrapped around her, holding everything from the neck down in an iron grip. The not-so-massive-anymore mare was quickly carried down to her final destination, screaming aloud as she saw Texas pull open the front of her panties. The terrified horse woman closed her eyes as she was plunged into the smelly hell. Trapped between the weasel's massive pussy and the soaked fabric of her panties the horse woman could do nothing but cry out for mercy. Her pleas fell on deaf ears though, as a large finger began to massage her against the quivering flesh of the sheriff's most intimate areas. The feminine scent was overwhelming, arousal flowing richly all around the mare. Suddenly a finger found itself on the back of her head, pushing Georgia's face between the wet folds. With a loud squelch the mare began to vanish into the giant weasel's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas moaned loudly, feeling her former deputy beginning to enter her. She was in no rush to finish this, slowly pushing and massaging her nethers. She felt Georgia's head try to twist and turn inside of her, sending waves of unmitigated lust rushing through her. She pushed the mare's shoulders in, crying out with pleasure as they slid past her lower lips. When the horse's wide waist was getting close to the wet gates the sheriff pulled her former deputy out, just so she could feel her slowly go in again. This wasn't even about making Georgia suffer anymore. The giant weasel just wanted to prolong the intense, electrifying joy she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering sheriff's other prisoners felt the waves of pleasure rushing through her as well. Roxxie Roo had to endure intense pressure as the narrow passage of Texas' rectum bore down on her with renewed vigor. Vivian got to smell the piercing feminine stink rising up from the weasel's nethers. It was almost as bad as feeling the weasel work up a sweat, the stretched out lynx's smooth fur being first to absorb the smelly moisture forming on the sheriff's rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overwhelming pleasure radiating from her loins drove Texas to push more and more of her former deputy into her pussy with every round. Even the mare's impressive waistline soon fell prey to the large, ravenous snatch. The giant weasel kept on pumping more and more of the mare's body into her sopping wet folds.</span></div></div>",

Her muscles were clenching around her, driving her closer to the edge. She finally pushed Georgia all the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Texas was hit by a three-sided pleasure attack. Georgia was now completely inside her pussy, still kicking and screaming. Meanwhile, Roxxie had started to struggle again at the anal muscles squeezing around her. Vivian's desperate attempts to free her arms and legs made her body rub up against the weasel's nipples. This was too much stimulus for the sheriff. Clenching around Roxxie and Georgia one final time, she let out a massive orgasm that nearly drowned the mare that's trapped in her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. This was Georgia's true purpose, to be her own personal dildo forever. But, so needed to make sure she knew that. She needed Georgia to understand her new position, then it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the drenched mare out of her pussy, she held Georgia in a clenched fist and reached for her mount. Georgia cpuld only watch in horror as her loyal steed was lifted up to the sheriff's mouth, and had her head bitten off by the massive weasel, then the remains were tossed aside. All the while, Texas never broke eye contact with Georga, silently tell her that this is the price of disobedience. She pulls out another vial, this time handing it to Georgia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink.\" She orders. Georgia couldn't have drank any faster even if she just swallowed it glass and all. Texas couldn't help but laugh at how quickly she had broken her. \"Welcome to your new life, Gergia.\" She slid the mare back into her pussy, where she planned to leave her for the rest of her days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow where?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With three bandits safely in her 'custody' Texas was determined to rid herself of the last big name in these parts. Smiling Jacks and her gang of bunnies caused no end of trouble for the sheriff. When they weren't busy stealing cattle from ranchers everywhere they could be found trying to abduct people, either for a ransom or just to have someone to torment. The giant weasel already imagined the shocked look on Jacks' face as she would face some smelly punishment of her own. Given the rabbit's fart-happy tendencies, maybe she could keep Roxxie company in the weasel's rectum. Then again, ridding the area of all these evildoers had left the giant sheriff quite hungry. Those bunnies might make for a decent meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra sat back in her wagon. She couldn't believe how well this was going. With the sheriff having the slightest clue she had melted away Texas' inhibitions. The witchdoctor kept a close eye on the weasel's thoughts and she never even hesitated when it came to punishing Georgia. Not a single moment where the weasel might think that what she did was wrong. The idea of locking the mare in jail never once crossed the sheriff's mind. The cheetah gleefully rubbed her hands and resumed watching the spectacle unfold through the giant's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant sheriff got on her feet and made her way to the old ranch where Smiling Jacks would be holed up. Though it all seemed to be going well the weasel soon ran into a problem. With every step her pussy gave its prisoner a light squeeze, making Georgia faintly squirm in response. The weasel had gone less than a mile and was already feeling the heat rising between her legs. At this rate it would take forever to get to Jacks. The weasel had to do something, she couldn't go around like this and she didn't want to tell her former deputy off for making her feel so good. Perhaps Georgia could be granted a small mercy, if only so Texas could get a move on. Reluctantly she undid her pants and with a load moan she pushed her toy back out. She pulled a small, old coinpurse from her pocket and forced the drenched mare in, tying it up so she couldn't escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you be good in there, Georgia. Ah don't wanna hear a squeak outta ya or yer goin right back in me, understood?\" The sheriff spoke sternly, the mare just whimpering a tiny \"yes.\" The giant weasel lifted up her pants, put the bagged mare in her pocket and set off, able to make good speed now that she wasn't getting aroused with every step she took. Her former deputy wisely kept her big mouth shut, enjoying the relative luxury of not being trapped in the weasel's sopping wet pussy. The smell of old leather was a definite improvement over the dense, musky stink in the weasel's depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn good time the weasel reached her destination. The large ranch looked as normal as any of the farmhouses around Gold Springs. No doubt the cattle grazing in the fields was stolen, but that was something to deal with later. Texas smiled as her eyes fell on the front gate. Propped up against it was a guard who was fast asleep. With all the stealth a giant weasel had she tip-toed closer. Only when her shadow fell over the sleeping guard did he begin to wake up. He looked up, shocked to see the shadow of the sheriff's looming boot. Before he could react Texas brought her foot down, squashing the guard flat. She ground her boot from side to side until a sheet of paper would be jealous of how thin the unfortunate rabbit was. The weasel dragged her foot back to reveal his smooshed face and kneeled down, whispering at him in an unsettlingly cheerful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, could ya be so kind an' tell me if Smilin Jacks is home?\" The terrified bandit managed a shaky nod with his flattened face. The giant sheriff smiled and rose back onto her feet, she moved towards the ranchhouse, leaving the flattened guard behind. She wasn't interested in Jacks' cronies. Her eyes were set on the big prize. By now the weasel was confident someone in that house would've seen her. How would Smiling Jacks react to seeing towering Texas coming for her?</span></div></div>",

Her hands were on her hips, trying to give herself an appearance of confidence. But as she got closer to Texas, the weasel noticed she was slightly trembling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering when you'd come for me sheriff. When I heard from my boys that you'd gone huge and started turning criminals into playthings, I knew my time was coming.\" The matter-of-fact way she spoke put Texas off, but did not deter her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you still stayed in the same farmhouse you knew I'd look for you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knrw if I ran, you'd just find me anyhow. So I'm here to cut a deal with you. I'll surrender willingly to whatever spot on your person you want me to, as long as you let my boys go free. I dragged them into this life. Their actions are my responsibility. They's is good men.\" Texas was suprised at how mature and accepting Jacks was of all this. She was expecting a fight like Georgia or for her to run away like Vivian, but this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then Jacks. As it happens, you were the only one I came here for anyway. In fact, I've got a nice, cushy spot as the insole for my right boot that will fit you nicely after all the times you stomped me under yours. But first,\" she pulls out the last vial, \"drink this.\" She hands it down to Jacks, who swigs it like a flask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished, Texas removed her right boot, airing out her sweaty foot. She grabbed the jackrabbit in a clenched fist and held her over the open boot. \"Enjoy your new life Jacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

The sweaty stench is powerful enough to knock out a horse, but the bandit is made of sterner stuff. Looming over her was the towering weasel, smiling as she watched her latest victim adjust itself to its new surroundings. As brave as the rabbit looked, she was beginning to lose her composure. By the time Texas' foot cast a shadow over her Smiling Jacks was in a panic. The large foot re-entered the boot, making itself at home and squashing the bandit flat. The giant sheriff twisted her foot to further mould her new insole into shape. She then looked up to the farmhouse, almost every window housing a terrified bunny bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up y'all. Your boss offered herself up ta spare ya from my wrath. But ah'm only gonna let ya walk if ya do <i>exactly</i> what ah say! First, y'all will be returnin all of these heads o cattle to their original owners. Then ye'll leave town an' never return. Ah catch any single one o ya and it's right down me gullet, are we clear, varmints?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrified bunnies all nod expect for one. She seems unimpressed by the sheriff's threats. She raises up her rifle and aims a shot right between Texas' eyes. A loud bang rings out and her shot hits the mark, bouncing right off the giant weasel's forehead. The sheriff sighs deeply. Partly exasperated by this act of stupidity and a little relieved she's got an excuse to score a quick snack. The other bunnies in the farmhouse scamper, not wanting to get caught up in the crossfire as the weasel stomps closer. The brave bandit fires one more shot before trying to run. But a large hand bursts through the wall, grabbing her in a storm of splintered wood and squeezing her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant sheriff didn't bother wasting a single word on the bunny bandit in her hand, simply opening her maw wide and throwing the little thing in. The rabbit landed on the weasel's large tongue with a wet squish and before she could move a muscle the large jaws around her closed. Texas played a little with the morsel in her mouth before pushing her to the back and letting her sink down that ravenous gullet. Just two gulps were needed to claim the slender bunny's frame and send it on a short journey to the sheriff's stomach. She contently pats her belly, looking at the huddled crowd of terrified bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else wanna give shootin me a try? Room for plenty more in here. No? Then git to work!\" She commanded. The sheriff walked away proudly. Not only had she dismantled Smiling Jacks' gang, she got herself a new insole and a snack out of it. One little bunny was hardly enough of a meal, but at least it stopped her hunger for now. With four of the biggest threats to Gold Springs eliminated in a single afternoon Texas headed back to town to celebrate. She couldn't wait to tell everyone how much safer they were with the biggest sheriff in the west as their guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would Gold Springs be so accepting of their new giant sheriff? Or would they disapprove of her newfound ways to deliver justice?</span></div></div>",

This was perfect, now that she's asleep, her mind will be much more vulnerable to her magic. She needed to turn Texas against her own town. She wanted her isolated and at her complete mercy.

Sure, protecting them sounded nice, but what if she put her strength to some real use? She saw all the different possibilities before her. She could sell the townsfolk insurance on their houses to stop giant weasels from sitting on them. She could make whoever she wanted disappear into her belly forever. How did she never recognize all these options before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra laughed maniacally in her wagon, feeling the sheriff's change of heart take place. Her spell was a resounding success. Now she could sit back and watch Gold Springs tremble. With a mischievous smirk the cheetah grabbed some tea and prepared for a show. She looked through the weasel's eyes and saw her standing up, wringing her hands and looking down on the town she once safeguarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas wandered down main street, a devious smirk on her face. All these people would do as she said or she would make an example out of them. Though if they knew what she'd done to the previous bandits terrorizing the town was there really need for another example? The townsfolk could feel something was off about their sheriff, but none dared to raise a question. The weasel was lost in thought, picturing what it might feel like to have them struggling in her grasp. Squirming in her stomach, ass or pussy and the thrill of feeling those struggles subside as they perished. The weasel was so lost in thought she almost wandered straight into the town hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff stopped and looked at the empty town hall. Maybe she could take Vivian's place and run this town. Who was she kidding? With her size she didn't need any titles or offices to run this town. She could be the tyrant of Gold Springs if she desired it, but even that seemed like too much busywork. Perhaps Georgia's way of doing things was better. The giant weasel could just do whatever she pleased in the name of the 'law' and if anyone gets in her way she uses her might to crush them. Then again, maybe the life of Roxxie Roo was closer to her style. Just go out and rob whoever you like if you find yourself needing money. All the cash in the Gold Springs bank could be a nice start for her new life as a career criminal. The only lifestyle that the giant former sheriff didn't like was that of Smiling Jacks. Rustling cattle sounded like way too much busywork for the weasel to bother with. She'd just wander about and take some cows from the nearby farms whenever she's hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked out the other end of town the weasel's mind was filled with possibilities. After the reign of Vivian, Georgia, Roxxie and Jacks it would be hard for the townspeople to imagine an even worse threat. Texas was going to show them how much worse things could get.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sheriff quickly dealt with the few remaining bandits in the city. Texas started by promising all of Vivian's thugs that if they gave themselves up at the sheriff's office her deputies would take care of the situation. If she found any of them afterwards, they would be taken care of by the sheriff herself. She licked her chops and patted her belly with that part of the announcement, sending a chilling message to the thugs. Unsurprisingly, almost all of them lined up to be taken to jail. A few tried to lay low or flee town, but the giant weasel didn't need long to find them. She took special interest in the rat duo that had captured her when she was tiny. They tried to hide out, but when Texas found them she threw them on the ground, lifting her foot over them. With a loud thud the heel of Texas' boot crashed down next to the shivering thugs. Slowly the sole came down, flattening them until they were helplessly pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brings back memories, don't it, ya varmints? Don't think ah've forgotten about you two. Thanks to you ah nearly ended up as Vivian's snack! Ah oughta return the favor an' eat ya meself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rats' whimpering pleas were music to the weasel's ears and in a fit of mercy she merely squashed them flat underfoot before bringing them to the sheriff's office. She handed the thugs off to her deputies and set about ridding Gold Springs and the surrounding region of all crime. Many of the bandits living in town had already chosen greener pastures before the giant sheriff could get her hands on them. Those that foolishly stayed behind were often reduced to tasty snacks for the weasel. In spite of Smiling Jacks' noble sacrifice it seemed that without her leadership her gang had mostly opted to stick around. When the sheriff confronted them at their new lair, she had a big, giddy smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now ah told you what was gonna happen if ya stuck around.\" She turned to face her boot, the infamous rabbit bandit still smooshed inside as a living insole. \"Ya can't blame me for this, Jacks. This is on them.\" The weasel chuckled. If Jacks was able to do anything, it'd be letting out a deep sigh. She knew her bunnies weren't the smartest tools in the shed, but this was dumb even by their standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas simply walked up to the bandits' lair, shrugging off withering gunfire like it was a mild breeze. The only thing the bunnies managed to wear down was the sheriff's patience. She reached in and grabbed one of the bandits, bringing the shrieking bunny to her maw and swallowing her whole. The last thing the bandits saw of their friend was a bulge traveling down Texas' neck. In mere minutes the gunfire was silenced and the weasel opted for a lengthy nap, her belly swollen with prey. The message was sent far and wide. Any bandits worth their salt kept away from Gold Springs and its ravenous sheriff. There was still the odd highwayman, but for the most part crime had vanished from the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo criminals were more intimately aware of this danger than the ones the weasel kept on her at all times. Whenever the town was all serene and peaceful the sheriff would take a long walk, finding a nice secluded area to have some fun in, far away from prying eyes. She relished playing with her four biggest enemies, now little more than toys for the weasel's urges. She began to swap around their positions, putting Georgia up her butt for a few months whilst Roxxie could enjoy being squeezed in the sheriff's pussy. Jacks too made for a great bit of stimulation, her slim frame providing little resistance in the weasel's crushing love tunnel. Vivian did great as an insole, finally providing Texas the support she never gave her as mayor. For many years they wouldn't leave the weasel's side as the sheriff enjoyed spending her time lewdly tormenting the former greatest bandits in the region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away Abra was enjoying the show too. It reminded her of the time she humiliated Texas by using the sheriff as her toy. The cheetah stuck around for a few more months, helping the citizens of Gold Springs with her tricks. But even after she left, she would still frequently use her magic to look through Texas' eyes to see the sheriff act out her desires. The witchdoctor did not expect her blessing to have this result. Her visions foretold of the sheriff trying to attack her and falling prey to her influence. The cheetah lamented not having a giant weasel to sic on her enemies, but she wasn't one to hold a grudge. There were still many more towns that she could liven up with her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith crime at a record low, the weasel began to employ her size in other ways. She helped the town prosper by providing the lumber needed for new buildings. An easy task when you can just rip trees out of the ground with your bare hands. The grateful townsfolk paid her well, money which she spent buying cows to sate her appetite. The odd, uninformed bandit still made for a tasty snack from time to time, the sheriff savouring them whenever she caught them. Through her hard work the sleepy mining town flourished, a safe haven in the lawless desert. In time, Gold Springs turned into a bustling city, ensuring Texas' legacy as the greatest sheriff in the Wild West would last forever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a satisfied smile Texas skipped through the desert. Her mood was at an all-time high, further helped by her greatest enemies now squirming helplessly against her enormous body. Vivian did a great job supporting her breasts, Jacks was the insole she never knew she needed this much and even Roxxie was doing her part in the weasel's ass. For a moment the sheriff thought about taking a short break in a nearby secluded gorge so she could have some fun with Georgia again. It was almost a pity the horse woman was able to avoid her punishment by virtue of being so good at her role as Texas' dildo that the sheriff could barely walk straight with her inserted. It had to be done, out of fairness to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff sat herself down in the nearby gorge, her immense body coming to a rest as she fetched the mare from the old purse she'd been put in. The squirming villain was still a little wet with the weasel's juices, but Texas didn't mind. She was about to receive so much more of them it wouldn't matter. Quickly she undid her belt and dropped her pants, lowering Georgia before those engorged, puffy lips once more. With little fanfare she plunged her corrupt former deputy in, a loud squelch echoing through the gorge. Already the sheriff was panting with arousal, but she wanted more. With two fingers on the mare's butt she helped her greedy pussy swallow its prey. Quickly the horse woman reminded the giant weasel why she couldn't stay inside all the time. Texas' whole body shook with pleasure as her pussy bore down on its prey with ravenous zeal, squeezing the trapped mare and bringing the sheriff to the edge of her climax. She rubbed her chest, pressing the stretched Vivian into her boobs and with a booming moan the weasel exploded in an epic orgasm. A river of slime surged from her pussy, carrying the soaked Georgia with it. The mare was too exhausted from the brutal punishment to abuse the sheriff's afterglow and flee. Texas quickly deposited her back in the purse and secured her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tidying herself up the sheriff continued on her way to town. As the first houses came into view she could tell something was off. The streets were mostly empty and a distant racket could be heard. Curious, the weasel gets closer. She sees a throng of people assembled before the sheriff's office, April desperately trying to speak to them. She couldn't get a word in. Someone in the amassed crowd spots Texas and soon their attention turns to her. The confused sheriff looks at April who signs at her that she doesn't really know what to do either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Folks, what's goin on?\" The giant sheriff asks politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a monster, a freak!\" The crowd hollers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Ah'm still the same ol' Texas ah always was. Jus' 'cause ah got a little bigger don't mean ah changed or somethin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit, we heard what happened with Vivian. You turned her into a bra! What kind of fucked up 'justice' is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas mood steadily began to sour. These people weren't really defending Vivian of all people, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, ah had to stop her from escapin the law, ah couldn't risk her gettin away from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure ya did. I don't know what you were doing to her, but we could hear the moaning all the way over here. You've abused your position as sheriff to torture people. You should be in one of those cells, but April refuses to arrest you!\" The crowd angrily pointed at the sheriff's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, enough! Ah suffered too much at the hands o those bandits for <i>years</i> to be told off by you lot! Ah did what needed to be done to ensure <i>your</i> safety. You've all got the biggest sheriff in all the West. Gold Springs is now the safest town around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how long until you grow tired of your current crop of victims and find some justification to use us for your sick pleasures!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas couldn't believe it. After all the indignities she suffered at the hands of the bandits she defeated today, this was her thanks for bringing them in? She'd been put through a thousand times worse by each of these four and now that they're gone people wanted to oust her too? After serving them dutifully and upholding the law as best she could it was just this one little bit of fun that was enough for them to discard her like a piece of used toilet paper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave this place and don't ever dare to come back!\" An angry bull man shouted, lunging forward and stabbing Texas' boot with his rake. The others began to rattle their tools and farming implements as well. The giant sheriff took a few steps back, baffled by their hostility. How could the still have any mercy for the likes of Roxxie Roo or Smiling Jacks? More and more a voice in the back of her head began to sway her. She didn't have to take this. She was sheriff Texas Stanton. If these rubes didn't want to listen to reason, they too could feel her justice. But lashing out would make her the monster they accuse her of being. The angry mob got louder and louder until a gunshot silenced them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom amidst the crowd a pudgy rat woman had fired a shot at the weasel. Their rabbling soon resumed but Texas just stood there, frozen. Something within her just... snapped. These people that she had put so much on the line for had just tried to murder her. They were never going to see her as anything other than a monster. Well, if it's a monster they want, then the giant weasel will give them a monster. Her shocked expression turned to a scowl and she stomped forward. The crowd exploded in panicked screams and scattered. The sheriff had her sights set on the rat woman that shot at her and lifted her foot high. Every building in town shook as she slammed down her immense boot on top of the rat, squashing her flat in an instant. With the rat dealt with the sheriff growled at the terrified people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to the nearest house and gave it a fierce kick, instantly reducing half the building to splinters and letting the other half collapse on its own. She continued down the road, ravaging every home. Near the end she simply dove forward, smashing an entire row of houses beneath her large body. The sheriff walked up to the saloon and turned around. A host of panicked citizens fled the building before the weasel sat down on it, her heavy butt obliterating the building. Amidst the rubble she could hear the wailing of those that were too slow to escape, now squished out of shape beneath the shattered timber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panicked townsfolk scurried about like fleeing ants as the giant weasel walked down main street, pummeling every shop and house along the way. Occasionally she squashed whoever came too near and soon the sheriff reached the town hall. It stood taller than the surrounding buildings, but compared to Texas it still wasn't even close. She lifted the fragile structure off its foundation and threw it onto another row of shops, demolishing them all. Suddenly a sound rang out that sent a wave of impending doom through all the fleeing townsfolk. A deep, gurgling rumble echoed from Texas' belly. The sheriff was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas squatted down and began to grab people one at a time, dropping them into her hungry maw and gobbling them up. She'd already had a small taste with the lone bunny bandit that opposed her at Smiling Jacks' hideout, but that was barely a snack. Every gulp sent another citizen into the weasel's empty belly. The more she added, the more she could feel them wriggling in her stomach. The weasel loved it, eagerly feasting on the townsfolk until she couldn't take another bite. But there were still so many people left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant weasel walked over to the sheriff's office. She carefully tore off the roof and pulled one of the cell doors from its hinges. She transformed the whole of the office into one big makeshift cell. For the better part of an hour Texas gathered more people in this big cell, brutally punishing any who tried to escape. Only April was spared. The giant sheriff put her down next to her horse and pointed to the distance, urging her to leave. Not wanting to upset whatever part of her friend was left in that towering monster the fox nodded and galloped away on her horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the day's end the towering weasel had one last thing to do to conclude her rampage. She dropped her pants and hovered her enormous ass over the makeshift prison holding the remaining townsfolk. The weasel grunted and unleashed a bellowing fart, forcing everyone on their knees and making the small crowd erupt in coughing and gagging. People began to pass out from the stench but a few were still able to look up in horror as they saw Roxxie's feet dangling from the weasel's asshole. It quickly worked to suck them back in, sealing Roxxie up in her wretched prison once more. After only a minute every last one of Texas' prisoners had passed out. The weasel laid herself out in the street next to her office and closed her eyes. Her bloated stomach got to work on its contents and with a broad smile the sheriff fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

As she flexed her pucker, making sure to crush the kangaroo between her backdoor and her panties, she released yet another potent, sweaty fart as she coo'd with glee at the payback she's finally able to give Roxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Roxie, I thought I was punishing you. But you just keep trying to smooch my asshole.\" Texas laughed as she repeatedly flexed her pucker, punching it into her repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you Texas. I swear, when I get out of here, You're gonna wish you'd killed me.\"<br>\r\nTexas could only smile joyfully as she let out another fart.<br>\r\n\"Hey Roxie, if you ever think about ditching the outlaw career and go straight, you'd make a great fart slurper.\" Texas cackled, getting a bit overzealous with vengeance over her nemesis. \"Yeah, I might just keep you back there to keep my butthole clean indefinately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, you'd better hope you stay like that forever, because if I ever catch you otherwise... What I'd do to you would give Butterscotch nightmares.\" Roxie howled in blind rage.<br>\r\nTexas sighed and flexed her glutes. \"Less barking, more sucking of my asshole.\" Texas reached behind her back and shoved a finger up her buttcrack, pushing her panties deeper as she plunged Roxie onto her pucker. \"It's time worthless trash like you, outlaws learn your place anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas grew concern as she thought, maybe she'd gone too far with antagonizing Roxie. Sighing, she'd reach down the back of her pants and fish out Roxie. Covering her mouth, she struggled to muffle a laugh as she saw Roxie, completely creamed in her buttsweat, and droplets of excrement which had managed to escape along with one of her farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie was visually steaming. A murderous glare was focused upon Texas, which, even though Texas' superior size, made her feel uneasy. Texas thought she could at least untie Roxie as well, not like she'd be much of a threat without ropes anyway. And once done, Texas stored the string in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, Texas felt her forehead heating up as a sharp pain trailed along her back. Fearing the worst, her eyes grew wide. But before she knew it, she felt herself almost instantly shrink back to her previous, shrunken size. In sheer panic, Texas begins to flail and thrash in the air. Though as if the universe was against her, the rope she had retrieved previously would drift out of her pocket as it got tangled around her one leg, then the other, and eventually her arms, swirling around her miniscule body until she was restricted enough to not move a single muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Texas eyes drifted below her onto her destination, she noticed she was headed straight for a building, looking at a nearby neon sign, she read the words. \"The Farting Funhouse.\" Texas skin turned white, as she had heard rumors of this place before. This places sole purpose was to serve the most gas inducing food imaginable, while the staff aggressively encouraged their customers to fart as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Texas descended into an open window in the ceiling. She was met by the overwhelming sound of farts frequently exploding from every direction, as apparently this was a extremely crowded and popular establishment. And it didn't matter what direction Texas looked, because the only things she could see were tables absolutely filled with free food buffets, and massive rears spraying farts into their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Back Into Old Habits.</b></u><br>\r\nTexas would find herself crashing into a comfortable, cushioned chair, parked right infront of a table stacked several feet high with food. Looking up, she saw the unmistakeable booty of Roxie following right behind, as it was aimed to crash in the same seat as Texas. Apparently, when Texas removed Roxie from her butt, she must have accidentally torn Roxie's pants off. As the kangaroo was completely nude from the waist down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Cushion of Honor.</b></u><br>\r\nTexas had crashed right onto the seat of a highly decorated chair. Apparently they were about to use if for the Fart Contest which would start any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Fart Sampler.</b></u><br>\r\nTexas was falling toward a special seating area. Where there was a circular table stacked with gasseous food. And inside this circle, was a circular bench big enough to fit 5 of these grotesque, farting behemoths at a time. Unfortunately, Texas would crash right into the center of the bench, as she was completely surrounded by 5 soiled, gaping buttcracks aimed straight at her.</span></div></div>",

Not much too look at with a simple pillow on it, Texas was glad it could help her remain hidden as she assets her situation to formulate a plan.

She lit a strange looking heap of fragrant incense and breathed deeply. All the candles in the wagon flickered as the witchdoctor muttered to herself. Quickly muttering turned to groaning and the smell of incense grew stronger, like a fire shooting up her nose and straight into her brain. The vision she received was so profound it knocked her flat on her back, leaving her breathless and motionless. After a few moments of gathering her thoughts, the cheetah sat up again, dusting off her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, dat's a lot of enemies. No wonder's she's so paranoid and testy. But who would serve me best in teaching her a lesson she won't soon forget?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe candles flickered again and Abra turned as though she was facing someone. she nodded intently, transfixed on a random spot on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dat makes sense.

But it smelled like the lion's share of it originated from the bandit's horse. With a curious and mischievous glance the cheetah approached Butterscotch. The large mare seemed a little uneasy at the sight of this eerie woman covered in trinkets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful there, doc. Ol' Butterscotch is in a mood lately.\" Roxxie warned, but Abra seemed undeterred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She be a beautiful horse.\" She commented, admiring the strength and power radiating off the mare. Butterscotch needed to be strong. Hauling a fat bandit like Roxxie around was no easy feat. The witchdoctor looked the stallion in her eyes. The horse huffed and bristled in return, growing more and more uncomfortable with the presence of the witchdoctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It be fine, ya mighty beast. Little Abra here means you no harm.\" Her eyes seemed to glint with a strange aura and to Roxxie's surprise her horse relaxed. It seemed almost entranced by the cheetah's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did ya do that? I gotta have you around more often when Butterscotch is moody.\" She said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De spirits see potential in dis animal. Can I give her a little treat?\" Abra asked the roo, holding up a sugar cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, sure. I reckon she ain't gonna get any fatter from that.\" Roxxie hollered, amused by the cheetah's politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened by the kangaroo's words, Abra fishes two more sugar cubes from her robes, presenting them all to the horse. Butterscotch looked at them curiously at first. She couldn't tell how or what, but something seemed off about them. But her big belly soon overrode any hesitation and she slurped them all out of Abra's hand. The mare whinnied with glee, letting the witchdoctor pat her head. Abra struggled to keep her composure, the urge to laugh maniacally at her deed growing strong. She politely excused herself and prepared to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where ya goin, doc? I thought you were gonna improve me so I can beat Texas once and for all.\" The confused roo asks. The cheetah thought fast and gave her an excuse. \"De spirits need time to attune your body. Sleep well tonight and by tomorrow you will be unstoppable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie just gave a half-hearted nod. She wanted to crush Texas today. But she had no idea how these crazy concoctions are supposed to work, so waiting a day is what it would take. She let the witchdoctor out, pondering for a moment if she should keep Abra hostage, just in case she'd been trying to trick her. But as the thought passed her mind the cheetah snapped around and stared her in the eye. Either she had amazing timing or she knew what the roo was thinking. It was unsettling either way and Roxxie could do without having the cheetah in her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Abra was out of sight of Roxxie's lair she ran as fast as she could. Her magic would kick in soon, and she didn't want to be anywhere close to it when it happened. If her hunch was correct, this was going to decimate that stupid little town and possibly a few more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo bandit sat back in her chair, patting her belly and wondering how she'd notice the potion's effects first. She glanced over to Butterscotch, who seemed calm. But something was off about the horse. The roo couldn't place it immediately, but things didn't seem right. Her face turned red at the thought of Abra having done something to hurt her horse. But then Butterscotch lets out a short whinny and grows six inches taller before the roo's eyes. A few seconds later another whinny paired with more growth. Roxxie quickly opens the pen and pulls her horse outside. She had no idea when this would stop, but she didn't want her horse to hurt herself by bursting through the roof. She also kinda preferred her lair not to be destroyed by her horse growing huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch whinnied loudly, growing faster and faster. She cleared the last door just moments before her butt would've become too big to fit. She looked at her frightened owner as the roo got more and more puny. The strange taste of those sugar cubes should've tipped her off immediately, but the horse's sweet tooth got the better of her judgment. Both horse and bandit wondered when this would end. It took a considerable amount of time but when Butterscotch had finally stopped growing she stood tall enough to see Gold Springs in the far distance. She looked down to see the bandit and gave the closest thing a horse has to a chuckle. Roxxie Roo was downright tiny, no more than a mouthful for the mare. Her words were barely decipherable anymore, but she seemed upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Butterscotch realized one of her hooves was planted right in the middle of the roo's lair, demolishing it completely. The destruction awoke something in the horse. She looked over to the distant town again and felt a malicious urge to go there. But first she wanted to deal with the kangaroo.</span></div></div>",

She had free reign to go where she wanted and do as she pleased. A single step would reduce her partner in crime to a flattened puddle, like she'd done so often with Texas. Maybe she could sit on her or swallow her up. Butterscotch looked at her former rider with glee, sending a shiver down the bandit's spine. Roxxie knew that stare. Her horse only looked at Texas like that when she was about to punish her. The enormous mare leaned her head down closer, huffing a jetstream of hot air all over the roo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E... Easy there girl. You still remember me, right?\" The kangaroo stammered nervously. The horse seemed to be stuck pondering still until the penny dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterscotch opened her maw and went in. In an instant Roxxie Roo was surrounded by the wet cavern and the horse carefully closed her maw, her thick lips wrapping around the roo's legs. The bandit screamed as she felt her steed move its head but before things could take a turn for the nightmarish the huge maw opened again. The horse wiggled her tongue a little, letting her partner in crime slip out. She landed roughly on the mare's back, covered in horse drool. Her heart was racing. The pudgy mare couldn't bring herself to hurt her lifelong friend. Roxxie might be an ass sometimes, but she has taken care of Butterscotch for so long, kept her healthy and happy. And only in the bandit's line of work did the horse get to live out her malicious dreams of tormenting others with her farts and weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal horse began trotting towards the unsuspecting town in the distance. It felt strange to not have the roo's considerable mass on her back. Roxxie was little more than a flea hitching a ride at this point. The roo was still trying to calm down after the scary trip in her steed's maw. Soon her eyes fell on Gold Springs and she began to puzzle things together. Her partner in crime was about to be having some fun there. The bandit had dreamed of taking on a whole town at once and now it was going to be a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I like where this is going.\" She said loudly, encouraging her horse. Butterscotch could barely understand her words, but that didn't matter. The towering mare was already daydreaming about what to do when she reached her destination. She couldn't wait to see the look on everyone's face as they were about to get stomped flat or sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance Abra had already packed up her things and was riding her cart far away from Gold Springs. She could see the humongous horse lazily trotting over and when she felt safe in the knowledge she wouldn't be caught up in all of it she stopped. The cheetah clambered up on top of her wagon, took a seat and fetched some snacks from the heap of miscellaneous furniture tied to the top. The witchdoctor smiled from ear to ear as she watched the destruction about to unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe citizens of Gold Springs were quietly minding their own business when a distant heavy thump was heard. Shortly after another followed. People started looking around and it didn't take them long to see the enormous horse in the distance trotting closer. In mere moments panic set in and people began falling over eachother in a desperate bid to clear the streets and hide in their houses. Butterscotch regarded it all with an amused grin. They were like ants to her and she was about to have some fun playing with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get 'em, girl!\" Roxxie cheered from her back.</span></div></div>",

But the mare wasn't just causing havoc for no reason. She was on the lookout for one building in particular. Her large nostrils twitched as she caught the smell she was looking for. It came from a slightly tougher looking building near the center of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie Roo tried to figure out what her partner in crime was up to, but from the horse's back she couldn't see much. Instead she began daydreaming about all the things she could accomplish with Butterscotch's new size. She could have Vivian's office trampled to nothing and rule Gold Springs with an iron fist. Or she could even just have her steed trot up and down main street a few times, leaving nothing but ruin behind. But most of all, she couldn't wait to see Texas. With a malicious chuckle she kept on trying to sneak a look at where Butterscotch was going until she realized, judging by nearby buildings, that they must be close to the sheriff's office. \"Oh, this is gonna be good.\" She said gleefully, rubbing her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas heard screams and commotion outside. She raised a curious brow, walking over to the shotgun mounted to the wall. Whatever this was, it sounded like it was going to need the heavy artillery. With several more rounds in her pocket she marched out calmly, ready to face down whatever threat was causing all this panic. The weasel looked down the street, seeing several enormous hooves. Slowly her view went up, following the muscular legs until finally she stared at the towering mare's face. The sheriff all but let the gun fall from her hands. She knew this horse and worse yet, she knew its owner. When it sniffed the air the weasel scurried back into the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff's heart was beating in her throat. It took her every ounce of willpower not to panic as well. What was she going to do against something of this scale? She'd need a cannon to even hope to damage it. Her whole body shook when she heard Butterscotch stomp another building to dust, fearing her office would be next beneath those trampling hooves. The only relief there was to be had was that the office was mostly empty. There were some cells filled with assorted scum, but her deputies were all out on their various duties. They would hopefully be spared the horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly darkness entered the office as the giant horse leaned in, blocking most of the windows. The weasel could hear the loud snorting close by, raising her heartbeat further. If Butterscotch was lingering here, whose smell was the horse tracking down? She pleaded silently to whoever would listen for it not to be hers, but she knew the odds were slim.</span></div></div>",

Texas stayed put, not daring to sneak out the backdoor. The moment that beast caught her in the open it'd take a step or two at most and she'd be at its mercy. And Butterscotch is not very familiar with the concept of mercy. She'd sat on the weasel for days in a row, just to make sure there would be no interference when Roxxie robbed the bank. The mere thought that she might try to repeat that act was chilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Texas' fear were brought a litle closer to reality as a loud crash broke the doors off their hinges. The very tip of the horse's muzzle pushed in, no more than a giant pair of nostrils fitting through the gap. The weasel contemplated opening fire, but at this scale the best even a shotgun would do was piss the horse off. An angry horse of that size could well destroy the entire town. She held on to one of doorframes leading to the back, but struggled due to the hurricane winds now whirling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach sniff and snort caused massive changes in airflow, pushing the weasel around. She desperately held on, not wanting to be blown around. Something seemed to go wrong though as a moment of quiet preceded the absolute storm that was the gigantic mare sneezing. The sheer force was enormous, the wooden inner walls of the sheriff's office groaning and warping. It was finally enough to rip the weasel away from her holdout and into the merciless torrents of air. A loud sniff pulled the weasel towards the large muzzle poking at the entrance. She tried to grab hold of anything within reach, but the floorboards were her only option. It was to no avail as the next sniff sealed her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gust of air pulled Texas up off the ground and straight into the left nostril of the horse. Butterscotch was more than enormous enough to suck the entire weasel up her nose, but the unexpected impact had her suprised all the same. The horse knew that distinct scent of weasel anywhere and she was gleeful to have sniffed her out. She could even feel the little thing in her nose squirming pathetically. A small satisfied snort nearly freed her prisoner, but Butterscotch was quick to ensure the weasel would have an unforgettable experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas shivered with disgust as she landed in a foul heap of snot. She'd been subjected to many different horrors in her career, but this one definitely ranked high among them. The thick ooze clung to her fur and soaked her clothes. The short, bristly hairs around her provided some handhold, but it seemed that every time she pulled on one another gust of air slammed her down into the slimy walls. Her surroundings moved around constantly, the weasel being pushed and pulled in the slimy passage. Muffled shreds of panicked screaming rang from the outside. Texas could only imagine what Butterscotch was up to now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it girl? What's that damn weasel done to ya?!\" Roxxie shouted from the mare's back, seeing her partner in crime shaking her head and sniffing and snorting wildly. It looked like that damn weasel had put pepper up her nose. Roxxie swore she would make the sheriff pay for that, not knowing her horse was already several steps ahead of her.</span></div></div>",

There was only one solution, to forcibly evict the sheriff with as much violence as possible. The horse reared back and sneezed loudly. Nearly windows shattered from the volume alone. It had worked though, as amidst the spray of large wads of snot shooting down main street was also a snot-coated Texas. The sheriff flew through the air in a flat arc, rolling and tumbling as she landed in the rough dirt of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas tried to move, but the sticky horse snot had her limbs glued to her body. She wanted to free herself from the smelly gunk, but progress was slow and time was not something the weasel had. Something made terrifyingly clear as a large shadow loomed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxxie Roo got to see the weasel for the first time since she got into town atop the giant horse. Butterscotch had propelled the sheriff so far that even from her perch atop her steed's shoulders she could catch a glimpse of the goo-caked Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dead, you hear me?! Nobody hurts ma horse and walks away!\" She yelled furiously, but the weasel didn't seem to react. The sheriff's eardrums were still ringing after being in the middle of that thunderous sneeze. Roxxie continued shouting threats down to the weasel, but Butterscotch was about to deliver a punishment far worse than anything Roxxie could deliver. The towering horse would make sure Texas was never seen again. She turned around and presented her enormous backside to the weasel. It blocked out the sun as the humongous horse slowly lowered her rear down. Not an easy feat for a horse, but Roxxie had trained her well. The kangaroo bandit held on to her steed's mane as best she could as Butterscotch was about to deliver the final blow to the weasel. The stench of horse ass filled the air as Texas desperately tried to free herself. But against the sheer size of the horse sitting down there was no escape. With a loud boom Butterscotch sat down on Texas, dumping every ounce of mass she had on the doomed sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing the weasel saw before everything went dark was...</span></div></div>",

The disgraced former deputy busied herself mostly with booze and running odd jobs for Vivian when nobody was looking. Today shaped up to be more of the same. With the weasel keeping a keen eye on the mayor work was at an all-time low, so booze was all there was left. At least the bribes she got fired for would fund a sizeable volume of alcohol to last her until she'd either find another well-paying gig or until she overthrew that damned weasel. The mare huffed. She should be the one maintaining the law in this town. Texas is far too scrawny to be any sort of imposing threat, not to mention her severe lack of vision. Surely she could see that the town would run so much better if the sheriff and the mayor aligned their goals? She could be swimming in money, but instead all she does is nose around in everyone's business. The mare grumbled to herself until she saw a small figure approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello dere, me name be Abra. I can sense you and I have a mutual goal and I am here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on there, ya scrawny puke. What does a lil' varmint like you think you can do to help me?

Predictably a large hand came down on her shoulder, stopping her in her tracks and roughly spinning her back around. Her smug grin was met with Georgia's intense stare. The mare glared at the small cheetah with such ferocity it felt like she was about to burn a hole right through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see I got your attention now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got my attention, make it good or you're the one getting humiliated.\" Georgia whispered as loudly and threateningly as she could without drawing any attention to the alleyway the two were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It be simple. I use my wily magics and bestow you with a blessing. With it you can overwhelm Texas and take your rightful place as sheriff of this town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large mare smiled. She'd heard this before. \"Uh huh, magic, right?\" She wanted to continue but now it was Abra's turn to stare daggers. Her confident grin turned into a bitter scowl and her eyes lit up with fury. Suddenly the large mare felt a stinging pain shoot through her arm. She let go of the diminutive cheetah, stepping back and seeing the small totem in her hand. It looked vaguely horse-like and a pin was stuck in its arm. Georgia's eyes widened with disbelief and curiosity. Abra was about to stick another pin in the totem when she saw the look of wonderment on the mare's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-lee shit, you're a real magician!\" Abra furrowed her brow. \"Witchdoctor actually, but the name doesn't matter. What matters is whether you want my help now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiddy like a schoolgirl Georgia nodded. Who knows what other tricks this 'witchdoctor' had up her sleeve. And moreover, how she could use them to destroy Texas. The cheetah smiled contently, seeing the large mare almost jump up and down with excitement. It was good to see not everyone was as cynical and jaded as that grumpy weasel, which brought her back to her scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here's the deal. I be givin you a special blessing on two conditions. Don't try to mess with me here, these are important to me.\" Georgia's face sank back into a serious glare. \"Firstly, once you've gotten your power you will use it to take on Texas. After that you can use it to punch as many people and things as you like. But Texas will be the first to feel the sting of my magic, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, don'tcha worry little thing, tha's ma plan anyways. Now what else do ya want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you smash her lights out, I want you to tell that weasel... 'Abra sends her regards.' That'll drive home that she brought de wrath of a real witchdoctor on her head. How long she be livin after dat I leave up to you. But make sure she knows it was my magic that brought about her downfall. It was my magic that made her enemy unstoppable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that sounds easy enough. Ya had me worried there for a moment, thinkin I had to be your servant or somethin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, after you delivered my message and humiliate the weasel you can do as you please with your new gifts. De spirits be generous and so am I. Now, do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight you've got a deal.\" Georgia said with a beaming smile holding out her hand. Abra gently placed hers in the large palm only for the mare to unintentionally shake her about. The witchdoctor needed a moment to recover from her new partner's enthusiasm. She almost felt sorry for the sheriff, knowing what terrible vengeance the mare would unleash upon her. But first a more important question arose. What blessing should the mare get?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Tell me, miss Georgia, how do you bear it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bear what?\" The mare replied, confused by the petite cheetah's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bear de constant mockery of dese houses. All around you they stand, taunting you with their size. You might be de biggest horse I ever laid eyes upon, but you be small compared to them. but no more, I can help you overcome dis hurdle. With my help you shall rise to meet their height, and then exceed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare didn't think her smile could get any bigger, but upon hearing those works she reached an all new level of giddiness. She'd used her size for as long as she can remember to intimidate those in her path. Now this magical little creature was going to make her as big as a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First ting, follow me. Growing big in dis alley is gonna get awkward if you find yourself wedged stuck between two houses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large mare didn't expect to be following someone as puny as the cheetah. Were it not for her magics, Georgia reckons she would've probably just stepped on Abra for a laugh. It's not every day something that squishy and small has the balls to approach her. Even as a deputy she had a habit of using excessive violence during her job. When she wasn't bribed to look the other way some hidden folks gladly paid a little extra to ensure she dealt with their competition just that little bit more harshly. Texas would soon learn just how harsh her punishment could be. The pair walked a little bit away from the houses and Abra beckoned Georgia to lean down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, listen closely. I'm going to give you two bottles with my special tincture. One of them will grow you, the other will return you to your current size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound like I'd ever want to be small again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All up to you, Georgia. But you might be finding that getting into your house will be difficult when you're as big as your house. Moving on, anything you're wearing will grow with you. That includes weapons. So prepare to make the term 'hand cannon' quite literal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare chuckled a little at the cheesy pun. She pondered for a moment if she should get more ammo to grow along with her. But once she'd be as tall as a house, was there really that much need for a gun? Her body would be deadly enough without also adding a gun to the mix. Anything else that desperately needed growing? The mare couldn't think of anything. One burning question did emerge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Abra, how long's this stuff gonna keep me big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De changes are permanent, only de red bottle will reverse dem. Keep it safe because besides me dere's nobody in de whole big prairie dat can make you another. With all de explanations out de way, prepare yourself to become de biggest sheriff in Wild West history. You might want to start small on the blue bottle. Drink maybe a quarter and see where dat takes you in size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare merrily ignored the cheetah's last warning and chugged the entire bottle at once, throwing it over her shoulder and looking down at her body expectantly. At first nothing seemed to happen bar a roiling, bubbling sensation in her gut. Was this some kind of joke? If that wretched little cheetah had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel it? Do you feel de spirits coursing through you? I can sense it well, ya be getting bigger real soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbling in her gut evolved into a weird itch running along her skin. The mare's sight blurred a little, but even without all the details visible Georgia could tell without a doubt that her perspective was changing. Nearby houses were soon at eye level. How much further will this go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her shaky vision Georgia saw eye to eye with the houses, but the strange concoction wasn't done yet. She kept on growing, looking down on all the buildings in town. the town hall was a little taller than most buildings, but the mare outgrew it too. When she finally stopped the spirits rushing through her faded. It left her with a lingering headache, made worse by the harsh bright daylight. She covered her eyes and realized she heard laughter. Abra was laughing maniacally, gazing at her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even in her wildest dreams did the witchdoctor think her mixture would be this effective. She'd expected to just about grow the mare to the size of the smaller houses, but she stood towering over all of them. Her revenge on Texas would be the stuff of legends. Though the cheetah normally prefers to stay away from the action, she can't help but feel immensely curious as to the things the huge mare is about to do. Before she can continue her train of thought she looks up to an imposing oversized gun barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you laughin at me?\" Georgia huffed in a sinister tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I be laughin at de face Texas is gonna make when she lays eyes upon her doom.\" Abra's answer seemed to please the giant mare, who holstered her gun and looked to the town. The sheriff was in there, clueless about the nightmare she was about to enter. Just before Georgia could turn and start her vengeance-fueled rampage the witchdoctor spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, tell that stupid weasel whose magics made you big. And do so before you kill her please.\" The horse woman smiled and nodded. As she set her first step towards the weasel the resounding boom surprised even the mare. She couldn't wait to put all that weight on the sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was taking a well-deserved nap from her daily activities. The bandits were keeping quiet and she'd already gotten enough of a headache from this crazy woman claiming spirits talk to her. She already regretted not running that con artist out of town right away. There were so many more important things to worry about, she didn't need this on her plate as well. Suddenly the whole building shook as a loud thump was heard outside. The sheriff almost fell out of her chair, swearing under her breath and looking out onto the street. Most the townsfolk had stopped in their tracks or hurriedly tried to get out of the road. All were looking towards the sheriff's office, but up. Was someone on the roof? Some bandits might be trying to break their comrades out of the cells in the office. The weasel took no chances and busted out her old double-barrel. With a determined grimace she stepped out into the street and turned to see what the commotion was all about. Gripped by utter terror, the sheriff looked up wide-eyed at the towering mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world... ah don't recall drinkin anythin this potent...\" She said in utter disbelief of the things her eyes were seeing. Georgia quickly snapped the sheriff to attention by stepping over her office. Even with her current size it was difficult and she almost made it. Unfortunatly she did smash a large hole in the building's facade. The enormous mare now stood looming over the sheriff. With a thundering voice she called out the weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheriff Texas Stanton, I hereby relieve you of your duties and promote myself to sheriff. You have been deemed to small and pathetic to govern the law in this town.\" The mare said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that!\" Texas yelled back. \"The sheriff is elected by the townsfolk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why didn't you say so. I'm callin a vote. I'd like to nominate maself for the position of sheriff. Mah goal? It's simple, either you vote for me or I'll stomp you flat and sit on your house until it's nothin but firewood. Alright, quick show of hands. Who believes this puny weasel should be sheriff?\" Barely a hand was raised. \"Goody, now just to complete this formality, who votes for me?\" Many fearful hands rose up, the mare basking in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well would ya look at that. It done look like there's a new sheriff in town. 's not like they had much choice. A vote for you is a waste as you'll be pushin' up daisies in a few minutes. Now if you'll excuse me...\" Georgia reaches down to grab Texas' badge, the gleaming sheriff's star. The weasel isn't quite ready to part with her status as lawman in this town. She resists, drawing the mare's ire. The huge horse wasn't messing around though. Fat anthro fingers, each bigger than Texas, curled around the sheriff and squeezed. The shotgun in Texas' hands was crushed into scrapmetal and her revolver probably didn't fare much better. The sheriff cried out for help, but it was little use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia lifted her former employer up to her enormous muzzle. She looked the panicking weasel in the eye and smiled. She spoke softly as she shared the details of her little adventure with Abra. Soon it clicked and Texas knew she'd fucked up beyond all repair. She was going to have to endure a lot of giant horse-woman playtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Georgia squeezed Texas again, relishing the delightful feeling the weasel gave as she slowly lost her form. But just crushing the former sheriff in her fist was far too merciful for the likes of Texas. She deserved worse, so much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A'right ya scrawny little varmint, it's time ya get put in yer place. As the sheriff I arrest ya for... \u00e4h'll think of something later. First of all, gimme that.\" Two fat fingers approached the former sheriff as the hand grasping her loosens. The finger that had her chest covered curls away, the approaching fingers daintily pinching the sheriff's star, trying to tear it off. Unfortunately Georgia's new giant stature wasn't very helpful here and she unintentionally pinched the tiny badge too hard. It crumpled up like a tin can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darnit.\" The mare grumbled. She looked around and saw the blacksmith, shaking on his feet. \"You. Make me a new sheriff's badge befitting my stature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am, right away ma'am.\" The rhino man said with fear in his every word. Georgia raised a smile, she could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that was a waste of time.\" She spoke harshly, returning her attention to the weasel in her hand. \"It's time ah send ye to yer cell. But yer office is going to need some renovations, so ah'm just gonna have t' improvise.\" Both of them knew the mare had already made up her mind as to where she should 'imprison' the weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was held high above the mare's huge, rounded butt. With her free hand Georgia pulled the waistband on those immense pants back. The tight-fitting fabric strained, but her strength overcame it with ease. The weasel began to squirm as best she could, but it was useless. With a loud laugh Georgia let the former sheriff fall into the gap, feeling her slide in deep. She adjusted her pants to ensure there wasn't an inch of spare room for any weasel stowaways and blew a small fart. Immediately her little prisoner wiggled, putting a smile on her face. Her little prisoner was laid out right along her crack, the only place in her pants with even the slightest hint of space. But with every struggle she felt the weasel slip in a little deeper between her massive cheeks. Soon the former sheriff was completely enveloped by warm, smelly buttflesh. The mare couldn't be happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we gotta settle some business, people.\" She spoke sternly to the townsfolk that had gathered to witness the giant in their midst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, this office is far to small for a sheriff as great as me. I want you guys to think up a nice alternative. How's about a giant chair for me to sit in an' a big cover for th' sun. I'll let you lot stew on that one. This little dump though...\" Georgia raised a foot and brought it down on the building's already-damaged facade. The wood splintered and the innards of the building were exposed for all to see. Several prisoners, still stuck in their cages looked up in horror. The deputies had long fled the scene. Georgia grew a content smile. Those cowards would've been fired anyways. The prisoners on the other hand required her more immediate attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, ah suppose ah better deal with this straight away. I ain't got no time t' be babysittin criminals.\" She reached in, smashing through the reinforced door of a cell and retrieved the prisoner. With a stern gaze she looked down on him and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you in for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I robbed a man.\" The quivering thug said. The colossal mare discarded him like a piece of garbage as she muttered about Texas wasting her time. The robber slammed into the ground, got up and dusted himself off. He'd feel that one in the morning, but did he just seriously get set free? He decides not to question a thing and walks away with a slight limp. Georgia had already busted open the next cell and interrogated the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah killed five people, sheriff. And ah'd do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Georgia flared up, squeezing a pathetic whine out of the murderer. \"Tha's five people that ain't gonna be able to work for me. Unacceptable!\" She threw the man onto the ground and lifted her massive foot over him. The last thing the murderer saw was her rapidly approaching boot. She leant into it for no reason other than to display maximum viciousness in dealing with anyone that upsets her. Fearful murmurs buzzed among the townsfolk. The next few criminals were all booked for petty crimes and set free. The last one claimed to be innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha's cute. Now tell me what ye'r in for or I'm gonna make somethin' up meself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T... T... Tax fraud. But y' gotta believe me. Vivian's got me in here because I know about...\" He was cut off by the mare squeezing the air from his lungs. She let his squished body flutter down in the sheriff's office and turned to face the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ol' office is now officially closed. Ah'll save y'all the trouble o' breakin it down.\" The mare simply let herself fall backwards, sitting down on the building. It couldn't handle the massive glutes for even a second and like a house of cards the sheriff's office came down on the fraudster along with Georgia's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was forced to listen to the horrid display outside. Her deputy had made a mockery of the fair justice she'd worked so hard to install. From now on Georgia's will would be law. The only silver lining she could imagine was Vivian now probably getting rightly terrified that the mare's delusions of grandeur would see her take up the mantle of mayor too. Not even all her thugs at once would stand a chance. It was a small joy inbetween the smelly farts and brutal clenches she endured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former sheriff was completely at Georgia's mercy. What plans does the mare have for Texas?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Georgia stood tall and proud, basking in her victory. No-one in this town would dare cross her ever again. Her word was law and she would uphold it with an iron fist. Anyone who broke the law would be captured and judged on the spot. No more of this long-winded bureaucratic nonsense. Vivian could keep doing that for all the mare cared. She would determine the punishment. As she stood before the awestruck townsfolk her smile couldn't be bigger. There was but one tiny distraction. From deep between her cheeks a very soft but distinct piercing squeaking could be heard. Texas was a fighter and even wedged in the biggest butt she'd ever seen she would not give up. She was no doubt yelling obscenities at the mare, but her words were too muffled by the immense volumes of soft ass surrounding her. Even reduced to a barely audible peep the weasel was able to get on her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will ya quit yer sniveling you pathetic rodent!\" Georgia bellowed, staring at her own ass. The townsfolk feared for a moment their newly minted sheriff had already lost it. Texas, still entombed between those squeezing walls of horse butt, fumed at that rodent remark, but it did give her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! You little runt! You bit me!\" The mare growled. \"Now you're in for it, weasel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas' whole world shook as she sank her teeth into the wall of short-furred flesh. She'd definitely managed to get a reaction this time. The huge cheeks slowly parted, thin rays of sunlight shining deep between the mare's massive glutes. Unfortunately the only reason those huge buttcheeks were moving was the mare's hand sliding itself between them. The weasel gulped as Georgia's thick fingers drew near. Already she was mentally preparing to be grabbed and squeezed. What else could the mare still do to her that would outdo being stuck here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer turned out to be brutally simple. The mare never bothered to try and grab Texas. Instead the thick fingers simply pushed the mare's puny captive deeper. The former sheriff whimpered as she was sinking ever deeper between those mammoth buttcheeks. The light faded from her prison, smothered out by overwhelming amounts of fat and flab. It took the mare some effort to press the weasel all the way into her crack, but soon Texas felt her worst nightmares fade into reality. A gut-wrenching squelching could be heard just behind her. Though she was stuck in complete darkness, she didn't need to see it to know it was there. The mare's twitching pucker was mere inches away from her. The sounds it produced would haunt her nightmares. The air around it smelled like her farts, only ten times worse. Unseizing and overwhelming, it made breathing normally near impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing stuck in the deepest depths of Georgia's buttcrack would be one thing, but the cruel mare wasn't done. The fingers kept poking Texas' chest and gut, pushing her along. Her back was the first thing to make contact with the sensitive pucker. Feeling the sheer enormity of it made the former sheriff realize what was about to happen. She was powerless to stop it as the fingers simply kept pushing. Sure enough the tightly sealed passage opened up. She felt herself get pushed inside, the slimy walls of the mare's rectum greeting the weasel with a coat of sticky gunk. The yawning pucker closed again, squeezing her torso and continuing the stream of disgusting noises. Mild terror turned to full-blown panic as the weasel felt the muscular ring tighten and loosen, her body slipping in just a little deeper every time. This couldn't be how it ended. She deserved better that to be slowly sucked into a horse's ass. She screamed and shouted, but deep between those huge buttcheeks not a sound escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood frozen in horror as they watched the new sheriff stick a finger up her own ass. Nobody dared to move of even say anything, lest they'd ruin the moment and incur Georgia's wrath. She could feel it. The weasel was wiggling as best she could, but Texas was no match for her beautiful body. It slowly pulled the weasel into her final resting place. With what restraint she had the mare stopped herself from farting. Now wasn't the time to gas the little runt unconscious. She wanted her victim to feel her immense body. Soon enough the walls around the weasel began to shudder to life. They brutally clenched together, painfully crushing their prey. Between clenches the mare's rear sucked even more of the squirming weasel inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was resigned to a life inside of Georgia's butt. Inexorably the pucker sealed up over her head, locking her inside a tube of muscle, slime and nothing even close to breathable air. The only question remaining was what would rob her of consciousness first, the stench or the pressure? The former sheriff was beaten and bruised from the ordeal, the crushing walls not helping one bit. She should've been more careful around Abra. Underestimating her had cost the weasel everything. With her final thoughts on the cheetah the lights finally go out. Georgia either doesn't notice or simply doesn't care that her prisoner is no longer moving. It was the inevitable fate of all those that would soon face her judgment. A long, heavy fart dispels the notion for everyone around that somehow Texas might be okay in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, consider that weasel properly judged. Now get moving ya lazy freeloaders. This new throne ain't gonna build itself.\" Her harsh words whipped the crowd into a frenzy, all busily trying not to be be her next prisoner. In the years that follow Georgia deposes mayor Vivian, sending her to meet the same fate as the weasel. By all accounts Gold Springs was peaceful. The massive mare kept the town in a death grip. Anyone who even slightly stepped out of line was dealt with... harshly. Only those with a bribe big enough could get away with anything. And even though Texas was a fine meal for Georgia's ass, it was merely the first of many unusual 'meals' for the towering mare. From her newly built throne she oversaw the daily bustle, demanding her every whim be met with severe punishment for any who refused. Her jacket proudly boasted a large iron star, making it clear to any and all who dared to end up in this town: Georgia is the sheriff, and her word is the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra left a few days after. The sight of the enormous mare putting the weasel in her place would stay with her for some time. But the Wild West is a big place. There were many more towns in need of her services. Though a town like Gold Springs and a horse woman as enormous and relentlessly enthusiastic as Georgia would be something she never came across again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus ends the tale of Texas, swallowed up by a giant horse woman's ass never to be seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Texa's job was hectic enough without the threat of a bounty hunter hanging over her head. She had a good track record with dealing with their kind, but one stray pot shot could spell then end for her while on the line of duty. The brave sheriff wasn't going to sit idly by and wait for them to make their move. She was going to seek out this would-be hitman and leave them beaten and hogtied outside of the mayor's office as a warning. With that goal in mind, she set off for the old coal mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her nose crinkled as she approached the aged cavern, the familiar smell of dust and soot filling her lungs. She was certainly no stranger to this type of environment. Prior to becoming a sheriff, she cut her teeth working as a coal miner as a teenager. It didn't pay well and the hours were rough but there were very few alternatives for employment in such a small town. It was a chapter of the sheriff's life that she would much rather forget. The sweltering heat, the lack of clean air, the backbreaking labor; it was like being trapped in the back of Georgia's pants, except it didn't happen on rare occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she traveled down the deserted tunnels of the old mine, something caught her attention. Through the piercing silence her ears could easily pick up on any sudden disturbances. She could hear a very faint footsteps steadily approaching her. Normally she would've assumed that it was just some worker who had come in early, but her intuition told her otherwise. These were not the footsteps of just some average joe. They were light, quick, and barely audible; the footsteps of a trained killer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awright, that's far enough. Take one more step and ah'll open fire!\" Texas threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her words did nothing to impede the approaching threat and as it drew closer the sheriff could vaguely make out its silhouette. It stood a good four or five feet over Texas' and it's rather bulky looking frame was obscured by a cloak of some kind. A growing tension filled the air as the figure stepped out of the shadows, revealing itself in full under the dim glow of the nearest lantern. Texas had hoped to get a good look at her killer, but its face was obscured by plain white mask. The sheriff quickly drew her gun, aiming dead center between the stranger's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah said that's far enough--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas' words died in her throat as a the figure bolted towards her, moving with speed that should've been impossible for one so large. The sheriff's brain was given no time to process the oncoming threat, but her body reflexively responded by firing off two shots. The cloaked behemoth averted the bullets with ease as he jumped to the side and clung to the wall in a hunched over position. It bounced from the wall to the top of the ceiling and back onto the ground, inches away from Texas' face. Before she could fire another shot, the figure reached out and snatched the pistol out of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas watched in horror it crushed her gun in it's massive gloved hand and tossed its crumpled remains to the side. Soon, fear gave way to anger fueled determination as she pounced on her attacker, her teeth gritted as she threw a fierce haymaker at its masked face. Like before, the figure managed to side step her attack with little effort, though Texas refused to let up as she threw punch after punch. Whomever this person was, they needed to pay for destroying her favorite handgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually the cloaked figure had grown tired of dodging and decided to act as it delivered a swift jab to Texas' nose, sending the lawman flying back. Everything was a blur for the sheriff as she struggled to collect herself, though her attacker would give her no time to recoperate before it was on her again. A massive foot came down on Texas, with enough force to pin her down without causing serious harm to her. With her hand clutched on her aching nose, the she looked up at the imposing figure with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Whomever this person was, they were a cut above the usual thugs that Vivian set her way. She'd lost her fair share of fights, but very rarely did her opponent beat her with skill alone. Her typical foes tended to rely on brute force and deception to get the better of her, so she wasn't quite prepared to deal with someone who could outdo her in a fair fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh... the mayor spared no expense this time around...</i> she thought morosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cloaked figure wasted no time as it removed its foot from her chest and flipped the sheriff over into a face down position. Texas couldn't see what it was doing, but she could feel her wrists and legs getting tied up. She began to speak out in defiance towards the mysterious figure, but a gag slipped over her mouth the moment she opened it. The bounty hunter then slung her over its massive shoulder and made its way out of the mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas shuddered at what was to come. She had been beaten handily and was being delivered to Mayor Vivian's doorstep. The irony of this situation wasn't lost on her, as she remembered having envisioned this scenario but in reverse. She could only imagine what sort of twisted games that sinister lynx had in store for her, but before she could even steel herself for the horrors that awaited her, things took an unexpected turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cloaked figure walked right past the mayor's office. Texas raised a brow and glanced down at the bounty hunter in confusion. She tried to inquire as to wear it was taking her, but she could do little more than mumble with the gag in her mouth. She was carried away from Vivian's office and eventually out of Gold Springs altogether. Texas began to wonder if they'd ever reach their destination, though it wasn't long before the bounty hunter came to a sudden stop. The sheriff raised a brow and looked forward, her confusion only doubling at what she saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a trailer. A double wide, two story trailer parked out half a mile outside town. Judging by the size of the door, it was clearly intended for use by larger attendants, like her assailant. For someone physically imposing, she wasn't expecting <i>this</i> to be its base of operations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bounty hunter opened the door to pitch black, though it must've been used to the dark as it entered and shut the door behind it, leaving them in complete darkness. Texas yelped as her bound body fell to the floor with a light thump. She wanted to complain about the shoddy treatment, but that was the least of her concerns at the moment. She was trapped, alone and in the dark with no way to defend herself. With Vivian she knew to expect the worse, but she had no idea what this stranger had in store for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She heard a the click of a light switch and as the darkness dispersed the sheriff finally got good look at her surroundings. Once again, the sheriff was surprised by what she saw. Her trailer had a rather homey feel to it, with floral wall paper, potted plants, bookshelves, two sofas, a coffee table and several photos adorning the walls. It was just so... normal looking, not at all like she was expecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was so absorbed in her environment that she didn't notice the figure reaching down until she felt its hands graze her neck slightly. She felt the gag slip out of her mouth, though the binds around her limbs remained. With her ability to speak given back to her, she decided to try and reason with this mysterious stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look, ah don't know what Vivian's payin' ya but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paying me?\" the figure responded, its voice so light and feminine that Texas was completely struck silent. \"No one's paying me, ya silly goose! I took this job for free!\" it said before letting out a cute, snorting laugh. Texas stared up at her blankly. Today was just full of surprises for the sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, let me get settled in a bit\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The bounty hunter undid her cloak and tossed it to the side, finally exposing herself to Texas. Her attire beneath the cloak consisted of a pair of denim jeans stretched their very limit by her thick hips and a tanktop that barely seemed up to the task of containing her massive breasts. How this woman managed to hide such features with little more than a cloak was a mystery to Texas. She then removed her mask, revealing a plump, youthful face with large buck teeth and a cute button nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better! Now let's get you nice an' cozy\" she said as she reached down and hoisted the sheriff up by the scruff of her neck and gently sitting her down onto a sofa. \"Which doya prefer, tea or coffee? If ya got a hankerin' fer some hot chocolate, I got plenty of it!\" she giggled as she stepped into her large walk-in kitchen. As she turned her back to the sheriff, Texas' could see the large flat beaver tail wagging behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-coffee's fine...\" Texas stammered as she fidgeted uncomfortably. She wasn't sure what to make of this bizarre woman, but her overly friendly demeanor put her even more on edge. In her experience, the friendlier the criminal the more like it was that they had a screw loose in their heads. Still, the sheriff couldn't help but be curious by her eccentric behavior and was tempted to stay and see what she had in store for her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Texas sighed and slumped back in her seat. It wasn't like she could escape in her present condition and try as she might, she couldn't do away with the rope tied around her wrists. Until an opportunity presented itself, she had no other choice but to sit and wait. With nothing else to do she began to do, she went surveying the beaver anthro's home, specifically the pictures she had hung up. Most of there of other beavers, presumably family. From the corner of her eye, she spotted something very peculiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the far end of the living room there a framed snippet of a newspaper. It was too far away for her to read, but that wasn't what caught her attention. The photo accompanying the picture was of her with her foot propped up on the beaten body of a cattle rustler. She had dealt with so many lawbreakers that she could scarcely remember half of the men she put away, but she could tell by her leaner build that it was a photo from her early days as Sheriff of Gold Springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here we go\" the stranger beaver woman said as she came back into the room with a tea tray holding two cups and a plate full of treats. She sat it down on the coffee table and dropped down onto the sofa across from the sheriff. Her hefty frame caused the trailer to shudder from her sudden descent, but by some miracle their drinks managed to stay within their respective cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I can't believe I'm finally talkin' to Texas! Ya may not know it, I'm yer biggest fan!\" she gushed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... nice. Aren't you 'spose to be a bounty hunter or something?\" Texas asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you betcha! Yer lookin' at the best bounty hunter in all the east coast!\" the beaver woman boasted as she puffed out her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before ya said that ya took the job for free? Why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Are ya kidding? Gettin' ta meet my idol was more'n enough for me! You shoulda seen my face when I got the contract and I saw yer name on it. Boy howdy, I couldn't sleep for days!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer gonna have to slow down a bit, 'cus ah'm still trying to catch up. Who are ya and how do ya know who ah am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, I'm such a clod! All this excitement and I haven't even gotten around to introducing myself! Sally Mayflower, professional bounty hunter!\" she said extending her hand out. It took a minute for her to realize that the sheriff was in to position to shake hands and she quickly pulled it back with a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas. Now ya mind answerin' mah second question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy. I've been hearin' about ya ever since you became sheriff!\" she said pointing to the newspaper on the wall. \"Back up north, yer somethin' of a folk hero! We read all about yer adventures and whatnot! Ever since I were a teen I wanted to be just like ya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... ya became a bounty hunter?\" Texas asked raising a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's what I'm good at and it pays the bills... most of the time. This time I didn't mind doing the job fer nothin'\" she said before taking a sip of her coffee. \"Don't be shy, help yourself. It isn't poisoned or anything\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before Texas could snap back at her for yet again failing to realize that she was tied up, Sally reached over the table and grabbed her cup, bringing it to Texas' lips. She wanted to keep her mouth shut tight in fear of it actually being in any way contaminated, but the heavily aroma wafting near her nose was too tempting to ignore. She took a sip and let out an involuntary moan at the rich flavor that hit her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew ya'd like it. That's the good stuff. Imported from Greece, dontcha know!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's good\" the sheriff conceded as a half smile touched her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got plenty if yer ever in the mood fer some more. I also got a whole buncha soda pop in the fridge. Got of rum too, if that's more yer thing!\" she prattled excitedly. The slightest bit of approval from her idol seemed to perk her up considerably. If it weren't the hostile circumstances that led up to their meeting, Texas could even call it cute. But one thought soon entered her mind as she sipped away at her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... when uh... when do ya'll plan on lettin' me go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" the beaver woman chimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm sorry, Ah didn't quite catch that... what did you just say?\" Texas asked narrowing her eyes a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't ever let ya go. See, when I said I took this job fer free, I was stretchin' the truth just a teensy bit. Yer actually my payment for the job\" she said as she set their cups down and jumped to her feet. \"That's a pretty sweet trade off, idnit? Ol' Vivian has ya outta her hair and I get to be with my hero fer the rest of my life!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you... you can't do that! Ah ain't no trophy! Ah'm a person!\" Texas cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sally just smiled as she reached down and picked the sheriff up, bringing her into her massive chest in a bone crushing embrace. The air was forced from Texas' lungs, though she hesitated in trying to take in air as the beaver's fur carried the musky scent of week old sweat. Her head was practically buried between Sally's boulder like tits, and she began to feel light headed. A large hand pulled her head back, giving her a chance to breath as she was forced to look up into Sally's face. There was no malice behind the eyes of her starstruck fan, but there was an undercurrent of intensity in her gaze. This woman like Texas. She <i>passionately, intensely</i> liked Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dontcha worry none. You'll have all the food you can ever want, and I'll keep ya nice and clean\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally, ah really don't think--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas hoped to appeal to the crazed woman, but was silenced as she was shoved deep down the giant beaver's cleavage. Sally cooed affectionately as she hugged stomach pressing her breasts together and unintentionally crushing the sheriff flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer gonna love bein' here...\" she whispered happily. With her prize secure, Sally decided to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Texas kicked and pushed against the sweat slick walls of Sally's cleavage, her outrage giving her newfound strength as she struggled to free herself from her binds. It was one thing for Vivain to sic the likes of Georgia and Roxxie on her, but for her to hire this lunatic to essentially hold Texas hostage for the rest of her life, she had gone one step too far. As soon as she got out of this situation, she planned on making a beeline over the the mayor's office and giving her beating of a lifetime, consequences be damned. It's not like she didn't have a case against her, as Sally outright admitted to being under her payroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sheriff's struggles came to quick halt as her nose caught whiff of a most unpleasant stench. She'd been so caught up in escaping her confinement that she didn't notice the musky odor that seemed etched into her captor's fur. It wasn't the worse smell she'd ever endured, but it was just bad enough to make her nose crinkle and her eyes water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, dontcha ever wash up?! Smells like somethin' died in here!\" she cried out in a muffled voice. Somehow Sally picked up on her words as she blushed bright with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know, I must stink somethin' fierce. Dis body'o mine ain't built for all this heat. Shoot, back up north 60 degrees is considered a heatwave, dontcha know!\" she giggled as wiped the sweat from her brow. \"Plus all dat time I spent waitin' fer ya in the mine built up a bit of a sweat\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before Texas could complain any further, her environment began to shake and jiggle wildly, indicating that Sally was on the move. On the outside, her captor was running up the stairs of her home up to the second floor where her bathroom resided. She was quite unlike the other thugs and brutes that the sheriff encountered, as she was quite self-conscious about her body odor and struggled to keep herself smelling fresh at all times. It ultimately proved a fruitless endeavor as her enormous body was quick to perspire and it was rather difficult to get the scent out of her fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n By the time the quaking stopped, Texas was left completely dazed and disheveled, so much so that she offered no resistance as Sally's hand reached in and pulled her out by the scruff of her neck fur. It took a second for her eyes to readjust themselves but once they did she saw that she was in what appeared to be a large bathroom. Much like the rest of her home, it had a cozy feel to it with rustic wooden walls and toiletries. Her attention was drawn to a massive built-in jacuzzi  in the corner of the room, large enough to fit two women of Sally's size some space to spare. Texas could only imagine how much money such a thing would cost, although given Sally's profession it probably wasn't that much of a concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuthin' better den a good soak after a hard days work!\"  Sally said as she gently placed a sheriff down and wiggled out of her jeans and tanktop. Texas couldn't help but cringe at her willingness to get nude in front of a stranger, though that was far from the most bizarre behavior Sally had exhibited up till then. Once the beaver was fully unclothed she reached down and grabbed onto Texas' vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get this dirty ol' thing offa ya\" she said with a friendly smile as she began the process of stripping down the sheriff. This utter violation of personal space was more than Texas could take as she fought and squirmed in Sally tight grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep yer grubby mitts off me!\" she ordered angrily as she tried to kick her hands away. Sally wasn't the least bit perturbed by her resistance as she meticulously stripped the bound sheriff down to her bra and panties while somehow managing to keep her binds intact. After neatly folding up her clothes and placing them to the side, she reached down to remove Texas' underwear, though she hesitated once she saw the disturbed look on her captive's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's dat look fer? I can't have ya jump on in with yer clothes on!\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't wanna get in there at all, ya damn loon!\" Texas snapped as she scooted back slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't be like dat. Dere's no shame in bathin' with a stranger. We do it all the time back home!\" she said before reaching forward and swiftly yanking Texas' undergarments off, leaving her naked body completely exposed. Once again the sheriff felt the heat in her face rise, both from the shame and contempt she felt. While this wasn't even close to being the most demeaning thing someone had subjected her to, her utter helplessness made it all the more aggravating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Ain't so bad, now is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas was about to launch into a profanity filled tirade but she wasn't given the opportunity as Sally snatched her up jumped into the warm waters of the jacuzzi, the resulting splash nearly soaking the entire floor. A fear of drowning entered the sheriff's mind as her body sank down into the water, but she was surprised to find herself floating with very little trouble. Sally sighed as she leaned back against the rim, an amused smile on her face as she looked down at the confused weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dere's lotsa Epson salt in the water. Makes it easier ta float\" she explained. She gave Texas a moment to adjust herself before she began scrubbing her down, her large lands handling her with an amazing amount of tenderness. Texas wanted to vocalize her displeasure but she found it rather difficult as the beaver' gently worked the aches and pains out of her muscles as though she were a licensed masseuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good golly, Dat's whole a lotta tension! When's last you took time offa work?\" Sally asked as she gently kneaded the sheriff's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crime never rests, so neither will I\" Texas responded, although her words came off more labored than they normally would as she was slipping more and more into a tranquil state of mind. She jumped as Sally let out a loud squeeing noise, her eyes lit up with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, you said it! You actually said it!\" she cried excitedly. Seeing the bewildered expression on Texas' face, she continued. \"December of last year, page ten, paragraph twelve of the Weekly Informer,. Dontcha remember? You were bein' innerviewed after you busted up that illegal diamond smuggling operation. They asked, 'does this job ever get to ya, Miss Stanton?' and you said, 'crime don't rest, so neither will I'! It was sooooooo cool!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas let out an awkward laugh and shook her head. If it weren't for the fact being held captive, she would find the beaver's gushing to be flattering. If they had met under any other circumstances, she could easily see herself hanging out with the oddball off of work, although that might've been the massage affecting her attitude. She still planned on escaping her clutches, but for the time being she decided to just sit back and let Sally do her thing.</span></div></div>",

All of the kinks in her shoulders and back had been thoroughly worked out and she felt a renewed sense of vigor. Were it not for the circumstances surrounding this whole ordeal, she would've felt obliged to thank Sally for her work. Her initial outrage had waned ever so slightly though, as Sally picked her up and stood up from the tub. She was about to place the sheriff down so she could dry herself off, but frowned when she saw no towels hanging on her the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shoot... I fergot to take em outta the laundry basket...\" she muttered. Her attention turned to Texas and flashed a smile that left her feeling uneasy. Without warning Sally grabbed her by the ankles and wrists and twisted, compressing the sheriff's body like a washcloth as she literally wrung the water off of her body. Once all the water was gone from her body, Sally went about drying herself off with Texas' body. Up and down her back, all along both armpits, through the valley of her cleavage and finally between her enormous buttcheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bout dat\" the beaver said sheepishly as she literally whipped Texas' body back into shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah swear, the moment ah get free I'ma throw yer fat ass in the clink so fast it'll make yer head spin...\" Texas said coldly as she glared daggers at Sally's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw don't be such a debby downer!\" Sally said with a giggle before as she walked out the bathroom and down the hall to her bedroom. Much like the rest of her home, Sally's room had a cozy feel to it and aside from one or two bits of clothing scattered here and there it was clear that Sally took pride in keeping things organized. The only thing that struck Texas as unusual was the framed photo of her standing with April resting on the nightstand next to Sally's bed. That was odd enough, but it was made all the more unnerving by the the clearly doctored image of Sally standing right beside the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy howdy, I could really go fer a nap. All dis excitement's got me tuckered out...\" Sally said with a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With her captive in her arms, she jumped onto her bed and shut her eyes, falling asleep almost immediately. Texas fidgeted uncomfortably as she was completely enveloped by Sally's heavy frame, her giant breasts threatening to swallow the sheriff's head as she was held tight against her chubby body. It was made all the more uncomfortable by the sweat that had begun to accumulate in the beaver's fur, pooling around Texas' face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The enraged lawman squirmed furiously against her bonds, desperate to free herself and throttle her loony fangirl but it proved quite difficult. She trailed her fingers along the rope wrapped tightly around her wrist and her brow furrowed at what she felt. <i>A constrictor knot... damn it...</i>, she thought to herself. Ditzy as she was, Sally certainly had the know how needed to succeed in her craft. The undoing the knot would be next to impossible, so her only hope was to somehow pull herself free from the beaver's grip and worm her way down to the kitchen to find something she could use to cut it loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was easier said than done though. In her sleep, Sally continued to pull Texas further and further into her plump body, making it increasingly difficult for the sheriff to catch her breath, let alone move. The sheriff could only hope that she would start tossing and turning in the middle of the night, creating a window of opportunity for her. Otherwise, she was stuck with nothing to do by try her damned hardest not to drown in the liters of sweat that poured off of Sally.</span></div></div>",

You won't be needing it after I capture you, weasel.\" She was clearly not from Golden springs, or anywhere close for that matter. her attire was not much, as she had the cloak she wore into town wrapped around her neck, shorts that didn't cover her backdoor at all, and a thin shirt that didn't leave much for imagination on her rather..large chest. She had one hand hanging loose to her left side, and the other behind her, digging into her butt as she scratched her rear end shamelessly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas could not believe what she seeing or hearing. Another criminal in Golden Springs, after she had just tango'd with almost all of them in the last few months or so! growling at this strangers attitude, Texas readied herself, going straight for her pistol as she yelled out to the fox woman \"Oh is that what you think, ya dirty varmint! Well guess again, big thighs, cause no one get's the better of Sheriff Texas Stant-eep!\" In the blink of an eye, as soon as she got her pistol out from her holster, the fox woman swiped right from her hand at light speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for this, sheriff~?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox woman sneered as she twirled the pistol around her index finger from her free hand. the other one still digging into her rear completely. Just who was this woman, and how was she so fast, Texas wondered to herself as she took a step away from her. \"ah, how'd you do that!? a-ah didn't even see you move before!\" Texas yelled out as the fox woman scratched the inside of her ea with Tex's gun before flinging it back to her, Texas scrambling for it so that it didn't go of and shoot at any civilians nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your concern, Weasel. All you need to know is that by the end of this week, you will be a broken shell of what you are now, as I pin you hard to the ground.\" Standing perfectly still, with the one hand concealed behind her back now digging into her pants for something, the fox woman stared Texas dead in the eyes the whole time as she spoke, leaving Tex paralyzed in fear, feeling naked and unprotected from her piercing gaze. \"I was payed a hefty sum of money for your capture in the most \"fitting\" ways for you.\" The fox woman grinned now at Tex, licking her lips painfully slow, as Tex got a shiver up her spine from it. She knew to damn well what this woman meant by \"fitting\". \"And I intend on enjoying every. last. second of it~\". These were the last few words she said before dashing right for Tex, cupping her nose with the one hand she had hidden inside her pants this entire time. \"Breath this in, and remember that this smell will be what breaks you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was painful, much more so than what she had put up with from other criminals. It was a mix of burning hot and acrid smell, bringing Tex to tears in an instant before struggling, only for the fox woman to wrap her other arm around her neck, as people all around gasped and panicked, running away from the sight of Texas losing yet again to another unknown criminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will break you, And you will give into me~\" Was all that Tex could hear before passing out right then and there on the spot, falling to the ground where she stood as the fox woman disappeared from sight, leaving Texas to lay there on the dirt ground, alone. upon waking up, still smelling the rancid smell of the fox (among other things now. After she left, more people must have had some fun with her as she was unconscious) Texas groggily stood up from the floor, clenching her head with her left hand and rubbing it gently, something she was used to by now. It would seem now that she had a target over head yet again, and this time, her foe was someone completely unknown to her. If she wanted any chance of coming out of this on top, she was gonna have to be prepared. Readying herself, Texas decided to fight this strange fox assailant, she was going to have to...  </span></div></div>",

The way she moved and acted was almost supernatural, like nothing she'd ever experienced. And speaking of things worse than she'd ever experienced, the smell of that Fox's ass was beyond words. She'd sniffed Roxxie Roo's asscrack on her swampiest day and had to inhale Cow flatulence for hours at a time, but it was nothing compared to the scent of the fox's ass. And that was just on her hand! The idea of smelling it at point blank was the worst possible thing she could've imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in her life, Texas had no idea what she was going to do. Scared and confused, Texas stumbled around town with a vacant look in her eyes. She needed a drink. She staggered into what she thought was the tavern, but in her confused state she had wandered into the old town library. There wasn't a soul in there but herself, the older woman who tended the books had long since gotten out of town and the library remained untouched simply out of disinterest. Without any valuables, it wasn't worth the crook's time to mess with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas tripped over to one of the tables and sat down, trying to collect her composure. Her eyes wandered to the books laid in front of her. All of them seemed to be various supernatural texts, mostly relating to witchcraft. One of the books already spread out in front of her was all about the various powers of the witch. She glanced over it, noticing that it mentioned impossible agility, a piercing gaze, and a supernatural stench about them. It was all more than she could believe. Was Texas dealing with a witch, or was it all some bizarre coincidence. She closed the book in frustration, and as she did a putrid odor hit her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the library slammed shut, and the smell got more intense. Texas covered her nose. It was the same smell from before, but in much greater quantities! The smell of that fox's ass was rapidly filling up the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where are you?!\" Texas called into the dark corners of the small library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her only answer was a loud, trumpeting fart, and the smell getting even thicker and nastier. Texas needed to figure out what was going on before she smothered in this stink!</span></div></div>",

It looked like Tex's only chance of escaping was to fight back now, but how could she fight someone she couldn't see?! filling with panic again after remembering she had just read on magic, Texas began to shake like a leaf. Was this woman really a witch? As much as she wanted the answers for these questions, her assailant was still nearby, to close rather as once Texas turned her head, she was right in front of the Mysterious fox's ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a horrid hissing noise expelling from the Fox's ass, Texas received a full dose of her gas. How could she have done that without alerting Tex in the slightest, none of it made sense! Texas now sprawled on the ground, kicking and gagging on the face full SBD she got, the fox woman wasn't letting up her fart mist, pushing out more and more before the entire library was now a thick yellow haze. Texas couldn't hold out much longer in these conditions, it was already clear to her that the victor of this match was the fox again, but she had to try and escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the fox wasn't stopping her pursuit on Texas just because she was farting. Not stopping for a second, the mysterious fox back flipped off the table, cartwheeling in the air as her gas stream spun around her perfectly. And as impressed by that as she was, Texas still couldn't stop herself from snarling and gagging on the rotten smell that filled her lungs entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...W-what are y-y-you?\" Texas said as now hurt for her to speak, coughing up pure farts from her lungs. Turning herself around and letting her gas now blanket over Tex once again, leaving the poor sheriff  go into an even harder coughing fit, The fox woman gave her ass a quick shake of her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not Tell you what my name is, But I will indeed enlighten you on just what I am, before turning your life into an utter nightmare.\" With that, the fox pressed her ass onto Tex's snout, letting out one last thick SBD down her nose, finally finishing Texas off this round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what could only have been another day going by from the sheer amount of gas she inhaled, Texas rubbed the sides of her head as her raging headache grew much worse from before. But, that last match with the fox at least opened up to her something about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Fox...\" Texas mumbled. \"I-I-ah Can't believe it...She's a-a-a....\"</span></div></div>",

She gagged when she realized she had actually swallowed some of that Fox's putrid fumes during their last scuffle. But that was only a momentary distraction from her incredible revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a ninja!\" Texas said aloud to nobody in particular, \"But what in tarnation is a ninja doing all the way here?

(even if she really didn't want to handle this by herself) she owed it to the people to take care of her own problems, and showing them that she meant business! With her head back in the game (Yet her gut still burping up fox farts) Texas made her way back to her office, ready for a old fashion show down with this girly ninja! However, her sneaky follower was always close by, gaining a step ahead of the sheriff as soon as she found out where she was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas's plan of action was simple; get to her office, grab her quickest sharp shooter she had, and catch that no good fox by her tail and slap her behind right into a jail cell! Feeling more and more confident with herself the more she thought about capturing the fox girl, Texas jogged her way now to the sheriff's office, ready for whatever the ninja had up her sleeves! Making it to the front door, Texas quickly unlocking it as she approached it. Eagerness in her eyes, Texas practically hopped into her office with a spring in her jump!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhowever,Texas's glee was quickly replaced with horror and disgust... Her entire office, her sanctuary was in ruins. The air was tainted by the smell of stale gas, all of her weaponry now gone, and sitting on her desk, with her gun being spun around her finger, sat the lone fox girl. \"It took you long enough. I ended up dismantling most of your firearms, sheriff\" the fox girl teased as held the gun now by the barrel, inspecting it all over before speaking up again. \"This one however seemed special, considering it was in that little box of yours on that pillow I'm sitting on now\" she snickered again as she rubbed her butt on the desk, showing that she truly was sitting on the pillow from the box. It must have soaked in all of this gas that's lingering in the room, the poor thing would never smell right again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas could not comprehend what she was seeing, how could this fox have gotten here before her in such a short time! Did she come to her office while she was knocked out... That must be the reason, this fox woman had Texas played from the very start then. She had Texas's move before she even knew what it was...And now she had her trapped in her own office... \"W-why...Why are you huntin me down like a animal!\" Texas cried out to the fox girl, her confidence shattered as she now shivered what this woman would do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've told you that I was hired to capture you when we first met. Now pay attention, or I won't offer you the ultimatum i have for you\" The fox girl stood up, leaving the retched pillow on the desk as gas lingered off of it. Texas's ears perked up as she listened to the fox girl now. What could she mean by ultimatum... She would soon find out, as the fox girl put down her gun and slid it towards Texas. \"I will give you this offer, and one other. Either you pick up that gun, fully loaded in each chamber, and try to strike me down with it...\" Texas looked down at the gun, like it were miles away from her despite laying right there in front of her. curiosity however made her ask though, just what was her *other* choice. The fox girl simply smiled as Texas asked, turning herself around and presenting her ass to Texas before stuffing her hand between her cheeks, wiping it deep between them as a loud, wet fart spilled all across it. Texas was in utter discuss as she heard it, while the fox girl continued smiling and letting the warmth of her gas coat the palm of her hand entirely, before pulling it free from between her cheeks and closing her hand into a fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"your other offer is to give up, come over to me, get on your knees and smell my cuffed gas\". Texas's heart sank slightly as she heard her ultimatum. OF course it would be something like this...but just smelling her gassy hand couldn't be all of it...no, there had to be more. \"What happens...aftah I smell your smelly hand, Mrs...\" Texas said quietly as she watched the fox girl carefully, afraid that she may just jump at her if she ended up annoying her to much. The fox girl stood perfectly still, hand still clenched as she locked eyes with Texas. \"Once you've smelt the stench of a thousand sour sushi, you will go unconscious, and come home with me. Once there, you will serve me to no end for the rest of your days and nights\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the catch Texas expected to hear. Of course she wouldn't just be able to walk away from this and go back to her normal life... Texas now sat still, grossed out completely by everything she just experienced. wet farts, the smell of sour sushi, and then being enslaved by this woman...None of this sounded appealing at all, yet why would this woman make THIS sound like the better choice? \"pheh, you're real funny, fox gal. And why would I go and sniff that dirty hand of your's?\" Texas snapped at the fox, only for her to respond back coldly. \"Because the people who hired me to capture you have much more terrible things planned for you. Vile things that make sounding like my slave a miracle...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas's eyes shrunk as the ninja fox spoke. Worse things planned...Somehow, Texas believed this. with how many people there are in town and the outskirts that wanted more than Texas's face trapped in a chair, the sheriff felt a sudden chill go down her spine. Something now was telling her that maybe...just maybe she should take this fox girl's offer. Maybe she should just let this woman take her away from town to somewhere far away, away from all these extreme criminals that wanted her out of the picture. \"The choice is yours, sheriff. You may try to shoot me down here, and possibly walk away victorious...Or come with me far away from this place, and enjoy a much more simpler life...Under me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many a traveler passed through the gates of Gold Spring, some innocent travelers and some much less innocent, but none traveled like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance it seemed like a normal covered wagon, but the strange part of it wasn't the wagon itself; it was who was pulling it. A two rows of women three long were tied together by harnesses and stocks, clad in nothing more than rags. They were all beaten and haggard, with vacant expressions, all pulling the wagon like they were common beats of burden. Sitting in the driver's seat of the wagon was a black bull, one a good head taller than even the largest man in Gold Springs and covered in muscle. He wore a ten gallon atop his horns and a pair of assless chaps, but nothing else. His knee-length cock was on full display for anyone who dared to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas pulled up in front of him to stop his wagon, \"Alright stranger, state yer business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull laughed, \"Stranger?! You honestly gonna say you don't know Black Brass when you see 'em? I'm insulted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't care! I said state yer business.\" Texas said once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not one for titles, huh bitch?\" Brass snorted, \"Well I'm here to collect any fine pieces of meat you got. Like the ones here.\" He cracked his reigns and his slave girls whimpered, \"And if any y'all got beef with me, you tell your sheriff to come hash it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas drew her gun, \"I'm sheriff around here, so you'll answer to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrass laughed, \"Is that so? Well let me tell you somethin', little missy. Womenfolk like you aren't fit to be sheriff. You know what happened to the last woman who thought she were good enough to be sheriff and talk back to Black Brass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrass leaned to the side in his seat and cut a wet, sloppy sounding fart. He reached under his ass and pulled out, by the ears, a black rabbit. She was nude, terrified and soaked head to toe in filth. It was obvious that Brass had been keeping her in there deep. He threw her to the ground, then hopped off the wagon. The rabbit tried to crawl away, but Brass came down on her like a lead weight, crushing her flat. He ground his hooves into her and snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So since yer so bold,\" He said, \"I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go in this here saloon and have me a drink. When I'm done, you and I are gonna have us a duel. And when you lose, I'm gonna make you lick my last buttplug off my hooves before I make you her replacement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Brass swaggered into the saloon, leaving Texas to contemplate her fate</span></div></div>",

Things didn't look good for Texas, and she had to figure out something to do. She decided to keep a low profile and sneak into the bar, maybe case up her opponent a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside she saw Black Brass poised up at the bar. Everyone else in the bar was giving him plenty of room, except for a waitress who had her face deep inside of his ass. Not of her own will, presumably. She slurped at his taint and asshole while he cut brutal, beefy farts right in her nose. Even from across the room, Texas could see the disgust and pain in the poor girls' eyes. Brass wasn't paying his little asslicker any mind, though, he was more concerned with knocking down drinks. He may've said he was only going to have a drink before dueling Texas, but he was clearly on at least his third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas was begging to formulate a plan. Brass was more than distracted, she just needed to get close. Suddenly, Brass grabbed the waitress's head and shoved it deep into her ass, then farted hard.

She ducked into the lady's room, which at the saloon also doubled as the changing room for the dancers, and came out in a halfway decent disguise; her duster and boots were swapped out for a frilly dress and her hair had been tucked into a light brown wig. She could probably fool a few of her friends with the getup, let alone a half-drunk bull that had only just met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said ANOTHER BITCH!\" Brass hollered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas threw aside any second thoughts she might have had about the plan and ran in, knowing it was her only chance. She dropped to her knees in front of Brass's muscular, musky ass. His taut asshole puckered in front of her, wafting out a pungent stench that stung her nose something fierce. She was hesitant to get closer to his stinking crack, but she knew she'd risk blowing her cover if she didn't. She leaned in and took a tentative lick, finding it just as horrible to taste as it was to smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrass snorted, \"You call that eating ass? Get in there 'fore I FORCE you in there so deep you never come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Brass hadn't turned around to look at her, she wasn't particularly confident in her disguise and was worried he might recognize her if he gave her too much scrutiny. She dove into his ass with more vigor, desperately lapping at his horrid butt in an attempt to appease the overgrown brute. She heard him moan in mild interest, meaning she might just make it. That was before he blasted her with a thick fart that blew straight down Texas's throat. She gagged, completely unable to focus on anything other than his rotten gas in her maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!Did I say stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas swallowed her pride and went in for more, but she wasn't sure how many more of those she could take. She didn't even know what she was doing! She was just slurping his ass and eating his farts, this wasn't helping her defeat him. She needed to think of a plan. That's when she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrass's hand cannon was dangling loose from its holster, and from where she was kneeling she could grab it. Not even a goliath like him would mess with her when she was the one holding the gun. Texas started to slowly reach over, still eating Brass's ass and still smelling his farts, trying to make it seem like she was doing her job and not undermining the bull. But could she get close enough to steal it? </span></div></div>",

But her perseverance put her in arm's reach of Brass's hand cannon. The weasel could practically touch the finely crafted handle when a large hand grips her wrist, pulling it away and causing her to look up in terror at the angry bull's glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a lot of nerve, tryin' to steal my gun right off my hip. You thought a bit of weak slobbering back there would be enough to distract me? To please Black Brass, you'll have to go a whole lot deeper. Since you're so keen on getting in there, let's skip the duel and go right to the good part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull grabs Texas' head and brings it back to his twitching pucker. He blew a rank fart in her face at point blank range, making the weasel wince in disgust. She tried to pry the strong hand loose, but Brass had no intention of letting go. He relished the weasel's pathetic resistance as he grunted and blew more foul winds into the sheriff's face. The filthy asshole opened up a little, the weasel's eyes growing wide with fear. Her plan had failed and now she was about to become Black Brass's latest victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the sheriff's face was mashed into the yielding flesh of the bull's pucker. It left smears of slimy residue as it engulfed all of the weasel's face. Brass grunted, finally feeling the satisfaction Texas hadn't been able to provide so far. With a pleased snort he kept pushing, forcing his asshole to part wide as the weasel's head got forced in. The muscular ring slipped close around her neck, sealing her whole head into the bull's ass. He let out several triumphant farts before he grabbed the weasel's waist. Her shoulders were no match for the stretchy hole and Texas' inevitable advance into Brass's rear continued. Every shove was paired with a nasty, wet squelch. The other saloon patrons that saw the spectacle were enraptured by it. More than a few quietly rejoiced as they watched the weasel slowly disappear into the bull's ravenous hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the weasel was pushed in about halfway the bull let go and turned his attention back to the bar. He demanded another drink, seemingly ignoring the squirming sheriff. But she could feel his inner muscles squeeze, pulse and move all around her. The bull's innards were hard at work and soon they began to slowly pull her in. The weasel cried out in terror, but nobody could hear it. Black Brass shuddered a little, feeling his prey wiggle. He clenched his butt around Texas to torment her further, accelerating her entrance into his bowels. He felt her slowly pushing deeper and deeper into him, humming with joy as he dominated yet another woman that didn't know her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Brass didn't stop until the weasel's legs had been pulled into his insatiable ass. It let out a triumphant fart as it had claimed yet another victim. The bull's infamy had spread to Gold Springs now. Another fart rang, followed by a strange clinking. The bull looked on the floor to see a filth-covered sheriff's star. With a deep chuckle he picked it up and slipped it into his waistcoat to join the badges of all the other lawbringers that failed to stop him. He grunted and clenched his bowels, squeezing the weasel stuck in his rear tightly. With a smug grin he murred as he felt the futile struggles of Texas tickling the walls of his colon. She would learn her place soon enough. He came to this town looking for a new ass slave, and he'd found a great one in the weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Texas taken care of, what does the bull do next?</span></div></div>",

Some patrons were shocked by the disturbing display of Texas disappearing up his butt. Others seemed pleased. Apparently the sheriff had made quite the number of enemies in town. He huffed before rising to his feet again. The bull gave the bartender a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your drink's okay, but you gotta get some better womenfolk in here. These bitches ain't good for nothin. Good thing the kind sheriff was willing to... 'fill in' for them.\" The barkeep smirked at the bull's joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know how half how much of a headache that damn weasel was for business, consider your drinks on the house.\" She replied with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, maybe this town ain't such a shithole after all.\" The tipsy bull said, slowly making his way out of the tavern. He clenched a few times to ensure his butt prisoner was in enough misery before walking back to his wagon. But as he staggered out of the front entrance he bumped into a large body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Watch it, worm! Nobody pushes Black Brass without...\" His sentence trailed off and his eyes widened a little. The tall bull was used to looking down on people, but all he found was a pair of immensely wide hips. Whoever he hit had an ass almost as large as his own. He slowly tilted his head, staring at the chubby belly and impressive rack, straining against an outfit at least once size too small. Finally his gaze met that of Georgia, who angrily stared at the bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the damn hell are you calling worm!\" She growled. Few things insulted the mare more than someone claiming she wasn't the biggest and strongest around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mind that tongue, missy! The last bitch that gave me lip is now stewing in my ass. So if you wanna settle this, how about a duel at-\" His attempts at intimidation were cut off by the mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you too much of a pussy to fight right now? C'mon, big boy, put 'em up!\" Georgia taunted, raising her fists. The bull snorted angrily, furious at these insults. He threw a wild haymaker and punched the large mare on the shoulder. She immediately threw a hammering blow right to the side of his head. They kept exchanging massive blows, neither brute giving an inch. Slowly they paced away from the saloon and into the street, a crowd forming around the two, cheering them on. The fighting went on for minutes, both the mare an the bull collecting bruises but refusing to back down. They each tried to use their wide hips and massive ass to knock the other off balance, but in spite of all the weight being thrown around they were evenly matched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blows started to slow the crowd quickly dissipated before the brutes might turn their attention on them. The two kept landing hits, but they were weaker and weaker. Neither of them wanted to be the first to give up. But after another handful of minutes they had come to a standstill, too tired to even throw a punch. Impressed by the mare, Black Brass tried his best to speak, breathing heavily from the brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say... You've got... quite some fight in ya... Not bad...\" He stammered, taking a few more deep breaths to catch his wits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ain't so bad yourself.\" Georgia wiped a bit of blood from her mouth, impressed by the bull's prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never met a woman like you. Most of 'em are well...\" He gestured to his wagon and the scrawny assortment of worn-out women in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm one of a kind.\" The massive mare proudly boasted. \"Now let's get outta the road before Texas barges in to complain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas? Wait, you mean that weasel?\" Black Brass said, raising a bruised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You met her before?\" Georgia sighed. Was that damn sheriff's reputation spreading beyond Gold Springs? It should be the mare who's name is heard and feared far and wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Met her? I rammed that scrawny bitch right up my ass! She tried to mess with the wrong bull today!\" He said proudly. Georgia's jaw nearly hit the floor. She'd fantasized about doing something like that to Texas, but she never found herself the opportunity to do so without someone interfering. Some part of her was sad that someone had beaten her to it, but when the consequences of his actions finally got through to the mare she was over the moon with happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what this means?! Now ah can get Vivian to promote me to sheriff!\" She cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull visibly and audibly retched with disgust. \"What, you want to be some no-good lawful-\" Again he was cut off by the mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lawful? Ya don't know me yet, but lemme tell ya that ah intend to anythin but lawful when ah'm sheriff.\" Georgia said with a cruel smirk. Black Brass was enamored. The massive mare before him was strong, stubborn and always hungry for power. The womanizing bull felt his heartrate quicken as she rambled on about her plans as sheriff. For the first time in years the bull felt the warmth of love radiating from within. Could this enormous mare really be the one? He felt compelled to tag along as Georgia started walking towards the town hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... uhm...\" He stammered, realizing now he never caught her name. \"Georgia.\" the mare snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Georgia. With you as the soon-to-be sheriff, do you want to have... some fun together?</span></div></div>",

Texas is a bit occupied at the moment with squirming in my butt. But I'm thinkin you and I go somewhere... quiet and I let her out for some 'fun'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive mare's ears twitch with curiosity. Some one on one time with a weakened Texas, that sounded too good to pass. With a cruel smile she took the bull's hand. He acted almost strangely courteous, enamored by the large horse woman. They both got on Black Brass' wagon and rode off. Just a few minutes away they found a nice sequestered corner in the hills. The imposing bull squatted down and grunted loudly. Amidst a storm of horrid farts the weasel began to emerge from her nightmarish prison. She was covered from head to toe in the bull's stench, brown smears running up and down her body. After being entombed inside the slimy darkness of Brass' rear, the weasel was too disoriented to do much of anything as she was laid out on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas slowly looked up, wiping the fetid slime from her eyes. But the first thing to fill her vision was the sole of Georgia's boot. She brought her weight down on the former sheriff's back, squashing her with enough force to bulge out the weasel's eyes. Black Brass snorted with laughter, seeing the massive mare get to work on her victim. Soon a mere foot was not enough for the horse woman and she dropped her pants to reveal her huge unwashed ass. The bull didn't think it possible, but the sight of that wide butt made him love the mare even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah can't tell ya how much you've got this comin', Tex. Ma butt's achin to flatten you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia dropped herself down on her victim. The weasel only managed a croaking yelp before her whole body was buried beneath the massive mare's smelly rear. The unwashed, grimy fur pressed down hard on the weasel, flattening her body beneath the new sheriff's merciless weight. To add insult to injury Georgia opened her backdoor with a foul volley of farts. The hellish fumes had nowhere to go, smothering Texas in their eyewatering stench. Not satisfied with merely squashing and gassing the weasel the horse woman steps it up one more notch. She shifts her ass from side to side, grinding the weasel flatter and wedging her between two monstrous buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an eternity of smelly torment the weasel finally felt the weight on her back lighten a little. But as Georgia stood up Texas began to panic. She was wedged so thoroughly between the horse's buttcheeks that she was going up with them. Black Brass' brow rose up with curiosity. It wasn't often he got to see someone dominate their victim with their butt in the ways he would do. Even with another round of smelly farts the weasel was stuck deep between the massive mare's cheeks. The limbs still sticking out between their fatty masses twitch with the foul stench of every gassy blast. But neither of the muscular brutes was satisfied. Not by a long shot.</span></div></div>",

Black Brass held his gut as his sides ached from all the laughter. He'd never seen something quite as pathetic as the former sheriff, utterly immobilized between the monstrous buttcheeks and twitching a little whenever they squeeze together before a mighty fart. He'd put many an unfortunate victim into a similar position, but he'd never been able to watch somebody else to it. Seeing the humongous glutes tense up as they deliver another powerful crushing squeeze to the weasel was a thing of beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas wiggled and squirmed as best she could, but her situation was hopeless. The mare's foul asscrack held her tightly, immense waves of pressure flattening her body and horrid gas assaulting her nose. Even if by some miracle she could slip out from those flabby cheeks, there would be another smelly villain waiting for her. Black Brass wouldn't hesitate for a second to put her right back in Georgia's crack. He might even decide to deal with an escaping sheriff himself and entomb her into the foul abyss of his rectum. There seemed to be no way out for the weasel. She could only hope the two brutes would tire themselves out and leave her behind. Her hopes were cruelly dashed as she felt the bull's hand reach in. But Texas wasn't the only one to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what do ya think you're doing back there, bucko?!\" The mare huffed. Black Brass looked her in the eye and replied with his smoothest voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don'tcha think that as the new sheriff in town you should see to it that this little pest is given a taste of her own medicine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell are you talkin about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sayin, this weasel here's a menace, accosting strangers in the street. She oughta be locked away like she's tried to do to you so many times.\" A sinister smirk arose on the bull's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The jail's miles away. Can't this wai-\" Georgia stops when she feels Black Brass push Texas deeper, the weasel's head getting close to her pucker. It sputters out more farts in anticipation as he continued talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't talkin about locking her away in a jail cell... Not when there's an even better alternative available.\" He reached even deeper, pressing Texas' head right up against the mare's butthole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia blushed brightly, feeling the weasel's face tickling her nasty hole. Only in her wildest fantasies did she ever imagine doing this. And now, with the bull's help, she was going to make it a reality. She moaned lewdly and to the former sheriff's horror the large ring yawned open wide. Black Brass felt the way clear up and pushed. With a noisy slurp the weasel's whole head was taken in. He quickly adjusted and grabbed the pinned critter by her waist. The lecherous bandit couldn't resist fondling Texas' privates as he continued pushing more of the weasel into that ravenous hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSickening slurps and squelches echoed out from the mare's rear. She moaned as she felt the weasel enter her body. Black Brass pushed slowly but relentlessly, feeding more and more of the weasel's body to Georgia's hungry butt. Soon only a pair of legs still hung outside of the mare's twitching hole. She clenched aloud and a good few inches of the squirming legs were sucked inside. With a steady rhythm Georgia kept on pulling the last bit of the former sheriff into her. The eerie stimulation of the weasel trapped inside of her was arousing in ways the mare had never felt before. She quickly reminded her prisoner that even here she could not escape the mare's brutal strength. A mighty clench from all around crushed the last bit of fight out of Texas, making her cry out in pain. Black Brass pulled the immense horsecheeks aside to watch the last of the weasel get slurped up into that bottomless pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" Georgia mutters in disbelief, looking down at her gut. Somewhere in there Texas was squirming for her life, choking on her noxious farts. Never before had the mare felt this powerful. Alongside this strength she also felt hornier than ever before. With a determined glare in her eye she turned to face Black Brass. The bull had a raging boner and he seemed as ready for his as she was. Georgia leaps forward, lunging at the bull and knocking him off his feet. What followed was a disturbing mix between a fight and a fuck, both brutes giving it their all and culminating in a loud shared climax. Texas felt like she was stuck in a fleshy tumble-dryer, smacking into the the walls of the mare's rectum before crying out as they bore down on her with a powerful squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Black Brass had found an equal. He agreed to stick around, at least for a while as Georgia got assigned her new duties as sheriff. The mare and the bull filled their days with more rough sex and the terrorizing of the citizens of Gold Springs. None dared to speak up as they used their strength to dominate anyone that got in their way, as well as whoever they felt like tormenting that day. Texas spent the remainder of her life helplessly lost in the depths of Georgia, the rancid horse bowels becoming her new home. All she could do was breathe the mare's farts. Georgia never even realized when she could no longer feel the weak squirming inside of her, too occupied with living happily ever after with Black Brass.</span></div></div>",

While she did have a bed in the upstairs portion of the sheriff's office, she personally preferred napping at her desk, her gun and lasso within easy reach in case of sudden emergencies. It certainly wasn't comfortable by any means, but her job wasn't really a comfortable one, so she saw it as a good fit. After standing up and stretching out her aching limbs, the weasel gave a tired sigh and headed for the door, ready for her night patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out into the town at night, she instantly shivered as the biting night wind blew through her. The temperature dropped so quickly as night fell, but as the weasel began to walk, she figured that was Gold Springs in a nutshell. A town of extremes. Hot and cold, big and small, good and evil, this place didn't seem to do anything in moderation. Musing as she strolled through the streets, the weasel heard the muted sounds of laughter and music coming from the saloons, where most of the citizenry retired in the evening before heading home, the noise barely cutting through the still night air. Up ahead, the warm lights of L'Odeur S\u00e9duisante, the town's all-skunk brothel, spilled out onto the streets. As she approached, a few of the curvacious skunk girls began to approach, hoping to lure her inside, but as they saw the light glinting off her badge, they quickly turned up their noses haughtily, heading back into the light and the warmth of the brothel's common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Texas moved on, but as she did, she couldn't help but feel that she was being followed. Turning, the weasel looked back the way she had come, but the lights from the brothel had ruined her night vision. She fancied that, just for a split second, she had seen something dart back into an alleyway, but she couldn't really say for sure... Still, it wouldn't hurt to go looking, would it? Or she could just continue the patrol. Or maybe even head back into the brothel, and see what the Madame knew about the disappearances. Texas and Lucy weren't on great terms, what with the curvy skunk being on Vivian's payroll, but at least she wasn't as outright hostile as some of the girls around here...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Better safe than sorry. Texas began to move up to the dark alleyway, before rounding the corner and seeing... nothing. The small street was dark, but open at the other end, and the weasel could see everything inside it silhouetted against the moonlight reflected off the desert sands beyond. Shaking her head a little, Texas stepped inside and walked down a distance, just to be sure, then froze as something snickered in the darkness. The weasel's hand dropped to her lasso as she suddenly heard the chitting and snickering of multiple creatures around her, and looking up, she just managed to catch a glimpse of something watching her from the rooftops before it quickly pulled away. This was a trap, and she needed to get out of here right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWheeling around, Texas moved to sprint out the way she came, then stopped dead in her tracks. As she had spun around, she had come face-to-face with a white skull mask, a pair of crazed, yellow-red eyes, and a wide, jagged, toothy grin. The weasel gasped and instantly took a step back, while the huge rat, at least ten feet tall and about as wide with fat, chuckled and straightened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly...\" Texas hissed. Of course. Who else could it have been? The weasel had hoped to not see, or smell, the rat for a while after her last defeat, but it seemed that she had dragged herself up out of her lair much more quickly than Texas had anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, weasel...\" The huge rat hissed, advancing the half-step that Texas had taken backwards, and letting her oppressive odour wash over Texas. As always, the rat bore a general miasma all around her, smelling like she bathed in a mixture of sweat and raw sewage. \"You shouldn't be walking these streets all alone...\" She chuckled in her unnerving, chittering manner, \"Haven't you heard? It's dangerous at night...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas, her blood running cold, glanced behind her. The end of the alleyway wasn't too far, but Molly had her pack of rat mooks and her own voodoo powers to try and stop her. On the other hand, Molly wasn't a particularly good fighter, though she was tricky. While in the dark she seemed to be able to move impossibly quickly, or sometimes seeming like she even teleported around, and there was still her magic to contend with, as well as her aura of stench. If Texas did fight her, she would need to fight smart.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing Molly's mooks skittering in the shadows around her exit and the fat rat blocking off the only other route out of this alley was too much. If push came to shove Texas could probably deal with Molly in a one-on-one scenario. Similarly she'd be able to fight off a decent number of her minions. But together they were too much. She had to get out of there. The sheriff took another step back and Molly advanced again, swiping a hand at her foe. The weasel dodged, but the rat's small claws managed to nick her cheek. She gave the sheriff a big, toothy smile as Texas looked around nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat rat nearly filled the width of the alleyway. Sneaking past her would almost certainly get the sheriff crushed between her massive pudgy thighs and a wall. The only way left was past her mooks. It was better than nothing. Not wanting to dodge more blows from the pestilent rat, Texas kicked her in the shin and made a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, you stupid little...\" Molly cursed. But she had tricks up her sleeve. The big voodoo rat always had tricks up her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas braced herself to charge her way past the minions near the end of the alley. A solid shoulder barge should get her to safety. They might try to chase, but out of the shadows their slovenly leader wouldn't be able to keep up. It all looked cautiously optimistic until the sheriff ran headfirst into an invisible barrier. It felt like a heavy cloth sheet had been hung in front of her, absorbing her movement and bringing her to a gentle standstill. She looked back and saw Molly holding up a small doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh, where do you think you're going, weasel?\" She said with a huge, evil smile. She patted the little doll, seeing Texas react like something big was tapping on her head. Next she began to pull the voodoo doll closer to her. As if pushed by an invisible hand the weasel began to slide back towards Molly. She dug her heels into the loose sand in the alley, but it didn't help a bit. The fat rat loomed ever closer and the weasel had no idea how to stop it. Texas was back in swiping distance, now close enough to see the small red stain on the doll's chest. She held the tiny cut on her cheek, realizing that the single drop of blood the rat had drawn must've been enough for her foul magics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad little weasels gon' get punished.\" Molly crowed, watching Texas slide even closer. The stench wafting off her body was beginning to get to her victim, the sheriff holding on to her nose in a vain attempt to lessen the impact. And impact was exactly what the corpulent rat had in mind. Each of her greasy thighs was as heavy as a horse and the weasel was about to find herself pressed between them. Molly smirked cruelly as she felt the sheriff's much smaller frame press up against her. She took a few heavy steps forward, mashing the weasel between her thighs. Texas had disappeared completely between the rat's thick, sweaty legs, but Molly could feel her well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt every futile struggle and gleefully rewarded the sheriff for her efforts by squashing her flat between those mammoth thighs. The fat rat could feel her hated nemesis suffer, screaming as she squeezed her legs together. The thick layers of fat surrounding the weasel ensured her cries for help never stood a chance of escape. Molly laughed as she walked up and down the alley, grinding her puny opponent between her legs. Even this little physical activity caused the rat to work up a major sweat, soaking the weasel's outfit in her pungent stench. Her minions just sat back, watching and chittering among eachother, laughing at Texas' fate. But Molly was not one to quickly dispatch someone she hated as much as Texas. She brought the voodoo doll up to her face, nullifying it's ability to move the weasel lest the rat inadvertently pull her victim free. Staring down the little doll the rat let out a mighty belch, causing it to glow faintly as it reacted with the horrifying miasma. The effect was profound as the weasel's weak squirming seized almost immediately. The squashed sheriff had fallen unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Texas wakes again, she finds herself...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the powerful stench of Molly's breath washes over her again. It was horrible enough to knock out a horse, but the weasel held on. The room she was in was earthen and large and completely dark bar some dim lights shining from connecting tunnels, a burrow dug deep beneath an old town called Silver Lakes. This was the voodoo rat's lair and slowly it began to sink in just how deeply in trouble the weasel was. This place was notorious for people entering it and never leaving. She couldn't show her fear though, or Molly would never let her hear the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourself, you fat, cowardly rat!\" The sheriff yelled into the darkness. Bellowing laughter returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, you're a brave one to shout demands like that. I'm gonna enjoy my time with you, Texas. Don't worry, I'll be gentle with you. I want this to last as long as possible.\" Molly's voice was dripping with malice. She snapped her finger and suddenly the room lit up, all the oil lamps on the wall and ceiling igniting at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese rat woman sat on a pile of rubble, holding up a small doll and smiling cruelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recognize this little one, sheriff?\" She cooed, but her words weren't connecting with the weasel. Texas was far more distressed by how dire her situation was. She hadn't tried to move yet, too dazed from Molly's initial assault. Now the weasel finally felt the heavy iron clasp around her ankle, a sturdy chain locking her to the floor. Furthermore she had been stripped naked. Her clothes were thrown into a corner, her weapon hung on the wall amidst a whole collection of sidearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're admiring my collection? Your horrified expression is right, those are all from other sheriffs and deputies that tried to stop me. Now please pay attention, I'm not gonna explain it twice. Actually, why don't I demonstrate what's about to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas' body tensed up. She tried moving, but her whole body seemed to have stopped working. It felt like she was buried up to her neck in sand. She struggled to turn her head, but when she finally managed to face Molly it became clear. The fat rat held the little voodoo doll in a tight grip, smirking cruelly. She squeezed the doll, making the weasel in front of her gasp and groan. The intense pressure on the sheriff slowly began to warp her body out of shape, but Molly was only just getting started. She loosened her grip just long enough for Texas to take a deep breath, only to crush the air right back out of her again. Every time Texas let out a pathetic little squeak, making it hard for Molly to keep going without bursting into a fit of laughter. It wasn't enough to stop her from mercilessly tormenting the weasel, but at least it earned Texas a short reprieve once the rat got bored with her little squeak toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, that was even better then I planned.\" She hollered, rolling on the floor with laughter. \"But if ya think that making me laugh is gonna save your sorry hide, you're badly mistaken.\" It was hard for her to sound threatening between laughs, but after the torment Texas just endured the rat was plenty intimidating. The weasel shivered a little as Molly composed herself, eyeing the little doll and pondering what to do next.</span></div></div>",

She opens her mouth and breathes onto it, watching the weasel cringe in disgust. Texas could smell the rat's foul breath as it surrounded her, clinging to her fur. Molly even let out a small burp to add another layer of horribleness to the stench. The weasel was on the ground, gasping for clean air, but the cruel rat had so much worse in store for her. She didn't keep the sheriff waiting any longer and threw the doll in her mouth, snapping her jaws close and sinking her teeth into the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Texas cried out in pain. It felt like her body was on fire. To make things worse the stench of Molly's breath had only gotten worse. The sharp teeth piercing the doll left no permanent damage on the weasel but it felt all too real. When the rat began chewing the sheriff rolled on the floor in agony, making it hard for Molly to keep a straight face. The weasel tried begging for mercy, but she knew the rat wouldn't listen. She would keep this sadistic display up until the doll was too chewed up to work anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly watched her hated nemesis writhe and shake in pain, crying and pleading to her. But her evil smirk just got wider as a result. She opened her maw to show off the chewed-up doll, giving Texas the briefest reprieve. Before the weasel could breathe easy though she threw her head back and with a loud gulp she sent the doll down her neck. \"Ever wonder what being digested feels like?\" She crowed with unrestrained malice. The rat leaned back and patted her big belly whilst she watched the sheriff squirm on the floor. Her victim looked like she was restrained in a narrow tube until she finally regained her freedom as the doll landed in Molly's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange tingling covered the weasel's whole body, but soon it began to sting. \"Please...\" She begged the rat, but Molly just gave her big belly a shake, sending another wave of this stinging sensation over the weasel. It felt like one of her limbs had fallen asleep, but spread out over her entire body. Worse yet the feelin was still getting more intense. Stinging barely covered it anymore as she felt more and more like she was being set aflame. The doll was swimming in the rat's stomach juices and the sheriff could almost feel it dissolve. It was a unique experience. The pain got worse as the acid ate away at it, but at the same time it also weakened the binding. The net result was still very painful and Texas spent the next fifteen minutes rolling on the floor in agony whilst the sadistic rat watched with a gleeful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doll fell apart in her stomach Molly could sense the magic weakening. Her roiling gut made light work of the small thing. No matter though. That was plenty of fun and she still had much more in store for the weasel. With an amused smirk she got on her feet and walked closer to her victim. The sheriff was just softly whimpering, recovering from the torment she'd been subjected to. Her nose began to ache as the rat got closer, her potent stench radiating from her grimy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun, Tex. But now I'm itching to get a little more... personal with you.\"</span></div></div>",

Her massive asscheeks swayed as she approached her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas barely had the energy left to look up in horror. After the nightmarish torment she'd been put through that voodoo rat would have to try hard to top it. But even through her blurred senses she could feel the ground shudder a little with each step Molly took. Those feet looked eager to stomp her flat. The weasel struggled and squirmed, a desperate attempt to get away. Safety was impossible, but just a few seconds more of not being hurt already sounded worthwhile. The rat's mocking laughter at her feeble escape attempt cut deep, the footsteps picking up in speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no, you don't get 't crawl away from your punishment, little sheriff. I've got so much more in store for you. Though I do wonder now... Would it be crueler to slowly end you here or should I let you go after a few weeks so you can live with the memories forever...\" The weasel's eyes widened at the voodoo rat's musings. Even if she were to feel kind enough to let her victim go, it would still be after several weeks of this torture. Molly continued thinking out loud. \"Hmmm... no... life is too good for you. You will spend your last moments in agony, and when I finally decide to kill you, you will thank me for it. Speaking of agony...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly chuckled a little as her heavy foot stomped down right in front of Texas' face. The sheriff shuddered, both from the impact and the nasty smell. But the voodoo rat didn't feel like trampling her little victim today. Instead she turned herself around. Darkness was cast over the weasel as Molly's enormous backside blocked out most of  the light. The rat crouched down, letting the sheriff slowly take in the sheer size of the ass that was about to crush her. With gleeful laughter the rat felt her bottom connect, covering the weasel like a huge fatty blanket. As she sat down Molly could feel the sheriff's body fail to support her weight, flattening beneath her. To add insult to injury she ground her massive cheeks from side to side, drawing a pained whimper from beneath her. The only other sound coming from Texas was a nasty squelching as the overwhelming mass squashed her flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... This is great. This is where all you cursed lawbringers should be. Beneath my ass, praying I'll let you admire it instead of just snuffing out your worthless little lives.\" Molly could barely contain her joy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A wave of relief waved over the sheriff as her tormentor slowly stood to her feet. She knew better than to entertain any hope of Molly showing mercy, but at that point anything was better than being trapped beneath her. Molly peered over her shoulder and giggled manically at what she saw. The weasel was practically tattooed to her massive rear, her puny body barely large enough to cover a single cheek and her head being positioned inches away from her asscrack. The wicked rodent swayed her hips a few times, marveling as the hero remained firmly planted on her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a good look for you, sheriff. You seem a lot more at home being a decoration on my ass. I know you can't talk at the moment, so feel free to thank me later for showing you your place in the world\" she taunted as she gave her ass a firm smack, grinning as the once proud lawwoman jiggled along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas could barely register her taunting as she slipped in and out of consciousness. Her body ached all over, her nose burned from the stench of Molly's musky fur, and the taste of the rodent's sweat tainted her tastebuds. It would only get worse from there though, as the evil rat strutted out of the alley with her head held high and her cronies in tow. They were relentless in their mockery of the sheriff, laughing and jeering at her every step of the way. One of them went so far as to pick her hat up off the floor and blast a loud fart into it, her actions earning a laugh and nod of approval from their leader. Their merriment eventually petered out and by the time they reached their lair the novelty had worn off for much of the group. They gradually split off from Molly and went back to their usual business of scuttling through their home and scoping out Gold Springs in the cover of darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Their leader was as giddy as a schoolgirl as she paced her makeshift bedchambers with an extra swivel in her hips. Her mind raced with all sorts of horrible ideas on how to go about making the sheriff\u2019s final hours on this earth as miserable and agonizing as possible. She finally had the lawwoman in her clutches and she was determined to break both her body <i>and</i> her spirit. After thinking it over for some time, she eventually thought of the perfect punishment for the obnoxious little do-gooder: she would leave her where she was. Simple as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as she was concerned, the weasel\u2019s life amounted to little more than the dirt in her fur and it only made sense for her to be regarded as such. She could think of no better way to illustrate how she felt about Texas and her like; crushed flat beneath the backside of her superior, her presence ignored and her existence treated as a non-factor in the rodent\u2019s world. With that in mind, Molly made it a point to abstain from further acknowledging the sheriff and she went about her business, at least until she was in the mood to snuff her miserable life out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n For someone with such a bulky frame, Molly displayed a surprising amount of energy as she walked back and forth throughout her home, engaging in various activities throughout the day. When she wasn\u2019t spending all of her time plotting against the sheriff, she was deeply immersed in her wicked crafts. She was either gathering materials and experimenting at her sinister workstation, or she was sitting down with her nose buried in a book of dubious origins. Not once did she pay Texas any mind, save for the few times were she cracked a smile as she let loose a powerful fart and felt her captive groan into her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the surface, this was probably the closest thing to mercy that she\u2019d ever shown her one of her victims, but for Texas it was a punishment akin to Chinese Water Torture. The sheriff had endured all manner of torment in her career, but this was wholly unique. The pain never seemed to dissipate for her, not even when Molly was on her feet. That might\u2019ve alleviated her physical pain, but it did nothing to ease the mental torture she underwent with her face still pressed flat against the rodent\u2019s rancid smelling ass. It was struggle for her to try and keep her wits about her. The moment Molly got bored, she would spring forth and attack. She just needed to wait it out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hours ticked by with little change. Back and forth Molly went, working on a project at one moment and reading at another. The only change made was that she would occasionally take a break to venture out of her room and converse with her minions about a piece of information they had gathered. The sheriff\u2019s iron will was waning and her lungs were desperate for clean air. Were she able to pull her head free from Molly\u2019s rump, she would be begging, <b>pleading</b>, for her to show even the slightest bit of sympathy for her and spare her just a minute of reprieve. At that point, she would\u2019ve even settled for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n More hours passed. Back and forth, workstation, reading, and the occasional (five-course) lunch break. Texas had reached the point of weeping. Molly\u2019s butt had become her entire world and she was certain that she\u2019d never be the same once the day was over. No amount of showering would remove the swampy stench from her fur and she would never be able to eat anything without tasting her sweat. Bringing Molly into justice was no longer a factor in her mind and all she could think to do was apologize to her tormentor in the hopes of placating her. <i>Please</i>, she thought Molly went to sit down for what had to have been the fiftieth time that day. <i>I\u2019ll do anything you want. Just let me go. Please\u2026</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fortune smiled on her, as Molly stopped herself mid-descent and stood back up to her full height. At long last, she had finally tired of her game and decided to bring things to a close. She reached back and grabbed onto the sheriff\u2019s flattened ponytail, smirking as it took her a few tries to peel her pathetic body free. She brought the weasel to her face and raised a brow at her expression. After what felt like an eternity of mind-numbing torment, the sheriff appeared to be...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, if there was anyone who knew what was going on in this town, it was Lucy. The only problem was that the skunk was the slipperiest snake Texas had ever had the displeasure of dealing with... Well, second to Mayor Vivian at least. Texas was Lucy's least favourite person in town, and the weasel was none to fond of the skunk either, suspecting her of blackmailing many prominant citizens, but Lucy always managed to skirt the edges of the law, and her girls, when arrested, always had their stories straight. Now that she needed something from the skunk, giving her the position of power, Lucy probably wasn't going to make it easy... or cheap. Taking a deep breath, the weasel walked up the steps to the front door of the brothel and pushed her way through the curtained entry into the main room beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA far cry from the other establishments in town like The Crushed Weasel, the sitting room of L'Odeur S\u00e9duisante was actually... nice? The whole place just looked fancy from toe to tip, with rich red velvet curtains on the windows, plush armchairs, beautiful carpets, and even a few plants and sculptures to class the place up. There was even a fine old piano positioned in a windowed alcove further back, with a plump skunk sitting and playing quite expertly, the melodic sounds gently warming the building and completing the overall-classy interior. Several more of Lucy's skunks lounged alluringly on comfortable fainting couches, sat and talked with guests, or sashayed across the room carrying drinks, but most of that was off to the weasel's left. Straight ahead of her from the entrance was a set of banistered stairs leading up, next to which another skunk lounged, looking just as seductive as the rest, but Texas could see this one's sharp eyes scanning for any trouble, noticed the slight muscle in her arms, and even picked up on the tiny bulge of a pistol hidden in the folds of her short dress. She regarded Texas for a split second before realising she was being analysed herself. She quickly gave the weasel a charming, ditzy giggle, obviously trying to play herself off as just another of the girls, before going back to watching the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pointed clearing of a throat from the right caught Texas's attention, and turning, she found herself facing a small, mahogany bar, behind which sat shelves of select, expensive drinks and a large, gold-framed mirror. Also behind the bar stood a slightly more voluptuous skunk, her bountiful chest and wide ass framed by her perfectly tailored corset and dress a true sight to behold, and her face a picture of Mephitidae beauty. She was about an inch shorter than Texas, and had none of her physique, yet the skunk looked the weasel over with a confidant, dominant gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Texas... How nice of you to stop by my humble establishment... and who are you here to arrest this time, vous voyou brutal?\" She said, slipping smoothly into an accented French that betrayed her Louisianian heritage. Texas wasn't exactly sure what she had said, but it was definitely an insult. She growled and put her hands on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ain't got time fer yer jabs, Lucy. Ah need some information about the disappearances around town, an' ah know your girls hear things. The sooner you tell me what you know, the sooner ah'm out of your hair.\" She stated plainly. Behind the counter, Madame Lucy's eyes narrowed, but she gave a slight nod, pouring the sheriff a whisky from one of the bottles and sliding it across to her. Texas raised an eyebrow but drank, enjoying the taste of the clearly high-quality drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have in fact heard a thing or two, Sheriff, but... you must understand that discretion is my trade. If I were known to be talking to you, my customers would be... concerned...\" She said in a purring whisper and moved closer so as to not be overheard. This also had the secondary advantage of giving Texas a clear view down her abundant cleavage, and while the weasel's eyes lingered there for a moment too long, Lucy smoothly topped up her drink without her noticing. \"But... given that these disappearances hurt my business as well, perhaps we could come to some arrangement, no? So how about this: Pay for a night with one of my girls. Unwind and have a little fun, and on your way out in the morning I'll pass you a letter containing all that I know.\" She said with a slight smile. \"No one will suspect me, and I guarantee you a wonderful time. I don't think you relax as often as you should, Sheriff... So, do we have a deal?\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, it had been a while since she had... unwound... She took a swig of her drink, then nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Lucy, you got yerself a deal.\" She said, her words slurring a bit. After only two drinks? This must be some strong stuff. The weasel reached into her pocket for her cash, and Lucy used the opportunity to refill her glass again. Texas slapped the crumpled bills on the counter, and the skunk grinned. Her attitude instantly shifted from suspicious and hostile to that of a welcoming host, knowing she had the weasel on her hook now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnifique...\" She purred, looking at Texas with a newfound, sultry expression and delicately taking the notes, which disappeared skillfully into a hidden pouch in her dress. \"Now then, what catches your interest, sheriff? I'm certain we'll have someone to your liking... Valentine, perhaps? She is our... house specialist, a monumentally talented individual who would give you a night you'd never forget. But if you prefer quantity over quality, I could also arrange for a private room and a half-dozen of my girls... They've been dying to get their hands on you.\" The skunk continued, her smile widening before she leant in to whisper in the weasel's ear. \"Or, if you're willing to pay a little extra, I may even be available tonight for a personal session... We'll skip the letter business and just talk privately... and maybe even get to know each other a little better.\" Lucy purred, topping up the weasel's drink again, before pulling back and leaning on the counter. As she did so, her arms squeezed in on either side of her ridiculous rack, and making it look even bigger, her sultry gaze not wavering for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it be, mon cheri?\" </span></div></div>",

With a smile, Lucy reached under the counter and plucked something up, before handing over a small brass key with a '13' carved into the bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite the number, you'll be getting quite lucky, sheriff...\" Lucy said with a wink, while Texas just blushed a little, then nodded and turned to walk off upstairs without another word. However before she could do so, there was the sound of a throat clearing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem... Sheriff? I'm afraid I cannot allow any weapons near my girls.\" Lucy stated, her eyes glancing down at Texas's gunbelt. The weasel hesitated for a moment, then nodded and removed it. Lucy took it carefully and stowed it behind the counter, then gifted the weasel with a bright smile. \"Merci. Up the stairs and to the end of the hall. Enjoy your stay, Sheriff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the weasel swayed unsteadily outside door number 13. The upstairs hallway of the brothel was lined with identical wooden doors, distinguished only by their numbered brass plates, and as Texas stood staring at hers, she was starting to have second thoughts. She hadn't done this before, and wasn't sure she could really trust Lucy, but... surely one night couldn't hurt, right? With a deep breath, the weasel unlocked the door and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sheriff stepped inside the room, she was immediately greeted by darkness, and an utter stench that was completely juxtaposed with the fancy aesthetic of the rest of this place. The stink of stale sweat and gas practically oozed out of the walls, and underlying it all was the sickly smell of sex. However before Texas could back away, the door suddenly slammed behind her, accompanied by the distinct 'click' of the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Lemme outta here you stinkin' varmints!!\" Texas shouted, banging on the door, but just as she was considering booting it down, there was a giggle from the darkness. Suddenly the light in the room clicked on, and lying on the bed was the absolute antithesis of the girls she had seen outside. This skunk wasn't dainty, she was huge! Easily over ten feet tall and colosally fat, Valentine lay in what was meant to be a seductive pose, but with her fat, sweaty body she more resembled a giant, dark purple slug! Worst of all was the fact that she was wearing practically nothing, just a tiny thong that was lost in her folds and flab, meaning that Texas could see everything, a sight that she wouldn't soon be burning free of her retinas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Don't you just look yummy...\" Valentine growled in a deep southern drawl. \"Come here, little sugar cube... Valentine's gonna rock your world...\" She continued, pure, unbridled lust in her eyes as she began to crawl across the king-sized bed towards Texas, then when she ran out of that, across the floor too. Even on her hands and knees she towered over the sheriff, her huge, sweaty breasts and layers of fat swinging and jiggling as she closed in. If Texas didn't do something now, she'd likely be regretting it in the morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weasel made it all of two steps before a massive hand closed around her, then slammed her down onto the sweaty bedsheets. Texas cried out, but her protests were completely ignored by Valentine. Instead, the huge skunked purred with delight as her prey was pinned under one huge hand, while her other one moved down and removed the tiny thong she had been wearing with a sticky, sucking noise. \"We won't be needing this... Now then, onto the foreplay! Eat up, weasel!\" She shouted, then turned and pulled apart her cheeks, revealing the sickening, unwiped ass crack hidden between them. Before Texas could even try to object, the skunk fell backwards with a BOOM, landing in what could be charitably be called a facesit, though really her ass covered most of the sheriff's body. However Texas's face was definitely between her cheeks, buried about as far up as it would go, and Valentine felt it. Biting her lip in pleasure at the sensation, the giant, fat skunk pulled her legs up onto the bed so that she was straddling the weasel's form, before using one hand to start massaging her huge breasts, and the other on her more sensitive areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh yes.... Now wriggle for me, sugar cube...\" The giant skunk moaned and purred, her hands roughly fondling her massive mammories and sweaty nethers, while her ass ground back and forth with a variety of disgusting squishing sounds, pushing Texas further into that huge, filthy crack until only her feet were visible, kicking pathetically. \"Mmmm.... You know how I like it... But let's get a little more intimate...\" She continued, feeling Texas's muzzle pressed up against her pucker. Removing the hand from her breasts, she reached back and managed to grab Texas's legs from between her cheeks, then suddenly plunged her forwards, ramming her torso-deep into her sickening ass. A shudder of pure pleasure ran down Valentine's spine, but she wasn't content to stop,  quickly pulling the screaming, struggling weasel out and slamming her in again and again and again, moaning and wailing as she turned the sheriff into nothing more than a living dildo, and one that she was using to plow her filthy backdoor thoroughly. \"Ah! AH!! YES!!!\" She cried in pleasure, accidentally letting loose with a few spluttering, wet farts that sprayed any parts of Texas not already slathered in her stinking sweat, and forced the stench of her gas through the weasel's nose and into her lungs. Texas tried to call out between rams, but even if she managed to, would there be anyone to hear? And more importantly, would anyone hear in time...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, Valentine was clearly getting heated, panting and sweating even more than normal, her face flushed a bright red and her eyes wild with lust. Purring up a storm, she rammed Texas extra deep and wriggled her around, crying out in ecstasy, then quickly pulled the shit-covered weasel out, letting her dangle limply. Texas's clothes had been completely shredded by the rough treatment, but her modesty was still protected by the thick layer of shit that coated her down to her knees, covering any possible indecency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough foreplay!\" Valentine screamed with lust, then dunked Texas into a deep, filthy pot of water by her bed to wash the worst of the crap off, sloshing her around in there for a moment before pulling her out and slapping her onto the bed. \"I want the real thing, and I want it NOW!\" She roared, lifting up her belly and straddling The sheriff so that her sopping wet sex was pressing into the weasel's body, big enough to cover about sixty percent of her. The weakened weasel, her body battered and her head spinning, could only scream muffledly into the muff that now covered most of her form, only her exposed feet kicking away. She had no hope of escape now. Valentine was in control, and Valentine was horny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to rock your WORLD!\" The giant skunk roared, and if Texas was by some miracle still able to access higher brain function at this point, she'd have to deduce that the room had some sort of top of the line soundproofing, just to ensure that Valentine's loud lovemaking sessions didn't evacuate the entire building. However, even if she was still that lucid, Valentine was about to fix that. With a lustful, primal roar, the skunk on top slammed her pussy down hard into the bed, instantly pulverising the weasel's naked form, then began thrusting and grinding and rutting herself into the hard mattress, which bounced and shook from the force of every impact. Quickly, Texas was flattened out to nothing but a stain on the sheets, but if she thought that was going to stop the lust-crazed skunk, she clearly didn't know Valentine. Even without the feeling of Texas beneath her, the skunk continued pounding away at the bed until the frame creaked and cracked, the reinforced mattress springs beginning to give out. And all the while, the heroic sheriff was smothered with sweat, stink and skunk lovejuices, the heat and stickiness of which had practically glued her to the bed, while the giant, fat skunk pussy ironed her out. Finally, after twenty agonising minutes, the skunk reached her climax, but it was far, FAR too late for Texas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Yes! YES!!!\" The skunk screamed as she sprayed across the bed, drenching what was left of the weasel. At exactly the same moment however, her ass muscles relaxed, and out rushed a long, brassy blast of putrid skunk gas that rolled across the room and coated utterly everything, with Texas... or the stain that resembled Texas,  right at the epicentre of it. For a solid few seconds all she could smell and see was the skunks thick, putrid gas, scorching her nose with the smell of a tire fire in an open sewer, before Valentine, utterly spent, sighed with relief and flopped backwards onto the bed, her ass still letting out occasional puffs and poots of gas. A questing hand found the cigarette package on the bedside table, and Valentine took a cigarette from the box, lightin up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Was that good for you too, sweetie?\" She said, taking a long drag. \"I hope not...\" The skunk chuckled, placing one of her huge feet on Texas... then blinked in surprise as she only felt warm, damp cloth beneath her. Running her foot back and forth over the spot, she realised that she couldn't feel any difference between the spot where the shocked sheriff stain was, and any other part of the sheet. She whined, her ears and tail drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw crap... not again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and Madame Lucy stood in the room, flanked by two of her skunks, examining the mess. Valentine, with her underwear back on and looking oddly sheepish for a huge, dominant girl like her, stood against one wall, while all of them looked down at the bedsheets. Still a little damp and reeking of Valentine's stink, the main item of interest was right in the centre, where a naked, terrified Texas had been completely bound to the sheet, her body spread-eagle, glistening, and slightly transparent. It seemed that the combination of heat, moisture, weight and gas that Valentine had been putting out had acted like a giant iron, and served to steam-press the town hero to the silk until they were one in the same, completely inseparable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry about this, M-madame Lucy...\" Valentine squeaked, a blush across her face, but Lucy just sighed, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not your fault, mon ami...\" The lead skunk said. \"She chose you, after all... I do wish that I could have been able to blackmail her though... I had so many little jobs for her... Ah well. C'est la vie! We have to play the hand we're dealt, no?\" She smiled, then turned to her skunk attendants. \"Start releasing rumours of the sheriff's visit to the clientelle, then contact Dusty at the town paper and have her run a story about the sheriff going into hiding following these humiliating revelations. That should keep any real investigators off our back for a short while, and if they do come snooping... well, we can tell them that she was a regular and that we're sad to see her business with us end like this...\" She turned back to the sheet, chuckling a little at the sight. It may have thrown a wrench into her schemes, but she had to admit, the bothersome sheriff did look funny like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for this one... Hide her in the basement for a few weeks then smuggle her out of town.\" She said with a smile. \"After all, I'm sure we can find an outlaw who will pay us quite handsomely... to have the great sheriff Texas as their own personal lovedoll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroned to the bedspread, the weasel could only sob as she heard the taunting laughter of the skunks, and knew that she was in for some rough nights ahead...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Texas looked across the table at the svelt seductress, her face flushed at the thought of hiring the madame herself. To say Texas was attracted to Lucy was an understatement, though practically everybody in town was given how drop-dead gorgeous the skunk looked, but given that she was another of Vivian's lackies, they'd never really seen eye to eye. But... maybe it was time to start fixing that...? With an embarressed cough, the weasel reached back into her pocket and took out another small handful of notes, carefully sliding them across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, maybe uh... A-ah mean... T-that is to say...\" The weasel's blush deepened, completely tongue tied, but Lucy had no such trouble. With a chuckle, she took the offered notes and fixed the weasel with a sultry smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the way of it then? Mhmm... I'm flattered sheriff. Well then, finish up your drink, and I'll lead you to my... special retreat.\" She said, topping up the weasel's drink one last time, though if the weasel had been keeping her eyes on the skunk's hands she would have noticed that Lucy poured this final drink from a different, identical bottle of whiskey. Sadly for her, however, she didn't, being too distracted by Lucy's charms, and with a smile she lifted her glass and toasted to the skunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the weasel finally awoke, her head was pounding and her vision was blurry. The last thing she remembered was the taste of whisky in her mouth, then... she was here? But where was here... And... Why was she dangling??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, the weasel saw heavy iron manacles shackling her wrists, with chains extending all the way up to the ceiling, apparently precisely measured to leave her toes just barely brushing the ground. A cry of shock passed the weasel's lips and she looked around for help, only to be stunned into silence by the rest of the room. Gone were the luxious trappings of the brothel; its fine silks, its plush velvets and its faintly perfumed air. Instead, the weasel was alone in the middle of a large, round cement room, its only features being a rank smell in the air, the faint sound of dripping, and a large, rusted metal door across the room from her, with no handle on Texas's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to call out for someone, a loud metal squealing signalled the door's opening. With a clank and a ka-chunk, some sort of locking mechanism drew back, and the door swung inwards to reveal Madame Lucy flanked by two of her skunks. She gave one of them a nod and stepped inside, and the indicated skunk closed up the door, turning the large metal wheel set into the middle to relock it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy!? What in the hell do you think you're doing!\" Texas shouted. \"What in tarnation is this??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? This is just my little private room. Perfect for teaching lessons to brutish sheriffs who think they can just walk into my establishment.\" She said, her eyes narrowed. \"I had thought you would have had more sense than to scare my patrons and worry my girls, but clearly I have overestimated you. So let this night be a clear reminder: You are not welcome here, imb\u00e9cile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk's hand lashed out and grabbed the weasel's braid, yanking her down to waist height. The weasel yelped in pain and made to lift her head back up, but as she did so she came face-to-face with a truly terrifying sight: Lucy's ass at point blank, the two giant, juicy cheeks utterly dwarfing her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Lucy, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the sheriff had planned to say was completely lost to time as her face was stuffed between the two massive cheeks, each easily as big as her entire head, and plunged so deep that her nose pressed against Lucy's backdoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh-uh, mon sheriff. You chose a private session with me, and I intend to give you exactly what you paid for...\" She purred, biting her lip... and letting loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thunderous, bellowing roar her ass released the pent-up fumes, which poured into Texas's mouth and nose and utterly ensured that she wouldn't be able to smell anything else for a month. All the other villains she'd dealt with were an afternoon's walk through flower-filled fields compared to this! It wasn't just that it was bad, though it was utterly abysmal, a smell so rotten that she could feel it infecting her very soul, but it was concentrated. Every wisp of gas that drifted over her tongue was like a hundred skunk fart blasts all pressed down into a single atom of gas, and as they made contact with her taste buds, she could taste all of them, at once, amplified. Comparisons to stinking sewers, sweaty laundry, rotten fish or tire fires just didn't really capture the <i>nuance</i> of precisely how mind-bindingly awful a blast of Lucy's gas was, but that combination, quadrupled, would produce a smell somewhere in the ballpark of being as foul as Lucy's gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deep breaths now!\" The skunk said, before the letting loose with a second fart; a hissing, whining, squeaking blast that forced itself down into the sheriff's airways, burning itself into the lining of her mouth and nose like acid etching into metal, and smelling far, far worse. With every lethal wisp, Lucy knew that Texas's brain was quickly melting away, dissolving in an endless sea of skunk stink until nothing would matter to the weasel anymore except the ass in front of her, and the constant fumes being pumped into her airways... Still, Texas was a useful pawn on the board in Lucy's plans for Gold Springs, and gassing her into a broken stink-slut would set her machinations back... but it would also feel sooo good... All it would take would be a few more blasts, and this troublesome, idiotic, brute of a sheriff would be her slave... Forever... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver of pleasure ran down Lucy's spine at the thought, and another squeak of gas slipped out. All she would have to do would be relax her ass muscles, and blow this sheriff's stupid brains out with her stink... And that would be the end of Sheriff Texas...</span></div></div>",

With a reluctant sigh, she yanked the sheriff's head free from her oppressive cheeks, a satisfied smile touching her beautiful face as she saw the glazed look in Texas' eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still conscious? For such a dimwitted brute, your mental fortitude is to be admired\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas could only respond with a wheeze and a cough, the soul destroying stench still lingering around her nose. She managed to survive the brutal assault on her senses, but there was no doubt as to whether or not she would've been able to hold out had Lucy not shown mercy on her. Her attention was brought up to the Lucy's gorgeous grinning face as she reached down and gently lifted her head up to meet the sheriff's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there is a lesson to be learned here. Don't you, mon sheriff?\" she asked in a condescending tone of voice. Texas picked up on the hint and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... didn't mean to... disrupt your business... please forgive... mah rudeness\" she panted. Her lack of defiance was very much out of character for her, but she knew her limits. Offending Lucy was already a foolish thing to do, but to try and mouth off to her when she's in a dominant position? It was nothing short of suicide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought you incapable of civility\" Lucy said giving the panting sheriff a soft pat on the cheek. \"Although... I can't help but feel that you aren't being sincere with your apology\" she added with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy please... ah'm sorry... ah won't never come in an' disrespect you or your girls again... ah swear...!\" the sheriff cried out with all the enthusiasm she could muster given how damaged her lungs were. She watched tensely as her captor began pacing back and forth, her tail lazily swinging to a fro as she pondered her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... that was better, but... still not satisfactory. You see Miss Stanton, I am quite the busy woman, incredibly so. Maintaining the upkeep of this fine establishment is a constant burden that I must shoulder, and thus I don't often get to break off for some me time. C'est tr\u00e8s tragique...\" she said with a melodramatic sigh. \"You've taken time out of my day, Miss Stanton. Sorry won't cut it with me, I'm afraid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas felt her heart stop. What exactly did that mean for her? Would the sinister skunk use her farts rot away what was left of her brain and sell her off as a slave? Would she keep her chained up in her private room, never to be seen again? Or would she forgo all subtlety and just take her life right there and then? Lucy could see the underlying terror beneath the sheriff's gaze and it amused her to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself, my adorable little sheriff. You've already paid me for my time, so we're all squared in that area. However...\" she drawled slowly as he approached the sheriff, once again presenting her enormous ass to her. Texas struggled and whimpered in fear, though Lucy quickly silenced her as she grabbed the back of her head and shoved it right back between her powerful buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to show me how sorry you are. Do a good job and I'll let you leave\" she instructed, shaking her impressive rear back and forth. \"Come now. Don't keep me waiting, mon cheri~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The residual musk of Lucy's butt seemed so quaint in comparison to the hell that she endured, although that really wasn't much of a compliment. Had it not been for the mind rotting barrage of gas the sheriff just got through inhaling, she wouldn't have been able to so much as stomach the stench that surrounded her face. With her head encased in what felt like a hundred pounds of plump skunk ass, she still somehow managed to pick up on the seductress' command. The thought of it made her retch but given her alternative she saw no other way around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Slowly, her tongue exited her mouth and began to explore her cramp, dark surroundings. The taste made Texas' eyes water and her stomach churn, but she powered on through, lavishing Lucy's ass with licks and kisses in the hopes of appeasing her. Above her she could hear her captor gasp and moan, the walls of flesh quivering and shaking with every lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh! Oh my... oh yes...\" the voluptuous skunk groaned, her legs nearly giving out on her as she ground her ass into the face of what once was her most hated enemy. \"Such... such talent you have! Maybe being sheriff wasn't your ideal career path after all. Have you ever considered working a brothel? I have half a mind to hire you as my personal stress reliever~\" she cooed before shuttering as she felt the sheriff's rough tongue pushing against her pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that be lovely? To be my plaything in the morning and my lover at night...? I guarantee it'd pay much better than your current occupation\" she added with a slight sneer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas shuddered at her proposition, though a small part of her couldn't help but find it tempting. Wicked as she was, none could deny Lucy's breathtaking appearance. Perhaps the lack of clean air was affecting her mind, but spending the rest of her nights huddled up to the ravishing skunk didn't seem to bad. She pushed such thoughts out of her head and focused on the task at hand, retching as the tip of her tongue managed to penetrate Lucy's tightened pecker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That proved to be a fatal error on her part as it managed to the push that Lucy needed. She cried out as she came to a shuddering orgasm, her fluids dripping onto the concrete floor below as she struggled to remain standing. The temporary loss of control also caused her to let a quick yet powerful fart, the force of which managed to free the sheriff's head from between her cheeks. It took a few minutes for her to regain her composure, sweat pouring off her body as her feminine juices continued to drizzle onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness me... that was tr\u00e8s bien, Miss Stanton. All is forgiven~\" she said with a wide grin as she turned to face the sheriff. After such a magnificent showing, she had began to consider returning the favor for the ensnared lawman, but was disappointed to find her limp and unconscious, the fart having knocked her clean out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor thing...\" she cooed before reaching into her cleavage and plucking a key free. She released the sheriff from her binds and snapped her fingers, immediately summoning her girls from the other side of the door where they initially stood guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, would you be so kind as to take care of the sheriff? Ah this excitement has left me in need of a nice hot bath\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oui madame!\" the two chimed as they swiftly retrieved the comatose sheriff and ushered her out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... if only she weren't such a nuisance...\" Lucy sighed, her hand lazily petting her sodden crotch. \"She would have made a fine bedmate... oh well. No love lost, I suppose\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, she made her way of the room, making sure to secure it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas awoke some time later in daze, her head pounding and her lungs still burning from the shotgun blast of gas that knocked her out cold. It took her eyes a moment to adjust themselves but once she finally found her barrings she looked around her to find that she had been...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Groaning loudly she sat up and clutched her head, startling a raccoon in a nearby bin, and coughed out a few wisps of Lucy's gas. Whether it was from the drugs the skunk had put in her drink or the fumes filling her lungs, Texas's head ached like the world's worst hangover, but her anger pierced right through that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas had given the skunk a chance, and Lucy had betrayed her, taking her money, her dignity, and almost her mind. With a snarl Texas pushed up to her feet, ignoring the splitting pain of her head, and reached for her gun, planning to storm back inside and arrest the while lot of them. However, as her hand fell onto the carved wooden grip of her revolver, she felt soft paper under her fingers. Looking down, she noticed a gently folded note had been tied delicately to the grip of her pistol with a perfumed purple ribbon, and the weasel's fingers deftly plucked it free, beginning to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Texas... Thank you for the unforgettable night, but a deal's a deal, so here is your information. My girls have heard very little about who could be behind these disappearances, which can only mean one thing: Molly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel stopped reading as a cold shiver rushed down her spine. While she treated all of her foes with a cautious unease, the only one she could admit to being outright scared by was Molly. The rat commanded forces beyond the sheriff's comprehension, and on top of that she commanded a small army of spies, and operated out of a nigh-impenetrable lair that no-one had ever returned from. Still, there were citizens in danger, and Texas couldn't allow her fear to be an impediment to her duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you know what that means. She'll have no doubt re-established her usual labyrinthine base beneath the Silver Lake ghost town, and while I would advise you to stay away, we both know that you'll jump in with both feet as always. Just be careful, and know that your untimely demise would be... Inconvenient. Good luck. Love, Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas grumbled as she looked over the paper, still planning to go and arrest Lucy. Molly was clearly the biggest threat, but Lucy had still drugged, kidnapped and assaulted the town sheriff, a course of action that demanded a response. Still, wasting time here could mean that those who had disappeared were suffering from Molly's clutches... And besides, who knows what embarrassing blackmail photos Lucy had taken while the weasel was out cold... Texas shuddered at the thought, but she needed to make a decision: Lucy or Molly?</span></div></div>",

Besides, that info could be a load of croc anyway. It was better to just deal with Lucy for now and wait for a better shot at Molly. Checking her gun for ammo in case things went bad in there, Texas rounded the corner of the alley and walked up to the front door of Lucy's brothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking in the door, Texas scanned the room. She saw many familiar faces, from the regular service girls, to the enforcer by the stairs, gun still in her pocket, to Lucy standing behind the bar. \"Lucy!\" The sheriff calls out, getting the skunk's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing the voice, Lucy turned to face Texas as she replaced her grimace with her iconic lustful grin. That look uneased Texas a bit as she walked up to the bar to confront her. She felt plenty of other eyes on her as she approached the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, mon amor. To what do I owe such a swift return? Perhaps you wish for another session with moi?\" Lucy asks, her tail wagging a bit in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas froze a bit. She had come here to arrest her, but that depraved part of her that got off on her treatment last night was coming back, wanting the skunk to push her down onto her bed and have her way with her. It didn't even mind if it was just another wave of gas like before. Coming to her senses, Texas finally speaks up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Lucy's brutal gassing must've knocked something loose in the sheriff's head, because for some reason she wasn't able to maintain her justified contempt for the alluring beauty before her. She had come in expecting to deliver swift justice for what was done to her, but Lucy's affable demeanor managed to quell her fury ever so slightly. Of course her chipper attitude could've been all an act, but it was never easy to discern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>It's not like she forced me into it</i>, she reasoned. <i>She made the offer and I said yes...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her mind went back to the day prior, her face growing warm at the memory. Had it been anyone else she wouldn't have tolerated such treatment but Madame Lucy wasn't at all like the boorish thugs she normally dealt with. She was a woman of class and refinement, a woman of such beauty and charm that it could make even the most stoic of townsfolk tongue tied and nervous. Were it not for the immense potency of her gas, she would have felt no shame in finding it pleasurable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she labored over her decision, the smiling skunk watched in amusement. Her claim of constantly being busy wasn't spoken in jest, as there were a number of tasks that required her attention at the moment. She was more than willing to put them aside when the sheriff was involved. There was a distinct pleasure she felt in watching the unwavering, infallible lawman of Gold Springs succumb to her feminine wiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes ma'am... ah've come to uh... solicit yer services\" Texas spoke in a meek, quiet voice. She instinctively winced as she expected Lucy to lay into her for her sudden passivity, but the lusty belle just smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mon cheri, you have no idea how badly I've wanted this~\" she cooed before reaching down into her cleavage and plucking a jet black key. \"Upstairs, last door in the hall. Meet me there in twenty minutes\" she instructed, gently placed the key into Texas's waiting palm before sauntering away with a bit more switch in her stride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas stared down at the key in a stunned silence. Why on earth was she doing this? No good could come from spending any more time with Lucy. She already had the information that she needed, so she had no real justification for being there was second time. That's when she remembered: she had come in to make an arrest! Of course wasn't <i>actually</i> here as a patron. She was just getting the sinister skunk alone so that no one could save her... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was broken from her thoughts as one of Lucy's staff tapped the counter to get her attention. The skunk by the stairwell stood on the other side with an inviting smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonjour. Madame Lucy has instructed me to serve you while she's getting everything ready. Feel free to take your pick from our fine assortment of wines and liquors, but do take care to not get <i>too</i> inebriated. Madame prefers her clients to have all their wits about them~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas bit back a snarky retort as she ordered two shots of whiskey. There wasn't really much she could say as a rebuke her comments as she willingly walked back in on her own accord. She paid close attention to the woman pouring her drink, making sure that there were no shenanigans this time around. After sniffing her drink a couple of times (and earning a knowing grin from the skunk behind the counter), she downed the drink and sighed in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The time flew by as the sheriff sat there, the alcohol calming her nerves and putting her mind at ease. She had made up her mind to overpower and subdue Lucy the moment the opportunity presented itself. though she had a hard time convincing herself that that was her intention all along. Soon enough, another shapely skunk walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The madame will see you now\" she said with a polite bow of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sheriff nodded and stood up from her seat, her palms sweating slightly as she made her way up the stairs. The looks she got from the staff were significantly more welcoming. No doubt Lucy had told them of the masochistic do-gooder that returned after being used and abused the night prior. They must've seen her submissiveness as an indication that she was no longer a threat to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah'll show them a thing or two...</i>, the sheriff thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She walked down the elegantly decorated hall all the way down to the last door which had the madame's name neatly embroidered onto the door with golden cursive letters. After taking a moment to steel her nerves, she unlocked the door and stepped in. The sight that greeted her left her absolutely speechless.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The voluptuous skunk was laid out before her, naked in all her gorgeous splendor. Whatever thoughts of law and arrest were still buzzing around in Texas' mind were silenced immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, come in, don't leave me waiting, mon cheri.\" She beckoned the weasel closer, seductively waving her finger. Her confident grin only grew as the sheriff took her first cautious steps. \"You know what I want, and I know what you need.\" The skunk spoke in riddles, but the weasel understood what she desired. With every step Texas removed more of her clothes until there wasn't a thread of clothing worn between the pair of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff crawled onto the large bed and Lucy quickly took charge. She wrapped the weasel into a big, comfortable hug, pressing Texas close to her musky body. The weasel's sense of smell already seemed dulled by their last encounter and she barely wiggled or resisted Lucy's advances. The skunk almost felt bored by how easy this was. But as she slid herself graciously on top of the weasel she began to feel the sheriff trying to fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now tell me Texas... after all the things I told you, you still came back for more? C'est un surprise. But I shall try to accommodate you.\" The skunk's large body rested atop the weasel with her crotch smothering Texas' face. \"Hmmm... let me feel that heavenly tongue again and I may return the favor.\" Lucy laughed naughtily. She couldn't quite believe she had made the sheriff of all people such an offer. It served only to turn her on further as she felt Texas' face rub against her wet folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh...\" Lucy gasped. That nimble weasel tongue had already come out. She expected to have to... press the weasel a lot more for her to deliver, but here she was, eagerly lapping away at the skunk's foul-smelling pussy. \"You are full of surprises today, Texas.\" She complimented between husky moans. Her excitement quickly reached a fever pitch, the skunk letting out a few small but horrifyingly smelly farts. Lucy blushed at her little accident, but thankfully it did nothing to even slow the weasel's efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas' nose burned from the stench. Both those farts and the skunk's pungent musk were a nightmare to deal with. But against all odds she persevered. It wouldn't even be too much effort to throw the skunk off of her and scramble for her gun, but the weasel found herself indifferent to it all. The only thing she could think of was giving that beautiful body the love it deserved. Her tongue pried itself between the slick lower lips and elicited ever louder moans from Lucy, spurring the weasel on further. Finally the skunk achieved her victory, a climax unlike any other squeezed from the tongue of one of her most hated enemies. Intensely pungent feminine release soaked the weasel's head and the bedsheets, but this ride was far from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her face covered in the skunk's foul juices the weasel soon gasped as she felt Lucy live up to her end of the bargain. This skunk that was supposed to hate her guts was now attempting to reach those guts it felt. Her tongue was expertly teasing the weasel's pussy and she effortlessly drew one lewd moan after the other out of her partner. \"You might be a natural, Texas, but there is nothing that beats... experience.\" She whispered between licks. The weasel barely heard her words, too lost in pleasure to do anything more than shiver with delight as the skunk went to town on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy held nothing back and soon she had the weasel on the very edge. The skunk shot a cruel smirk over her shoulder, drawing the moment out as long as she could until finally driving that tongue in deep and making Texas cry out in shameful joy. Deep down the weasel knew it was wrong, but it felt so damn good she couldn't help but enjoy herself. She sat up, burying the weasel's face beneath her and blowing a nasty little fart in there. She got onto her feet, standing beside the bed and admiring the ravaged weasel laid out on the sheets. Several large damp stains revealed the sheer excess of their pleasures, but the skunk wasn't quite done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'est vraiment special, Texas. Few can perform what you just did. I feel this calls for a... reward. I'll have my girls put together every scrap they know about Molly. And should one of her rats come in here, I shall see if they cannot be... convinced to share some more with us. As for you, stay here... I have a surprise that you will not soon forget.\" She let out an ominous laugh, making Texas feel a chill run down her spine.</span></div></div>",

Had the sheriff not been so distracted when she walked in, she would've took immediate notice to the heavy iron chains attached to the legs below. Too little to late, as she had no energy left within her from the intense toe curling climax Lucy brought her to not minutes ago. All she could do was watch as the seductress strolled to around the bed, chaining her limbs down and ensuring that she wouldn't be able to flee from what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Nice and cozy\" she said with a chuckle before sitting down beside the ensnared weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lucy... please don't... Ah don't know whatchu got planned but if ya let me go and ah'll pay you as much as-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay?\" Lucy interrupted with an amused grin. \"Oh, this isn't about money, mon petit sh\u00e9rif. I'm simply injecting a bit more passion into an already steamy affair\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n To say that Texas was doubtful would've been a massive understatement. She could only imagine what sinister plans her gorgeous captor had in store for her. At that point, the sheriff almost welcome it as punishment for her inexcusable foolishness. Just <i>what</i> was she thinking coming back for more? Was she really so attracted to Lucy that she would ignore her innate survival instincts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right to be concerned, Miss Stanton. You've found yourself in such a compromising position, haven't you? I could easily take this opportunity to turn you into a mindless little stink slave. No one would even know you were missing...\" The skunk whispered coldly as her plump rear hovered near Texas' face and drawing a panicked whimper from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I <i>could</i> do that... but it'd be such a waste, wouldn't it?\" she asked as before gracefully whirling around laying her larger body down onto the Texas'. The weasel's nervous fidgeting ceased as she peered up at Lucy's smiling face. Gazing upon her stunning visage filled her head with so many conflicting emotions. She couldn't make up her mind as to whether or not she was angry, aroused, or terrified of the domineering belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm known for many things, Texas: I am a successful woman, a fantastic dancer, a passionate lover, and much much more...\" Lucy said placing her hands on either side of the bond sheriff's face. \"But only those who have left a significant impression on me are permitted to know my greatest attribute\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She paused for a moment, her gaze seeming to bore deep into Texas' soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, and have always been, something of a romantic~\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas' eyes went wide as her seductive captor leaned in close, her luscious lips barely an inch away from hers. The set of her musty fur was closer than ever, but her disgust couldn't even come close to matching the blossoming desire that was felt. Deep down, she wanted Lucy to close the distance and let their lips connect, but Lucy seemed content to just lay there and let the anticipation build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth, Miss Stanton, I've never cared much for you. You're loud, crude, vulgar, and very much lacking in class or poise... and yet... I can't help but fancy you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas' gut reaction was to try and rebuke her sudden affections, but the moment she opened her mouth to protest, Lucy  finally brought their lips together in an intense, passionate kiss. Almost instantly, the sheriff tossed aside all thoughts of resisting as her brain was overwhelmed with a wave of euphoric bliss. The closeted desires that once resided deep within her subconscious were on full display as she pushed back against the alluring skunk's lips. Her binds didn't give her much room to act, but Texas was determined to reciprocate her affections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two kissed for some for what felt like an hours, their tongues swirling together and allowing the two to savor the lingering aftertaste of their previous previous bout of lovemaking. The thought of sampling her feminine own juices would've normally Texas heaving in disgust, but she was more than happy to overlook it as her body quivered beneath her much larger lover. Without warning, Lucy pulled back from their kiss, her flawlessly groom fur now disheveled and drenched with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merveilleux, my dear sweet sheriff. Perhaps you aren't so hopeless after all...\" she chuckled before she sat up and slid over to the opposite end of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What... do ya want... with me...?\" Texas asked between pants as her conscious mind began to awaken from the pleasure induced trance she was just in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be perfectly honest? Nothing at all\" Lucy said as she stood to her feet. \"I told you, Miss Stanton. If you look past all my alleged wrongdoings, I've always been a hopeless romantic... and while I typically don't dabble with your sort, I can't help but find some allure in doing so. You, the fearless and uncompromising crime fighter, and me, the ravishing and wholly amoral temptress. We are opposites in every respect, yet when we are together, we make the sweetest of music~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas narrowed her eyes bitterly, but she couldn't bring herself to disagree. While she wasn't nearly as horrible as Vivian, the sinister madame embodied all the sheriff despised in people. Greedy, selfish, corruption and as she herself so eloquently put it, \"wholly immoral\". And there the weasel was, her body covered in overwhelming stench of sweat and sex as her body laid bare on the criminal's bed. She was no stranger to this type of scenario given the types of law breakers she faced on a regular basis, but this was far different. She <i>asked</i> for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all fine'n dandy... but what exactly are you gettin' at?\" Texas questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite clear, is it not? You and I will never be able to truly love one another due to our respective career paths. I do not intend retire my current business model... and as I understand it, you take issue with that. We are fated foes, you and I; cursed to constantly long for one another whilst we fight one another. It's almost poetic...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sensual skunk ceased her monologue for a moment, the look on her face becoming heated once more. She circled the bed like a predator scoping out her next meal and once she reached the top of Texas' head she knelt down to whisper softly into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of that said... I think there's some potential for a much more... intimate, relationship\" she cooed as she began to gently message Texas' shoulders. \"Always so tense, so rigid... playing peacekeeper leaves you with so little time for leisure. Wouldn't it be nice to have a place where you can unwind? A place where you can take off that silly little badge and let all your worries melt away...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas blinked and felt a lump forming in her throat. It didn't take a genius to figure out what Lucy was proposing, though she was having a hard time determining just how serious she was being. She was right about one thing: in Texas' line of work, she very rarely was given time to rest and recuperate. It was a price she was willing to pay for the sake of the good people of Gold Springs, but every now and again she would sit behind her desk and pine for a bit of free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you wanna be friends with benefits... am ah right?\" Texas asked as she peered up at the skunk with narrowed eyes. She tried her best to come off as indignant, but Lucy could practically feel the heat radiating off of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rather vulgar way of phrasing it... but you're not wrong\" Lucy tittered as she knelt down at the head of the bed, her arms wrapping around the sheriff's neck in an affectionate embrace. \"You're an inquisitive sort, Texas... and I am a woman who tends to be in the know of things. Of course, Mademoiselle Vivian frowns upon those with loose tongues, and I would <i>never </i>be so foolish as to feed her most hated enemy information... but if you ever find yourself straining to come up with any leads, I can use my skills to help you... clear your mind~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Never before had Texas felt so conflicted. Nothing good could come from fraternizing with someone of Lucy's ilk, no matter how amazing she was in bed. On top of the ever looming threat of her mind rotting gas, Texas also had to worry about the potential for blackmail. If it ever got out that she was sleeping with Vivian's second in command for information, she'd never live it down. She took in a deep breath, weighing out the pros and cons in her mind as Lucy patiently awaited her answer. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whether it was the honeyed words, the kissing or just straight up the mindblowing sex the weasel didn't know. But she knew one thing bitterly well. For all the long-winded rambling the skunk did have a point. Texas felt strangely relaxed against all odds. Even chained to her bed she felt at ease, as though she... trusted her? Lucy, of all people, managed to make her calm down. As reprehensible as she and her business were, the sheriff had to swallow her pride and admit what she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... ah accept. But just for tonight. Tomorrow ah got a deputy to find.\" She said with a timid voice. Lucy frowned a moment, but let out an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, there is no stopping your sense of righteousness, is there? Fine, I'll let you chase your little friend tomorrow, but tonight I shall command your attention.\" She strode towards the chained up weasel confidently. Texas felt a shiver of worry run down her spine as the skunk ran a slender finger down her cheek. Lucy dipped in for another passionate kiss, but she had so much more in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout breaking their kiss the skunk crawled onto the bed, sitting on all fours and looming over the weasel's chained up body. \"Oh, the things I could do...\" she murmured, daydreaming about her fantasies. She leaned down ever so slowly, her round belly and large breasts resting atop the weasel. Finally her passionate kiss came to an end and after a seductive wink the skunk let herself flop forward onto the weasel. The sudden increase in weight was offset by the two huge boobs sliding forward and surrounding the weasel's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, c'est bon Texas. Just hold still.\" Lucy moaned, stifling a giggle at the irony of asking the chained up weasel not to move. She could feel her squirming, twisting her head to try and escape. But Lucy's prodigious chest had effortlessly taken the sheriff's head into the depths of her cleavage. She played with her boobs, mashing them around the weasel's head and feeling her resistance fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell deep in the skunk's cleavage was uniquely musty, robbing the weasel of her breath. The soft globes were so much more overwhelming up close, pinning down her head between two fuzzy walls. It was hard to think straight for Texas. Not just because of the tight space, but also because she had a hard time grasping what the hell she was feeling. A strong part of her really didn't mind being in this position. She was fighting herself as much as she was fighting off the skunk's affections. The smothering breasts were soft beyond comparison and though they were squeezing her ever so gently, this really wasn't such a bad place to be. Maybe, in spite of how repugnant the skunk usually was, she had a point about being too tense. Maybe for once she could relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lucy finally lifted herself off the weasel there was a loud gasp for air. She just giggled and teased her. \"Many have called my assets breathtaking, but none quite so literal as you, Texas. Now just let me do what I do best and ease your mind.\" The weasel rolled her eyes. It wasn't like she was in a position anymore to stop the amorous skunk. For hours Lucy kissed every part of her, smothered her in adoration and let Texas return the favor by pushing every smelly corner of her body in the weasel's face. She held back just enough to ensure her lover would stay awake, but beyond that she gave her everything in the ways only a romantic like her would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning the weasel was the first to wake up. After only a few short hours of sleep following their long night of romance she was shocked to feel the shackles missing from her limbs. It would do her little good, as the skunk was still peacefully sleeping on top of her. Lucy's jaw hung open and her morning breath made the weasel's eyes water. She couldn't remember most of what happened last night, but the unsettling sensation that she liked it was very much present. Of all the people in town she didn't expect Lucy to be so enamored with her. Weirder yet was that in spite of her short rest she was feeling immensely well rested. She felt sharp and ready to retrieve April, even if it meant facing off against Molly. Her daydreams were cut short though when the skunk stirred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... That was... something else.\" She murmured and yawned, slowly sliding herself out of bed and stretching her limbs. The weasel breathed deeply with relief as the skunk's weight shifted off her, following Lucy's example and getting up herself. \"So... you're still going after your friend, aren't you?\" She asked coyly, hoping last night might've changed the weasel's mind. She knew it was a fool's hope against someone as stubborn as Texas, but there it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, ah can't tarry any longer. But uhm... for what it's worth, this was... nice. Ah'm hoping... maybe we can do it again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what you agreed on. I do hope you haven't forgotten our... arrangement. It would be a shame if others learned about last night.\" She said with a sly wink. Texas sighed grimly. She knew this would be part of the whole affair but it still didn't sit right with her to let Lucy have this kind of leverage. She nods to the skunk. \"Ah know. Le's hope there's still enough of me left after dealin with Molly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, about that...\" Lucy perked up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Lucy paused for a moment as she fished into her cleavage for a cigarette and a holder. Somehow the sheriff managed to miss it despite her face buried so deep in the skunk's generous bosom, but she could hardly be faulted for it. Anyone in her position would have a hard time focusing on anything other than trying to catch their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's been some talk amongst my girls about an underground passage not too far from here. More than a few vagabonds have been seen scuttling in and out of there from time to time\" she said before stopping to search her person for a lighter. Texas was quick to assist her as she walked over to her vest and fished out a matchbook. She tossed it over to Lucy who nodded in thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I would reprimand my staff for missing out on an opportunity to bring in potential patrons, but judging from what was said they don't strike me as the type of people that I want stinking up my fine establishment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas was half tempted to crack wise about a skunk criticizing another person's stench, but she thought better of it. Lucy wasn't the type to part with information easily, so she didn't want to run the risk of potentially offending her. Besides, she knew from experience just how wretched Molly and her crew smelled. The crazed rodent was one of the few people that the sheriff knew off that could potentially compete with Lucy in that department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't suppose yer girls would be able to go into greater detail?\" Texas asked with a sheepish smile. She already knew the answer, but there was to harm in asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd suppose correctly\" Lucy replied with smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas sighed and nodded. The seductive skunk had already given her more than enough information to work with. Find Molly's lair would take a bit more legwork than expected, but she was confident in her ability to succeed. She stopped herself just as she was about to leave as a thought came to mind. With all that passion and excitement, the subject of payment never once came up. She pulled a fistful of notes from her pocket and placed them on the nightstand beside Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have misunderstood my offer, mon amour. You are not here as a patron, but as a guest. <i>My</i> guest\" temptress cooed affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, ah can't really come to enjoy yer company if yer your business ain't doin' well\" Texas said as she put on her hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lucy flashed an amused smile in response. The sheriff's subtle jab at didn't escape her notice, but Lucy took no offense to it. If anything, it only further spurred her interest in the the noble peace keeper, that she would so casually flirt with danger by antagonizing a woman of her status. She shrugged tucked the money away in her cleavage before turning her attention back to the sheriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Stanton!\" She called as Texas was at the door. The weasel turned back and for a brief moment she could've sworn that she saw a hint of concern on Lucy's face. \"Try not to get yourself killed. It's bad for business\" she warned sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas stared back at her silently, drinking in the weight of her words. After a few seconds, she smiled and nodded before heading out and closing the door behind her. Lucy sat back down onto the bed and placed her cigarette into her mouth. In truth, it didn't really matter to her whether or not Texas came back safely, as she stood to benefit either way. If Texas won, she would be able to return for more fun. If she failed, than that made it all the most easy for Vivian to assert her authority over Gold Springs. If Lucy had to choose which outcome she preferred, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sighed and sat down onto the bed before placing the cigarette holder to her lips and lighting it. She looked down at the matchbox the sheriff and given her and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really must do something about this bad habit of mine...\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas regarded the staff with a polite tip of her hat, doing utmost to treat them with respect. The anger she felt towards them had faded into the ether, and while she didn't intend to turn a blind eye to their wrongdoings, she found herself more welcoming to their presence. Really, after the night she had there was no way they could gain any greater leverage over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excusez-moi, Mademoiselle!\" a small skunk called as she ran up with what appeared to be a small piece of candy in a white wrapper. \"Every patron is to be gifted with a complimentary mint. You almost left without yours!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas nodded and accepted the treat into her waiting palm before digging into her pocket and handing the skunk and coin. She'd dabbled with Lucy's sort enough times to understand how they operated. As she stepped outside, she unfurled the wrapper and as expected, there was a message written on the inside in tiny printed letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Go Right</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could've given me a better hint than that\" Texas huffed as she popped the mint into her mouth and tore up the wrapper.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though the skunk's vague instructions were hard to follow, eventually the sheriff located the crack in the wall that she had referred to. In it was a crude map of Silver Lakes with a red circle around one of the buildings. The weasel knew the main entrance to Molly's lair was in the sunken church tower. This was a different entrance. Hopefully that would allow her to sneak right past the guards. The voodoo rat on her own was already a formidable threat, she didn't need her goons to join in that fight as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully this'll work.\" Texas muttered to herself. A shiver ran down her spine at the thought of returning to Lucy after rescuing April. The skunk would no doubt expect some kind of gratitude. But there were worse things that could happen. If Molly got her ratty hands on the weasel there was a good chance she'd never leave Silver Lakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith renewed resolve the sheriff set off to the old town. Amidst the eerie smells of the bog that surrounded it she reached the half-sunken town of Silver Lakes. Texas felt an unnerving sense of dread weighing on her shoulders. Not many bandits could be said to intimidate the weasel, but Molly was one of them. Her unrelenting sadistic nature and the rumors of all the other lawbringers she had killed did little to calm the weasel's mind. But Texas had an advantage. She got off her horse a good distance outside of the town and carefully skulked towards the building marked on the map. She half expected it to be a dud, but to the weasel's greater surprise there actually was a trapdoor. Silently it swung open and the sheriff took a deep breath before going in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe narrow tunnel was barely lit or reinforced, a dangerous prospect in the loose soil of Silver Lakes. It was also free of any rats that might sound an alarm. The passage got so small she had to crawl on all fours to get through, but there was light at the end of the tunnel. Steadily the weasel kept going, hoping she would end up close to April. Suddenly she froze. Voices rang out at the end of the tunnel. If someone were to look in now the weasel would be utterly trapped. Texas held her breath, not daring to make a sound and hoping fiercely for the voices to leave. Eventually they passed on and the weasel crawled through the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel entrance was concealed by a large stockpile of crates, letting the weasel slip into the cavernous chamber undetected. She peeked over one of the crates and with a relieved smile saw April, chained to the wall. Her deputy looked haggard and exhausted, no doubt a result of Molly's cruelty, but she was still alive. On the far wall was a grim reminder of how lucky the red fox had been. Dozens of revolvers and badges from sheriffs and deputies, collected by Molly after she took them out. Not wanting their badges to join that collection, the weasel looked around for any guards. The large chamber appeared to be empty save for her and April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas didn't waste another second and scurried towards her deputy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A shiver ran down Texas' body as she her nose caught wind of a familiar stench. She could faintly hear the subtle treading off Molly's feet, a sound that she had grown to fear from her repeated encounters with the fiendish rodent. Her immediate reaction to hearing the noise was to look for a place to hide but before she could even survey the area, Molly stepped out of the tunnel and into the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Time seemed to come to a stand still as the two stared at each other. Molly didn't seem the least bit surprised by the Sheriff's presence in her lair, although that stemmed less from forward planning and more from her sadistic nature. Unlike the rest of the wrongdoers in Gold Springs, she was always happy to see the Sheriff. Whereas they saw Texas as a hindrance or a threat, Molly saw her as nothing more than a plaything. Her body language reflected this mindset as she advanced on the her with her tail swishing back and forth in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had known that I was going to have a guest, I would've tidied up a bit. No worries though... I've always been a good host, as your friend can attest to\" Molly snickered as her gaze turned to the beaten and weary deputy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya dun crossed the line this time, Molly! Takin' shots at me is one thing, but kidnappin' mah deputy? That's low, even for you!\" Texas growled as her hand slinked down to her gun holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you Texas, I can go much, much lower than that\" Molly said with a toothy grin as she gradually closed the distance between them. Texas narrowed her eyes and tightly gripped the handle of her pistol. She had a definite speed advantage, though that didn't mean much when facing off against a foe with access to such strange and mysterious abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm just here fer mah deputy, Molly. Let us go and there won't be no trouble\" the sheriff said in a firm, authoritative tone. Her demand was answered with an amused chuckle from the giant rodent as she continued stalking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just got here! I'd hate to see you leave so soon. I've spent the whole week thinking of some fun games we can play together...\" she said as she hungrily licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Texas shuttered before quickly freeing the gun from her holster and taking aim at Molly's face. The crazed rodent came to an immediate halt at the slight of the firearm, her smile waning ever so slightly. Her gaze never shifted from the weasel though, her eyes seeming to bore into the sheriff's soul. Texas wouldn't be intimidated as she stared her down. Molly large ears twitched slightly the sheriff cocked the hammer back on her pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme the key. <b>Now</b>\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly's sinister grin never left her face, even as she raised both her hands in a show of compliance. The two maintained their intense staredown as Molly reached into her cleavage and fished out the key. Texas gestured to the ground and she responded with a nod as she gently placed it onto the ground and took a step back. Texas nodded her approval and reached out with her foot to slide the key over to her, she didn't want to take her eyes off of the rodent even for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn't take long for Texas to find the lock, though feeling around for it while keeping Molly at bay proved difficult. Eventually her efforts bore fruit as April fell limply onto the ground. She didn't so much as stir the fall as she remained unconscious. Texas swiftly hoisted her onto her back and began to walking backwards in the direction she first arrived. Molly made no moves to stop her, though the sinister grin on her face continued to unease the sheriff. It wasn't at all like her to concede defeat, though she seemed to take all of this in stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn't take long for her to realize why.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Texas moved slowly, weighed down by April and not wanting to let that filthy rat out of her sights for even a moment. Molly was being downright unnerving right now. Why was she just standing there and letting them get away? There had to be some kind of scheme involved, but the weasel wasn't about to stick around and find out. Hopefully her deputy would come to her senses soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff's wish was granted as she felt some subtle movement coming from her friend. The fox shuddered a little, opening her eyes with a bemused groan. Slowly April looked around, gauging the situation. But when she saw the voodoo rat standing there she snapped into action. The deputy's eyes hazed over and she swung her arm at the weasel's, knocking the gun from her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April! What in the- oof!\" Texas gasped as the fox swung a knee into her chest. She let her deputy fall to the ground, desperate to grab her pistol before Molly could make a move. April gave chase, slamming into the weasel and knocking her down. The deputy flailed at the revolver, smacking it across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into you, dammit!\" The sheriff snapped as she tried to wrestle her deputy into submission. But the fox didn't say a word. As she finally looked April in the eye it became clear what was happening. Her vacant stare prompted Texas to look over to her nemesis. Molly still stood there, but a huge smug grin had curled up onto her face. The fat rat still held up her hands, but she was waving her fingers, wisps of dark purple smoke swirling between them. As she saw the weasel realize what happened, she burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, go on little sheriff. Fight for your freedom! Or maybe the things she's been whispering to me are true... Maybe you aren't as good of a fighter as you like to boast about. Wouldn't be the first thing she griped about either...\" Molly crowed. Those words stung the weasel. Not just because April was under her spell, but because apparently her deputy thought so low of her. Though knowing Molly it might all be just a big fat lie. Nevertheless, she wasn't going to escape this predicament with her friend pinning her down. Texas whispered to herself that the fox would understand later and took a big swing, knocking April off balance. The weasel pushed herself free, putting up her fists to prepare for the next attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril didn't hesitate to charge again, flailing her arms at her friend. Her swings were powerful, but clumsy. Clearly the voodoo rat was using her as a puppet. With all that said and done, the weasel still found herself having to back out of those wild haymakers. All the while she tried to break the spell by appealing to her deputy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon April, fight it. This ain't you. Ah know yer in there somewhere!\" The weasel's impassioned pleas seemed to work, slowing the wild swings down, but in that time she'd conceded enough ground to find herself on the other side of the room again. Worse yet, she'd completely lost track of Molly being forced to focus on her deputy. The fat rat chuckled. One more step and the weasel would've bumped into her big gut. Still, more than close enough for her next move. Texas snaps around, hearing that laughter coming from uncomfortably close by and seeing a fuzzy wall of rat belly. She looks up to see Molly reaching down and grabbing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurple smoke dances around the weasel's head as the voodoo rat whispers in an incomprehensible language. The weasel's arms fall limp. Behind her April was no longer under Molly's direct control. She fell to the ground, exhausted and dazed. Texas' mind was swimming, overwhelmed with sensations. The rat's hands felt like they were trying to squeeze her skull out of her head, the spell adding an oppressive amount of heat as it pried into her thoughts. Her resistance slowly faded away as her vision blurred and cleared at the same time. For a moment she felt weightless until finally reality reassembled itself before her and she came crashing back down to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox deputy watched Molly lift the sheriff up by her head and slam her into the ground. With a curious smirk the voodoo rat stood back, eager to see the result of her spell.</span></div></div>",

Let's draw up a contract, shall we? I use my powers to get you Texas, and you agree to keep her out of the hair of the criminals of Gold Springs. Do we have a deal?\" She asks with an outstretched hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" April says with assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then planned out everything. April's disappearance, \"leaking\" information about the secret passage to Lucy's girls, and temporarily hypnotizing April for a fistfight. It all went down like clockwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas had now crawled on top of April and the two began to kiss, April moaning as she felt Texas' lips against her own for the first time. They felt even better than she imagined. She broke the kiss to talk to Molly, letting the mind altered Texas kiss her cheek over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do have some skill with that voodooo.\" She comments as she holds her new lover close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there ever any doubt? And as for your part of our deal...?\" Molly hints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we're back in Gold Springs, I'll have Texas sign a formal resignation letter from the sheriff's office. We'll go live a quiet life in the countryside and be out of your hair.\" April confirms as she and Texas begin to stand up and leave. \"Pleasure doing business with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut is that the end of it for Molly?</span></div></div>",

As the two walked out of her lair, her smile faded and her face became serious. It took some effort for her to keep from attacking the two on the way out, but something didn't quite sit right with her. She knew little about the deputy as the focus of her ire laid squarely on Texas. That said, she still had eyes and ears all over the town. Her minions described April as a sycophant who very much shared her employer's sense of righteousness. The woman that came to her didn\u2019t at all reflect that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twisted rat walked over to her favorite chair and sat down to further ponder over what had taken place. She wanted to be happy about not having the sheriff in her hair anymore, but she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was amiss with April. It wasn\u2019t any concern of hers of course, but her controlling nature required her to constantly be in the know of things. She drummed her fingers on her armrest as she tried to think of a scenario that could potentially explain the deputy\u2019s odd behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mulling it over for a few minutes, she found her answer. It was an absurd conclusion that most rational thinking people wouldn\u2019t come to, but that didn\u2019t apply to someone like her. A wicked smile spread along her face as she practically leapt from her seat and let out a piercing whistle. In a matter of seconds, her minions were standing before her, their dirt smeared faces mirroring their leader\u2019s crazed enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, guys. We\u2019re going on a little trip\u2026\u201d she chuckled darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut your back into it, you slobs!\u201d Penelope ordered snippidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer servants didn\u2019t so much as complain as they struggled to carry her caravan through the busy streets of Gold Springs. Their thin frames were ill-suited for such an arduous task, but that wouldn\u2019t stop them from trying. They were utterly devoted to their demeonering master, caring little of the odd looks they were receiving from onlookers. Penelope sighed and leaned back in her seat as her slaves slowly trekked along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I have no one to blame but myself. If I wanted stronger servants, I should\u2019ve hypnotized buffier folk\u201d she muttered. Her twisted sense of humor was what caused her to target people with smaller builds. It was amusing to watch them suffer the weight of her caravan just to please her, though the joke wore itself thin whenever she had places to be. She was already in a sour mood due to her lack of customers, so all she wanted was to get back to her tent and unwind with some pampering from her servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time for them to arrive at their destination, though something seemed amiss to Penelope. She had left the flap of her tent closed when she left, yet it was wide open and wafting in the breeze. Her nose curled slightly, as a tangy odor wafted from the inside. Had some smelly vagrant broken into her home while she was gone? If so, she would see to that they were thoroughly punished. Perhaps she would hypnotize them into going over to Mayor Vivian\u2019s home and slapping her across the face. Then again, that might\u2019ve been too cruel even by her standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou. Go see if anyone\u2019s in my home\u201d she commanded one of her cronies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man nodded and rushed to fulfill his master\u2019s wish, though Penelope had chosen poorly the person to send as he was the main support holding her caravan up. Once he was gone, the whole thing came crashing down on top of the rest of the group, crushing him flat in an instant. Penelope let out a startled squeal as she was jostled out of her seat and set tumbling to the ground. She huffed and stood up before brushing herself off and turning her attention back to her servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re all fired! Letting a sweet little thing like me touch the ground\u2026 you\u2019re useless, the whole lotta ya!\u201d she yelled as she kicked dirt into the nearest one\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Penelope, there\u2019s no one in here!\u201d the young man called from the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope stuck her tongue out at her flattened servants before making her way over to her home. The smell only intensified with each step she took, so she was quick to conclude that someone had indeed barged into her home uninvited. She could only hope that they didn\u2019t go digging through her personal belongings. Even someone like her had precious memorabilia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped inside the tent and froze that the being that greeted her. Standing before her was what had to have been the largest rat she\u2019d ever seen in her life. Her eyes trailed along her impossibly huge body and down to her once loyal servant who was happily licking the rodent\u2019s feet clean. Penelope didn\u2019t need to guess what had happened. She was very much intuned with the supernatural and standing before this stranger, her intuition was telling her that she was someone immense power. The rabbit tried to back away, but was halted as her back hit a fuzzy wall. She could feel the presence of several other rats standing behind her, though she wasn\u2019t sure just how they were able to sneak up on her so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing the danger these strangers presented, Penelope reacted in the only way she knew how once it became clear that her powers of hypnosis was ineffective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, friends! I wasn\u2019t expecting any guests, but I\u2019m more than happy to accommodate!\u201d Penelope proclaimed with much grandiosity. She walked over and sat down on the seat cushion by her firepit. The giant rat watched with an unchanging grin as she quickly placed a kettle on the fire and prepared some herbal tea. \u201cCome, sit! You must be tired after such a long journey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly\u2019s minions were bewildered at the rabbit\u2019s cordial demeanor. How could she be so formal with their master, a woman whose very name struck fear into the hearts of all who knew of her horrible deeds? Molly knew better though. Penelope hid it well, but she couldn\u2019t mask the stench of overwhelming fear wafting off of her. It was the sinister rodent\u2019s favorite scent, just barely beating the smell of her own musk. She humored her as she sat down beside the rabbit, the impact of her descent shaking the ground as her massive ass annihilated the cushion beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have chamomile tea if that\u2019s your preference. Or do you fancy something with more of a kick? Some peppermint with a lemon twist would be right up your alley! O-or maybe you\u2019d like some\u2026 g-ginger\u2026 tea\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope\u2019s calm facade faded rather quickly as Molly\u2019s eyes seemed to bore into her very soul. Her very presence was sending off warning signals in the rabbit\u2019s head, telling her that at any moment, this strange being would reduce her to a smear underneath her titanic rear end. Her nervousness was on full display as she struggled to pour herself a cup, her hands shaking violently and threatening to spill the hot water onto her lap. She froze as Molly reached down and plucked the tin cup from her hand. It looked laughably small in her meaty fingers though it was obvious that she was accustomed to such a thing.<br>\r\nPenelope watched in stunned silence as she tossed the entire tin into her mouth, not so much as blinking as the hot liquid touched her tongue. She chewed it thoroughly before swallowing it whole. After witnessing such a surreal display, Penelope let out a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-more of a c-c-coffee d-drinker, I see\u2026\u201d she joked, her voice coming out in a fearful squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite the talented enchanter, aren't you?\u201d Molly spoke suddenly, startling the rabbit. \u201cYou placed quite the powerful spell on the deputy. It even fooled me at first. That\u2019s not an easy feat\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope blinked and looked up at her guest with a raised brow. How did she even know about her past dealings with a sheriff? Indeed, she had approached April and used her abilities on her, though it was more on a whim than anything else. The sheriff had slapped her with a fine for having her caravan station out in front of the bank and she had later hypnotized her deputy for the sake of petty revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho, April? I just told her to get a life and quit being the deputy\u2019s professional lapdog. That\u2019s all I did\u201d she said bitterly she poured herself another cup of tea. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you came here for a reason pertaining to her? What, did she like, come over and beg to be your slave or something? You\u2019d be amazed at how many folks secretly want to be someone else\u2019s property\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe came to me and brokered a deal to get rid of the sheriff. Seems like she\u2019s been pining for her for some time and she wanted me to cast a spell that would make her reciprocate those feelings. I thought it was pretty unusual, but what really made me question it was how she described Texas. \u2018smug, arrogant, and thinks she\u2019s above it all\u2019 were her exact words\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope blushed and rubbed her arm in embarrassment. Texas\u2019 fine had left her feeling more than a little sour as she brought the deputy under her thrall. Little did she know, her angered ranting had taken root in April\u2019s mind. All April\u2019s talk of Texas being a paper tiger and being all talk was a result of Penelope accidentally planting such thoughts into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, maybe I might\u2019ve let some stuff slip when I was doing the deed. What of it?\u201d she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly grinned and leaned down, her crazed, bloodshot eyes sending chills down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d she asked with a sneer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm not a fan of being used for someone else's dirty work.\" Molly spoke slowly and threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat rat had little patience for the machinations of people like Penelope or Vivian. Texas was hers to deal with and anybody that got in her way would rue the day they were born. And if they felt she was taking too much time scheming and not enough time dealing with the weasel she would send them a chilling message to stay out of her way, usually by making some of their henchmen disappear. With her temper already frayed she furrowed her brow even more when the rabbit started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about? I put a spell on April, not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, and you didn't think I'd notice?\" A scowl formed on Molly's face. Was Penelope really going to lie about her actions right to her face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notice what? You being your paranoid self again?\" The rabbit snapped back, trying her best to keep her nerves in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of all the ways April could've done this, she went straight for the single most dangerous adversary in a thousand mile radius. So many others would happily play along, but I could just as easily have dismissed her deal and killed her. She's smart enough to know that too. But something in her made her come to me. And I'll be damned if it was her own volition. Which leads me back to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope gulped. She didn't like where this was going, but she had nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a reputation to keep up, so you can't exactly go around dispatching lawbringers, even in these parts. So you figured why not send those two idiots to Molly. She wouldn't mind adding some more marks to her tally, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wanted them to kill themselves by your hand, why would I have April try to make a deal with you? Why not send her your way begging to be snuffed out?\" The rabbit stammered, but Molly's glare just got fouler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you knew I'd be suspicious to say the very least if that were to happen. This way you hoped your interference would go unnoticed. And because I bet you let Vivian in on this little scheme too. What's the reward, hm? The sheriff's office? You get all the benefits while I clean up the mess for you. Well, don't you worry your fluffy little head any longer. I'll make sure you won't need to deal with this mess for another minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypnotist breathed a sigh of relief before realizing Molly's intent. The fat rat stood up and let rip a monstrous fart. Even her rats struggled to keep the entrance blocked whilst Penelope nearly doubled over. The rabbit fell to the ground, staring up at the rat now looming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea always gives me the worst gas...\" Molly chuckled darkly before turning around and presenting her enormous backside to the downed rabbit. Penelope's eyes grew wide and she tried to crawl to safety, but it was far too late. With a large <i>WHUMP</i> Molly sat herself down. The hypnotist's scrawny frame disappeared completely underneath the blubbery mass. Subtle squelches could be heard as Penelope was squashed flat beneath the fat rat's domineering butt. Several more small farts escaped, adding to the rabbit's overwhelming misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rat sat there doing what she was most feared for doubts began to spring up. What if Penelope was right and this was all just a huge coincidence? With a smile Molly shrugged those thoughts away. So what if she didn't orchestrate April's actions, right now this was just fun to do. But mere casual cruelty didn't feel like enough yet. It was time to send Gold Springs a terrifying reminder of what happens when you mess with the voodoo rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypnotist rabbit was given a small reprieve when the massive mountaint of assflesh lifted up. For a moment it felt like she would be plastered to it, squashed into a barely recognizable sheet. But soon after she was presented with perhaps the only thing more terrifying than Molly's rear: The rat's twitching asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly parted her asscheeks wide, their lardy mass no longer concealing her backdoor. Tattooed on each asscheek was a tally. Deputies on the left, sheriffs on the right. Each mark representing the end of another lawbringer. Penelope wouldn't even be worth counting in this grisly scoreboard, but the voodoo rat was going to savour this moment all the same. She aimed as best she could and sat down again, the fetid hole pushed right up against the rabbit's squashed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the darkness underneath the rat's butt Penelope couldn't see a thing, but she knew what was ahead of her. A rancid tunnel full of the worst stench imaginable. Molly reached down into her asscrack and began to push the flattened rabbit inside. Bit by bit the squashed body of Penelope was crammed into the horrifying passage. After a while the voodoo rat's bowels seemed to try and assist in the cruel act, pulling the hypnotist in deeper. In mere minutes there wasn't a trace left of Penelope and with a satisfied smile the fat rat stood up. She would never again be bothered by the hypnotist's crazy schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Penelope's followers were slowly waking up. Being 'fired' and their mistress' waning power led to them steadily regaining their bearings. The first thing they did with their newfound free will was scatter in all directions when Molly came out of the tent. The voodoo rat was unconcerned by them. She had her sights set elsewhere.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Destroying Texas would take a backseat for the time being. It was imperative to Molly that she seek out the perpetrator of this scheme and punish them for their hubris. Granted, she had no real way of knowing whether or not the mayor was involved in Penelope\u2019s pathetic ploy, but there was no harm in checking. Well\u2026 no harm to <i>her</i> at least. She stomped away from the tent, her minions tailing behind in manic glee. When their master was on the warpath, nothing short of divine intervention could save the poor soul unfortunate enough to cross her path. Regardless of the mayor\u2019s innocence, they were going to see a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow April, are you sure about this? Once it\u2019s signed, there\u2019s no turning back\u201d Vivian asked the smiling deputy with frained concern. In her hand she held a letter of resignation, signed by both Texas and April. All that was needed to make it official was for it to be signed and notarized by the mayor herself. As happy as it made the corrupt mynx, she wanted to test the waters a bit and gauge just how dead set April was about retiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all fine, Miss Vivian. I know we\u2019ve had our differences in the past, but me and Texas are ready to move on from all that. This job has taken its toll on the both of us and we wanna enjoy each other\u2019s company while we\u2019ve still got our health, ya know?\u201d she said with a weary smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 if that\u2019s what you two want, I see no reason to stop you\u201d Vivian said with a heavy sigh before signing her name and stamping her approval onto the letter. She could barely contain her mirth, but she managed to keep a straight face as they shook hands and April exited her office. After all the time and money she\u2019d spent in trying to get rid of those two busybodies, they just up and quit. Not only that, but they sign a contract that keeps them from ever returning to their posts! Once she was sure the former deputy was out of hearshot, she let out an ecstatic cry and threw her hands into the air in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve waited so long for this day\u2026! It\u2019s a shame that I couldn\u2019t have done the two in myself though\u2026 ah well. Maybe some other bleeding heart lawman will try to pick up the slack. Speaking of which\u2026\u201d she trailed off as she reached into the nearest cabinet for a form she\u2019d been saving for this very occasion. It was a form that when enacted, would appoint Georgia as Gold Spring\u2019s new sheriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d better send word to that meathead before people start causing a ruckus\u201d she said as she walked over to her door and peeked her head out to the hall leading to the front desk. \u201cSusan! Sent a word out to Georgia that I need her in my office ASAP! Tell her it\u2019s a matter of her promotion!\u201d she shouted before shutting her door. In her excitement, she didn\u2019t bother waiting for her secretary call back with her usual response of \u201cright away, Miss Vivian\u201d. Had she done so, her response would\u2019ve been met with silence as her secretary wasn\u2019t at her post. <br>\r\n The poor woman had no time to prepare as she grabbed  from her seat and tossed to the ground, her face quickly being buried deep in the sweaty asscrack of one of Molly\u2019s large bottomed minions. The only warning she heard was a subtle creak a minute after April had left and shut the door behind her. She had looked up and was confused to find the door slightly agape, her nose curling at the pungent odor that suddenly appeared. After that, everything went black and she woke up to the nightmarish hell of stinking rat ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While she was enduring this torment, her employer was hard at work thinking up new ways to profit off of her sudden good fortune. There were a number of good business ventures that she had hoped to dip her toe into, but Texas had the eyes of a hawk and could spot chicanery a mile away. With her out of the picture, her future prospects were looking brighter than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her enthusiasm wasn\u2019t to last, however. Her enthusiasm was dropped in an instant as an unfamiliar feeling washed over her. Those who knew Vivian were well aware of how dangerous she was and one of the things that made her so dangerous was her completely unflappable nature. Her pride in her own criminal genius was such that she always maintained her cool, even in the most tense situations. That said, it was hard to fight one\u2019s innate instincts when faced with overwhelming peril. The mayor was experiencing such a moment, her body rigid and sweat pouring from her brow as her heart raced. She could feel it. Danger was present in the room with her and it wasn\u2019t something that she could easily think her way out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Summoning all the bravery she could muster, the mayor slowly walked over to her desk and took a seat, her eyes shut for a moment as she took in a deep breath. Her nose curled at the horrendous scent that had suddenly appeared in her office, but she remained stoic despite it. She couldn\u2019t show weakness. She couldn\u2019t show that she was afraid. She opened her eyes and was unsurprised to the hulking rodent known as Molly sitting across from her, her enormous rear crushing the chair beneath her into pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume you have a good reason for being here\u201d Vivian stated, her voice smooth and calm. Acting too tough would only serve to annoy Molly and capitulating would insite her sadistic bloodlust. Good or bad, the rodent was looking for a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing more than a hunch, really. Someone stuck their nose into my business. I don\u2019t care for that\u201d Molly said as her crazed eyes bore into the mayors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you believe that I\u2019m involved?\u201d Vivian asked as she met her gaze with unwavering stoicism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s just a hunch. The thing is, my hunches are never wrong. Well\u2026 save for that one time\u2026 see, I had a hunch that I could drive a man to madness by farting in his face for an hour\u2026\u201d she said before slowly leaning in, her cruel smirk widening into a frightening smile. \u201cIt only took ten minutes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive\u201d Vivian said before standing up from her desk and walking over to the window overlooking the town. Molly assumed that she was about to take her chances jump, but the mynx was simply retrieving a half empty glass of whiskey that she had left unattended. Her brazen display left the sinister rat rather bemused. She was certain that her cool and calm demeanor was nothing more than an act, but even she had to be impressed with her ability to maintain it in the face of impending doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s say that I am involved\u201d Vivian began after taking a swig of her glass. \u201cI assume your reaction would be to either snuff me out or torture me for weeks until I\u2019m begging to have my life ended. Am I right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you\u2019re familiar with my work then\u201d Molly said with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Your name carries a lot of weight around these parts. A kill count of law enforcers well into the double digits and the only person in the history of Gold Springs to have ever been deemed \u2018too dangerous to pursue.\u2019 Not many criminals can boast the record you possess\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlattery with get you nowhere, mayor~\u201d Molly said with an unsettling giggle. Her smile widened and her eyes narrowed as she leaned against the desk. \u201cAlthough that brings me back to the hypothetical you put forth. You know who I am, you know what I do, and yet you saw fit to try and make me a cog in your insipid little plan.

The rodent cast an enormous shadow over her and she could see the eagerness in her eyes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The slightest of smiles slipped onto Vivian's expression as the door to her office burst open and a dozen of her helpers stormed in. For the first time she saw genuine surprise on Molly's face. Even with all her voodoo mystics she didn't see this one coming it would seem. But the mayor was prepared and ready to act. It was easy to think that the sly lynx had been outmaneuvered, but she always had a backup plan ready. She did few things idly, and drinking whiskey was not among them. Her henchmen had kept a close eye on the window of her office, checking at all times for a sign. Half a glass of booze meant danger, finishing the drink meant attack now. And so they had charged, subduing the rat's minions through sheer numbers and entering the office to even the odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what it's worth, I didn't have anything to do with those two dunderheads seeking you out. I don't know what possessed them, but I'll gladly profit of the situation. But since you do not seem to be interested in reason, we'll have to do this the hard way.\" Vivian sneered, watching Molly's anger grow. The voodoo rat was ready to decimate that arrogant bitch, but the sounds of a dozen boots storming towards her demanded her more immediate attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You picked the wrong fight.\" She spoke, a second deep voice echoing alongside hers. It sent a shiver of fear down the rats' spines, but they were more afraid of what Vivian did to dissenters. Molly would soon fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first rat lunged at her, brandishing a knife. With reflexes far faster than anyone would expect from someone as fat as Molly she grabbed him out of the air. The voodoo rat easily stood three times as tall as the struggling mook, lifting him up high for all to see. Then she dropped him to the ground, only to swing her huge gut forwards. With a massive dry slap the rotund belly slammed into the falling rat, launching it back to the office entrance. The heavy impact propelled him with enough force to crash right through the door, leaving it in splinters and the rat unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others all drew their guns, but Molly raised her hands towards them. She let out a lengthy burp, seemingly speaking some dark language at the same time. The henchmen watched in horror as the barrels of their weapons began to droop, the metal turning as soft as butter in their hands. By now their spirits were beginning to waver, but they knew Vivian's punishment for their failure was even steeper than this. They stood the line, rushing the voodoo rat in an attempt to overwhelm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pitiful.\" Molly sneered, grabbing the frontrunner of this valiant charge and lifting him to her face. She unleashed another burp on the squirming figure, making him twitch and convulse, before throwing him aside. The henchman curled up on the floor, shivering and crying in the fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next rat in her grasp was wedged beneath her armpit and left to marinate in her vile sweat whilst the fat rat worked on the others. Inflicting nightmares one at a time would take too long. She needed something to deal with all of them right now. A cruel smirk spread from ear to ear as Molly plucked a feather from her hat. Darkness enveloped her fingers, siphoning into the mundane feather and infusing it with unknown energies. She flung her weapon into the middle of the room where it stuck into the floorboards like an arrow. The henchmen all took an apprehensive step back before the feather began to hum, radiating with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really fucked up now!\" She cackled sadistically. The strange voodoo was drawing the rats towards it. Not through seduction, but by sheer force. They tried to resist and run, but the tenebrous aura pulled them closer. None were spared, not even the rat that was incapacitated by the door or the whimpering mess in the corner. All were drawn together into a squirming heap. Molly walked up to her pile of victims and laughed. She threw the one she had wedged under her arm in with the rest. The henchmen began to squeak for mercy when she turned around and presented her enormous ass to them. It became chillingly clear what she had in mind and none of them could stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole building shook as Molly slammed her ass down, squashing all of the scrawny henchmen at once. Slowly she ground her butt from side to side, producing a wet squelch as the mass of flattened rat moved beneath her. She forcefully rubbed them into the floorboards. When she stood up the rats were a uniform mass of grey, their terrified eyes floating on top and staring silently as the voodoo rat was eager to dispense more punishment. Molly jumped up as far as her powers could carry her enormous mass and crashed down on the henchmen again. This was no longer a fight, this was just to sate her sadistic urges and to send a message to all who might think about opposing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor below her creaked, the thick wooden structure struggling to deal with the impact of literal tons of ass. One last time Molly got up and jumped onto her victims. But that was too much. The floorboards bent and splintered, sending the rat and squashed pile of henchmen tumbling down to the ground floor. Vivian's assistant had already cleared the building and most of the voodoo rat's minions were out of the way when they saw the cracks forming in the ceiling above them. The fall did little to hurt Molly, but her victims were given another torturous squashing. Even the fat rat felt that it was getting a bit gratuitous, but as her evil desires were slaked her attention was drawn back to something else. Where the hell was Vivian?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a...\" Molly growled. She had fallen for the most simple diversion there was. The lynx had snuck out during her playtime with those pathetic henchmen. By now she was probably on a horse and putting as much distance between the two of them as possible. As punishment she let out a horrifying fart onto the rats beneath her. Whether the mayor had anything to do with these dealings didn't matter anymore. She would see that damn bitch suffering and begging for mercy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Molly\u2019s thick tail lashed about violently, destroying every piece of furniture in her immediate vicinity as her eye twitched in an erratic manner. In her haste to punish the mayor, she had underestimated her craftiness. Now she was stuck with no leads and her minions were in no condition to perform their usual duties, the collapsing of the ceiling leaving them trapped in the rubble. The malicious rat wouldn\u2019t be deterred as once someone was in her sights, she would chase them down the ends of the earth until they were no more. Still, without the aid of her minions, tracking Vivian down would take more time than she was willing to spare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just when it seemed that all was lost, she was hit with a sudden spark of inspiration. From the corner of her eye, she found a tattered photo laying in the ruins of the waiting area. It was a profile shot of the former sheriff Texas, her smiling face lying in the center of a dart board. A crazed grin spread along her face and without a moment of hesitation, she stormed out of the mayor\u2019s office and into the streets. All onlookers were quick to scatter at the mere sight of her. Luckily for them, she only had on destination in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAh\u2019m really gonna miss this place. Had a lotta good memories sittin\u2019 in this here chair\u201d Texas said as she rubbed her hand across her desk. Her and April had gone to work cleaning out their office of their belongings and making sure that it was prepped and ready for their eventual replacements. She had been reluctant to leave at first given how long she\u2019d resided their, though Vivian had been kind enough to provide the two of them with suitable housing on a decent sized plot of land as a gesture of good will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, like the time Georgia had her goons stuff you into the seat padding?\u201d April called from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey, ah never said they were all good\u201d Texas called back with a chuckle. Even her most horrid of memories seemed quaint in hindsight. She thought back to all the times she had been stomped on, chewed up, sat on, and flattened, and all she could do was smile. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to feel any negative emotions regarding all of that. After all, it did lead her to working with the woman she loved more than anything in the world. How, she wondered, did it take her so long to realize how she really felt about her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A familiar scent brought her back to the present. It was a nose curling odor that made her fair stand on end, and yet\u2026 she found it oddly intoxicating. She turned and was pleasantly surprised to find Molly standing inches away from her. The rat\u2019s hex had completely taken root in her brain even on a subconscious level, as evidenced by her lack of fear as she stared up at the being that once inspired great fear in her. In her warped mind, Molly was the kind and lovely soul who had given her the push she needed in order to get her life on the right track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, hey there Mistress. Sorry fer the mess. We\u2019re tryin\u2019 ta get our stuff so we can head on outta here\u201d she said as she gestured to the half full box on the ground. She was so far gone that she didn\u2019t even take notice to the title she had assigned to the evil rodent. Molly grinned and gave her a pat on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cForgive my intrusion, but I\u2019m in need of your services. You\u2019re well acquainted with the mayor, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked in a mockingly sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cO\u2019course! Ah been chasin\u2019 Vivian for so long ah almost know her better than the back o\u2019 mah hand\u201d Texas joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIs that right?\u201d Molly asked as her eyes lit up. \u201cThen you would be able to find her for me, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, sure! Ah\u2019d be happy to help ya!\u201d the former sheriff said cheerfully. \u201cAh need to go pay her a visit m\u2019self. We had a long history o\u2019 bein\u2019 at each other\u2019s necks and ah think it\u2019s only right that ah go an\u2019 make amends\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUh huh, that\u2019s real nice\u201d Molly said with a wave of her hand. \u201cNow get to work sniffing her out for me\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her rude and dismissive tone went completely over Texas\u2019 head as she walked over to the door. \u201cApril, ah\u2019m steppin\u2019 out for a minute! Don\u2019t wait up!\u201d she shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright! Just make sure you\u2019re home for dinner!\u201d her lover shouted back from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly licked her lips hungrily as followed the enthralled weasel, paying little mind to her inane prattling as they traveled together. As amusing as it was to see her former foe being beholden to her whim, she couldn\u2019t quite get over the fact that her current state of mind was the result of Penelope interfering with her affairs. Once Vivian was accounted for, perhaps she would snuff them both out simultaneously. Then again, maybe she could tweak her hex to make both Texas and April loyal slaves. When they weren\u2019t being used to sate her twisted desires, they would aid her in tracking down other wannabe lawmen. Molly shelved those thoughts for another time. She had plenty of time to consider options while she was torturing Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The issue was finding the crafty lynx. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, here it is.\" The weasel declared, pointing at a large mansion. It couldn't have been more than a few miles away from Gold Springs, situated among the many farms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? This close to town?\" Molly muttered, surprised by the mayor's audacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vivian don't last long in places where she ain't in control. So even if she's fixin to skip town, she won't go far.\" Texas responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess that saves me a long chase. Now run along, little weasel, I've got some unfinished business to attend to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hol' on, ya wanna jus' storm the place? Bad idea. Ah've been in there and that mansion's a maze of secret passages an hidden rooms. And in them hidden spaces there's a small army of henchmen waitin for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I could use some new minions...\" Molly spoke slowly, her voice filled with malice and glee. Whatever traps Vivian had laid out in that mansion, they would not survive contact with an enemy like the voodoo rat herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah mean it, Mistress, it's dangerous.\" The weasel wanted to elaborate further, but Molly shot her a vicious icy glare, making her fall silent. Her eyes widened at the horrors haunting her mind and she quickly turned around, got back on her horse and left the fat rat alone. Molly smirked. As fun as it was to instill nightmares in the weasel, she had some vengeance to enact. Her first mark was the lone lookout standing outside. He peered into the distance, keeping his rifle at the ready. The unfortunate henchman never bothered looking behind him as a wisp of smoke rose up from the ground. It solidified into a narrow tentacle, lashing towards him and wrapping tightly around his neck. He couldn't call out or sound the alarm. All he could do was watch Molly emerge from behind some shrubs and calmly walk towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rat henchman knew what had happened to his colleagues in town. How the voodoo rat had squashed all of them with ease. And now that monster was coming for him. He tried aiming his rifle towards her, but her overwhelming aura of terror made him drop his weapon. He was shivering and shaking by the time she got close enough for him to smell the pungent odour radiating off her body. The vile stench got worse and worse until her huge, sweaty asscheeks loomed over him blocking out the sun. Molly simply sat down, letting out a surprised moan as she had aimed herself better than expected. She had planned to just flatten the insignificant little henchman and move on, but judging by the wet slurping noise that came from behind he'd gone right up her ass. His futile resistance was amusing. He'd share the same fate as Penelope, trapped in the foulest hell imaginable until Molly would see fit to snuff them out for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... good start.\" She mused to herself, feeling the last of the henchman get pulled inside as she stood up. Next on her agenda were the stables. She didn't want the mayor to race off again on a horse, so she'd ensure there were no horses available. The large barn was quite far removed from the mansion, presumably to make sure Vivian wouldn't be bothered by the smell or the noise. It made it easy for the fat rat to sneak towards it. Outside the main door was a guard. Inside a stable hand or something, since the guard seemed to be talking to someone. Seizing upon this distraction, Molly quickly closed the distance, her powers hiding her earth-shakingly heavy sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think it's for real? Texas resigning an' all that?\" The distracted guard spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, that damn weasel's gonna be back, just you watch. I bet this is all some kinda ruse.\" The stable hand responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, she thinks she can fool Vivian? Tha's a goo~ <i>hrk</i>\" His words were cut short when Molly's hand wrapped around his neck. The voodoo rat walked inside, holding the struggling scrawny henchman in front of her like a trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim? You okay there?\" The stable hand asked, unsure why the guard stopped short. His jaw soon dropped in terror as the fat rat came in holding his friend. The horses too panicked, seemingly able to sense the overwhelming amounts of spite and malice coursing through her. Before any alarms could be rang Molly clenched her teeth and produced a loud fart. She held her trophy near her ass to let the fumes to their work and in no time he'd fallen limp. She discarded the unconscious body, laughing maniacally as the stable hand fell too. One by one the horses began to panic, but Molly was unfazed. She simply sauntered over to the main door and shoved it open. Sunlight flooded in whilst the green haze of her farts dissipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one she opened the stables for each horse, letting the animals run off. They didn't hesitate for a moment, eager to escape the cruel, smelly rat. Only one horse was left, but this one was special. It reeked of sweat. This was the horse that Vivian used to escape. This one wouldn't get off so easily. Molly opened the door, but blocked the animal's escape with her wide frame. She entered the small room, grabbing the horse's leads. With nowhere else to go she pinned it against a wall, her fat ass easily large enough to subdue it. The cruel rat then crawled onto its back, the horse's legs nearly giving out immediately. Normally her voodoo powers would assist any horse tasked with carrying her, but that kind of support was nowhere to be found now. Instead she added to the torment by scooting forward and wrapping her thighs around the horse's neck. She gave it a squeeze, slowly choking the animal out until it too had fallen unconscious. A fitting punishment for aiding Vivian in her mind. She stood towering over the unconscious horse, leaning down to whisper in its ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Vivian ever comes near, you know what to do.\" She spoke softly, a small wisp of purple smoke leaving her lips and entering the horse's ear. With her curse in place Molly felt confident in having her victim cut off and trapped in the mansion. Now there was simply the task of dealing with Vivian and her house of tricks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Confident as she was in her dark powers, Molly resisted the temptation to simply storm through the mansion in search for her prey. She had made the mistake of underestimating Vivian's cunning and as a result, her cabal of loyal servants were leave indisposed. A minor setback, one that her mind enslaving magics could easily rectify, but it was a reminder of how even the smallest slip-up on her part could grant the mayor a chance to escape again. Molly was deranged, but she never made the same mistake twice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The massive rodent stomped over to the unconscious stable hand with without ceremony, dropped atop his helpless body. She shifted around a bit, grinding his body into a fine paste as she tried to make herself comfortable. Once she was ready, she closed her eyes and began chanting a spell in a strange and forbidden tongue. With each word spoken, a black smoke seeped from her mouth and began to envelop the stable. It didn't let up, seeping beneath the closed door and through the halls, eventually leaving everything completely enshrouded in an inky black haze. Vivian's henchmen didn't notice the encroaching threat until a particularly foul smell touched their nostrils. Whatever this substance was, it carried the distinct stench of Molly's horrid breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez-us! What crawled in here n' died?!\" one of them wretched as he stood across beside another armed guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I dunno. Think it might be a gas leak?\" his companion responded as he covered his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't never smelt no gas like this! We'd better let Vivian know before... be-before...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The henchman's voice died in his throat as the smoke began to gradually ease its way into his brain though his nose. The malicious substance dug deep into his mind, robbing him of his senses and rendering him mute. He wasn't the only one effected. Throughout the mansion, Vivian's minions were stopped dead in their tracks, the light fading from their eyes and their expressions becoming blank. Once they were all under her thrall, two words rang out through their collective consciouses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Get Vivian.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n That one phrase was burned into their minds as they shambled onward, dropping weapons or tools they happened to be holding as they began their single-minded pursuit of their former employer. For her to be able to enslave so many people at once, Molly had to make her command as simple and straight forward as possible. As a result, her zombified minions lacked much in the way of thinking power as they clumsily stumbled their way to the mayor's location, more often than not tripping over each other or knocking down a nearby vase. It didn't really matter though. They had one job, and that was to locate Vivian and force her from her hiding place. Their numbers were great enough to where they would impose an immediate threat to her, no matter how lacking they were in intellect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mayor herself was clueless to the encroaching hoard, as she sat in her private chambers looking through an assortment of contracts. She had managed to escape Molly's wrath for the time being, but the fearsome rodent was known for never letting up when vengeance was on her mind. That said, she wasn't the only one who carried such a reputation. Vivian's pride wouldn't allow her to simply run and hide from her foes. She make use of her connections to ensure that Molly was dealt with once and for all. The first step was to enlist the aide of the best mercenaries that money could buy. Not many people were willing to take the job given her target of choice, but she was pleased to find that there were a few hired guns who reveled at the chance to try their hands at such a formidable adversary. Once everything was sorted out, she placed the papers in a suitcase resting in her lap and sighed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That overgrown rodent is cutting into my funds... maybe there's a way I can profit from this?\" she muttered as she stood to her feet with her hand on her chin. \"I get myself some good P.R.by parading her fat ass around town. With Texas officially retired, I'll take all the credit for putting her away. That would certainly raise my stock...\" she snickered as she leaned back in her seat slightly. A loud thump broke her away of her thoughts, startling her out of her seat. Her attention turned over to the only point of entry in the room, a large mahogany door where the she could hear someone knocking on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I told you idiots not to bother me while I'm working!\" she yelled bitterly. She had been on edge ever since her escape, every small sound making her flinch. At the sound of her voice, the knocking stopped though it was soon followed by an uproar of activity coming from outside. Vivian wasn't sure what what happening but she could make out the sound of dozens of feet dragging through along the carpet, getting louder with each passing second. Another thud rang out as many hands began beating at her door with a with sluggish yet powerful blows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vivian's eyes widened as a large splinter of wood fell from the door, the familiar faces of her henchmen coming into view. It didn't take much thinking on her part to realize that they were under some kind of spell. She never discounted the probability of Molly using her own minions against her, but how on earth did she find her so fast? The only people who even knew about her hideout were Georgia and Madame Lucy. Shifty as they were, they were smart enough not to dabble with Molly and her ilk. Regardless, the hows and whys weren't important at the moment. It didn't take long for the mindless horde's persistent pummeling to bring her door crashing down. Her once loyal henchmen began pouring into the room, their empty eyes trained on the mayor as they dragged their feet towards her. </span></div></div>",

Nothing, not a footstep to be heard. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shambling horde closed in, only to see Vivian reach over to a nearby bookcase and activate a lever. A panel of the wooden wall opened up and she ran off, closing the secret door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran through the hall, the mayor could smell the perfidious stench of rat breath lingering in the air. It fogged her mind a little, but failed to do much more. She all but crashed through the back door and made a run for the stables. She could hear footsteps behind her as her henchmen had found other ways of getting back on her trail, shambling slowly out of the mansion. She had a considerable headstart, though she wasn't quite prepared for the horrifying scene inside the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were almost completely abandoned, with only her trusty stable-hand left. His eyes had turned black like her enthralled minions, but fortunately he wouldn't be much of a threat. His body had been flattened thin as a sheet, no doubt Molly's handiwork. Far worse were the horses. All of them had been let out. Vivian frantically looked around. That fat bitch had cut off her main escape route. Or had she? One horse was still left. It was the horse that carried her here. It looked haggard, but with the looming threat of Molly nearby the mayor couldn't afford to be picky. She threw a saddle on its back faster than she'd ever thought possible and by the time her henchmen started banging on the stable doors she was ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian charged away through the small crowd, knocking them aside. Thankfully her horse still had enough stamina to carry her to her next secret hideout. She had a contingency for every occasion, and this would be no different. It would be a left turn at the next crossroads, but her horse seemed to have a different plan. It turned right, racing down a road further into some farmland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What gives?! Turn around you stupid animal!\" She snarled, pulling on the reins. But the horse had become completely unresponsive to her commands. It's only reaction was to gallop even faster. It turned another sharp right, sprinting into an open cow pasture. Vivian's eyes went wide as she saw the voodoo rat standing ahead of her in the field, arms wide open and a cruel smile on her face. Molly was still quite far away, but the horse was sprinting so fast the mayor couldn't risk jumping off without badly hurting herself and making her easy prey for the fat rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly laughed, seeing her nemesis come charging towards her. She leaned down a little, ready to absorb what would come next. The horse ran towards her at full speed, a collision inevitable. But the large voodoo rat had several tons of weight over the horse and with a loud <i>WHUMP</i> it was brought to a standstill. Vivian was catapulted from the saddle and right into Molly's chest. The sweaty stench burned the mayor's nose and the fat rat was quick to wrap her in an inescapable hug. The horse bounced off her large body and fell onto its side. The voodoo rat quickly turned around and sat down, squashing the exhausted animal beneath her immense rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayor! I missed you. How good to be reunited with you. I do believe our little chat hadn't quite finished.\" She spoke, her voice dripping with malice and glee. She squeezed Vivian tighter, forcing the mayor's head between her sweaty unwashed breasts. She ground her butt down on the horse at the same time, flattening it to ensure the mayor had no chance of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where did we leave off...\" Molly mused aloud. \"Oh yeah, I believe we were at the part where you were going to beg for me to save your pathetic little life.\" She cackled maniacally, pulling the mayor's head from the sweaty embrace and waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P... Please...\" Vivian whimpered. She had no more escapes or plans in her back pocket. She was at the mercy of the voodoo rat and there wasn't a worse place to be in right now in all the world. She had no hope to fight off the larger and fatter bandit. \"I'll give you a... anything.\" She wheezes out, barely able to draw a breath between Molly's crushing embrace and foul stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Molly repeated, a second, booming dark voice echoing alongside her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Y-yes...!\" Vivian cried as she could feel Molly's grip slackening slightly. \"I've got connections! I... I can get you anything you've ever wanted! Money, power, anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly couldn't help but laugh at  the mayor's pathetic grovelling. All of the bravado and confidence she had shown in their first confrontation was gone in the face of her impending demise. It just went to show that no matter how much power people <i>claimed</i> to have, they were all helpless before her own power. Their delusions of authority was an affront to beings like her and as such, she saw fit to put them in their place. She roughly caressed the back of the lynx's head, not-so-subtly emphasizing the discrepancy between them in strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What use does someone like me have for money? If I want something, I take it. As for your other offer... well, as you've seen, I'm <i>plenty</i> powerful... or do you mean that phony type of power that weaklings like you constantly cling to? The kind where you give me a fancy title and expect people to obey me based on that alone? If that's the case, I may have to punish you for just for having the temerity of offering me something so useless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Please, I... t-t-there has to be something that I can offer you! Just tell me what you want!\" the mayor pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her heartfelt plea seemed to fall on deaf ears as Molly's smile widened into a frightening grin. A tense silence hung on the air as the rat's unblinking eyes seemed to pierce right through her. It in that moment, staring into those crazed bloodshot eyes, that Vivian experienced the sensation of fear. No one, not Annabelle, not Madame Lucy, not even her arch nemesis Texas, could elicit such a response from her. This monster of a woman was unlike any other rival she'd had in the past. Despite her manic and crazed demeanor, she boasted a strategic mind that surpassed even her own. That fact alone made the mayor fear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly could feel the dread building in Vivian's heart, her thick tongue licking her chops as she drank it in. There was a distinct pleasure she derived from breaking people mentally, watching their confidence die as it eventually dawned on them just how helpless they were before her. As far as she was concerned, the lynx's demise was a foregone conclusion. She wouldn\u2019t end it all right then and there though. The lynx didn\u2019t deserve such mercy after acting all haughty before. No, her punishment would be long and agonizing. By the time she was done with the mayor, she\u2019d be on her hands and knees pleading to have her life snuffed out beneath the rat\u2019s mighty derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vivian was dropped to the ground abruptly, though before she could scramble to freedom, Molly\u2019s meaty paw grabbed a fistful of her hair. She cried out in pain as she was dragged through the empty field, her eyes going wide as she saw her steed\u2019s flattened, unconscious body. She immediately silenced her screaming as Molly glanced over her shoulder and gave her an intense glare. Painful as it was, this was the closest the rat would come to showing restraint. If she so wanted, she could\u2019ve stored the lynx in her stomach or between deep inside her hellish buttcrack. Thankfully, her silence was only answered with a grunt as Molly continued on her merry way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took everything Vivian had to keep from tearing up at her predicament. She did nothing to instigate Molly\u2019s wrath yet she was going to be tortured in the most painful manner possible. The injustice of it all was staggering. She was dragged back into town with Molly sticking to the shadows in order to avoid detection. The risk of getting caught meant next to nothing for her but she wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with any would-be heroes. The smell of sweat and dirt hit the mayor\u2019s nose in an instant once they reached their destination. Molly\u2019s perpetual odor was already strong enough to make the eyes water, so it only stood to reason that her lair would carry that same pungent stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me show you something, Vivian. This is what real power looks like\u2026\u201d Molly said with a snicker snapping her fingers. A very slight rumbling could be heard, the sounds dozens of feet treading through the dirt covered tunnels of Molly\u2019s lair. Vivian was painfully held up in front of the rat by her hair and she was stunned to see the rat\u2019s manic henchmen all present and accounted for. Their bodies were littered with wounds, some of them struggling to stand under their own power after having the roof collapse on top of them. The mayor would\u2019ve thought that they would hold some contempt towards their leader for causing their injuries, but they stared upon Molly with a shared reverence unlike anything she\u2019d ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee the look in their eyes? See the love they have for me? That\u2019s a type of love that comes from respecting the natural order of things. The strong rule and the weak serve. They know it and they embrace it. No matter what I do, they\u2019ll keep serving me\u2026 because they can only be happy when their master is happy. You\u2019re not too far off from sharing that belief yourself, but you seem to be confused regarding where your place is in that order. You think having money makes you powerful enough to rule\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She gave the mayor one quick shake, forcing a pained yelp from her as she felt her hair getting tugged at the roots. She could feel their eyes running up and down her body, no doubt envisioning all of the cruel acts of perversion they could engage in with her. Molly grinned as she could practically smell the fear emitting from Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think would happen if I threw you over to them? Do you think your money would save you? Do you think they would respect your fancy title and leave you alone? Why don\u2019t we find out if your \u2018power\u2019 holds any real weight, hm?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Vivian cried out, her eyes turning wide as dinner plates as she looked back at Molly. \u201cPlease\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for ever thinking I had any real power! If you let me go, I\u2019ll step down as mayor and you won\u2019t ever see me again!\u201d she pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I care about you being mayor!\u201d the rat laughed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just trying to make a point. Funny as it would be so see my minions use you as their plaything, I\u2019m still in the process of figuring out just what to do with you\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her minions parted as their mistress walked by them, the mayor swung over her shoulder as though she were a towel. The lynx wept silently as she was brought to Molly\u2019s private chambers and dumped unceremoniously onto the rat\u2019s filthy sweat stained bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou be a good girl and stay here while I go fetch some things\u201d Molly ordered flatly before walking out and shutting the door behind her. She didn\u2019t appear to be overly concerned with securing Vivian, though the lynx could hardly blame her. The only thing she had to fall back on were the contracts in their briefcase and even if she were to somehow escape, Molly would hunt her down before she could even make use of them. Still, she couldn\u2019t stand being in such a helpless position. A woman of her class having to sit in a filthy hovel, hoping that her captor was in a good enough mood to spare her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That disgusting rat,</i> she fumed. <i>If I get out of this alive, I swear I\u2019ll have her sent to the gallows!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Morbid as it was, she found a bit of amusement imagining the sheriff\u2019s office trying to hang Molly and having the rope break the second the trap went off. It certainly wouldn\u2019t have been the first time that something like that happened, what with a fair amount of the populace being hefty in their stature. Of course, public executions stopped occurring once that bleeding heart yokel Texas took over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026 Texas\u2026!\u201d Vivian murmured as a thought struck her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As much as she despised the weasel, she was the only person she knew to have stood toe to toe with Molly and lived to tell the tale. Surely she would be able to lend aid to the mayor! That thought would have to wait, as she'd have to think of a way to escape Molly\u2019s clutches, although she wasn\u2019t certain if that would do more harm than good were she to get caught. She didn\u2019t have a lot of time to think things over, so after weighing the pros and cons, Vivian decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If she'd try to slip away and got caught, Molly wouldn't hesitate to torment her to death in this hellhole. But staying put would probably have the same effect. Maybe the fat rat would be a little nicer about it, but that really didn't change the fact that if Vivian didn't get out of here this would be the end for her. Accepting her fate was never her strong point. She didn't scheme and plot all these years just to perish in some smelly hovel at the hands of a paranoid rat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the confidence she could muster the mayor opened the bedroom door and began to walk for the exit. The rat warren was a maze of tunnels with no kind of signs anywhere. The winding passages scrambled her sense of direction. She just had to follow her instincts and her nose. If the foul stench got weaker she was probably nearing an exit. She made some progress before she stopped in her tracks. Footsteps up ahead. Not heavy enough to be Molly herself, but definitely a group of rats. She turned around to hide when more steps were heard coming from the other direction too. With no other passages in this narrow tunnel Vivian began to panic. She was about to get caught. She pushed herself up against the wall and hoped it would be over quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first pack of rats came into view and though they all saw the mayor whimpering softly they gave her no more than a quick glance, never even slowing their pace. Was this a trick by Molly? Why didn't they raise the alarm? Were they really so obedient they could no longer fathom the mere concept of going against Molly's orders? Whatever it was, Vivian breathed a small sigh of relief. She wasn't about to risk letting herself be seen though. These guys might've been passive, but who knows how the other rats might react. The current pack was still closing in and a new problem presented itself. Though Molly was the fattest and widest rat by a significant margin and easily able to navigate these tunnels, this group of rats together was filling the whole tunnel. And they were making no efforts to clear a gap in their formation for the mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmf.\" She groaned as the hefty flank of one of the rats brushed harshly against her, pressing her against the dirt walls. Was this the kind of wringer that Texas so often was put through? Vivian was surprised the weasel hadn't quit much sooner if this was her job. Worse yet, she's fairly certain the smelly rat is leaning into her just for that little added pressure and humiliation. She took a moment to regain her bearings after that painful event. The steps behind her were still closing in and she was in no mood to get squashed between more rat bodies and dirt walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step closer to the exit Vivian couldn't believe her fortune. There was barely a rat present between her and freedom bar that unfortunate little incident a moment ago. She began to think on Molly's words. She had a terrifying presence, commanding total obedience from her minions. If only there was a way to channel that herself. She'd have no need for a sheriff anymore, or henchmen. Everyone would do as she pleased whenever she demanded it. Wouldn't that be amazing... She grinned a little wider as a thin ray of what looked to be daylight shone from the next tunnel. She was getting so close. But as she turned the corner her heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the far end was Molly, a cruel grin on her face and a little mirror in her hand. She played with it, reflecting some light from a nearby torch into the mayor's eyes. Vivian froze up, the hairs on her neck standing on end. Sitting on the ground next to the voodoo rat was a large doctor's bag. It was richly embroidered with all kinds of strange symbols, little trinkets and totems hanging from the handles. But the biggest blow of all was the distinct shape of the bedroom door right next to Molly. She had wandered in a circle and ended up right where she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah, hold that face. That's the defeat I'm looking for. You will not set foot outside my home without my permission. Now get back where you belong or I will have you empty the cesspit with your bare hands. I'm sure the remains of your little sentry will be happy to see you again.\" Molly chuckled, patting her belly. Vivian's expression was one of horror. What was that vile beast inferring?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got off easy. Not unlike you... or your little associate.\" The voodoo rat said threateningly, standing up and grabbing the doctor's bag. She opened the bedroom door, but when the mayor tried to obey and enter the voodoo rat grabbed her head and pressed it into her blubbery, unwashed belly. Vivian gave some token resistance before hearing a muffled, bloodcurdling shriek echo from the rat's depths. Her blood ran cold. There was someone in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, your little friend Penelope is having a great time experiencing her worst fears over and over again until I tire of her and permit her to digest. Now on you go... it's your turn.\" Molly muses as she shoves Vivian into the bedroom. She follows her in, snapping her fingers to close the door and lock it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, no further disturbances. Now it's just little you and all of me.\" Her gleeful smirk and unflinching stare sapped the last of the mayor's nerve. But before she could break down into a tearful plea for mercy the fat rat gave Vivian a frightening look at...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Molly's gaze didn't leave the mayor for a second, not even as she knelt down and rummaged through her sinister looking bag. Her already big grin stretched even wider as she pulled out a doll. It wasn't just any doll however. It was a crude looking recreation of the Vivian, patched together in what had to have been in ten minutes. The sight of it brought the lynx to her knees in sheer terror. She wasn't nearly as well versed in the dark arts as Molly, but she knew enough to recognize a voodoo doll when she saw one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... don't...\" the mayor whimpered as tears flowed freely down her face. Any concerns about maintaining her dignity were tossed to the wayside at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you crying about? You don't even know what I'm going to do to you yet!\" Molly laugh as she walked over to her bed and took a seat at the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit\" she ordered, pointing down to the ground in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mayor responded with fearful obedience as she crawled over to the rat, her nose curling at the odor radiating from her lower half. Looking up at the massive rat, she couldn't help but be slightly awed. For one so vile and repugnant, it was impossible to deny the otherworldly air of menace she exuded as she towered over her much smaller body. Everything about her seemed designed to inspire fear and submission, from her imposing sizes, to her blood red irises, to the intense musty odor that clung to her fur. It was no wonder that she was able to command such reverence from her minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry your pretty little head, Vivian. I'm not going to end you. Not yet, at least\" the rat said with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vivian breathed a sigh of relief, though she quickly tensed back up as the realization hit her. Technically speaking, Penelope was another woman who Molly had chosen to keep alive. That fact alone hammered home the point that there really was no room for mercy in the sinister rat's heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what're you going to do with me?\" the lynx inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What indeed\" Molly asked back with a laugh as she gently stroked the doll on its head. Vivian flinched as she felt a sudden pressure on her head, as though she were being caressed by a giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On our little trip back home, I was racking my brain trying to think of a suitable punishment for you. I could've let you join Penelope, I could've sewn you to the back of my underwear, I could've given you to my minions to play with. They do get rowdy being cooped up inside all day\" she said, grinning as she saw the color drain from her captive's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough the more I thought about it, the more I began to rethink things. Pathetic as you are, you\u2019re still a cut above the usual weaklings that try to challenge my magics. That little ambush of yours actually managed to catch me off guard and that\u2019s not a feat that even Texas can boast\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vivian wasn\u2019t sure how to respond as she remained silent. Was the villainous rodent praising her intelligence? She never would\u2019ve thought her capable of having anything other than smug contempt for others, so this came as a bit of a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t often that someone manages to garner my respect, Vivian. For that, I\u2019m going to grant you the ultimate kindness\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vivian was about to question what she meant when a horrid smell caused her to fall to the floor gagging. She grasped onto her throat, her eyes bulging and her lungs burning as the familiar stench of Molly\u2019s sweat soaked cleavage seemed to completely encompass her. She looked up to see that Molly was no longer holding the voodoo doll, though she didn\u2019t have to wonder what happened to it as she saw one of its limbs poking out of the top of her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, breath it in... familiarize yourself with my many scents\u2026\u201d she cooed as she gave her boobs a quick squeeze. Vivian groaned as the horrid smell was contrasted by the plush softness of Molly\u2019s breasts pushing against her body. She was left frozen in place, helpless before the rat\u2019s powers as she watched her stand up and kneel down to meet her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll grow to love it eventually. You\u2019re a lot sharper than the others, so it might take a few months\u201d she said as she gave the mayor a pat on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what\u2026 what\u2019re you\u2026 talking about\u2026?\u201d Vivian wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you listening? I told you, I\u2019m going to grant you the ultimate kindness: a lifetime of servitude towards me\u201d Molly explained, her voice dripping with sinister glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, <b><i>what</i></b>?!\u201d Vivian cried, a jolt of panic induced energy running through her as she sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said before, there can be no greater joy for the weak than to serve the strong. Don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. I saw it in your eyes when you were seated in front of me. It was that very same look that I saw in my minions when I first invited them into my flock: Fear turned to admiration\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She narrowed her eyes, her crimson irises seeming to stare right into the mayor\u2019s soul. There was a hypnotic quality to them, though that might\u2019ve just been the blossoming fear taking hold of the lynx again. She cringed as she watched the rat\u2019s large tongue slowly slither out of her mouth and trail along her cheek. It was any wonder how the lynx was able to stay conscious, with her voodoo doll forcing her to breathe in Molly\u2019s sweat and the smell of her rancid breath inches from her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 you\u2019re going to be a <i>fine</i> servant. Maybe even the best\u2026\u201d she murmured before standing up and retrieving the voodoo doll from her cleavage. The invisible walls of flesh immediately eased off of the mayor, along with the stench. She coughed and weakling tried to crawl over to the door. Frightened as she was, her pride wouldn\u2019t allow her to act as this disgusting woman\u2019s lacky. She didn\u2019t get very far before she felt something tugging against her leg and anchoring her in place. She looked back to see Molly pinching down on her legs with very little pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ah, not so fast. I haven\u2019t finished with your initiation\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cOnce I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll be allowed to roam the tunnels and mingle with your new family\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her words made Vivian feel violently ill. If this was truly her fate, perhaps death was the more preferable option. She didn\u2019t get a chance to say as much as the air was forced from her lungs. Molly had given the doll a good squeeze around the waist, grinning at the pained expression on Vivian\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s not waste any more time\u201d she said with a grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It is time for you to be reborn as a member of our great little family. Oh, the fun we'll have...\" Molly laughed maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian's eyes were locked onto the little doll of herself. She dreaded to think what the cruel rat had in mind and her heartbeat rose as it was lowered down. Was Molly going to stomp on it? Sit on it? Please don't let it go up her ass. But it was quickly revealed that there was possibly someplace worse for the doll to go than the voodoo rat's massive rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor lurched back as she was hit by a wall of foul stench. It hit her like a sledgehammer, setting her nostrils ablaze with its strength and sheer depth of horror. It smelled like the darkest basement in Lucy's brothel had been left uncleaned for a year, mixed with some truly ancient ripe sweat. The second hammerblow came when Vivian felt a distinct wetness rub against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no... nonon~\" She whimpered before the fat rat overpowered her cries with a loud moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaah... Isn't this fun, Vivian?\" She asked sarcastically, rubbing the doll against her soaking wet pussy. She didn't get to do this too often anymore. There was little need to add more to her ranks and at some point all those extras just start to get in the way. But special cases like the little mayor here would hold an exception. She's thought about doing the same to Texas, but a blindly obedient sheriff is incapable of understanding the suffering she should endure. And that weasel deserved to whimper and cry at every ounce of vile torment Molly would heap onto her. The wet sensation spread along most of Vivian's body as her movement was restricted by the doll. Molly held it tightly, pressing it against her snatch and permitting the mayor almost no leeway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villainous rat relished seeing the lynx twitch and sputter. What must it feel like for her? To be in the presence of such power? Judging by the shocked wide eyes and horrified expression it must be awe-inspiring. Just wait until she realizes there's so much more to this ritual than what she's experiencing now. She stared intently at her victim, wanting to see every last little glance of the nightmares she was about to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian gasped when she felt the slimy wetness suddenly engulf her head. It was joined by a distant warmth and a sense of dread heavier than she'd ever felt. The rat's unnerving stare distracted her, but the noisy squelching and slurping emitted from between Molly's legs painting a sickeningly clear picture. The warmth spread down, embracing more of her body whilst clamping down on it even harder. It felt like she was dunked into a raging torrent, gooey wetness all around her. But her fur was dry. Her mind struggled to grasp how this was even possible whilst the voodoo rat just sat there and moaned. Finally she was almost completely within the rat's vile embrace. Molly pulled her hands from her crotch and parted her legs. The grotesque sight sent a shiver of fear down the mayor's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLodged deep into Molly's pussy was the doll. Only a tiny portion of its feet were still visible amidst the rancid depths of her love tunnel. Vivian gasped as she watched the feet slide up and disappear into the soaking wet folds, the large pussy seemingly devouring her on its own. It completed the immobilizing wet embrace on her body and gave the rat reason to unleash a bellowing laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, there. Another soul to join my ranks. Fear not, Vivian, once you've breathed in my most powerful smells you'll never think of anything other than obeying my every command. And you'll be doing plenty of that, because that doll ain't coming out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly wanted to keep laughing, but a lewd moan interrupted her. She missed having this kind of fun with her victims. Maybe she should seek out Texas and April after this and deal with them properly. As for the mayor, she couldn't possibly be made to suffer more, could she? The voodoo rat chuckled. Of course this could be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you, mayor, rolling up your little schemes has left me exhausted. You should feel ashamed for wasting so much of my time. But don't fear, I know how you can make it up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down and grabbed the immobilized lynx. Vivian could tell it took the rat more effort than normal to move her, fighting against her own voodoo. But Molly's strength and control were indisputable. Even as she was unable to move a muscle herself, the rat placed her in the middle of the bed. She watched the mayor's face contort in horror as she took off her remaining clothes. Although that might also just be her womanhood playfully squeezing the doll, bearing down with impossible strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian looked up, seeing the rat's posterior filling her vision as Molly clambered back onto the bed and sat down in middle of it. The puny body wedged between her cheeks felt amazing. The mayor was far less enthusiastic about it. As if the nauseating stench surrounding her before wasn't bad enough, now it was mixed with the putrid scent of unwashed rat ass. And Molly made sure she was wedged in deeply, smothered utterly in the vile prison of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foul rat simply laid back and snapped her fingers, extinguishing all light in her bedroom. \"Sweet dreams Vivian. They'll be the last free thoughts in your mind. Try not to spend them all on my ass.\" She chuckled darkly before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll night long Vivian was kept awake. If the horrid stench and pressure from the voodoo doll's grip didn't nearly suffocate her the fat rat would blow another vicious fart down on her. And on the off chance both of those were having a break the bone-chilling muffled screams from inside the rat made sure the mayor wouldn't get a second of sleep. By the time she was so exhausted nothing could stop her anymore the vast asscheeks bore down hard, sending a wave of pain through her body. They clenched and squeezed as Molly shuffled to the side of her bed and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Good morning slave. Did you dream as pleasantly as I did? I'm sure you did. Now you'll get to obey real power for the rest of your little life, however long I decide that to be.\" The rat snickered at her own malice, even moreso when she noticed the mayor was unable to free herself. \"Oh? Stuck back there? Fine, I'll do you a favor, but I'm gonna expect one back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian felt a chubby hand grab her leg and pull her free from the sweaty vice that was Molly's fat ass. She was utterly drenched in slimy ass sweat and grime, coughing and sputtering. She wiped the worst of it from her eyes. Wait, she could move again. Had the voodoo doll been deactivated? She looked up at her mistress, who just returned her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, the doll is gone, dissolved in my pussy. And with it, your will to fight me.\" Molly said calmly. But was she right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Molly dropped the once proud mayor of Gold Springs with little care and<br>\r\n awaited her next action. Without even a moment of hesitation, Vivian crawled up to the fearsome rodent on her hands and knees before hugging onto her thick leg in a display of total submission. Molly laughed smugly and patted her new slave on the top of her head. From that moment forward, the lynx would be kept around as an example of her power. All of the mayor\u2019s wealth and resources were useless before a force of nature like Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the fold, little one. Sorry to say, your old made up title will carry little weight here. You\u2019re going to be on the bottom of the totem pole, serving not just me, but my underlings. I doubt that you\u2019ll rise through the ranks in short order. Work hard and I\u2019ll grant you the title of \u2018Personal Stress Reliever\u201d Molly taunted as she continued to caress the lynx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes... \u201c Vivian muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes what, slave?\u201d Molly asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mistress Molly\u201d the lynx added in a louder, more enthusiastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good. Now go introduce yourself to your family proper. Obey every command and do it with a smile!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my mistress\u2026\u201d Vivian said as she slowly pulled herself away from the rat and staggered over to the door. The softness of Molly\u2019s rear might\u2019ve provided some comfort throughout the night, but the amalgamation of horrid smells left her disoriented and nauseous. As she reached for the door handle, Molly called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget, slave: trips to the outside are forbidden to all newcomers. Until you\u2019ve proven yourself, you can only go outside with yours truly as an escort, so don\u2019t let me catch trying to leave\u2026\u201d she chuckled coldy, her voice distorting more and more with each word she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you say, my mistress\u201d Vivian responded in an almost robotic tone as she exited the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Molly laughed at her obedient demeanor. As much as she hated people trying to intercede with her affairs, the outcome of Vivian\u2019s interference was well worth it. Her single-minded hatred of Texas had made her complacent and uncreative. In that respect, she was somewhat grateful towards Penelope and Vivian for injecting a bit of energy into daily routine. She caressed her large gut affectionately, grinning as she could feel the bunny\u2019s soul screaming out, pleading for an end to the hell she was enduring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 I might\u2019ve jumped the gun when I consumed you. You would\u2019ve made a good slave too\u201d she said in a tone that didn\u2019t sound very sincere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vivian was regarded with sneers and taunting by Molly\u2019s minions as she walked through the tunnels with a blank look on her face. Her fur, once prim and proper was frazzled and covered in their master\u2019s sweat. Her scent was all they needed to indicate that she\u2019d been integrated into their family, that and her humbled and submissive behavior. More than a few of them got handsy with her, pressing her face into their cleavage or groping her rear, yet the lynx took it in stride and offered no resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so high and mighty now, are you?\u201d one of them taunted as she shoved Vivian down and planted her thick rear onto her face. Even that wasn\u2019t enough to get a rise out of her, much to the rat\u2019s disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vivian was paraded around the tunnels for hours, stopping at the command of the higher ranked rodents and made to service in the most humiliating of ways. Eventually the novelty wore thin and they left the former mayor to her own devices. Really, it shouldn\u2019t have been all that amazing to see her in such a state. All were helpless before Molly\u2019s magic and she was no exception. At some point, they all had to face the reality of the matter and over time, they came to relish serving their master. Given enough time, Vivian would adopt their way of life and would do so with great enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That said, Vivian was no ordinary person. Even without her money and influence, the mayor of Gold Springs still had two things she could fall back on: her willpower and her intellect. Indeed, she had been left shaken by the nightmarish torture Molly had subjected her to and more than a few times, the urge to prostrate herself before the rat and apologize for having resisted her previously. Had Molly kept her there for another two or three days, there was no doubt that she would\u2019ve been absolutely broken but the rat once again made the mistake of underestimating her mental fortitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rattled as she was, the pain she felt had only strengthened her resolve to not only to escape but to get even with the vile rodent. Even as she was being taunted and harassed by her minions, she managed to keep the facade of a crushed and submissive slave. After the smells she\u2019d experienced, their stenches didn\u2019t so much as make her blink. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThat\u2026 disgusting beast\u2026 I\u2019ll get her\u2026 somehow\u2026 some way\u2026 </i>she thought as she sat down with her back against the tunnel wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was some temptation to disobey Molly and sneak out of the lair, but she thought better of it. The rat had eyes and ears everywhere, whether it be in the form of her many minions or the use of her dark magic. The safest bet would be to bide her time and earn Molly\u2019s trust, but heaven only knows how long that would take. Her mental strength was strong, but she wasn\u2019t sure how long she could keep this act up without either giving herself away or succumbing to her corruption. Even as she sat there plotting against Molly, a very small part of her wanted to just give up and accept her place there to avoid any more punishment. The rat\u2019s torture had done it\u2019s job in planting a seed of doubt in her mind and it was only a matter of time before it grew and took root. Once that happened, she would be no different than Molly\u2019s other minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have to stick it out\u2026 just long enough for until an opportunity to escape presents itself. Once that happens, I can leave and enlist Annabelle and Lucy\u2019s aid. If they aren\u2019t willing to help, I can bribe them with the gold I have stashed in my penthouse\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t much of a plan, but it was all she could come up with in such short\u2019s notice. The only thing she had to worry about was whether or not she was able to keep her wits about her in the meantime.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mayor's internal dilemma deepened throughout the day. Molly had well established how ruthless and vindictive she could be, but only moments of her cruelty had come through. Nothing compared to her day to day activities in her nest at least. Vivian had never really thought about why so many of her minions looked a little bruised and weary all the time. Sure, the little accident in town added a good number of scrapes, but even the rats that hadn't been anywhere near there were injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voodoo rat made it a constant habit to torment them, gleefully abusing their weak, puny bodies. She would command them to form a seat for her majestic ass but not allow enough rats to group together to support it. And when they inevitably buckled under the weight she'd punish them by grinding them flat beneath her rear. Vivian thought her torment had been special because of the fat rat's irrational theories about her, Penelope and Texas. But there wasn't an hour in the day that Molly wasn't either concocting schemes, tormenting her own minions, usually both at the same time. It was only a matter of time before Vivian would be called in to suffer again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later one of the higher rank minions approached the former mayor and commanded her to get on her knees. She grumbled a little internally but obeyed. He presented his manhood to her, a lewd smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suck it, you little slave!\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had escaped, every single one of these wretched rats would be hunted down and culled. Vivian filled her mind with thoughts of vicious retribution as she did as she was ordered, putting the unwashed flaccid cock in her mouth and wincing at the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attagirl, now don't stop until I say so.\" He gave the former mayor a toothy grin. She responded with gusto, providing the rat with so much stimulation he barely had time to get hard before his member already spewed its load. The tension in his body dissipated and with a cocky smirk he released Vivian from her duties, only to drop some even worse news on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly asked me to get you. You're needed in her bedroom. Better not keep her waiting. Imagine what she'd do if she found out you've been slobbering on rat cock instead of heeding her call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine if she learned you failed to relay her call to me because you were too busy making me tend to your own needs.\" The lynx hissed back, the rat's face going a little pale. Even at the bottom rung of this horrid pack the mayor's cunning had not been dulled. They all feared Molly's wrath as much as she did. Speaking of which, she better get a move on before the voodoo rat decides punishment is due. She made her way to the bedroom, finding Molly sitting stark naked on her edge of her bed. At her feet was another minion, roughly getting squashed beneath her bare soles. The moment Vivian entered he was let go, scampering for the door and closing it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave. You're slow. It nearly made me kill that guy out of sheer boredom. I expect all my slaves to give their all or they will find themselves demoted to food.\" She stated grimly, a toothy grin on her face as he bloodshot eyes made unflinching contact with the former mayor. She licked her lips and beckoned Vivian to get closer. With a shiver running down her spine the lynx obeyed. Her fears only deepened when Molly grabbed a length of rope, throwing it at Vivian's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going on a special assignment, mayor. Tie that around your waist, and make sure you do it properly.\" The voodoo rat commanded, taking the other end of the rope and tying it to one of the bedposts. She stared unblinking at Vivian as the mayor tried to remember how to tie a proper knot. Vivian tried her hardest, not wanting the rat to have an excuse to torture her. Finally she'd created something satisfactory, looking up to Molly with fearful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I caught your little accomplice Penelope I banished her to the depths of my ass. I'm sure you've heard the screams by now. But rare as it might be, I find myself regretting my actions. I want her back out and you're going to be instrumental in making it happen. Or you'll be lost in there too while I work my powers to expel you two slowly. Either way, prepare yourself, you're going in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going in?\" The lynx stammered with disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, slave. Crawl inside my ass and retrieve Penelope. Do I need to repeat myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N... no ma'am.\" The mayor stammered, shocked by the voodoo rat's casual tone. She got closer while Molly got on her knees at the side of her bed, resting her prodigious gut on the bed and presenting her huge, unwashed ass to the mayor. Vivian pushed apart the grimy cheeks to see the rat's putrid hole twitching deep between them. She gulped, fearfully pressing on. Two walls of assflesh surrounded her and one mighty clench would smother and crush her between their sweaty, stinky masses. The hole itself sputtered with the odd tiny fart, the smell of which could put a burning landfill to shame. She was really about to go in there. The urge to drop the act had never been stronger, but there would be no end to Molly's fury if she discovered her deceit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I haven't got all day. Don't make me have to help you.\" The fat rat sounded annoyed. Vivian had better get moving. With a disgusted sneer on her face she pushed closer, pulling open the foul hole with both hands. It was surprisingly stretchy, easily letting the mayor slide both arms inside. From there the rat practically did the work for her, the greedy asshole pulling and sucking on Vivian with so much power all she had to do was go along with it. The ravenous hole swallowed her up in seconds, sealing her in foul-smelling darkness. The sticky, slimy walls squeezed and undulated as Vivian was traveling deeper into Molly than she ever thought possible. The stench was the stuff of legends. Nothing even got near it. Not a thousand baths would ever have her feel clean again. The only thing she can do is reach Penelope as fast as possible. The screams ahead were unnerving, but at least they let Vivian know she was getting close. Once there she could use the rope to pull herself back to freedom out of this nightmare.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> It was only through the mayor's immense mental fortitude that she was able to keep her wits about her as she powered through the horrible trial before her. She was motivated both by her intense fear or Molly's wrath and the intense desire to wreak terrible vengeance upon her. Focusing her thoughts of the latter helped tune out the bloodcurdling screams up ahead. What really made her shudder was the pleasured moans resonating all around her, as reminded her of the \"initiation\" she had endured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a few minutes slithering, the screaming came to a sudden stop. Vivian's could feel her heart stop for a moment. Was she too late? Had Penelope's life finally expired? Her concern for the rabbit wasn't a factor in her mind, though she dreaded what would happen if she returned to Molly empty handed. It came as a relief to her as she her a strained whimper up ahead. All of that nonstop screaming had finally taken a toll on her vocal cords. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With no light source to aid her, Vivian didn\u2019t notice the rabbit\u2019s face until she bumped into her and heard a startled squeak. She reached forward and placed her hand on what she assumed was Penelope\u2019s face. How she ended up facing outward was anyone\u2019s guess, though Vivian quickly postulated that she\u2019d been trying to squirm her way out before getting trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenelope. I\u2019m going to get you out of here\u2026\u201d the lynx said with all the sincerity she could muster. She never did care for the narcissistic bunny and her constant mischief, but her unique talents would prove useful. If she truly were to defeat Molly, she needed all the help she could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-please\u2026\u201d Penelope stammered as her body trembled violently. \u201cM-m-make\u2026 m-make i-it s-s-stop\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh. It\u2019s going to be okay\u2026 just hold tight, alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Penelope nodded and did her best to calm down. She fidgeted at the lynx\u2019s touch, the experiences leaving a permanent scar on her psyche. From that day onward, she wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night without having nightmares of Molly\u2019s enormous rear coming down and encasing her in a black void of filth and stink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That brought her attention to Vivian. Why was she there? Molly\u2019s bulk blocked out most sound and she spent a good majority of her time screaming her lungs out, so she knew nothing of what happened between her and Vivian. Had the mayor somehow do the impossible and defeat this monster of a woman? Given how calm she appeared to be, that was the only explanation she could think of. That assumption along with her assistance endowed Penelope with a whole new respect for the lynx. Once they were free, she would swear undying loyalty towards her for this kindness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Of course, getting out was easier said than done. Vivian was never the athletic type so she was having some trouble pulling herself out with the rope. The constant squeezing of Molly\u2019s asshole only served to hinder her progress. If the lynx didn\u2019t know any better, she would\u2019ve assumed that this was nothing more than a convoluted ploy to trap her inside her ass with Penelope. As if sensing her growing concern, she felt a powerful tug coming from the other side of the rope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was given little time to prepare as she was quickly yanked out with a loud <i><b>slurp</b></i>, Penelope clinging tightly to her waist. Vivian had hoped to have her efforts rewarded with a bit of fresh air, but the scent that greeted her was arguably much worse. As she and Penelope were tossed to the ground, she looked back at Molly and fought back the urge to vomit as she saw her fondling her pussy with great enthusiasm. All of that movement inside her asshole had gotten her in the mood, as evidenced by the puddle of slime that coated her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 good job\u2026\u201d she said as she began to catch her breath. It was hard for Vivian to tell whether she was being praised for retrieving Penelope or for the pleasure she managed to bring in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wah? You\u2026?!\u201d Penelope gasped as she stumbled back, her chest heaving and her eyes bulging as she looked up at the towering rat. Her reaction brought another pleasured shudder from Molly, much to Vivian\u2019s disgust. There truly was no limit to her depravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back. I apologize for our last interaction. I\u2019ll admit, I <i>might</i> have overreacted a bit\u201d Molly said with a sneer, her words dripping with malicious sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vivian looked down at Penelope, expecting her to jump to her feet and launch into an anger induced tirade. Her past dealings with the rabbit had been strictly business related, mostly in the form of arguments regarding the zoning laws and her refusal to abide by them. She didn\u2019t so much as flinch at the mayor\u2019s veiled threats, despite being fully aware of the reputation she carried. The fiery woman that she knew was nowhere to be seen as she trembled fearfully at Molly\u2019s cruel visage. Vivian couldn\u2019t blame her. The treatment she herself had endured paled in comparison to the nightmarish hell the bunny had endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you possibly find it in your heart to forgive me?\u201d Molly asked with a toothy grin. Her words carried a slight double meaning. She wanted to see how her mental state was after being subjected to the horrors of her ass for days on end. Vivian stared at the shaken woman, secretly hoping that she had enough wits to know what to say. Lashing out would lead to a severe punishment, though she wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to see her completely subservient towards Molly. Fear was a powerful motivator, after all. If she was like Vivian, her pride would enable her to power on through and put on a solid poker face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After an uncomfortable minute of silence, the Penelope\u2019s mental state was made quite clear. </span></div></div>",

She stayed down on all fours, meekly crawling over to the smug voodoo rat. Molly watches with an amused smirk as her former adversary slowly makes her way over to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... As expected. Another mind shattered by my might. Perhaps I should've given you the same treatment, Vivian. Just look at how obedient she is. Yes... Come on in, Penelope. I know what you want.\" Molly cooed as she spread her legs a little wider. The rotten, fishy stench radiating from her crotch was unbearable, but the rabbit was completely unfazed. Vivian had to tap into every ounce of willpower not to gag. Being covered in the residue from the rat's rectum didn't help any either. But the only thing more horrifying right now was seeing Penelope so completely obedient to this monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had crawled up to the bed and gave the rat a strange look. Molly nodded and Penelope struggled to hoist herself up. For a moment Vivian worried in abject horror that she would be watching the rabbit willingly climb back into that huge ass. But instead she was treated to an almost even more unsettling sight. As she came eye to eye with the voodoo rat's soaking wet pussy she simply let herself fall forward a bit, planting her face right in the middle with a noisy splat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly moaned, feeling Penelope's tongue spring into action and probe her in the most delightful ways. \"Oooooh, that's good. Give me some more of that 'forgiveness'\" Her voice was dripping with malice as she put a grubby hand on the back of Penelope's head and dragged it up and down. Not the tiniest stretch of her loose, slimy pussy was left unattended. The sight of it was sickening to the mayor, but she didn't muscle through a literal journey up Molly's ass to lose her cool now. She had hoped Penelope would have the mental fortitude to endure the horrors too, but it seemed like she was still all alone in her act. A pity, the rabbit had proven useful in the past. Making Texas believe she had a crush on Georgia was some of the most hilarious things the mayor had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope's face was mashed into the rat's snatch so long she was nearly suffocating, but Molly finally released her. She fell back into a heap, her breathing swallow and haggard. She didn't move a muscle as the fat rat hovered a large, sweaty foot over her. With a small laugh Molly pinned her victim down, squeezing her underfoot until the mayor couldn't tell if it was the floorboards or Penelope's ribcage that was creaking. Finally the rat seemed to grow bored tormenting her current victim. She looked up to the mayor, stained from head to toe in her filth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vivian, be a dear and go collect Damien for me. I really want to hear that sonorous voice of his as I make him squeal for mercy. And take this one along with you.\" The voodoo rat kicked the rabbit over to the lynx, her body limp and floppy, but alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian shuddered as she expected Molly would like to see and grabbed Penelope's arm. She dragged the hypnotist rabbit out of the bedroom, wondering about her next assignment. This Damien was presumably one of her rat minions, but she didn't know a single one of their names. Before the bedroom door closed, the voodoo rat was sure to add one final threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you better not be late again, or it's you that'll squeal for mercy instead.\"</span></div></div>",

She knew that this course of action would cripple her plans and put her on the backfoot in her efforts to become mayor, but in that moment she just didn't care. All she wanted for that instant was to put the annoying sheriff in her place... To silence this annoying biting insect who arrested her girls and stomped into her establishment like she owned the place. With a moan of pleasure the skunk let loose with everything that she had been holding back... and damn near blew the weasel's head off! As the floodgates opened Texas was blasted by fart after soul-churningly bad fart, each one making the weasel feel like she should rip her nostrils out just to avoid smelling it for a millisecond longer... but as the assault continued, Texas realised that it wasn't coming to an end. The sheriff's struggles grew more desperate, but there was very little she could do at this point, as she could already feel the haze seeping into her mind. As gas cloud after gas cloud melted her brain in a toxic miasma, she was finding it harder and harder to think. What was her town called again? What was her job? And her name... Florida? Montana? It was just so hard to think... and then soon even thinking of thinking slipped away... and the weasel just hung limp in her chains, the last sputters of Lucy's gas blasting away any remaining braincells... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, the process had only taken about five minutes, but as Lucy stepped forwards and fixed her skirts, glancing back to check on the status of the weasel, she smiled at the familiar sight of a mind-broken gas slave. The blank stare, the limp stance, the tongue pathetically lolling out of her mouth... Lucy was as confidant as she'd ever been that there was nothing left of the weasel now save for a brainless, order-following, stink-obsessed slave, good only to follow orders and be rewarded with more mind-rending gas. The skunk tutted to herself a little, disappointed in both how easily she had given in to the pleasure of the moment over the rational choice, and in how long the weasel had lasted. True, it was longer than most people managed, but she had still been hoping to draw it out a little more before converting Texas to... this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Perhaps not quite so tough as your reputation would indicate, mon sheriff?\" She enquired, circling around to get a good look at her. Texas said nothing, her mental processes all but gone, and a small smile worked its way across the skunk's face. \"Usually when I choose to take there more... extreme measures, I am careful to have a buyer already lined up to sell the new slave to...\" She said, starting to uncuff the chains around Texas's wrists using a key plucked from her cleavage. \"I can't have the sheriff finding out, after all. But... somehow I think it will not be an issue this time... In fact, I think the new sheriff might be very appreciative of my efforts... and the new girl for hire in my lineup...\" As the weasel's wrists were freed she slumped forwards onto all fours, then just looked up at Lucy blankly. The skunk chuckled, then turned and walked towards the door, Texas obediently following on all fours. \"As will every other outlaw in town. You'll be very busy, mon cheri...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the rest of your life...\"</span></div></div>",

Well that ain't a game ah'm playin'! Now tell me about the disappearances and stop wasting my time!\" The weasel finished, her voice raising. It was only as her shouting faded away that she noticed that the noise of the piano and the low murmuring from the patrons and skunks had gone silent. Glancing to her left, the weasel noticed the skunk by the stairs had her eyes firmly fixed on Texas, while her hand had snaked into the hidden pocket of her dress, no-doubt resting on the secret pistol that the sheriff had noticed earlier. Lucy noticed this too, and raised a hand to calm the skunk down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arr\u00eatez, Melody.\" Lucy said, and the skunk guard relaxed slightly, removing her hand from her weapon, though still looked quite on edge. The madame looked back to Texas and narrowed her eyes. \"As for you, sheriff, I believe you have overstayed your welcome. I have tried to be hospitible, and you have thrown that back in my face. Therefore, I insist that you leave. Immediately.\" She said forcefully, while Texas grit her teeth. She still didn't have any information, and despite Lucy's guard, she was pretty sure she could strong-arm the skunk into telling her what she wanted to know. Lucy was a schemer, not a fighter, after all. On the other hand, that wasn't the kind of person Texas was, and lackey of the mayor or not Lucy was still a citizen of this town who Texas was sworn to protect and serve. Maybe it would be wisest just to de-escalate the situation and go back to her patrol?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But at risk of jumping out of her skin should that change, the sheriff kept her eyes and ears alert and her body tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town doctor, Howliday, chided her that the tension would put her in an early grave sooner than a vengeful bandit with an ass to grind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it served its purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not a damned thing in the world would have prepared Texas for what happened. And the sheriff had seen some truly demented shit in her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw what looked like a mirror, but it was... floating above the street...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCircling it, she saw one side of it was a swirling black void that felt like looking down a gulch... and the other side looked like a street... but it was clean, white, smooth, with buildings to match beyond it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas' jaw hung open in confusion and awe just in time to see a wolf woman in a figure-hugging blue bodysuit come dart around the corner, shooting what looked like a pistol... if a pistol shot bolts of green light!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't move her feet, fixed in one spot, as the wolf leaped backwards through the opening, ass-first, slamming it right into Texas' face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women fell to the ground as the portal closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas' face had been smooshed into many a backside in her time, but this was the first time the experience hadn't been a traumatizing one. At least to her nostrils... The black-haired, gray wolf's booty smelled of vanilla and rubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooofh!!! Gerrof me, ya' varmint!!!\" The weasel muffledly exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess pried her generous butt off of the sheriff's face and turned around, kneeling to help up the fallen lawwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am SO sorry about that... Look, I wasn't watching where I was-OHCRAP! It's gone AGAIN?!\" The woman yowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What's gone...? What again..?\" The sheriff was clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My time machine! The agency's gonna paste me for sure this time! I-ohhh double-crap... I'm not even in my own time anymore... aaaaand I've just revealed I'm a time traveler to a sentient, more-or-less modern person. Super!

That wasn't cool!!! I don't know what barn or cave you were raised in, but you can't just hit pe-\" Texas sighed and threw her own ample rump onto the blue-clad wolfess' face, smooshing her into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-BRRZAP!!-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... SERIOUSLY not nice! Don't hit me or sit on me again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again...?\" Texas mumbled. She hadn't hit her. Though she'd been thinking about it. Or sitting on her just to make her stop talking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, sorry. Short-range time backleap. Feature of the suit. Which, thanks to you, now only has two charges left.

Was that... window or what-have-you, your time machine?\" Texas asked. She'd read Jules Verne's works but after reading 'The Time Machine', which gave her nightmares, she vowed never to broach the subject again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's here, broaching itself, like everything else in the weasel's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope... I was being shot at when I crossed the threshold and my time machine got lost. Again... It's somewhere within a few miles, that at least I know.\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm inclined to help a fellow law officer out.

At least this time I've found a friendly face and not a bunch of stupid dinosaurs that want to mash me into paste...\" Samantha breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinosaurs...?\" Texas asked skeptically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr.... um..... Thunder Lizards? Giant bones in the badlands? Well, they belonged to massive creatures. And thanks to those stupid lizards, the academy is filled with video of me being eaten and mashed up, ground into paste, spitroasted by cannibal pigs, squashed by a giant chief and used as buttfloss before being crammed into her pucker and my personal favorite, getting chewed up and blown into a bubble by a tyrannosaurus-freaking-rex prior to being swallowed! All the timelines where I apparently screwed up got... cluttered. So there's ample time-dilation video showing all of that! From every angle! Best part, the professors MAKE ME WATCH TOO. IN FRONT OF EVERYONE... I've never been so humiliated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas listened as the futuristic wolfess carried on, wallowing in self-pity. Tex knew she wasn't the mightiest in the West, but a complainer she was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'mma ask at the saloon. Maybe someone saw your doo-hickey.\" Texas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The Crushed Weasel', huh? Is there a story there...?\" Samantha curiously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas' face reddened. \"Yeah. A stupid one. Don't ask.\" She snipped, stepping up to the swinging doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha cut in front of her. \"Sorry, sorry... I've just ALWAYS wanted to do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess flung open the doors dramatically... and YAPPED as they violently sprung back to slam into her with such force as to smear her across both of them. She slowly slid down, dropping into a pile of blue, gray and black mush, her gold eyes looking pitifully up at Tex, who chuckled sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeah, sorry about that, sugar. The fat cow what runs this place, Anna, put a mighty strong spring into the doors after she got tired of replacin' em when people opened them too fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-BRRZAP!-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh SON OF A-!\" Samantha yelled from behind Tex as the weasel carefully pushed open the doors, looking over her shoulder, holding them open a little to let the time traveler in. \"S-Sorry! Just a time-traveler thing...\" She mumbled, down to one charge left on her suit until she could find one of the scattered power cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pair stepped in and the music stopped, the denizens staring at the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the sexy little slip, Sheriff?\" The obese mare propping up the bar asked after a throaty belch. \"And how much is it to roll in the hay with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ease up, deputy.

She strode over to Anna, who had already taken the star off Texas'  vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing as the sheriff went and got some poor out of towner killed, as the town's most successful businesscow, I nominate Deputy Georgia as the new sheriff!

Indeed, as she pushed down, more weasel butt overflowed around the edges of the spittoon bucket, forcing a tighter fit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia grinned widely at Anna, who clapped with approval. \"What a delightful methodology!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare took a bow, then continued to press in, sinking April in until only her tail and ass stuck out of Texas' abused, stretched pucker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmrrrrmmmmgh.....\" They both whimper-moaned in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia stuffed her thumbs, not content yet, into April's rear and pulled out, stretching it tight over the bottom of the metal bucket, completely sealing it in!

I'm declaring a town holiday! The annual 'We got rid of the goody-big-asses and their bigmouth friend too' day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoergia's eyes suddenly widened and she let out a wet, throaty belch! A wet and smelly mop of black hair coughed up, splatting onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm-mmm! Satisfyin'!\" Georgia hooted. \"Shame it's all fucked up or I'd sell it to Miss Cleo. Ah well!\" She shrugged, then stepped on the hair, spinning on her heel, grinding Samantha's hair into a black paste which ingrained into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the days that followed, Golden Springs became a hub of bandit activity and a sanctuary and safe haven for criminals, bandits, anyone fleeing from perfectly understandable misunderstandings with the law. And whenever someone tried to bring any semblance of law and order in, Georgia only needed to come out with her pink, shiny, foxtail paperweight or point to the black splotch permanently ingrained in the floor of the Crushed Weasel to remind them what happened when you cross the rightful sheriff of Golden Springs.</span></div></div>",

With a broad smirk she reached for the puny wolf. Samantha dodged back, but her tail wasn't quick enough to follow. The mare's iron grip locked around it and she dragged the whimpering wolf close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't many of your kind 'round these parts, le's see if it's because o yer taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first though, she'd need to squash this wolf into a more malleable form to fit her inside those big jaws. The mare flashed a cruel grin and held Samantha close to her enormous thighs. She shuffled them back and forth, pushing the twitching wolf tail between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha panicked, feeling the monstrous thighs squeeze her tail flat. Worse yet, they were pulling the rest of her into their smothering embrace. Georgia was impatient though, gleefullly helping out by putting a big hand on Samantha's gut and pushing her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone help me!\" She cried out, but the biggest reaction from the bar was some distant laughter. Nobody was stupid enough to get between the mare and her playthings. Texas tried to say something, maybe an 'I told you so', but her current predicament left those words as indecipherable mumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful thighs effortlessly squished her into a thick grey paste, her lower body feeling numb. Georgia put a hand on Samantha's head and pushed the rest of her between those crushing walls of muscle and fat too. Finally the mare parted her legs, picking up the ball of Samantha, now looking more like a lump of clay with eyes. It was time for the good part. Georgia licked her chops and opened her maw wide. A wave of rancid horse breath washed over the wolf. Those halitosis comments were and understatement and then some. The unfortunate wolf wondered briefly how she was even able to smell anything in this form, but the mare soon gave her far worse things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare chomped down on her new piece of gum, the gooey wolf sticking to her teeth. She loudly chewed away at it, her tongue slathering whatever parts of Samantha it could reach in slimy, pungent drool. The wolfess felt nothing but a dull ache resonating throughout her body. This wasn't the first time she'd ended up in the jaws of some foul creature. But usually intelligent lifeforms abstained from these acts. Then again, was this mare really all that 'intelligent'? More concerning was that without her suit, she had no way of escaping this torment. And Georgia's comments did little to ease her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... You'sh real tashty, y' know thah?\" The bar crowd laughed aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare kept chewing, infusing the wolf with the stench of horse spit and her gross horse breath. Her dull teeth squeezed and chomped the amorphous ball of grey paste, preventing any shot at reforming back into her normal shape. The taste was great, but as with any gum it started to fade after a few minutes. The mare frowned a bit, annoyed that her gum was already losing its unique flavour. The wild chomping had left Samantha completely disoriented. She couldn't tell up from down any more, completely at the horse's mercy.</span></div></div>",

Georgia acted quick, stomping towards the sheriff and looming over her ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y' always gotta butt in when I'm havin my fun?! I've had it up to <i>here</i> with you, Tex. Ah reckon it's high damn time someone oughta show you your place!\" She shouted. Her temper was short by nature, and the booze wasn't helping one bit here. She picked Texas up from the floor and returned the favor by delivering a haymaker to her gut. The weasel wheezed loudly as she felt her body turn malleable from the heavy impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the weasel could grab her gun the mare tore off Texas' belt, throwing it aside. The rest of the sheriff's outfit was turned to scraps of cloth and leather in Georgia's strong hands. As more and more was revealed the other patrons in the bar hollered and whistled, making the weasel blush. But her attention was set squarely on the irate horse woman. Soon she had the weasel naked and she started to stretch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff's elasticity was put to the test, the mare pulling her and squeezing her back together in a weasel-colored wad. Soon the mare was satisfied with her efforts, bring the balled up Texas to eye level. Her body was reduced to a brownish wad with two frightened eyes staring down the mare's yawning gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since ya made me swallow me last piece 'o gum, how's about you take its place!\" The mare crowed loudly. Her breath made the weasel's eyes water with its horrifying stench. The alcohol in it burned the sheriff's non-existent nose. Georgia opened wide and stuffed her new gum into her large maw. She chomped down hard, chewing the taffy-like body of Texas and getting her stuck to her grime-ridden teeth. The weasel felt sick, both from the foul smells around her and the constant disorientation from being chewed on.</span></div></div>",

Apparently it made the mare laugh so hard she accidentally swallowed the weasel-flavored gum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas felt wet cilia guide her downward through a noxious tunnel of flesh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and with a splat, she emerged into the mare's stomach, her gooey body smooshing against Samantha's. Their eyes regarded eachother in the murky stomach, both letting out frightened whines!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia laughed, shaking her head &gt;\"Well.... guess the Sheriff and her idiot friend are chow now!

What COULD indeed happen? They're pretty much one person now, fused together.

She needed a drink to settle her stomach after swallowing those two scrawny pests. It rumbled and roiled loudly, working away at the mare's substantial latest meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside that big gut the wolf and the weasel struggled to keep together. They'd been fused together into a singular puddle of squashed goop, but that was far from their biggest concern. From the fringes of their being they could feel themselves merging with Georgia's foul stomach juices too. It became increasingly difficult to tell where they ended and the stomach started. All they could do was whine uselessly as they fought to keep some level of consciousness. Finally everything turned black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree beers later the massive mare clutched her belly. \"Ah got some business 't tend to...\" She announced. Annabelle immediately directed her to the outhouse, the mare quickly making her way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outhouse was basic, Georgia barely fitting in and making the simple wooden seat creak. Below was a deep pit, half-filled already. The mare sat down and grit her teeth. \"Alright Tex, ye get 't be a pain in ma rear one last time.\" She grumbled to herself as she began to push. Her unwashed rear widened and the first of many thick horse apples plopped out. It took a considerable amount of time for the mare to finish, her big gut rumbling with satisfaction and a refreshed hunger. Georgia pulled her pants back up and looked at her handiwork. Amidst the pungent heap she could barely identify some tufts of grey and brown fur. With a satisfied smirk she patted her belly, pleased to see it deliver such fine work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's time travel device remained lost and her story was nearly forgotten, save for a few embarrassing details that were recorded before her suit went haywire. She served as a cautionary tale for all time travelers to keep a safe distance with the locals of their time periods. Who knows what acts of gluttonous barbarism they were into back then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTexas' legacy as the sheriff of Gold Springs was swiftly erased when the mayor assigned Georgia to be the new sheriff. Every ounce of justice and honesty was removed in favor of the violent mare's preferred method of lawgiving: bribes and corruption. She used her power to punish whoever she saw fit, keeping an iron grip on the town. Any out-of-towner coming to visit quickly learned to supplement their monetary bribe with food, lest the mare decide to relive that glorious moment that propelled her into this position one more time.</span></div></div>",

Follow the adventures of the town's sheriff, Texas, as she and her deputy April try to bring back law and order to Gold Springs, fighting fat and smelly villains who want nothing more than to squash and gas our heroes into paste. This is a fetish story, and while it will mostly be focused on themes such as squashing, flattening, gassing and some scat, really all fetishes are welcome here. However, if those fetishes offend you, <b>do not</b> read this interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Character Bios:</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Texas Stanton</b>: The weasel sheriff of Gold Springs.
