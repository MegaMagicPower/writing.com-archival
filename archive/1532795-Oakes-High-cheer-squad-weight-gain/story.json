What did you expect with their mascot being a boar (everyone at the school thinks of it as a pig still).<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n                                                                             *Pick the person you want to see gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly (5' 10\" -126 pounds- 18 years old)- Kimberly had barely came to this school during her junior and already by her senior year, she has taken the the position as captain from Ashley. Kimberly is very stuck up and hates it when anybody tries to look better than her. But that is hard to do with her gorgeous jet black hair, light green eyes and perfect figure. Kimberly knows she has a sexy body, with her wonderful C cup breast along side a matching well toned ass. You can tell by how shows off her body all the time by wearing very little clothing. But because of this, she has made many enemies already in her short time here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley (5' 9\"-123 pounds-18 years old)- Ashley has been attending Oakes High for all her high school life. She was captain of the cheer squad her junior year and was expecting to have it again her senior year. But it was stolen away by Kimberly and Ashley hates Kimberly for that. Everyone knows about the hatred Ashley has for Kimberly, but they just try and ignore it. Ashley had made a lot of enemies last year as cheer  captain and she lost all of her good friends. To make matters worse, Ashley's only follower Amber left her. Her senior just started and it already turned so crappy. Ashley then decide to try and depend on her looks to get her by this year. As she fits the stereotype of cheerleader, with long blond hair, dark blue eyes, and a perfect body. (not to forget about how her family is super rich.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber (5' 10\"-124 pounds-17 years old)- Amber had always helped and supported Ashely ever since she was a freshmen and Ashley a sophomore. It was her hopes, that Ashely would become  captain and name Amber  captain once Ashley graduated. Ever since Kimberly became  captain though, Amber has stopped following and helping Ashley. She than began to think that maybe she wouldn't need any help, she looked stunning with her light brown hair and matching brown eyes. She even had a nice body in her opinion, with a nice and slim wasit/stomach and wonderful C cups. Besides her only competition next year would be Rose, but than the perfect Trixie came along. She didn't want the same thing to happen to her, like it did with Ashley and Kimberly stealing her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosaline aka Rose or Rosa (5' 6\"-129 pounds-17 years old)- Rose had it though, being the shortest and heaviest girl on the squad since her freshmen year. But she couldn't help it, since the other girls exercised and diet on their free time, while Rose spent her time partying and her mother always cooking such wonderful food. She wasn't fat by regular female standards, but to the cheer squad she was. Since freshmen year the captain would go up to her during practice to pinched her stomach, and if she got a good chunk of fat she would make Rose do sit ups all practice. All through freshmen and sophomore year she did sit ups at home and managed to keep her stomach in check. But she failed to realize what happen to her hips and ass until her junior year. She is trying her best this year, keeping her weight under 130 pounds and is hoping not to get kicked off the cheer squad. This Latina is she consider sexy around the school, with her dark black hair and light brown skin. However, since most girls in the school don't like the cheer squad they pick on her the most about her chunky butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie (5' 8\"-120 pounds-15 years old)- Not much is known about her, expect that she join the school and the squad this year. Many people were surprise as she was barely a freshmen and made the squad. Everyone now thinks she is going to be captain next year, but she doesn't want to wait till next year because she wants it now. Trixie will do anything to become the captain of the squad. She looks like Ashley in many ways, except she has short blond hair. Amber is afraid of her chances being captain next year with Trixie around. Amber knows she needs to ruin her if she stands a chance to be captain next year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n*Pick the person you want to see gain weight.</span></div></div>",

Brian returned home with just that, and she nearly ate the entire first  burger in one bite, and took it slightly slower with the three others. She nearly forced herself to eat the fries, and the two salads and mcflurries were a struggle.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last thing Kimberly wanted was for teammates to see that she had gained weight. When she heard them enter the gym, she sucked in her gut as much as she could. She was disapointed and not to mention embarassed that even sucking in her belly there was a little belly noticeable. She just hoped that by some miracle the other girls wouldn't notice. She took her usual spot in the gym as the cheer captain and waited for them to come in. She watched as they came in together, all talking with each other as they put down their bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley noticed Kimberly first and Kimberly could tell that she was not pleased to see her back so soon or at all. She took some satisfactation in that. She had no doubt that Ashley was the one who squealed on her and silently made a vow to herself that she would get Ashley back for it. She wasn't sure how yet but she would. Kimberly was completely covinced that Ashley had been the one who squealed on her. \"Look girls, our disgraced captain has returned. Once a cheater, always a cheater I say. I bet she even cheated to get captain\" Ashley replied as she walked over to her spot, glaring at Kimberly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, Rosaline, Trixie all giggled as they followed behind Amber to their sports. Amber and Trixie each had their own cheer captain inspirations so they were not taking sides in the battle for captain between Kimberly and Ashley but both were ready to take over as captain at a moment's notice if something should happen to both Kimberly or Ashley.  Amber was determined to win the position of captain the honest way. Trixie on the other hand was already thinking of ways to steal the position of captain away from Kimberly and Ashley and none of them were particular nice ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four girls let out a gasp when they fully saw Kimberly after getting to their spots. Then an big smile spread across Ashley's face and she let out an evil laugh. Maybe it wouldn't be so easy for Kimberly to retain her status as captain anymore. Amber, Rosaline, and Trixie couldn't help but laugh themselves. All four girls were laughing for different reasons. Amber was laughing because she was jealous because even though they had similar bodys, guys found Kimberly hotter. Rosaline was laughing because Kimberly had always given her a hard time about being the heaviest of the cheerleaders and her big ass. Maybe she wouldn't be the heaviest for long.  Trixie was laughing because she now had a devilishily brilliant idea of how to unseat Kimberly as captain. She would fatten her up. Find out her food weaknesses, keep bring them to her, and watch her ballowing. Fattening up Kimberly had been one of the ideas she had been thinking but hadn't been sure it would work until now. Ashley was laughing because she found it a sorta revenge against Kimberly for taking the position of captain from her. Karma had come back on Kimberly in her favor. She also took it to be a sign of what she needed to do to get the postion of captain, she had to figure out how to keep Kimberly gaining so she would be too fat to cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the girls realized just how fat Kimberly had already gotten though. Still though, it was not enough for Kimberly to be kicked off the squad and either Ashley or Trixie take over as captain. \"I guess you are not as dedicated to keeping in shape and being a cheerleader as you proclaim to be. You have been gone like only two weeks and you have already gotten a belly? It's disgusting. Not a way a cheer captain shoudl be acting\" Ashley said bitchily with a look of disgust across her face which only grew more when she poked Kimberly's soft and saw it ooze out completely. \"Oh my god, gross! You are fat\" Ashley said to Kimberly, still in that same bitchy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly felt both a mix of anger and hurt. On one hand she wanted to slap Ashley and get everyone started on their stretches and off focusing on her small weight gain. On the other hand, Ashley's words and belly poke had both hurt her and embarassed her. She wanted to run out of the gym and cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls were assuming that her return to school automatically meant her reinstatement as Captain over the squad.  Although she wanted to take charge and make everyone start doing warmup stretches Kimberly knew better.  Apart from the question of her own physical ability to do the routines the letter permitting her return to school was quite clear. Until her grades improved sufficiently she could not even be on the squad, much less be captain.   That hadn't yet happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she simply glared until she could finally find something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the only one with a little belly - but you're just lucky Ashley that I only dropped by today to visit.  When I come back for real and take charge again you'll find out just what dedication means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kimberly turned on her heels and left, her but wobbling in her overly tight outfit. .  Ashley smiled as she realized both her mistake and what it meant. If Kimberly had gotten so much fatter in just a couple of weeks then what would another few bring? The girl was in obvious denial. Of course there was the matter of Ashley's own burgeoning paunch, but that wasn't the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly went off just wanting to cry.  The good times with Brian, the fun at her grandmothers, all the joy of the past two weeks were so different than the rejection she felt from the squad.  Inside she realized that Ashley had won them to her side -and Kimberly wasn't sure what she wanted. But then she realized that she did in fact know what she wanted - Brian. Instead of shedding tears she reached for her cell phone and called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the hour he was at her side in Bob's Big Boy, feeding her a combo meal and sundae for comfort food and listening to her tale of woe.  Brian of course knew that it was good for Kim to leave the team, but instead he offered to redouble his efforts on improving her grades. This he knew would be successful - but along the way the gullible Kim would likely gain another 7-10 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even before, when they were initially just beginning to date, he knew of her on again, off again binging and dieting. Despite her status as a cheerleader he suspected that she could easily become a permanent plumper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d also seen the quiet support from her mom over the past two weeks, stocking the kitchen with goodies that Kim had been virtually inhaling. He\u2019d even been surprised by Kim herself when she teased him for not bringing her a dessert at lunch. And now she\u2019d reacted to criticism from er former classmates by calling him to have what amounted to a full meal after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike his girl friend, Brian knew the script for the next chapter. He knew he was already branded as a closet chubby chaser by Amber, no doubt learned from her new boyfriend who knew Brian was privately a fellow FA. If he positioned himself as a friend and tutor he would win from Kim her trust and respect, but he had to be careful to let indulging of her appetite be her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what folks do when they\u2019re out of work?

If you want to be captain you need grades \u2013 and hat means getting by your teachers.  Instead of thinking about them why not let me redouble our efforts \u2013 I know you can do it. I\u2019ve seen your improved cores and read your reports.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn other words, forget cheerleading for a month and be a 24/7 scholar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe we can stick in some diversions \u2013 but basically, yes.

I know its structured but it works\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly swallowed hard, suddenly realizing what a task master Brian might become.  But the next day she did as he had requested.  By the end of the final period she had the requested information for three of her five classes,(two of her teachers weren\u2019t that well organized).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts OK \u2013 three out of five is a good start.  Your place or the library?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm,\u201d Kim said, \u201cI guess my place, but before we go there could we swing by Taco Bell?  Just thinking about so much study has made me a bit hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, err, due.\u201d Brian replied, inwardly smiling that his plan was working just as designed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Taco Bell drive through Kim ordered a burrito supreme and two tacos. Brian had a Volcano box special. Then they went to her home and laid out their battle plan for the rest of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNow,\u201d said Brian after they were finished, \u201cyou have two quizzes on Friday. What do you say that if you get A\u2019s on both I have to take you to a nice restaurant \u2013 if you only get a B or C it\u2019s a cheeseburger at Mickey D\u2019s?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA cheeseburger on a Friday night? You have to be kidding,\u201d Kim objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI consider that the lesser option that I expect not to happen, , \u201c Brian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, instead of a cheeseburger can your wallet stand the Cheesecake Factory,\u201d Kim answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian thought quickly. That would be an expensive evening, but by catering to  Kim\u2019s impulsiveness he would not be responsible for the4 results..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, if if it makes you happy, nothing\u2019 is too good for my girl!\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say Kim had perfect scores on both quizzes and Brian took a hundred dollar bill from his savings account and made the reservations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to cost me, but its worth it,\u2019 he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cheesecake Factory is one of the more elite chains, with a 20 page menu that\u2019s even available in large print and Braille. It is definitely a special occasion or upper class formal dining establishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with appetizers of fried zucchini and a plate of ahi tartare, also known as tuna fish, garnished with avocado and soy ginger sesame sauce, Kim thought she had Brian eating out of her hand.  Leafing through the menu she'd ordered pasta d\u2019la vinci and he\u2019d opted or the Factory\u2019s famous meatloaf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo spend this kind of money on me, he must really are and want me o succeed,\u201d she thought, little realizing that she was doing just what he\u2019d hope \u2013 eating 2/3 of the appetizer delicacies., then sharing more than just her share as they sampled  part of each other\u2019s entr\u00e9es.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large portions left both of them stuffed and Brian didn\u2019t push dessert.  Instead he apologized for having over ordered on the appetizers and with great contrition offered to make it up by getting Kim some cheesecake to go.  She selected he caramel pecan turtle, and them Brian surprised her by ordering an entire cake so that Kim could \u201cshare it with her family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew she\u2019d no doubt give them a ice \u2013 but would wind up having the majority for herself.   Sore enough, she had a piece before retiring and two more the next day.  By Sunday, as they doubled down on a report for history, he discovered it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the next week, and the week after, and for two more the rhythm continued \u2013each day after school Kim would ask to top at this or that fast food place before burrowing into the books,  Each day Brian accommodated her,  Cheerleading was never mentioned, but  in mid week he\u2019d incentivize the academic goals they shared with food-based rewards.  And Kim played along because she was thoroughly enjoying what both Brian and her mom were facilitating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food sensations were great, her grades were way up and life with Brian was good. Still, in the back of her mind Kimberly remembered the mysterious incident of Brian suddenly cutting short an evening at his place.  She hadn\u2019t brought it up, but the question of his mysterious visitor hung unresolved. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite her curiosity of why Brian had cut short an evening at his place and who his mysterious visitor were, Kimberly could not work up the energy to investigate. All the studying and snacking had made her lazy. Instead of going out like she had when she was cheering, she would stay at home watching tv or a dvd or reading books and magazines as she snacked on whatever sweets her mom brought over to her. She was enjoying these lazy days and wasn't missing going out that much. Going out to dinner, the movies, and the mall for shopping with Brian satisfied her need to go out enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of her continued indulgence, Kimberly had no doubt that she had gained a couple more pounds though she hadn't weighed herself in awhile. She wasn't really worried about it or thinking about it too much as  she had no doubt that she would have no trouble working off the weight when she got back to cheerleading. She had been a little worried before about coming back and being out of shape when she was the captain but after seeing that the rest of the girls with the exception of Trixie who was too young to really be a threat anyway had gained weight themselves so she still would be in better shape then them no matter how much she had gained because she was sure they had gained more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill though, she couldn't help but wonder just how much weight she had gained. After another week of completing all her homework assignments and studying over delicious big snacks in additions to her big dinners and desserts, acing all her quizzes, and another big delicious meal at The Cheesecake Factory as her reward for doing well on her quizzes, she woke up on Saturday morning and decided to see just how much she now weighed. She sat up in bed, rubbed her eyes a little, pulled off her covers, got up, and headed for her bathroom. She walked over to the scale, stepped on, and down looked as the needle went up to 150 and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I am 150 pounds\" Kimberly gasped in shock. She couldn't believe that she had gained that much weight. I'm fat she thought to herself in horror. She stepped off the scale and walked over to the full lengh mirror and glaced over reflection. Her face was a little fuller but other then that there was no major difference and the fuller cheeks did not dimenish her pretty face, it was still as pretty as ever. She looked down to her breasts which had gone up a cup size from C to D and was now straiging her bra which was feeling very tight. Now this was a gain that she didn't mind. While she had loved her C's and was proud of them, she was definitely happy to increase her breast size to D which was even better. Her belly was not a soft round pot belly that was sticking out over the waistband of her panties which was now also quite tight. Her hips had widened and she now cleary had thick thighs that were slightly touching together. SHe turned around and gasped as she now had a soft round fat ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to look over body for a couple of minutes, trying to aborb and take in just how much she had gained. The more she looked over her body though, the less shocked and embarassed she felt. She realized that extra weight looked good on her and she liked how soft and flabby it felt. She had a more curvy feminine figure now which she loved. Her boyfriend still thought she was beautiful and in fact seemed even more smitten with her now. Plus she was enjoying getting to indulge in all of her favorite fatty foods. She was also comforted by the fact that she could loose all the weight when she got back to cheerleading. So with all that in mind, did she need to worry about 150 pounds? No she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her mom calling up to her that breakfast was ready, she heard her stomach growl in hunger. Despite how much she ate last night, she still very hungry. \"Be right down mom\" she called. She quicky peed, washed her hands and faced, brushed her hair, then walked back into her room. With it being a Saturday morning and feeling lazy, she slide on a pair of sweatpants which felt a little tighter and snugger then before, and slide on a white t-shirt, not caring that it rolled up revealing her potbelly, and quickly headed downstairs to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big smile spread across her face as she saw her mom greet her with a big stack of delicious chocolate chip cookies complete with butter, powder, and a bottle of maple syrup on the table. She also noticed a plate of cinnamon sugar poptarts on the table along with a glass of milk and orange juice on her side. \"Come sit down and eat hun\" her mom said sweetly as she smiled to herself as she saw her daugher's potbelly. \"Mm, chocolate chip pancakes and cinnamon sugar poptarts. Thanks mom\" she replied sweetly wtih a smile as she walked over to the table and took a seat before her mom set the plate of pancakes before. \"Dig in\" her mom said before going back over to the stove to pour herself a cup. Kimberly poured syrup all over pancakes, picked up her fork and knife, cut up a couple of big pieces, and quickly ate them. \"Ooh, soo good\" she moaned softly. Her mom poured herself a cup of coffee and took a sip while she happily watched her daughter indugle in the pancakes. The pancakes were so good that Kimberly couldn't resist and was starting to stuff them down her throat, only stoping to lick the syrup and powder off her lips, and wash it down with a couple sips of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her belly full of pancakes Kimberly plopped herself down in front of the wide screen television as her mom left the housed. She wasn\u2019t at all hungry after two pop tarts, four hotcakes and a generous serving of scrambled eggs. Her mom, accurately discerning what she\u2019d guessed was Brian\u2019s preference, had capitulated to her daughter\u2019s wish not to be constrained on calories and had been fulfilling her promise well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was bothering Kimberly was how she knew she\u2019d messed up in being such a diva with the cheer squad. She could see that fatter Ashley, fatter Amber and the reinstated fat Rosa weren\u2019t really anxious to have her back \u2013 and she couldn\u2019t very well ridicule them for their weights when she knew she\u2019d gotten bigger herself \u2013 almost as big as she\u2019d once been in her previous community. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previous week she\u2019d apologized to Rosa for kicking her off the squad and congratulated her on being reinstated.  Rosa seemed surprised, but accepted it graciously, even suggesting they do something together sometime. Kim had  emailed Rosa a message saying that Brian wasn\u2019t going to be free today so it would be an opportunity, but as she settled down into the divan still hadn\u2019t gotten a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian.  Again today she had no idea where he was.  He was there for her 2-3 nights a week helping with her studies and plying her with treats. She loved being with him, but there were those mysterious gaps in his schedule that he always managed to dodge accounting for. She didn\u2019t want to press him on it. But it styill bothered her in the back of her mind. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, around 11:00 her cell rang. It was Rosa, responding to her invitation. She had to do the family shopping at Wal-Mart \u2013 she was wondering if Kim wanted to come and then she\u2019d spring for lunch.  Knowing that Rosa\u2019s new boyfriend Bradley was a friend of Brian\u2019s, Kim saw this as a chance to pick Rosa\u2019s brain and readily accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim marveled at Rosa\u2019s obvious familiarity with grocery shpp9ng. as she swiftly filled the basket with over a hundred dollars worth of food.  They took it to Rosa\u2019s house where she offered Kim her choice of several Sam\u2019s Choice frozen delicacies that had to be either grilled or cooked in an oven,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo microwave?\u201d questioned Kim<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa shook her head. \u201cNot with these \u2013 the meat is not precooked, so it has to be done the old fashioned way. They\u2019re hand prepared to a certain stsge, then frozen to be finished in an oven or on the stove \u2013 see, the directions say \u201cdo not microwave: , We have chicken breast stuffed with mushrooms, cheese and crimini.  We also have them stuffed with jalape\u00f1os and cheeses, Tuscan lasagna, or beef stroganoff\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm \u2013 stroganoff?  That\u2019s beef and noodles, which sounds better than chicken.  Can I have that?\u201d Kim suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure enough, said Rosa, not noting anymore than Kim that the former cheerleading captain had elected the highest calorie choice of the four offerings.  While it and a chicken breast for Rosa cooked the girls put away the groceries, then had lunch. The latter included a dessert of black cherry ice cream and some pecan cookies. Naturally the girl\u2019s discussed their boy friends, which led Kim to share with Rosa the mystery of Brian\u2019s absences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is strange,\u201d Rosa conceded, \u201cand I can only say I\u2019m pretty sure its not any other girls \u2018cause he\u2019s really into you. He\u2019s shared that with Brad. But beyond that I\u2019m not going, except to say you should get the full details out of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have an idea of what he does?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but not enough to be safe talking about it. I\u2018d probably get everything wrong and it wouldn\u2019t be the whole story.   But you\u2019ve got a great boy friend who cares about you - my advice is communicate and don\u2019t lose him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that is all Rosa would say.  That night Brian picked her up for a party but there was another couple in the car.  During the course of the evening Kim, nervous over her desire to confront Brian, ate incessantly, a fact others at the party couldn\u2019t help but notice. Before they headed home Kim asked Brian if the other couple could be dropped off first because she needed to talk to him privately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, babe\u201d he replied, as he glanced at her full torso stretching the limits of an obviously tight top.  Kim was definitely developing love handles and the beginning of a second chin. He had seen her plow through at least 1200 calories worth of goodies during the evening and he smiled. thinking, of where the results would turn up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were alone, Kim was very forthright, \u201cBrian, i know you have a secret, and i have to be honest, although its really none of my business, curiosity is killing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this secret is?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere you spend part of your time at, and disappear to at the drop of a hat. Last week you were pulled out of class at 11:00 and i saw your car drive off \u2013 you skipped lunch and were back late for fifth period. That wasn\u2019t for a school club. I know. At this kind of thing goes on every week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian sighed. Kim was obviously thinking for herself, and becoming more assertive, both of which were good things. But it also meant he needed to share a family secret \u2013 something he wasn\u2019t supposed to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, it wasn\u2019t for school, and I wish I could tell you more. What triggered all this now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonest? i tried to discuss this with Rosa and all she\u2019d tell me is that its not another woman and i\u2019d need to get more from you. I think you see my problem -everybody but me knows something that you won\u2019t tell me about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim squirmed I her seat, pulling nervously at the tight blouse containing her belly roll. Brian knew he was in a spot with his chubby girl friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually they don\u2019t know \u2013 although they may think they do. But I get your point Kim.  The problem is that i do have a sort of secret double life of sorts that I\u2019m not supposed to discuss with anyone. But i understand your feelings. Give me a couple of days and I\u2019ll see if something can be done.?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Kim went along with his request. She knew she\u2019d crossed a line but luckily he\u2019d not refused outright and dumped her. To her surprise it didn\u2019t take a \u201ccouple of days.\u201d Late the next morning, Sunday, she got a call from Brian asking her to a fast food picnic lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll will be revealed, \u201c he promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim accepted and Brian picked her up, driving about twenty minutes out of town towards a state park that overlooked the city. Before entering the park he swung by Burger King and ordered a variety of burgers and sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will assure freshness, \u201c he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim\u2019s taste buds were already salivating as Brian pulled into a picnic area that was also part of a lookout point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian walked with Kimberly over to an isolated picnic table, well beyond earshot of anyone else in the park.  He unpacked the assortment of burgers and side orders. To anyone else it appeared as two young people enjoying a meal while overlooking the busy metropolis below.  But Kimberly sensed, correctly, that Brian was setting the stage for some major disclosures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s enjoy the burgers \u2013 I bought extra just to make sure we don\u2019t run out..  I have permission now to use my own discretion, so I\u2019m going to elect to tell you everything, so, please settle in and listen,\u201d Brian began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPermission?  From who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents.  For eleven years I\u2019ve lived a bit of a double life. They thought that I was too young to deal with the questions and assumptions that would come up so I had to agree to keep a family secret starting at age seven \u2013 they\u2019d tell school authorities and others who needed to know, but I wasn\u2019t to say anything. But Rosa is correct. Since its obvious that  some people have their ideas its best that you know the truth directly from me, because I don\u2019t know what Rosa thinks she knows or how complete or accurate it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim\u2019s mind was reeling. This obviously wasn\u2019t going to be a simple sound byte answer like she\u2019d imagined it could be. She knew that she would now likely have to keep whatever it was secret as well \u2013 and if school authorities were complicit  it had to be major. \u201cYou\u2019re making this all mysterious \u2013 all that she said was that it isn\u2019t s another girl and beyond that I should talk to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right there \u2013 Victor is not a girl; he\u2019s my cousin.  But to me he is like a sick brother that I have to be there for, even though that\u2019s not practical or possible most of the time, Brian confided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you\u2019re confusing me. You have a brother,  or cousin, who has made you lead a double life since age seven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt began before that \u2013 I was seven when they institutionalized him at Chesire Hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChesire Hall \u2013 that\u2019s a state mental institution?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian nodded his head. \u201cYes, and when I\u2019m needed they call me and I go. Its what I promised him I\u2019d do and its where I go when I disappear. You can imagine what would happen if hat got out around school - that I go to a mental hospital 2-3 times a week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKids would assume you had a problem and tease you? Or at least treat you different\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian set his jaw, his eyes teared up but he spoke with a firm, almost defiant tone Kim had never heard. be. \u201cExactly \u2013 and even their parents would make them not associate with me. Its happened to others if something\u2019s different you stay away from it. It could have been a nightmare. But Vic needs me and I wasn\u2019t going to abandon him. The only way he was willing to go was my promising to come see him \u2013 and I\u2019ve kept that promise.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so why does he have to be there?\u201d Kim inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian took a deep breath, relieved that Kim was reacting with interest rather than the rejection he had feared. At least she was wanting to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVictor was brain injured in an accident \u2013 his mother, my mom\u2019s sister,  blamed herself and eventually committed suicide. He came to live with us and as kids I was the one person he\u2019d relate to and act halfway normal. At times he\u2019d act crazy because people couldn\u2019t understand him and have to be sedated. But I can always understand him, at times its like my brain zones off into another mode and I\u2019ll even talk like he does \u2013 except its like half talking, half telepathy. But I can come back out of it at will; he can\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, so its like you\u2019re in another dimension?\u201d Kim aid, struggling to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of a dream state, but while I can wake up he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Brian replied. \u201cBut let me tell you everything <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. In preschool and kindergarten it worked out OK, but I kept maturing and he didn\u2019t.  I could calm him by acting like he does at his level but then I wasn\u2019t relating to others. After first grade it became obvious it wasn\u2019t going to work out because I was getting into fights protecting him. . So thy separated us and sent him to a special home after I agreed to help out 1-2 times a week and be on call when needed. They moved him to Chesire Hhall four years ago.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwice a week I stop by and we play like pre-schoolers. It calms him and then we can talk, at his level of course and with our minds linked. He can\u2019t do hat with anyone else. Usually that\u2019s enough to get him through and keep him off the dopey meds for a few more days. .  But sometimes he acts out before the next visit and that\u2019s when I get special calls.  That time at my place when I got summoned?  He\u2019d locked himself in part of the kitchen and wouldn\u2019t come out until I showed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow \u2013 so you\u2019re basically a caretaker for a disabled person who can\u2019t communicate with anyone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:Yeah, sort of \u2013 but you\u2019re at least not mocking him.  That\u2019s what happened in first grade. I was constantly getting into fights to protect him. And you\u2019re new in town \u2013 you don\u2019t have the scandal about his mom being shared in your family.  What happened with her wasn\u2019t Victor\u2019s doing. He was only two \u2013 I was three..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was a scandal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes \u2013 his Dad left with some woman, then his mom got involved with a married bigwig. That affair was somehow tied to the accident that injured Victor and his mom kept blaming herself. That\u2019s why she finally committed suicide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s it \u2013 a family tragedy you have to live with?  Brian. I wish you could have told me earlier. I must say I admire you for being so loyal to your cousin \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry for being so distrustful,\u201d Kim poured out her thoughts in a burst of remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApology accepted \u2013 and believe me, Kim, with understanding. Its been a blank chapter I wasn\u2019t allowed to share. I hope it doesn\u2019t affect us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim already knew that the only effect was to admire Brian more. She had an idea that would convey what she felt. \u201cWell, does Victor mind if you bring someone along on occasion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian was impressed. \u201cThanks for the offer.   I\u2019ve never asked, but I will. You know, Kim, you\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian smiled, the maturity that transcended his chronological age showing. \u201cInstead of looking down on me for letting something interfere with us and our relationship you\u2019re actually wanting to reach out and help Vic \u2013 I think you\u2019re beginning to case about others in away you haven\u2019t done before. Your cheer leader buddies might be surprised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim shifted her ample buttocks a bit. She\u2019d finished two burgers and some fries while listening to Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. About that. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m much a part of that scene anymore. I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight and you can see what I\u2019ve done here \u2013demolished two burgers, fires and a soda and I still have room for more. I\u2019ve lost weight from this level before, but with you I\u2019m not just into even trying. You wouldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019m up to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian of course didn\u2019t know and wanted to ask, but he was swift enough not to, \u201cNot my business, but I think you fill out your clothes just fine \u2013 and in case yo\u2019ve not noticed the rest of the squad isn\u2019t tiny either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrian, I\u2019m bigger than any of them, believe me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine, but if you don\u2019t want to be a cheerleader and instead enjoy food with me that\u2019s great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was startled. \u201cYou mean that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.  Kim, I can\u2019t free Victor from his prison. But you are emerging like a butterfly from the cocoon you\u2019ve lived in all your life. I could see when I first met you that you were trying to compete for popularity when you really didn\u2019t need to. And you let yourself be used to bring down Ashley just because some people in this town didn\u2019t like her family. But I knew you weren\u2019t a party to it \u2013 just a girl trying to establish herself in a new town  Now Ashley\u2019s doing her thing and you have me.  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s enough for you. But it is for me,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute \u2013 you say I was used?  By who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may need to talk to Rosa to confirm this, but I\u2019m told the squad members have a theory. They think your cheerleading abilities were exploited to pressure the school admin by people who don\u2019t like her family. With all the work she\u2019d put in there is no way a new girl in school could have been so easily edged out if her last name was Murphy or Garcia. You had help you never knew about.  Ashley stayed on instead of quitting because she likes cheerleading, but she was conspired against.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim paused and thought for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t see it then, but you could be right.  I ran for cheer captain because my parents said I should. They\u2019d been told by some people in town that with my background I could easily make it, that no one at the school was really that skilled or motivated. I was too new in town to know that last part was a lie. Ashley doesn\u2019t need help from others to be captain and still get her grades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with practice you could do both at he same time as well. You know I\u2019m more hanging out with you than tutoring nowadays. But unless cheer means as much to you as it does to Ashley I don\u2019t care if you go back or not.  I know your improved grades will allow you to make the effort the right way, but what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and then there\u2019s also this.\u201d  Kim took a second double cheeseburger, her third burger of the afternoon, as she watched Brian\u2019s grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you like watching me eat- and to beat out Ashley I couldn\u2019t go on doing  this,\u201d she said as she took a big bite.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kim had departed from her date with Brian wondering if she truly knew anything about what was actually real. He\u2019d told her that her election to be cheerleading captain was effectively a power play with her as a pawn.  Rosa had initially sent her to Brian to find out his secret \u2013 but now Brian had told her that Rosa held the key to a further secret, one involving her, one that her parents apparently had a role in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her dad out of town Kimberly knew her mom and her would be together alone that very evening. They were having a classic comfort food, tamale pie, <br>\r\nwith ground beef, onion, bell pepper, tomatoes, Anaheim green chilies, whole corn,  olives, raisins, and cheddar cheese plus Chile pepper and cumin topped with corn bread and sour cream.  It bordered on the divine for Kim\u2019s taste buds. As her mom anticipated Kim enjoyed it and even dished out seconds as she divulged Brian\u2019s secret while as her mom listened attentively. , but when it came time to serve dessert her borderline stout daughter surprised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, after all this hot stuff I\u2019ll have the ice cream in a minute or two, but mom we need to talk,\u201d Kim posited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about darling?\u201dHer mom asked. She knew it wasn\u2019t weight, because she\u2019d just polished off two helpings and was going to have ice cream. And her grades were going just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose idea was it for me to try to be a cheerleading captain?  \u2018Cause they didn\u2019t tell you and dad the real truth. They said the team here was a bunch of no talents with no one qualified to lead them. Actually they have plenty of talent and Ashley is a great leader,\u201d Kim gushed in a torrent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they talked to your father, not me, but one was the realtor who sold us the house, Bob Hedges. I think the other two were connected with the school board, her mom replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould it be that they were just jealous of Ashley\u2019s family and looking to freeze her out?\u201d Kim pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know. But why? her mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I thought I was such great stuff and better than others when actually they\u2019re just as good \u2013 maybe better. I feel like I was played for a fool. And I feel ashamed. I\u2019ve already apologized to Rosa for kicking her off the team, but now I think there\u2019s more to be done. . .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re planning to talk with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so.  With the weight I\u2019ve gained I may just let Ashley keep her position. If what I\u2019m learning is true I\u2019m better off just being with Brian. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Kim informed Rosa that she\u2019d done what she suggested and talked with Brian, and now they needed to get together again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, what about Arby\u2019s after school,\u201d the plump coed replied, adjusting her Chicana rhinestone tank top.  Rosa loved the clothing line favored by her mom in plus sizes, even though she personally still easily fit into the traditional line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon Rosa and Kim sat down with curly fries and toasted subs, hers a French dip and Swiss while Kim had a Philly beef. Rosa  started things out with a friendly note, \u201cSo now you know about Brian and his cousin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d answered Kim, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just have told me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa tilted her head and raised her eyebrow. \u201cLike I said, I hear a lot of things but its bits and pieces \u2013 best that you go to the source.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrian says you\u2019re a good source on how I really became team captain,\u201d Kim  said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa sighed. \u201cSome people with long memories remember a lot of stuff including why the school team is called the Boars. Ashley had me tell her that story earlier this semester, \u2013 but short version is, some in this town blame her family for a lot of stuff and will take it out on whoever has the Morgan name, even a teenager in high school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo they went to my parents and said \u201cyou have this great daughter\u201d when really I was just a shill \u2013they wanted to shaft Ashley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes - and to the principal and superintendent and said \u201cyou\u2019d better make this happen or we don\u2019t support you come next election on in your budget requests. \u201c\u201c continued Rosa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s blackmail!\u201d Kim exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes \u2013 and neither your Ashley knew what was happening at the time, Neither did I \u2013 then. The good news is, she doesn\u2019t hate you. She\u2019s aware it wasn\u2019t your doing. Thank Randy for that. He\u2019s been a saint in all this,\u201d related Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre he and Brian in on this together? I know they\u2019re friends,\u201d  Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa took a deep breath and chewed on her sandwich before continuing. \u201cI\u2019m sure they communicate at least.  Its no secret what happened, Kim; you just weren\u2019t close enough to anyone that thy could tell you until now, When you came and apologized to me I knew you were rethinking your positions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim close her eyes. \u201cYou know I plan on talking to Ashley next, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiled. \u201cI was expecting it \u2013 and she is too.  Do you want to do it over dinner tonight?  I can call her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim hesitated. \u201cI suppose Amber, Trixie and Linda all know as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa shook her head. \u201cNot from my lips.  Ashley came to me because Randy sent her. What the guys may or may not have said to one another, I can\u2019t say.  But since Brian and Randy sent you and Ash to me and the others haven\u2019t come I tend to think they\u2019re in the dark as to all the details, That\u2019s what Bradley has told me.  I think our guys are up to something but are keeping it under wraps for now.  I\u2019ve been told that we still have basketball season to complete, then it will be time for some decisions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, call Ashley. I do need to make amends and he sooner the better.\u2019 Kim replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supper at Ashley\u2019s was scheduled for four hours later and proved very cordial. Kim was impressed with the elegant  manor to which the head cheerleader had been born. As a military child used to government housing in a dozen location in her ife it seemed somewhat pretentious, but Ashley moved in it with a grace free of any self consciousness.  This was her turf and she treated both Rosa and Kim as equals.  This egalitarian approach wasn\u2019t something rank-oriented military families did, but she followed Rosa\u2019s lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper, a fine chicken cacciatore with mashed potatoes, green salad and asparagus, Ashley\u2019s mom discreetly served a cobbler and ice cream dessert and left the girl to their meeting.  Rosa asked Ash to share the tale of their grandfathers, which Ashley did, then remarked, \u201cnow you know st least some of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts been this way for forty years,\u201c sighed Ashley. \u201cIf not the boar thing then downtown development, if not development then factories.  Its all class envy by people who want things their way or the highway, and if they can\u2019t get it thery turn nasty.\u201d\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim thought of her father\u2019s military background. \u201cCan\u2019t you counterattack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a practical matter, no. If we use raw economic power it creates a rallying point that drains resources even if we win. People always want to believe the big fish are exploiting the small ones \u2013 even when actually sometimes the big fish  are protecting the smallest,\u201d Ashley explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Kim asked as she finished her cobbler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRosa?\u201d Ashley said, a touch of weariness in her voice. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa closed her eyes, took a deep breath and began. \u201cA hundred times and more Ashley\u2019s family has blocked attempts to oust Hispanic businesses, helped families without insurance with medical bills, ad interceded with government agencies. A phone call from certain people in our community to her dad, his father, his grandfather, for four generations. But always behind the scenes so that it doesn\u2019t become an endless line of beggars. But when the need is real, they\u2019ve been there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was dumbfounded. \u201cWow \u2013 and I come on the scene and act like a bully and you just took it.  I-I-I\u2019m so sorry Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked at Kim seriously, wanting her to understand something vital. \u201cMy family, especially my Dad, knew you were being used and why, Kim, but I couldn\u2019t hit back. The temptation was to just walk away and quit It was what they expected and deciding to stay wasn\u2019t easy. But I was on the team because I wanted to help put on a show, not be the big cheese. I have the brains and grades to make my name sometime later. Cheerleading for me is fun \u2013 that\u2019s why I stayed despite the injustice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then when I really messed up you made your move.\u201d Kim noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, there was that.\u201d Ashley admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim let out a breath. \u201cDid you know I\u2019ve thought of not even trying to come back? I\u2019ve gained weight, gotten a boyfriend ans a new outlook on life. Cheer isn\u2019t a big a deal fr me as it is for you I suspect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s interest was piqued. Randy had suggested this possibility, but now it was being openly discussed. \u201cHave you decided?  \u201cCause I know the school authorities are under the same pressures as they were before \u2013 they don\u2019t like me, my weight or the size of the team. We\u2019re in their face as the big bad bold Boars. But if you get your grades up I know I have to step down\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, knowing what I do now, I can\u2019t see it. Even before I was hesitant. Brian says its up to me, and when I lay this out I think my parents will too.  But can I be the one to break the news?\u201d Kim asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded her head. \u201cComing from you I think is the only way to protect everyone \u2013 including the faculty. It gives them cover.\u201d .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I say something,\u201d interjected Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d replied Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore anyone says anything final to anyone check with Brian and Randy \u2013 this conversation is all good but they\u2019re up to more than even I know for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just couldn't wear those jeans anymore, or they'll burst off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn panick, she looked everywhere in the bathroom to find something else to wear. Luckily, Kimberly had once left a skirt here. It was very short, form fitted and black. She tried it on : it still fitted due to its stretchy fabric, and it was more confortable than her jeans. However, the outline of her bulging stomach was very visible and it exposed plenty of softened thighs. Angrily, she pulled her tank top to show more cleavage, so her boyfriend's view would be distracted from the flawed zones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVowing to diet, Kimberly went out of the bathroom and joigned Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to wear something sexier for you...\" she said, her body swaying more than usual as she walked to her boyfriend.</span></div></div>",

Normally she would go out bare naked, showing off her body, and not hide in the room in her bra and panties. But Kimberly now started to feel a little less confident with the new layers of fat all over her body. As soon as she got to the door she heard footsteps coming her way so she jumped back into bed and cover herself with blankets. As soon as he came back in he started to change his shirt and put some stuff in his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happen honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O nothing, something just came up and I gotta go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, why do you have to leave now?

What made it worst was all the clothes she was trying to wear. Even for her old figure the clothes would clung tightly around her body, but now it just squeezed the soft layer of fat she had developed. The black panties she was wearing now just sank into her ass fat, as it was becoming the fattest part of her body. A small muffin top was even formed with the tight panties she wore.

It had taken two weeks at home to finish the twenty page report and study enough to be getting positive feedback from her instructors. Since it was the weekend her parents had let her go to Brian house, but now it was ruined and she wanted to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating constantly can have a unique effect on a person who has been used to gaining a few pounds, then dieting to cut back. Kim was one especially vulnerable, because she had played the yo-yo game at least a dozen tines and had actually once been far heavier \u2013 topping out over 160 only two years before. Persons who have lost weight have latent fast cells waiting like deflated balloons to be refilled, and an influx of calories is all they need.  Since cell walls don\u2019t need to be rebuilt re-gain occurs at twice the rate of brand new pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly in her denial knew none of this.  All she knew was that she\u2019d been enjoying obscene quantities of fast foods courtesy of Brian and her refilling cells now needed their fix. She was confident that she wouldn\u2019t gain from appeasing her hunger pangs but knew hat she needed food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped at a Taco Bell.  A burrito grande and four tacos sounded about right.  She went in and ordered, adding a large raspberry ice tea to the mix, then sat down with her tray. Mechanically she began devouring her order, still wondering about Brian\u2019s mysterious caller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she got home to receive two bits of news.  A note from the school informed her that her suspension for extorting homework help ha expired and that her grades had improved enough to allow her to return to school; she was however still under academic suspension relative to the cheerleading team pending additional progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other news was that her grandparents had paid the family a surprise vist and she was invited to their retreat on the lake or the weekend.  Still annoyed at Brian she decided to accept and let him stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim grandparents had always indulged the chubbier version of their granddaughter, and this weekend was no exception.  On their way to the cabin they stopped at a Perkins family restaurant where Kim reverted to type, enjoying a mouthwatering home style pot roast dinner.  It was filling, but that didn\u2019t keep her grandmother from encouraging her to have a piece of chocolate French silk pie for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day saw Kimberly enjoying pancakes and eggs for breakfast, something she never did at home, then fishing for awhile with grandpa.  Pastrami sandwiches and ice cream were lunch, followed by a shopping trip to the local Wal-Mart, where her grandmother discreetly pressed several outfits on her because it was \u201ctoo warm to be wearing those sweats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Kimberly her own mom had suggested that this be done and supplied the funds. It was obvious to everyone except the vain Kim that she needed to move up a couple of sizes in her wardrobe before returning to school.  Kim tried on the outfits and felt much more comfortable, telling her grandma that \u201cWally World gets sizes right \u2013these actually look and feel good,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma just smiled and invited Kim to share an in-house McDonalds meal with her at the Wal-Mart before they grabbed Grandpa and headed home. Kim had a Big Mac value meal with a side cheeseburger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Kim was eager to get back to school and glad to have clothes that hadn\u2019t shrunk.  Still in denial about her own gain she had a full supper, discovering to her surprise that er grandparents had brought an entire pie from Perkins. Then, after her grandparents departed, she spent the evening on the Internet with a bag of pretzels at her side.  Brian still hadn\u2019t called by 11:00 and the Pretzels were gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly slipped into the kitchen and indulged in the final piece of pie.  It was yummy. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The result was a further easing of Kimberly's  eating habits.. She ate full meals and supper plus snacks such as pretzels and chips. All of this did not go unnoticed by her mom, who began to get curious. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling,\" she asked one evening as Kimberly brought a large bowl of ice cream into the living room to eat in front of the HD television, \"are you that upset over the cheerleading situation, because you seem to be eating a bit more than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all this studying seems to have given me an appetite, but I don't think its any big deal. Once my grades are back up I'll take care of Ashley soon enough\" she replied defensively. \"Do I look like I've gained that much weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, not really. Not that I can tell, at least yet. But taking pop tarts to school after a big breakfast could get you there eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly recalled that she had indeed taken a couple of pop tarts that morning after a breakfast that included scrambled eggs, O'brien potatoes and an oversized blueberry muffin. She was however relieved that her mom apparently hadn't noticed her clothes getting tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know mom - I'll try and watch it. But the comfort food does seem to help me study better, really.  I showed you my test scores after Brian's help, haven't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" her mom nodded, recalling that whenever Brian came by he also had something for he and his pupil to share.  Even if it wasn't yet that noticeable she knew that her daughter had to be picking up a bit of weight.  But, if she was happy it didn't matter that much.  She resolved to make sure the kitchen stayed well supplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly's dad heard the exchange, but held his peace. He wanted his wife and daughter to be happy and really didn't think Kimberly had a problem any more than her two older siblings. He was more concerned about her relationship with Brian.  He was a nice kid but still male.  Her dad figured it was safer and better for them to be at his house with full kitchen privileges than hanging out somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school Brian was monopolizing Kimberly's time, making sure that they ate lunch together and fetching her food while she saved their seat. She appreciated the attention, and actually looked forward to the daily variety of entrees and desserts that had twice the calories of her previous fare.  He would then drive her home, promising to return later after she'd done her homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly really wanted to recover her captaincy and actually was doing the assigned classwork, producing improved papers and test scores that were genuine.  But being in the house after school alone she was also now frequently ready for a snack first - or else would ask Brian to stop or some fast food first.  She was a getting used to eating 4-5 times a day, and it wasn't a lo-cal diet.</span></div></div>",

I've got some classwork on my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hastened to the dessert section and got two pieces of peach pie a la mode with double scoops.and was happy to see the delighted expression on Kimberly's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's the way to treat a girl,\" she exclaimed as Brian continued to smile happily while she devoured her portion .From a distance Trixie took note of what Brian had done.- living up to his reputation as Amber had predicted.  What surprised her was that Kim had initiated the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she up to?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly in fact wasn't counting calories but compliments, and Brian had her eating like the subject of one of Pavlov's experiments.  That afternoon she asked if they could stop at the Burger King drive thru for a Cheese Whopper and a malt, not objecting when Brian added fries. She knew that would appease her appetite until supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night there was no dessert. Her mom announced that she had a surprise when Brian got there at 8:00.  It turned out to be a freshly prepared Boston cream pie that had been in the refrigerator for hours - filled with custard and topped with a chocolate fudge frosting.  Each of the two teens had a double portion while Kimberly's mom had one herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis rhythm of consumption continued for four weeks and then, one day during her final period, Kim was called into the school counselor's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations,\" she was informed.  \"Your teachers report your grades have improved in every subject. We can clear you to rejoin the cheerleading squad next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimbely was at first estatic - but then suddenly began for the first time to wonder how much she'd gained during her six week break.  After school, instead of swinging by a drive thru she asked Brian to take her home.  There she tried on her cheerleading outfits and her worst fears were confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what!\" she said to Brian \"All this studying has kept me from working out and my uniforms don't fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She still doesn't realize how much she's also been eating,\" Brian realized to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd hate to see you put thru it, but I suppose we could put you on a diet along with an exercise program I guess,\" he replied. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would take a month - and then my grades would probably slip again. And I've liked sharing food and studies with you  - we'd have to stop doing that. What do you say that instead I just let the cheerleading go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian's face lit up. \"Suits me just fine. Personally I like every bit of whatever little added weight you've put on..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement confirmed what Kimberly had heard and suspected was true - Brian would never say it, but he didn't mind her getting chubby. in fact probably preferred it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, 'cause I know there is a Pepperidge Farm coconut layer cake in the pantry with our name on it.  Mom was saving it for tonight but why not now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstonished at this turn of events, Brian willingly.went along.  After he left, Kimberly knew she next had to deal with her parents, which actually meant her mom since her Dad was out of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening she deliberately ate very moderately, then told her mom very solemly.  \"Mom, I need to talk with you. I have good news and bad news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially expecting some horrible news such as unwanted pregnancy, her mom was relieved when Kimberly continued, \"The good news is that I've pulled my grades up enough that I can rejoin the cheerleading squad - the bad news is that with all this studying and inactivity I've outgrown my cheerleading outfits.  There are only six weeks to go in the season anyway, and if I try to lose weight it will likely be over. What do you think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does Brian think?\" her mom  replied cautiously. She'd seen this coming as her daughter had feasted morning after morning on high carb breakfasts, then had more high calorie snacks at night. She was unaware of the desserts at lunch or afternoon drive-thru treats, but even without them the pattern and its consequences had been apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He say its all fine with him - he doesn't want me trying to lose anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your father has been predicting this, we're really happy about your grades improving and the weight isn't an issue. I know you're right about Brian. He loves you.  We'll go shopping for some clothes that fit better this Sunday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mom, you're the greatest,\" Kimberly exclaimed and gave her mom a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly she was thankful that she could still enjoy her big breakfasts in peace. <br>\r\n.</span></div></div>",

She had taken her position as Captain, and while there were some in the school who claimed this was because Kimberly was a better cheerleader, Ashley knew different. Ashley knew the only reason Kimberly had been able to replace her was due to her flaunting of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley herself had a great body, but she flaunted it around far less than Kimberly did. As rivals, she and Kimberly were pretty evenly matched...but Ashley had one big advantage over Kimberly - her family were stinking rich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ashley was planning to use her family wealth to her advantage. Using a few thousands dollars she had convinced her parents to loan her, she had purchased an experimental 'weight gain serum' from the internet, which apparently caused whoever took it to gain weight uncontrollably. Ashley planned to use this serum to gain her revenge on Kimberly, and without her perfect body, Kimberly would be nothing. Ashley would reclaim her position as Captain, and Kimberly would pay for her arrogance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Monday morning, Ashley headed into school as usual, only today, she had a nasty surprise waiting for Kimberly. When lunched rolled around, the cheerleaders headed into the cafeteria, and selected their usual healthy meal - a light salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I bring yours over to you Kimberly?\" Ashley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Kimberly said, and she walked to the girls usual table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the other girls gave Ashley an odd look. They looked astonished that Ashley was being so nice to her hated rival. Ashley ignored their shocked looks, and smiled to herself as she grabbed two salads and headed over to the table where Kimberly was sitting. She pulled the vial of weight gain serum out of her pocket, and quickly tipped it all over Kimberly's salad. Before anyone had seen her, she slipped the empty vial back into her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley reached the table, and set down the two plates, making sure to place the one with the serum in in front of Kimberly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ash,\" Kimberly said as she grabbed and fork and dug in to her salad. \"Nice to see you finally giving your Captain some respect. I didn't think you were ever going to fall into line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had to stop herself from losing her temper. \"Of course I was, and I think your doing a great job...Captain...\" Ashley said, and she had to bite her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was tucked into her salad. Ashley had worried that she would somehow be able to taste the weight gain formula, but apparently it was flavourless. The plan was working perfectly, providing the serum actually worked and wasn't some kind of scam. But surely something that cost thousands of dollars had to be worth the money?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley ate her own salad as the rest of the girls joined them, and Kimberly finished up, clearing her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled to herself...this was going to be fun...</span></div></div>",

Maybe you guys should have it a miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled to herself and kept looking down at her plate so as not to reveal anything. \"Nothing wrong with mine,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine either, I feel fine,\" said Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I wouldn't want everybody getting sick...we can't afford to get out of shape,\" Kimberly said sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should just ate it too fast?\" Trixie suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly glared at her. \"What are you trying to say, Trixie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um...nothing Kimberly...just a suggestion,\" Trixie said nervously, backing off immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do look a little bloated,\" Rosaline dared to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do NOT!\" Kimberly screeched, but when she looked down at her stomach, she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Ashley asked, trying her best to sound concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...\" said Kimberly. \"I'll see you all later, I've got things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Kimberly stood up and marched out of the cafeteria as the other girls gave each other confused looks. Ashley simple smiled, everything seemed to be going as planned, and much quicker than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly exited the cafeteria in a hurry and headed for the girls changing rooms near the gym. Although she hadn't mentioned it to the other girls, when she had looked down, she had seen her stomach looking rather bloated - and for a cheerleader of her status, that would be pretty embarassing to be seen with. Her apparently sudden fullness was a mystery to her, and she didn't have a clue how her belly had gotten so full just from eating one salad. She hadn't been eating anything differently lately...so perhaps this had nothing to do with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly wasn't sure why her stomach had expanded, but she knew she would need to conceal it from the other girls and students. She headed for the girls changing rooms, which were empty at lunch time, and pulled up her tight tank top to reveal her bloated stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" She asked herself in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like she had eaten a full meal rather than a salad, and with her top pulled up she was sure her belly had gotten a little bigger since leaving the cantine. She poked at her stomach, expecting it to be hard and bloated and full - but instead her fingers sank slightly into it. She pulled them back in alarm and quickly gave her exposed midriff another poke...it felt...flabby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible...\" Kimberly told herself. \"This is impossible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't be putting on weight, she was always so careful about what she ate, and had the best body in school. How could this have happened? She continued to rub her puffy stomach to make sure it was real, and decided that she needed to get out of here before anyone saw her. The girls already thought she was feeling unwell, so all she had to day was go home sick. Then make her next move and try and get rid of this newfound flab. </span></div></div>",

The staff were convinced by her groaning and moaning, and gave her the rest of the day off. Kimberly quickly dropped the act when she got outside, and got home as fast as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering her empty house, she hurried up to her room and went to get a closer look at her stomach in her full body length mirror - which she would often spend hours admiring herself in. But now she wasn't admiring, now she was horrified. She could have sworn that her stomach had bloated a little bigger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly turned to the side and rubbed her stomach, noting how soft it felt. She pressed her hand into it, hoping to see how much flab had gathered on her once perfectly toned abs, and felt her hand sink a little into her stomach flesh. It definately seemed to be getting flabbier, and she had absolutely no idea why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to exercise,\" Kimberly told herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately lay down on the floor and started doing sit-ups and crunches, her stomach felt strange after so many years of having a toned belly, but she persisted, panting and breathing out like her life depended on it as she performed her exercises for the next few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of exercise, Kimberly was totally worn out. She collapsed back onto her comfy bed and looked down at her stomach, then gave it a poke, it seemed harder and firmer now, and she guessed that her rigorous exercise had made it toughen back up. Exhausted, Kimberly declined to eat dinner in the evening, and climbed into bed - hoping that her stomach would have gone down by the morning.</span></div></div>",

As she groaned and blinked and rubbed her eyes, she suddenly realised she needed to check out her stomach. Part of her was afraid to lift up the covers and look down at herself, but the other part of her was desperate to see whether her curiously bloated stomach was still visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly pulled the covers back, and nearly screamed. Not only was her belly still bloated, it had gotten even bigger! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Kimberly gasped. \"No, no NO! This can't be happening to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was now pushing against her pyjama top, it's increasing size straining the buttons of the silky garment. Kimberly pushed her hands into her bulging belly, and felt her hands sink into what seemed to be a layer of fat. Kimberly had no idea how this was possible, particularly after all the exercise she had done last night. She could have accepted it if her belly had not returned to abs in the space of a day, but the fact had it had gotten even bigger was too much for her to believe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly jumped out of bed and stepped up to the mirror. As she examined her body, she noticed that certain other parts of her figure had begun to grow larger, namely her breasts. Taken aback by her bulging boobs, Kimberly reached her hands up to touch them - they felt soft, but larger than they had been yesterday. Something was definately wrong...although...she didn't mind her breasts getting bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kimberly didn\u2019t exactly keep a vast array of loose fitting clothes, as she purposefully chose the tightest and skimpiest outfits to show off her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly did, however, have a few things that might conceal her strangely swollen belly. While they were not the most fashionable outfit, she decided on wearing sweats, as they were very loose fitting, and could conceal her body quite well for today. Kimberly pulled out the dull grey sweats and changed into them. She did her hair and make up as usual, making sure she still looked good, and then she set off for school. Luckily, the squad was not having practise today, so the girls would not get a chance to see her in her cheerleading outfit \u2013 which would give away the fact she had grown straight away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at school, Kimberly headed straight for her first class of the day \u2013 History. She hurried into the classroom, sucking in her belly just in case anyone caught a glimpse of it as she walked past. She then chose her regular seat beside Ashley, who was either smiling at her, or smirking at her. Kimberly wasn\u2019t sure which. She had never really trusted Ashley, who she suspected had always been jealous of her since she arrived at Oakes High. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Kimberly,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cAre you okay? We were all worried about you yesterday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly wondered why Ashley was being so nice, she wasn\u2019t usually this sociable. \u201cI just felt a little queasy\u2026\u201d Kimberly replied quickly. \u201cMust have been something I ate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the sweats?\u201d Ashley asked, looking Kimberly up and down. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you in anything but a mini skirt or skin tight jeans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly shifted nervously in her seat. \u201cI felt like a change is all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Ashley gave her a half smile. </span></div></div>",

Kimberly had never enjoyed history; she had always been more interested in the future than the past, and didn\u2019t see the point of learning about people who were long dead. So she sat, looking as bored as everyone else in the class, while Miss Gates droned on and on about the civil war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPsst\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly glanced around, and saw Josh Phillips, the hottest guy on the football team, staring at her from two seats away. Josh was generally seen as the guy that every girl wanted to get with, he was tall, muscled and handsome \u2013 and he had been flirting with Kimberly for the past few weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Kimberly whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo mini skirt today, come on Kim, your legs are the only things that keep me awake during this snore fest!\u201d Josh whispered back, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smiled, forgetting for a moment how unattractive she had felt earlier. \u201cWell you\u2019ll just have to use your imagination,\u201d she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smirked. \u201cI can do that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly turned away and smirked to herself, wondering when exactly Josh would stop flirting and ask her out. She was certain that a date with him would make the other girls on the squad incredibly jealous, particularly Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lesson went on, Kimberly nearly fell asleep several times, but always managed to pinch herself and stay awake before she dozed off. Towards the end of the lesson, Kimberly began to feel a tingling sensation in her stomach. She panicked, fearing that her belly was growing again, and looked down. The sweats she had chosen were loose enough that she could not see any changes in her waistline, so she ran her fingers underneath her top and touched her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nearly cried out loud at what she felt. Sure enough, her belly seemed to be expanding outwards, pressing against her fingers as it pushed its way forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Ashley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly quickly pulled her hand away from her belly and straightened up. \u201cNo, nothing,\u201d she said quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened. She now know that this had nothing to do with her diet or gaining weight naturally, something very strange was happening to her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, and the class hurried out of the lesson, with Miss Gates shouting at them to remember to do their essay for next week. Kimberly barely heard a word she was saying as she rushed out of the room and headed for the girls bathroom. </span></div></div>",

It was even bigger than it had been this morning, and had rounded out into the beginnings of a potbelly. Kimberly almost looked like she was in the very early stages of pregnancy. But she knew she wasn\u2019t pregnant, no pregnant woman had growth spurts like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly couldn\u2019t believe what had happened.

She would be late for her next class, but she wasn't particularly bothered about that today - an empty corridor would mean less chance of being noticed.

What were they doing here? She wondered. Had they found out that she had put on weight? Were they here to challenge her leadership of the squad? She tried to calm herself down, and pretend nothing was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" she asked. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We spoke to our teachers and got next period off to practise for the big game's performance next week,\" Ashley explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all think it's pretty important,\" said Amber. \"Plus we get to skip Math!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly started getting worried - this was exactly what she had feared, if they went to practise, she would need to change into her cheerleading uniform, and all the girls would see what was happening to her body. They would kick her off of the squad in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...can't...I'm still not feeling well...\" Kimberly struggled for an excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were fine earlier,\" Ashley snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on,\" said Amber. \"It'll do you good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need all the practise we can get,\" Ashley said. \"But I guess I can take over as Captain for a while if your not feeling well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hit a nerve with Kimberly, she could see that Ashley was already scheming to steal her position. \"All right, all right...I'll come,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smirked strangely, and Kimberly gave her a quizical look. They then turned and headed towards the girls changing rooms, and Kimberly began to wonder how she was going to talk her way out of this situation - they would all see her bloated stomach and added pounds, and realise she was suddenly getting fat.

She could be insulted, exposed to the entire school and worst of all, kicked off the team, at which point she was sure that Ashley would take control. As they entered the changing rooms, Kimberly knew she had passed the point of no return - the squad were going to see what had happened to her once toned stomach. Perhaps there would be some way to explain it? Perhaps they would believe her that this wasn't her fault? But then...she wouldn't have believed <i> them</i> if they claimed to have magically gained weight overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and Amber tossed their bags onto the bench and began to undress. Normally, Kimberly would have been confident she had the best body there, but today, Ashley was more deserving of that title, with Amber coming a close runner up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, Rosaline and Trixie were already in their underwear, and Kimberly had to admit that for the first time ever she found herself envying Rosaline's body - despite having the biggest butt on the cheer squad, she at least didn't have a gross pot belly like Kimberly now had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and change <i>Captain</i> ,\" Ashley said, almost mockingly, from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly bit her tongue, and hesitantly unzipped her pants. She felt some relief as her bulging belly freed itself from the sweat pants, and immediately sucked in her new found girth as much as she could. She unzipped her top and pulled it off, leaving her in her underwear. Her breasts looked a little bigger than they had done earlier, but Kimberly couldn't tell without giving them a closer examination...right now, she just wanted to act like everything was normal. When Kimberly glanced around the room, the other girls, all clad only in their underwear, were staring at her. Rosaline and Trixie looked away as soon as Kimberly spotted them, but Ashley had a cruel smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking a little...larger...aren't we Captain?\" Ashley said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you mean?!\" Kimberly tried to keep her belly sucked in as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...no offense, but you've definitely gained a few pounds,\" Amber chimed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous!\" Kimberly said nervously. \"I look the same as always...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting harder and harder to keep her belly sucked in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you guys think?\" Ashley asked, turning to Rosaline and Trixie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosaline and Trixie looked at each other nervously, and Kimberly reckoned they were too scared to comment. Eventually, Trixie shrugged and turned to face Kimberly, \"You do look a little bigger Kim...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...your butt looks a little more like mine...\" Rosaline added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutraged by that remark, Kimberly forgot all about sucking in her belly as she turned red with anger. Her stomach bulged out to it's full size, causing the other girls to gasp and stare at it in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not-,\" Kimberly realized her mistake too late, and looked down to see her chubby new muffin top belly staring back up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's proof girls,\" Ashley smirked. \"Looks like our Captain is now the fattest one on the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Kimberly snapped. \"I'm hardly <i> fat</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat enough for a cheerleader,\" Amber said, siding with Ashley instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your always having a go at me for being the biggest one on the team, but I don't have a big flabby belly like you!\" Rosaline hissed, as if she had been wanting to talk to Kimberly like this for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Kimberly cried out. \"It's not even that big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty big...are you pregnant?\" Trixie asked, a look of confusion on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley rolled her eyes. \"She couldn't have gotten pregnant overnight could she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right...\" Trixie said, embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how it happened!\" Kimberly said, trying desperately to explain her sudden weight gain to the girls. \"I just started bloating out yesterday...I think I need to see a Doctor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lousy excuse,\" Ashley said. \"You don't just get fat overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not fat!\" Kimberly screamed, making her stomach jiggle slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't have a chubby Captain,\" Amber said. \"It would ruin us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very true Amber,\" Ashley said icily. \"So girls, lets vote on it...do we still want Kimberly on our team?\"</span></div></div>",

For the good of the Oakes High Cheer Squad, I will now assume the position of Captain. Are there any objections?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked around at each other, but nobody spoke. They simply shook their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look like it!\" Amber said cheerfully, smiling at her new Captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was furious. She had shaped this squad into what it was, and now they were casting her aside like she was nothing! In one day she had gone from fit to fat. Her life, as she knew it, was over. She fought back tears, and began to angrily put her clothes back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Kimberly hissed angrily as she pulled her sweat pants back up and grabbed her zip up top. \"See how well you do without me! This team won't make it one week without me as Captain, you'll see!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kimberly zipped up her top, grabbed her things, and barged past the other girls, secretly envying their slim, toned bodies as they stood around in their underwear watching her leave. As she pushed the door open, she could have sworn that she heard Ashley laugh mockingly from behind her. Kimberly wanted nothing more than to punch the arrogant new Captain's lights out - but that wouldn't do her much good right now...she needed to find out what was happening to her. She <i>knew</i> there had to be a rational explanation for her sudden growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly would need to see a Doctor, surely then she would find out what was going on. She whipped out her cell phone and dialled her family physician - Doctor Greenstein. She was greeted on the phone by his receptionist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Greensteins office, how may I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...I have an unusual problem...and I need to see the Doctor right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly sneaked out of school - as far as anyone knew, she was still in Cheer practise, and if anyone asked any questions, she would just make up some excuse. She didn't care that she was missing school, she had a more important situation to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly had explained her bizarre situation over the phone, much to the bemusement of the receptionist at the Doctor's office. She had feared she wouldn't be seen straight away, but as her family were rather wealthy, and had grown to know the Doctor quite well - she had been allowed an immediate appointment with no questions asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying quickly down the road, Kimberly turned and rushed into the surgery. She had gotten down hear so fast that she was sure she must have burned a few of her excess pounds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of breath, she rested her elbows on the reception desk, as the elderly receptionist peered up at her over her glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, miss Kimberly...if you would care to take a seat,\" the receptionist said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I...go...in...right now?\" Kimberly pouted in between taking deep breaths, her face flushed, and sweat running down her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" the receptionist said. \"The Doctor is with a patient right now, if you would care to take a seat, he'll be with you in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine...\" Kimberly muttered impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed the room and sat down in one of the waiting room chairs. She hated being here, and chose a seat away from anybody else...she didn't want to catch anything while she was waiting. Kimberly folded her legs and breathed a sigh of relief as she lent back in the chair. She looked at the knee high table beside her, which was stacked with reading material for the patients. She grabbed a magazine at random from the top of the pile and glanced at the cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly read the headline on the front cover: <i>IS FAT THE NEW THIN?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Kimberly snapped at the magazine and threw it back down onto the pile, annoyed by the mere suggestion that anyone could enjoy putting on weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the magazine hit the top of the pile, Kimberly began to feel a chafing around her breasts...her bra was starting to feel more uncomfortable. It had felt a little tighter this morning due to her strange new weight gain...but it was starting to get even tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't be growing...\" Kimberly whispered to herself as she stared down at her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her worst fears were confirmed: she could actually see her zip up top tightening around her chest. Why did this have to happen now, of all times and places?! She couldn't pull the top off to get a closer look at her body, not in this room full of people...but she wanted to see what was happening to her body, just how big was she getting? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the examination room opened, and Doctor Greenstein escorted an elderly patient out. \"Just take one of those every twenty fours...\" the Doctor said, before noticing Kimberly. \"Ah, Kimberly, come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly zipped her top up a little more, and hurried into the Doctor's room, he followed her in, closing the door behind him. With her back to the Doctor, Kimberly pulled her top up and looked at her stomach...it seemed to have grown an inch or two larger...but it was hard to tell. The growth seemed to have stopped now, which was unfortunate really, as if the Doctor had seen it he might have been more inclined to believe the strange story she was about to tell him. </span></div></div>",

You don't look all that unwell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly slumped down into the leather chair facing the Doctor, and felt her stomach's flab push up against her top. \"Well...it's kind of embarrassing...\" Kimberly began. \"Some-thing's happening to me...I'm getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief silence followed as Doctor Greenstein raised an eyebrow quizzically. \"Erm...I'm not a dietician Kimberly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly knew this was going to be difficult, she probably sounded crazy. \"No, it's not that I'm just putting on weight, it's that it just happened overnight! Yesterday I was fine, I mean, you've seen me before - my body was perfect, and I always watch what I eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Greenstein looked awkward, and tried to look away from Kimberly's larger than normal cleavage, which, Kimberly suddenly realised, had become a little more visible during her last growth a few minutes ago. She shifted awkwardly, and continued to speak. \"I went home yesterday after lunch and then woke up the next morning with my stomach looking like a balloon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might be exaggerating a tad Kimberly,\" said the Doctor. \"You don't look much different to me. Are you sure your not just bloated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly knew he was going to take more convincing, so she suddenly stood up and unzipped her top. The tank top she was wearing underneath her sweats was clinging tightly to her larger belly, and she slowly pulled it up to reveal her bloated looking stomach. \"Look!\" She said. \"This just came out of nowhere, and it keeps getting bigger - just now, in the waiting room, it grew again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" said Doctor Greenstein, rising from his chair and walking over to get a closer look at Kimberly's exposed belly. \"Are you sure this came overnight? That is most odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure!\" Kimberly insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Greenstein poked a finger into her flabby stomach. Kimberly flinched as the Doctor's cold finger touched her stomach and sank slightly into the layer of fat covering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's definitely not bloating,\" the Doctor said. \"You are sure this happened overnight? This isn't some elaborate joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you think I'd find something like this funny?\" Kimberly said, tears welling up in her eyes. \"I just want to know what's happening to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Greenstein placed a comforting hand on Kimberly's shoulder, and then returned to his desk. He reached into one the drawers alongside it, and pulled out a needle. Kimberly backed away slightly, pulling her tank top back down over her exposed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take a blood sample and have it analysed, there must be some reason that this is happening to you,\" the Doctor said. \"I should have the results back in a day, I'll let you know as soon as the lab finds something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankyou,\" Kimberly said. \"I didn't think anyone would believe me...I don't really believe it myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what kind of a Doctor would I be if I didn't trust my patients?\" Doctor Greenstein said with a warm smile. \"Now, this may sting a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly had always hated needles, and she looked away as she felt it go into her arm. In a moment, it was over, and she knew that all she had to do now was wait until the results were in. She was <i>certain</i> that this sudden fattening was nothing natural, and once she knew what she was dealing with, she could take steps to solve the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly exited the Doctor's and zipped up her sweat top, once she was outside, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

She didn't know if she could face seeing the rest of the squad after her humiliation in the locker room, especially since she still had no explanation for her random growth spurts. Anyway, hopefully she wouldn't have to, as the Doctor had said the results would be back within a day - hopefully he would find out what was happening to her and she would be back to her normal, slim, sexy self within the week...but what if he couldn't help? What if she had some sort of disease that couldn't be cured? Kimberly felt herself shaking with fear at the thought, and quickly dismissed that thought from her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will all be over soon,\" she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly decided to walk it home, hoping she might lose a few pounds in the process. For the first time today, she was glad to be wearing sweats, as the walk had actually tired her out a little, and she had begun to sweat around her stomach and thighs on the way home. Considering it was only a half-hour walk, that was rather unusual, and Kimberly suspected her extra sweatiness had something to do with her extra flabbiness. How did overweight people cope?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was empty, with both her parents at work until late, so nobody would suspect she was out of school. Somewhat out of breath after her walk back, Kimberly set off up the stairs, feeling her larger than normal belly rub against her sweat pants, jiggling slightly with each step she took. When she had reached the top of the staircase, Kimberly unzipped her top and threw it into the laundry basket outside her room - she didn't fancy wearing it again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly walked into the room, closed the door behind her and sat down on the edge of the bed opposite the mirror. She sighed and stared at her reflection sadly - any other day she might have been dancing about in her underwear, admiring her reflection while she posed in a variety of sexy positions, but now she could hardly bring herself to look back at the girl in the mirror. Her swollen stomach had made her white tank top considerably tight, giving her the look of a girl in the early stages of pregnancy. She stood up and resigned herself to checking out the rest of her body, starting with her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and pointed her ass towards the mirror, while glancing over her shoulder at her butt's reflection behind her - it wasn't quite as noticeable as her bigger belly, but it had definitely softened, filling out her once loose sweat pants. There seemed to be less room around her thighs as well, indeed, everything seemed much tighter than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly turned back round, and stared at the only part of her body that might actually have <i>benefited</i> from her weight gain - her breasts. Her C cup breasts had been the envy of many girls at school - perfectly rounded, and always displayed in the most revealing of outfits. Now, they seemed to have gone up half a cup size, and Kimberly could feel them squeezing together in the confines of her tight top...bigger boobs weren't so bad...at least there was one positive thing about her bloating body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, a large growling noise came from Kimberly's stomach. It was then she realized that she hadn't eaten a thing all day - she had been convinced that eating <i>anything</i> at this point could only be a bad thing, and had wanted to starve herself until this was over, but her stomach was churning now, grumbling and protesting louder than it had ever done before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo...\" Kimberly clutched at her protruding belly as hunger pains overcame her. \"No...I...I can't...I need to lose weight, and that isn't going to happen if I start eating again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly realized that she was, quite bizarrely, talking to her own stomach at this point. It growled again, as if it was replying to her protests, and she angrily shushed it. \"Ooo...\" She moaned again as her stomach growled at an even higher volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a little snack wouldn't hurt? Kimberly wasn't sure she could cope with her rumbling stomach for much longer, she would have to eat a salad or something to tide her over. She got to her feet and headed downstairs to the kitchen, opening the fridge and getting out some vegetables for a home made salad - she usually ate this, and it was usually enough to satisfy her practically non existent appetite, but Kimberly wasn't so sure this would fill her up in her current state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a fork and began stabbing at her bowl, she was more ravenous than she had suspected, and was almost shoving the contents of the salad down her throat. Her fork was darting in and out of her mouth every few seconds, and when she reached down to poke at her bowl, all she heard was a clunking noise as her fork hit the empty bowl. She had eaten that salad much quicker than normal, and yet she felt oddly unsatisfied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll have another bowl...\" Kimberly said, running her hand over her stomach thoughtfully as it rumbled once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly headed back to the fridge, placed her bowl on the kitchen counter, and looked inside. She eyed the vegetables for a moment, but somehow she didn't see another bowl of salad satisfying her hunger, she surveyed the contents of the fridge, and her eyes were suddenly drawn to a large pack of brownies that her mother had made. Kimberly would occasionally treat herself to one or two of the chocolate brownies when she wasn't training for Cheer leading. In her current state, she doubted eating a few would matter all that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to go ahead and eat them, Kimberly pulled the container out of the fridge and poured herself a glass of milk. She returned to the kitchen table and pulled a brownie out, chomping down on it and relishing the taste of something sweet for once, though she didn't like to admit it to herself...she much preferred the taste of chocolate to the taste of lettuce and tomatoes. To her hungry mouth, the fudge and chocolate chips were heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter devouring the first brownie, Kimberly started on the second, and then the third - she was cramming them into her mouth like there was no tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...so good...\" Kimberly groaned in between bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped chocolate crumbs from around her lips and stuffed another brownie into her mouth, then another, and another. Kimberly didn't seem to be able to stop, even if she rested for a minute, she would be spurred on by the growling protests of her belly, and so, she continued to feast upon the brownies before her. Her hunger seemed practically insatiable, and Kimberly knew she was eating far too much, but her stomach seemed to be crying out for more, and she couldn't bring herself to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs brownie after brownie was crammed into her mouth, crumbs fell down her tank top, some of them falling into her cleavage and becoming lost in her bigger bust. Still, she continued, ignoring anything that might distract her from her feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after ten minutes of stuffing herself full of delicious brownies, Kimberly had finished them all off. She wasn't sure exactly how many had been in the container when she had started eating, but she guessed there had to have been at least twenty...maybe more. She wiped some of the mess from around her mouth and grabbed her glass, taking a big gulp of milk to wash down her meal. She was so thirsty, that she gulped down the rest of the glass soon after. At last, the grumbling in her belly had subsided, and Kimberly was feeling thoroughly stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...how many of those things were there?\" Kimberly asked herself, staring down at the residue left by her binge. \"I've never eaten so much in one go before...damn it...I'm supposed to be losing weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grasped her stomach in her hands, and noticed that instead of the flabby feeling it possessed earlier, it now felt hard and bloated. Kimberly actually preferred it like this, at least it wasn't jiggling with each step she took. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she held her bloated stomach, Kimberly began to feel something...taken aback, she looked down at her burgeoning belly, and gave a small shriek as she realised it was growing even larger! Just like before, her belly was expanding before her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this cannot be happening <i>again</i>!\" Kimberly said, her face red with anger at her own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was, and Kimberly was powerless to stop it. Her already sizeable bulge swelled larger, and Kimberly felt some of the hardness of her bloated stomach begin to disappear. As more and more fat was added to her waistline, Kimberly grimaced as she felt her fingers sink slightly into the thick layer of flab covering her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so messed up...\" Kimberly groaned, looking down at herself in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Kimberly, this growth stopped quite quickly. An inch or two had been added to her waistline, but nothing drastic. She breathed a sigh of relief as she watched her stomach cease inflating, and looked down over her once perfect body in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting so big...\" She moaned, pinching a roll of fat on her newly formed pot belly and shaking it. The rest of her stomach jiggled slightly, and she let go out of the fat-roll, allowing it to rejoin the rest of her belly. \"This is so disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kimberly heard a key turn in the front door - her Mom was back early! As she heard the key begin to turn in the lock, she jumped to her feet, causing her enlarged breasts and belly to shake. She was still unaccustomed to weighing this much, so stumbled slightly as she hurried from the room and back upstairs. Her Mom opened the front door just as Kimberly reached the top step and dived into her room, slamming the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Kimberly slid the lock across her bedroom door and collapsed onto the bed. She couldn't face her parents seeing her like this yet, in fact, she couldn't really face anyone seeing her like this. As well as the fact that she was rapidly expanding at random moments, she also had no idea how she would even explain it in a way that didn't make her sound completely insane. Hopefully, once the test results came in the next morning, she would know more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the evening, Kimberly stayed hidden in her room. Still feeling thoroughly bloated after her earlier feast, Kimberly avoided eating anything else, and pretended she wasn't feeling well. Her parents didn't like it, but had decided not to question her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was glad when night fell. Her pyjamas still fit her growing body perfectly, with their loose and stretchy material. Her chubby belly stuck out from beneath her top, but she felt much more at ease wearing them than her day-time clothing. She clambered into bed, and, hand resting on her belly, drifted off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

Answering her was a loud grumble from her belly. \"Oh no not again!\" Kimberly was feeling ravenous, almost as if her belly was hollow, though she knew it wasn't. She got up and sneaked downstairs to the kitchen. Her parents are asleep, and she cannot wake them up, lest they see her bloated body. She opened the fridge quietly, and saw the leftovers of a large meatloaf. Kimberly pulled that out and just started eating it, not bothering to warm it up. \"Ohhh this tastes so good....\" The meatloaf had barbecue sauce glazed over the top of it with kroutons inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly finished off the whole meatloaf, and got up to find another meal. As she opened up the fridge, she just searched through the it making noise. Uptsairs, her father was stirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly found a container full of vanilla bean cake. She smiled a big smile as vanilla was her favorite. She set the container on the table with a loud smack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly's father awoke, thinking he was being robbed, he grabbed a baseball bat from the wall and crept downstairs. Kimberly had eaten most of the cakes and was getting full again, when her father raised the bat over his head. Kimburly turned and yelled \"DAD?!?!?!\" He stopped, and flipped on the lights. \"Kim? What are you........\" He gazed at her daughters body, disgusted. \"My god Kim, what happened to you!? You've ruined your body!\" Kimberly's belly was bloated with meatloaf and cakes, and her face was covered in crumbs. \"Dad it's not my fault! I don't know how I'm--\" Her father cut her off and said, \"Thats it! Obviously me and your mother haven't been watching you close enough. Now you've gone and plumped up! Your mother will have a talk to you about losing this disgusting flab.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that he grabbed a piece of flab from Kimberly's belly. \"Get off dad!! If you won't listen to me, then I don't give a shit about you!\" With this Kimberly stomped up the stairs and slammed her door. All this anger was having a big effect on her belly, but she didn't care. She just dove under the covers of her bed and wept silently. With anger and stress together, her body changed more under the covers.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Kimberly woke up but stayed in her bed. She was sure it was saturday, so she just laid in her bed for about 3 hours. Kimberly's mother came into her room, screaming at her, \"Kimberly!!!! You get up right now! Your father told me what happened last night, and I am very angry with you!\" Kimberly just stayed quiet, and ignored her mothers ranting. \"Don't you ignore me young lady! Get up!\" With this her mother pulled off Kimberly's bed sheets. \"Mom!!! Get the hell out of my room!!\" Kimberly stood up and glared at her mother. Her mother just stood there, shocked at what had happened to her daughters body. She started crying, and ran out of the room. Kimberly went to her mirror and stared at her body. Her face now had a double-chin, and her breasts looked to be a D cup now. She smiled at her breasts, but frowned when she beheld her belly. It was a fully developed pot belly now, and she decided to measure it. As she brought the tape around, it was 40 inches. \"Holy.....how much did I grow last night?!?!\" She looked at her legs and saw that they brushed against each other now. She measured her butt, and saw that it read 46 inches. \"My god.....my ass is huge!\" Kimberly was in a perdicament. \"There's no way in hell I'll be able to hide this big gut at school.\" said Kimberly while taking hold of her love handles and shaking her belly. \"I wonder how much I even weigh.....\" Kimberly made her way to the bathroom and stepped on the scale.

It's a bit urgent...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yeah, I'll be right over...\" said Kimberly with worry. \"Ok, thank you. Bye\" said the Dr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...what to wear...\" Kimberly opened her closet with a disappointed look. \"I used to fit into all of these clothes.....*sigh*\" Kimberly just took out a green tank top that only covered her breasts. It didn't come close to covering her belly. Then Kimberly took the grey zip-up sweatshirt she wore the first time she went to see Greenstein, and tried it on. She slipped her chubby arms through the arm holes without difficulty, but then came the dreaded zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly tugged and tugged and tugged, but with her newly grown pot belly, the zipper wasn't going anywhere. Kimberly gave up with a *humph!* and just left it open. She then slipped on some black bootie shorts that almost got stuck on her thighs, but Kimberly pulled them up. She went downstairs with her belly pushing the sweatshirt apart, and her father saw it. \"My god Kimberly! Do not go out like that in public! It's disgusting!\" Kimberly shouted some unrepeatable words at her father and started walking to the clinic. It was a hot day out, so Kimberly decided to throw her sweatshirt off letting everyone near her to gaze at her chubby body and pregnant looking belly. Any guys would have been amazed with Kimberly's butt, as it jiggled and wiggled in her shorts and was pushing the fabric out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly finally arrived at the clinic, and went inside to the air-conditioned building. As she went up to the desk the woman there looked at her and said, \"Are you looking for the Maternity ward miss?\" Kimberly turned red at the face with this comment, and almost grabbed hold of the womans neck when Dr. Greenstein came between them. \"No, Margaret. She's one of my patients! Now, uh, go take your break....now...\" Margaret got the clue and went off somewhere. \"Alright then Kimberly lets go into my office...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly walked in and Greenstein shut the door. \"Well, I must be honest Kimberly, it looks like you've grown...but don't worry, I have the answer to your sudden weight gain...\" Greenstein then said, \"When I tested your blood, I immediately saw an abnormality inside of it. I took a closer look and found that it was traces of the All-Growth Formula that was just released two days ago. How it got inside you, I have no idea...but I ordered a vial of the weight gain formula also to experiment on it. It's over in that box....\" He pointed to a regular looking box on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I contacted the company that makes the formula and asked if they made a reverse effect type of formula. They do, and I ordered some for you Kimberly...\" Greenstein stood up and began walking over to a table with the box on it. But suddenly, Greenstein's foot got caught on the floor, and he tripped. \"Agghhh!!!\" Greenstein hit the floor with a thud, and knocked himself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly just stared in amusement at what just happened. \"......*snicker* ....AHahahahah!!!\" Kimberly started laughing, but realized that it was not funny....but it still kinda is... Kimberly knew the Dr wouldn't be able to help her now, so she went to the box and opened it. She peered in and saw that there was two vials of a grey liquid. \"How do I know which one is the reverse effect one and which is the weight gain one???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was in a risky situation. She had no idea which vial to take...</span></div></div>",

What is the matter with you all?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to imagine, but somehow Ashley had become twice the demonic cheerleader that Kimberly ever was. She extended the cheerleading practices, took out all water breaks, and made them come to practice even on lazy Sunday. It wasn't even 15 minutes into practice on monday evening and all the girls were dead tired. Ashley would have none of it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't tell anybody to stop! At this rate we'll never be ready for the game!\" Ashley yelled furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Ash, we're dying here!\" pleaded Trixie. \"And we've gone over our main routine more than enough, maybe if we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me Trixie, but who is the Captain here again?\" Ashley reveled in her position of superiority. In fact, she missed being in charge so much she wanted to take it up another notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you are Ashley, but-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, if you want to stay on this team, YOU have to listen to YOUR Captain!\" Almost moving Trixie to tears, Ashley was realizing just how fun cheerleading practice in the gym could be when another voice rang through the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Trixie, sheesh! You don't listen to the Captain you get the axe, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeads turned and hair flew as all the girls looked to the gym entrance. Kimberly was walking towards them - and their jaws dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was such thing as a perfect hourglass figure, they were looking at it. Thin, toned legs stretched up into perfectly proportioned hips and a venerable ass, her short blue cheer captain skirt swaying to and fro. Her visible, tan flat stomach teased from beneath her short cheering top, and what looked to be DD breasts were shoved stretching the rest of her uniform to infatuating levels. Styled, golden hair went down to her back and down her front. She was back with all her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ku- Ku Kimber-!\" but Kimberly had to interrupt Ashley's stuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, you really need to go easier on the girls. I mean, we even had this routine down last week anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! You all look like you're all dying!\" Kimberly said, attention now fully focused on the rest of the team. \"Come on, lets get something to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's!\" cried Amber, following Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" Rosasline agreed, wiping the sweat from her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now wa-\" Ashley tried to say, but Kimberly again interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless the Captain disagrees, of course! It's only the welfare of her team.\" Kimberly said with the wave of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley forced a smile. \"You know, MAYBE something to drink isn't so bad. In fact, let's all get a snack somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team breathed a sigh of relief, especially a worn out Trixie. The team was so exhausted that they pretended to ignore Kimberly's weight loss until they were sitting down at the tables, munching on pretzels and non fat chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, you look amazing, Kim!\" said Amber, breaking the ice surrounding their former Captain's restored beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, you're ass? It looks bette than mine now!\" Rosaline concurred between a pretzel or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are practically radiating, Kim. How'd you lose all the extra flab?\" asked Trixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, how DID you lose it all?\" Ashley further inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly just smiled. \"Oh, thank you all! And you know me, I always find a way to keep my body in shape! It was nothing really.\" she giggled. The rest of the team, sans their captain, laughed as well, while Ashley was more furious than she had ever been in her entire life. At this rate Kim could pull the strings to get her Captain status back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had no idea how Kim did it, but she found a way to suppress the weight gain drug. This was a big problem for her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kimberly was extra nice to the other girls as they ate, knowing she would need them back on her side if she was to reclaim her position as Captain. She had also made the deduction that it was Ashley who had slipped her the All-Growth Formula at lunch the other day, there was no other logical explanation - and Ashley had been unusually helpful that day, volunteering to get Kimberly's lunch. It had to have been her, she was the only girl apart from Kimberly with the cash to waste on an expensive new drug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, even if it hadn't been Ashley, Kimberly reasoned that she deserved a taste of her own medicine, after the she had treated her during her unfortunate weight gain incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, after proudly displaying her newly reformed body to her parents, Kimberly asked for a reward. Impressed by their daughters astonishingly quick weight gain, and more than a little confused, her parents gave Kimberly a two hundred dollar 'well done' bonus. Kimberly would have preferred to have spent the cash on new clothes, to replace the ones she had ripped and stretched out when she had been growing, but her devious plan required her to be more conservative with her spending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the All-Growth Formula's website, and ordered a box of the drug, making sure to check the box for next day delivery (she wanted to put her plan into action as soon as possible.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in a few nights, Kimberly felt like her usual self. No longer was she disgusted by her own body, no longer did she look in the mirror and see a huge flabby belly staring back at her, and no longer was she forced to cram herself into clothes that clung to every inch of her growing body. She felt normal, she felt beautiful, and she felt like she was going to be on top once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly slipped out of her clothes and took a moment to admire her naked body in the mirror. It was perfect in every way, in fact, it seemed to have changed a little...she hadn't really noticed it earlier, but she looked more curvy than she had before all this started. Her breasts seemed bigger than before...and her ass more purt and rounded than usual, but Kimberly was more than pleased with these developments - her body was pretty much perfection. She smiled happily at her reflection, and changed into her pyjamas, before clambering into bed, dreaming of revenge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Kimberly was awoken by the persistent ringing of the doorbell. Her eyes shot open, and she charged downstairs to the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it! I'll get it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the door knob and yanked the door open, to see a delivery man carrying a small parcel in his hands. \"Delivery for Miss Kimberly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could even finish saying her name, Kimberly snatched the box from his hands with a grin. \"Thankyou!\" She squealed as she closed the door and ran upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was safely in her room, Kimberly opened the box, and took out the All-Growth Formula, which was a relatively small bottle filled with liquid. Kimberly read some of the instructions on the back, which advised against ingesting more than a tablespoon full of the formula. Kimberly wondered how much she must have ingested to have grown so big so quickly...and considered how much of the formula she would treat Ashley to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got dressed, and headed out to school, planning on putting her scheme into action at lunch time. </span></div></div>",

She watched as Kimberly handed out all the girl's milkshakes, sucking up just enough for everybody to make them smile, make them happy. Kim had volunteered to get them all their milkshakes after Trixie mentioned how good they were, and it was blatantly obvious that she was trying to win the squad's favor back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the current captain, the plan was working. Ashley was trying hard to keep from looking TOO pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Kim, don't want to spill those!\" Amber warned, receiving her drink from the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and get milkshake all over my good yoga pants?\" Kimberly asked, slightly turning around to show off her cute black yoga pants and ass. \"No way I'm dropping anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls laughed, and Ashley tried to chuckle. The fat serum had failed miserably. In fact, it had backfired! Somehow over the weekend Kimberly had not only managed to halt the growth, but also become more attractive in the process! Not 3 days ago Kimberly was a wreck, barely able to fit into her damn cheer squad uniform, and now this! As skinny as she ever was before, only now with more ... generous curves here and there. It made Ashley want to give her another dose of the formula, and hope maybe this time the effects stay for good. Ashley was by no means ugly, but how in the world could she compete with Kimberly now? Maybe if she stated stuffing her bra a bit more -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, vanilla milkshake for you, right Ash?\" asked Kimberly to a slightly daydreaming Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. Thanks.\" she said, taking the shake and drinking it without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was trying very, very hard to suppress her devilish little smile. She was sure Ashley had only sprinkled a little of the formula on her salad or something last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no chance in hell Kimberly was going to be that courteous. She dumped most, if not all, of that damn serum into Ashley's milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly sipped on her chocolate milkshake savorily, noticing how wonderful her bigger, better cleavage looked today in her low cut top. Now all she had to do was wait.</span></div></div>",

She looked down, and moved her hands below the table, a look of horror crossing her face. Kimberly instantly knew that the serum had begun to take effect. She had never expected it to work quite so fast, but then, she had poured a hell of a lot into Ashley's cup!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Ash?\" Kimberly asked, still sipping casually on her milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm hmm...\" Ashley squeaked, avoiding Kimberly's gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, who was sitting beside Ashley, had also starting looking beneath the table. Her expression was a mixture of confusion and wonder. \"Erm...Ashley...are you sure you're okay? You look kinda...bloated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shutup!\" Ashley snapped, her face red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber recoiled, backing away fearfully, but Ashley's outburst had not gone unnoticed by the other girls. All eyes now fell upon the Captain. Kimberly continued sipping at her milkshake, trying to look as innocent as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ashley snapped again, glaring at the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to freak out,\" Amber said, still looking fearful. \"I was just...oh my God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's eyes nearly popped out of her head. She was staring below the table, at what appeared to be Ashley's waist. The other girls all followed her gaze, and their mouths dropped open in amazement. Ashley panicked, and stood up, and Kimberly finally got a good look at her handiwork. Ashley's once flat stomach was bulging out at an alarming speed - it was literally growing before the girls' eyes. Her top was riding up, exposing every inch of her newly formed pot belly, which bulged and bloated like an inflating balloon as Ashley struggled to conceal it with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! What's wrong with you?\" Roslaine gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your belly's freaking huge!\" Trixie blurted out, staring at Ashley's growing gut in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was Kimberly whom Ashley's gaze fell upon. Kimberly could hold back no longer, and she smiled across at Ashley. \"Something wrong...Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you did this to me!\" Ashley hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" Kimberly smirked. \"It's not my fault you drank your milkshake too fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Ashley screamed. \"I'll get you back for this! I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ashley ran from the room, cradling her rapidly expanding belly in her hands. The other girls stared on in amazement as their new Captain ran from the room, and Kimberly simply smiled. \"So...what do you say girls, do you want your old Captain back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to cheer at the game next week,\" Trixie said. \"And it looks like Ashley's falked on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we reinstate Kimberly!\" Roslaine said. \"I never wanted Ashley to be Captain anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me,\" Amber shrugged. \"Somebody better text Ashley the news, she's not gonna be happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly smiled. Her plan had worked to perfection, and with any luck, Ashley would be off the team for good. She couldn't wait to see how big her treacherous rival was going to grow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her phone began to vibrate...</span></div></div>",

She hurriedly made her way up to her room, ignoring her parents and ignoring the smells of dinner coming from the kitchen. She slammed her bedroom door shut, locked it and walked to her mirror to examine her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly looked at her reflection, her eyes moving over every inch of her body, but she couldn't see any noticeable changes yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God...\" Kimberly exhaled slowly. \"I'm so sexy now...why did this have to happen again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Kimberly forgot all about gaining weight, and admired her new assets. Her enhanced breasts and bulbous behind had seemed amazing this morning, but she suspected they would soon lose their firmness and grow to larger, flabbier, sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to have to hold out until I get a proper cure,\" Kimberly told herself. \"I can do that, no problem. At least Ashley's turning into a fat pig right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that satisfying thought, Kimberly stripped off, admired her naked form in the mirror one last time, and put on a silky nightgown that stopped just below her perfectly round ass cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better still fit me in the morning,\" Kimberly groaned as she clambered into bed, dreading what was to come in the morning. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kimberley did not sleep well that night. She tossed and turned in her sleep as she dreamed of Ashley, standing over her. Her nemesis was the size of a house in the dream; a huge, fat ball of flab that laughed as she stared down at the tiny, skinny Kimberley. Ashley's monstrous belly bulged forwards as she roared like a giant, and Kim tried to run as her huge, sausage like fingers grabbed her and hoisted her up into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me!\" Kimberly cried in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat you?!\" Ashley laughed a thunderous laugh as she squeezed her victim between her chubby fingers. \"I'm going to <i>feed </i>you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Ashley began to pull food from out of thin air and cram it into Kimbrley's mouth. The sexy cheerleader began to bloat larger and larger with each greasy cheeseburger, chocolate cake and pizza slice the giant blobby Ashley forced into her open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stoooop...stooooooop!\" Kimberley moaned, helpless to resist the fat giant's attack. \"You're making me faaaaaaaaaat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberley ballooned even faster than she had in real life; and Ashley dropped her to the floor. Kimberley landed unharmed with a loud thud, and screamed as her body began to expand, swelling with layers of flab that tore through her tight clothing, leaving her writhing around in the nude. People emerged from all around her and began pointing and laughing as her naked pot belly tripled in size and her arms and legs thickened to the size of tree trunks. Her beautiful face was lost in a sea of flab and multiple chins appeared under her chubby features. Her gigantic ass jiggled as she struggled to her feet and tumbled towards Ashley's enormous belly with a squeal of terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Kimberley woke up with a high pitched scream, drenched in sweat. \"It was just a dream...just a dream...just a dream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberley looked down at her body, and was greeted by the sight of two very big, very exposed breasts. Her boobs had spilled out over the top of her pink nightie...but they had gotten bigger this week...maybe she just needed some new night clothes? Fearfully, she pulled back her covers, and realized the truth...her weight had returned. Her nightie was clinging to her body, and was so tight she could barely move. Her flat, toned abs had once more been replaced with a large, flabby pot belly, and her breasts had gone up at least one cup size; so large and weighty that they could no longer be contained within her night gown. She hadn't expected her excess bulk to return quite so soon...but at least she wasn't as ginormous as she had been in her nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...not again...\" She moaned, poking her fingers into her soft belly in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she swung her chunkier legs out of the bed and stood up, but as she arched her back and stretched, her silk night gown gave an almighty rip and exploded from her body. As she watched it fall to the floor in tatters, she had to fight back tears. <i>Not again, please not again!</i> She stared down at her naked body and ran her hands over her pudgy stomach sadly, consoling herself that at least it would only be two days until she was cured. Slowly, she walked to her mirror and sighed as she set eyes upon her bulging body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I must be about two hundred pounds, most of it in my belly and boobs, </i> she thought as she stared at her reflection with a grimace. Her pot belly had grown even larger than before, but somehow maintained a perfectly round shape, despite it's softness. Her tits were a sight to behold, resting comfortably atop her spherical stomach like tiny mountains. They were bigger than she had ever imagined they would become, and, truth be told, she kind of liked them...dangling there, bulging out of her clothes...she allowed herself a small smile as she gave them a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun around to check out her butt; it was predictably huge, far too big for any of her panties. She would have serious trouble finding an item of clothing that contained it. She sat back down on the edge of the bed, which creaked slightly under her weight. Her big belly spilled into her lap, and she rubbed it gently as she considered her next move. She certainly couldn't return to school looking like this, her boobs alone would get her expelled! She was going to have to fake a sickday or two. Her parents barely paid any attention to what she did at home, so hiding out was possible - while they were at work she could walk around the house freely, and they didn't back until late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberley waited until her parents had gone out, then dialed the school and did a bad impersonation of her mom. It apparently worked, because they didn't question her at all and assured her that Kimberley could have the rest of the week off. Kimberley breathed a sigh of relief, now all she had to do was wait for the cure...</span></div></div>",

She screamed as she could feel her breasts pushing her bra to the limit, and then her belly began growing outwards again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the girls were very surprised by this. All except for Ashley, who had an evil smirk on her face. \"Holy crap! This really isn't natural....\" shouted Trixie. \"People don't just balloon out randomly. I think there IS something wrong with Kim....\" said Rosaline. They just watched in amazement as Kimberly kept growing, her belly beginning to develop stretch marks. Her ass was also starting to rip her sweatpants in the back. She was crying uncontrollably, starting to sit down on the ground. It seemed that the growing finally stopped, and Kimberly just sat there and kept crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Trixie went to Kimberly and tried to comfort her. \"Trixie, what the hell are you doing?! She doesn't deserve your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, this isn't right. This isn't just regular weight gain, it's something all together different! She needs help....\" As Trixie said this she began helping Kimberly up, and helped her get clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot believe your helping her Trix. Come on, leave this ex-cheerleader to sob!\" yelled Ashley. Suddenly, Trixie turned around and slapped Ashley right in the face. \"Ashley, I would've never known you to be such a heartless bitch!\" With this, her and Kimberly started walking out of the locker room. \"Your gonna pay for that you little slut....\" said Ashley to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Why would you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly and Trixie were now at Kim's house, talking upstairs. \"I know it seems hypocritical and all, me helping to kick you off the team, and then coming to your side.

Ive never seen her be so devilish....\" Kimberly and Trixie just sat upstairs in an awkward silence until Trixie said she should probably go. And so she did, and Kimberly was all alone in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so ugly.....\" said Kimberly as she looked at her newly bloated body. Her ass had grown about 4 pant sizes, and her breasts looked to be DD cup now. Her belly couldn't be contained by any of her shirts now, measuring to a solid 40 inches around. \"What am I going to do......?\" </span></div></div>",

As the cheer leader gave herself another once over, she knew that she would never be able to practice in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even feel like myself anymore, like this is somebody else's body I'm in ...\" sighed Kimberly to herself. She sucked in her stomach to see her flab seemingly disappear, but it would be an impossible task to lead even the most basic routines while not daring to breathe correctly. It did not help that, for some reason, it looked like fat was accumulating on other parts of her body even more. Her breasts had indeed gotten a tad more bounce inside the short cheer uniform, and her legs were showing slight signs of growth around the thighs and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I even tell them?\" she thought, making her way towards the gym door. \"Oh, this weight just magically accumulated since yesterday, forgive me!\" Kimberly fought to beat back a few tears. \"They will kick me off the team for sure, laugh at their captain! Laugh at how fat I am, just like all those bitches before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last deep breath, sucking in her stomach as much as she could, the young woman walked out into the gym, where a PE class was going on. Making her way around the room, she took another small breath before opening the door outside to see ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly was shocked. In her terrible worry she had not noticed the rain clouds forming earlier, nor the rain hitting the gym roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! What else have I been completely oblivious too lately!?\" Kimberly thought, seeing the heavy rain outside. The rest of the cheer squad, decked in their cheer uniforms arrived at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no!\" cried Trixie, pouting like she usually did. \"I was hoping the rain wouldn't come so soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea.\" agreed Amber, looking at the rain outside. \"Looks like it won't let up for a while, and practicing in the rain is never a good idea. Getting a cold would blow right now. This really stinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, with a notable look of dissatisfaction on her face, turned to Kimberly in earnest. \"Well, no problem. I am sure we could use the gym, right Kimberly?\" she said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well PE classes go on all day.\" the raven haired girl replied, scratching her head, trying her best to look contemplative and concerned. \"And, um, the other sports teams have probably got the gym as their own after school ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying there's NO time to practice, captain?\" Ashley questioned a little vehemently, taking Kimberly by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no.\" Her green eyes darted from person to person. As the captain, she should be the one who wants to cheer most! Kim needed a fast plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it is looking a little unlikely that we can practice today.\" Then, Kimberly thought up a clever ruse. \"Unless you girls all really want to practice with a bunch of sweaty old men at some fitness center or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew! Count me out of that.\" Rose remarked, hands on her hips. \"There is no way I am stepping one foot inside one of those unclean sweat factories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled!\" Kimberly stated, almost forgetting to suck in her stomach. \"Practice today is cancelled, and if this rain doesn't let up, it might be postponed for another day or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just enough time to figure out what the hell is happening to my body!' Kimberely hoped.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately for her, she made to the last 10 minutes of math, just enough time to remind a certain somebody to do her homework for her. She<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kim.\" said Micheal, a brown haired boy a little shorter than Kimberly. He was also a senior in a few of her classes, and has been absolutely crazy for Kim for a few years now. Kim had tried her best to halt his advances, but the man was persistent, so she did her best to take only as much advantage of him as she needed. He was too much a sweetheart for her to be too manipulative to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Micheal, sorry I was late! Did that homework get turned in?\"  Kim said in her most innocent sounding voice.

She didn't know that all this stress was just enhancing the weight gain serum, as her butt grew a little more, causing the sweats she was wearing to be very tight. \"Oh my god......I'm going to have to try and be sick again! I have to figure out whats going on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly left the bathroom, making sure the halls were empty, and snuck out and made her way to the front desk. She put on her best fake acting and walked up to the office \"*snifff* I feel....really sick...I need to *cough cough* go home....\" As Kimberly said this, she felt her belly growing more and started pushing on the table she was leaning on. Kimberly's face went pale, causing the attendant to believe her even more. \"Yes, yes, just get out before you get anyone else sick!\" Kimberly turned and sucked in her belly as best she could, still showing a good amount of flab. She quickly got outside and drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly stood upstairs in her room, in front of her mirror, with a horrified expression. Her belly was still growing slightly, making her love handles even more noticeable. \"Why wont this stop???\" said Kimberly tearfully. The only thing she could do was exercise, and hope that she could stall this growing. Kimberly laid down on the floor, and started doing sit-ups. \"Ungghh......ohh.....I can't....my belly.....is too big......\" said Kimberly between gasps of air. Instead she just laid there, feeling her belly. She wiggled it, and poked it, thinking how she was going to get back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could do was go on her computer. As she sat down on her little office chair, she had difficulty getting her butt into the chair. \"I just want this all to be gone!!!\" yelled Kimberly. As her browser window popped she was on Yahoo. She glanced through the news and saw something strange. *New Weight Gain Serum shown with excellent results hits drugstore counters* Kimberly clicks on the article and a video pops up and starts playing *Here we are with Sasha Ronalds, the first test subject for this new weight gain serum. It's alright if we ask you a few questions, Sasha? Ok then, well here is a picture slideshow of Sasha's body throughout the experiment.* Kimberly looked at the first picture, and saw a slim fit girl, like herself before all this madness. She found out that she was in danger of being too skinny and needed to gain weight. So they tested the serum on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few pictures, Kimberly could tell that she had gotten pudgier around the waist and legs. \"It's like whats happening to me.....\" thought Kimberly. She exited the video as she didn't want to see what she looked like at the end. \"There's no other explanation......I must have been injected with the serum, but.....how?\" Kimberly played over all the events leading up to her weight gain, but couldn't get a clue when or where she took the serum. \"Wait a minute......Yes, thats it.\" Kimberly remembered eating salad with the other squad mates, and a flavorless dressing was covering her salad. \"That must've been the weight gain serum. That bitch Ashley slipped it onto my salad!\" Little did Kimberly know, that anger also enhanced the serum, but with greater effect. As she slammed her desk with her hand, she heard a rip. Kimberly's butt had grown a good 2 pant sizes with that slam, and her sweats were now shredded. \"Oh my god! Shit, I really need to find an antidote for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kimberly tried to get out of the office chair, she couldn't. Her butt was stuck in it, and Kimberly tried pulling it off, but couldn't. \"Well this is just goddamn great!!!!\" screamed Kimberly. And with that scream, her butt grew even more, cracking the chair, and causing it to fall off her big butt. Kimberly squeezed her ass, and found it more jiggly on the cheeks and her thighs were more flabby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she searched her closet for anything that would be able to cover her huge ass. Nothing would come even close, so she crept over to her mothers room and searched her clothes. She found a pair of dark blue jeans that just got over her butt with little struggle. Kimberly had a plan, but wasn't sure what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she-</span></div></div>",

She look at her alarm clock, which read 9:57, and hit the snooze button for about the eighth time. \"Ugh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley are you still not up!? You better get your ass out of bed by the time I come back from shopping, or else you are in big trouble.\" She heard her mother slammed the front door down stairs. Ashley knew her mom was finally gone and won't be back for at least another six hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about another ten minutes in bed Ashley began to finally wake up. She changed out of her silk PJs to escape the heat and into her tanktop and booty shorts for a more relax feeling. She readjusted her tanktop a few times, beining as it had now become a snugger fix with her new doughy midsection and had seemilar trouble with her shorts. She had to make sure she looked decent at least, just in case if her mother was still home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw her mother was gone, Ashley began to mumble to herself as she went down stairs. \"Stupid bitch, all she does is nag and complain and then goes shopping. Why can't she get a job like dad and go on business trips all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce down stairs, she did her usually routine since summer started. Which consisted of eating on the couch whiling watching TV. Since this spoiled princess still hasn't recover from the whole Kimberly getting her captain spot, she spent most of her days like this. To make matters worse, her mom has been yelling at her ever since she found out that Ashley wasn't going to be captain. This made Ashley more and more stress. Since most of her so called friends left her to hang out with Kimberly, she had no one to talk or anyone to hangout with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sat on the couch with her boxes of cupcakes till almost four o'clock. While she was finishing her second box she heard a sound that has been missing all summer long, her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly rolled over on the couch and picked up her cellphone. She was then disappointed when she saw it was just a message from Kimberly;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Practice starts tomorrow before school at 6:20, don't forget!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\" Ashley couldn't believe that school was starting tomorrow. \"How did I forget. I bet Kimberly is going to be all on my ass tomorrow, when she finds out I wasn't doing her exercise plan she gave out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley knew she had gained a little over summer and she keep telling herself she will start to exercise again. However her mother had the key to their house gym and Ashley knew her mother would freak if she found out she gained weight. Ashley would rather go to the public gym and be seen by all of the people there, than by her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind soon drifted back to her TV shows and the day past her by yet again.</span></div></div>",

Once out she first threw on a pair of jeans along with her favorite pink tank top. But then she notice the little pouch of white fat she had where her slim abs once was.

She then spent twenty minutes fixing her long blond hair till it was perfect, and then spent another ten minutes with her make up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley then ran downstairs and saw the box of donuts her mother had left for the maids.

She heard the usually comments like, \"There goes that fine ass again.\"  or  \"How does she fit all that in those jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ashley then began to feel depressed, knowing that most of her weight is going to her stomach. 'Man, why can't I just put this stupid weight on my ass like Rosa.'

Her one time sycophant Amber had set out to become better than Kimberly over the summer herself after having grown weary of Ashley's domination and control.  They were barely speaking when Amber broke her leg and began enjoying munchies during her convalescence, becoming the pudgiest member of the squad. They barely spoke until school started.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley now actually took some delight on Kimberly's ragging on Amber and Rosaline over their weight, but the fact was she'd added a few pounds herself.  Frustrated over Kimberly's lean physique and apparent success she'd been engaging in more than just cupcake binges at home. She was also regularly eating pizza slices at lunch and munching on occasional candy bars, rationalizing that she would work the calories off practicing more than Kimberly until she reassumed her rightful role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully Ashley was an ambitious control freak who personally was prone to laziness. She had initially clawed her way to being captain by showing up others and wasn't very well liked.  Although Kimberly was turning out to be the devil you get when you dispose of another, the fact is that Kimberly's ascent was due in part to the team's chafing under Ashley. That is why Amber had deserted her when she was no longer a ticket to the captaincy. Of course it had never occurred to Ashley to mend fences and visit her former friend during the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that Ashley was sitting by herself at lunch thinking about indulging in some pie when she overheard one of the guys grumbling about Kimberly.  His gripe was that she'd conned him into doing her homework, then not kept her promise to go out with him. ..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimberly is actually cheating - that's how she has time to call before school practices and exercise so much! if I can prove it she'll be out and I'll be back where I belong!\" Ashley thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and forgot about the pie, grabbing an oversize chocolate chip cookie instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start carrying a tape recorder with me tomorrow and look for a chance to get confirmation of wshat Kimberly has been doing,  Sister, you are so going down!\" she chortled as she bustled along towards her next class with her slight belly roll softly jiggling.</span></div></div>",

Kimberly called an early practice, started chewing people out for tardiness and was reminded that there were homework assignments to be done. She made the error of ridiculing others on the team for not following her example and getting a proxy to do their work. Ashley caught every word on tape and turned the usurper of her rightful job in. Kimberly was suspended for thirty days or until her grades sufficiently improved.  Ashley was back in charge!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's family was wealthy and used to doing things based on money and power.  However, she had lost her position the prior year not just because Kimberly was better at routines but because of complaints about her arrogance towards others. In her heart she knew it was partially true - especially the way she'd used poor Amber.  But not she wanted to change. At her worst she'd never made an issue over weight like Kimberly, and now she had some pudge of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to show them things are going to be different now,\" she decided, and instead of a 6:30 am practice decided to treat everyone to after school burgers and a malt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our school mascot is the boar, which is a wild pig,\" she noted. \"No one is demanding that we be skinny, just that we develop support for the athletic teams, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie wanted to shake her head in opposition, but Ros and Amber were happy for the change in focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say how long I'll be running things - it depends on Kimberly. but I'm not going to hassle you about your weight and in exchange hopefully you won't diss me for mine.

True to her word she didn\u2019t hassle Amber or Rosaline about their weight, nor for that matter Linda, a slightly stocky junior who became Kim\u2019s interim replacement. There was a reason for this generosity \u2013 she herself was so relieved to be out from underneath Kim\u2019s fatophobe tirades that she herself was taking a break from counting calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley wasn\u2019t scheduling 6:30 am cheer sessions either, because she wasn\u2019t interested in getting up so early.  She was in fact getting up sp late that instead of a decent breakfast she was grabbing donuts and pastries when she arrived at school.  This only made her hungrier at lunch. Her once taut convex stomach was now concave, pushing at her jeans and forming a small muffin top with snug slacks and jeans. This was causing her to subconsciously pick at the waistband and hitch her pants up when rising. But she seemed not to notice and her teammates had promised not to tease her.  Instead, except for Trixie, they too were eating pizza and other high calorie food at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie saw what was happening. She noticed that tops whose lower hems which once easily hung below Ashley\u2019s beltline were now exposing a bit of belly. And her hips were stretching her jeans so they looked like beach balls. But Ashley and her friends, who had once stuck to salad wraps and soup for lunch, now indulged in spaghetti and meatballs one day, macaroni the next. They were even having desserts. Trixie smiled one day when Ashley showed up with an especially long white camisole cotton tank top with a stomach smoothing panel which Trixie knew came from Nordstroms and was called the \u201cYummie Tummie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least she knows she\u2019s getting fat,\u201d Trixie thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually she didn\u2019t. The garment had been selected by Ashley\u2019s mom, who had noticed he exposure that the shorter tanks were giving her daughter. At home she\u2019d tried to prepare lower calorie meals, only to see Ashley take larger portions, eat more snacks and brush aside suggestions that she needed to watch her appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Ashley felt popular. She was getting dates, and even though her bra had stepped up a size, she knew as a result of her increased eating, she saw hat as a good thing. . The guys liked giving her pizza and burgers and she didn\u2019t mid the attention. Although she was now probably pushing 140 she didn\u2019t feel she was \u201cfat\u201d and certainly no bigger than her Boar HS teammates.  The previous summer she\u2019d noticed some cute guys getting excited in their trunks over some plump girls bursting out of their swim suits and had thought \u201cI guess some guys really like a little meat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time she\u2019d still been trying to watch her weight. Now she was becoming confident that it really didn\u2019t matter \u2013 even if she gained she could draw the same reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Trixie it was all good. She was the only team member light enough to  be on top of the stack as the flyer in some routines and was in prime position to be Ashley\u2019s successor. With Kim also getting fatter she doubted she\u2019d be back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it wasn\u2019t long until the inevitable happened.  One Saturday morning Ashley grabbed a pair of older jeans that had been one of her favorites. She yanked and tugged to get them on, but it was no use. It was useless. She couldn\u2019t get them past her hips and butt and the fabric was constricting her thighs. And it was obvious that even if she could have gotten her hips to fit there was no way her belly would. There was at least a three inch gap between the snaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated she pulled them off and faced reality. She put on some more comfortable sweats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this is more like it, \u201c she exclaimed as her butt relaxed from being so compressed in the jeans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her credit card and resolved to visit the mall after breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday was one of the few days when her mom was on hand to make breakfast. Seeing Ashley in her sweats she could discern that she now had a slight belly roll and two full butt cheeks. She figured out easily why her daughter probably wasn\u2019t wearing her jeans. But, being somewhat stout herself, she held her peace and served a meal of corned beef hash and poached eggs with English muffins. After eating two of the muffins Ashley got up and put two more in the toaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungry this morning?\u201d her mom asked. She knew Ashley had been out to dinner the night before with Randy Phillips and was surprised she wasn\u2019t still stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little. Cheerleading plus all the homework has been giving me an appetite. In act I\u2019m going shopping today \u2018cause I\u2019ve picked up a few pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s not bothering you? I could start cutting back a bit I suppose \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, Mom,\u201d Ashley replied to her surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re a great cook and I love our food. The other cheerleaders are still all bigger than me and we all have good social lives.  I\u2019m tired of living off lettuce leaves and water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you had a good night with Randy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah \u2013 we went Italian at Bellas. Have you ever has Tuscan lamb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo .. what is it like\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuscious \u2013 especially with the garlic mashed potatoes.  Pizzas OK but the Italians have other good stuff. Tonight we\u2019re going to the Beachcomer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, her mom thought, \u201cand its going to your hips young lady. But you\u2019ve been warned, so its your problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley went to the mall and bought clothes in size 12, which were big enough to still be loose on her., then got feeling hungry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI deserve a treat,\u201d she thought and stopped into McDonalds and had a big mac value meal with a strawberry shake plus a filet of fish chaser.  Then she went home to find her mom gone.  Feeling lazy she watched a movie on tv until 4:00 and then had some ice cream before taking a nap. She knew that she needed to be on top of her game going out with Randy two nights in a row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy\u2019s family, like Ashley\u2019s, had money and could do what they wanted. Still, he was not arrogant towards others, earning his position on the football team the old fashioned way rather than using his name and genuinely studying for his excellent grades. He\u2019d noticed that Ashley was becoming less of a diva and maturing into a nicer person sand he\u2019d noticed her maturing figure as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d started their relationship out slowly, complimenting her on classwork then offering to buy her ice cream after school. Then on Friday he\u2019d impressed her with an Italian dinner and set her up for one of the areas better (and more pricy) restaurants.  It reflected the class from which they both came \u2013 and was a chance to see if he was right about her enjoyment of good food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley did not disappoint. She started with of roasted French feta cheese, then enjoyed swordfish puttanesca (which is served atop a generous helping of pappardelle pasta). Randy msatched her with a meal of maple glazed sakmion. It was an expensive meal, one they both knew few other guys Randy\u2019s age could afford. As such it was a statement that he wanted them to have a relationship.  Ashley fully understood the unspoken message, and was happy she was wearing her new dinner dress that showcased her thickening waistline for the occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the meal was over Ashley thought they would be heading for home, but instead he commented \u201cIt will be a half hour until the music starts \u2013 shall we take a walk on the beach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMusic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes \u2013 and dancing if you\u2019d care to\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why not,\u201d she agreed. The stars were out, the moon was full, and the serene ocean looked beautiful. After they got back they listened to the music and had several dances before Ashley finished off the evening with an almond mocha sundae with caramel topping.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like any other high school, gossip spread quickly at Oaks High school, especially when it was a rumor about a popular couple like Randy and Ashley. Randy was popular because even though he was rich, he was a nice guy and earned everything he got. All the guys liked him and all the girls loved because he was good looking so no one would tease him about dating a girl who was plumpening up. Also it was because that girl, Ashley, was pretty, popular, and the head cheerleader again. Plus, it hadn't escaped anyone's notice that the extra weight looked good on Ashley and she didn't seem to mind the extra weight. It was hard to tease someone about weight gain when it looked good on them and they were okay with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was now eating with Randy and his friends often and had invited Amber, Rosa, Trixie, and Linda to join them and they all had. Randy and his friends loved to give Ashley and her friends all kinds of extra food. All but Trixie always expected. They still gave Ashley the most in reference to her being Randy's girlfriend and she relished this. Ashley and her friends were all eating lots of pizza, burgers, and fries with soda every day for lunch at school and even on the weekends which was in addition to all the sweets they were snacking on throughout the day. Plus  Randy was taking Ashley out for dinner and desserts every weekend on both Friday and Saturday. All the girls were gaining weight except for Trixie but since she never teased the rest for gaining, no one said anything to her about it. In no way was she going to say anything because she knew it would get her kicked off the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had gained the most and her sweatpants were becoming her favorite clothing of choice. She was wearing it most days as she had outgrown most everything else and her mom was not going to buy her a whole new wardrobe. She was buying her a few new items from time to time but not a whole new wardrobe in hope that would get Ashley to diet and loose weight. Ashley didn't mind as she liked wearing clothes were too small for her so she could show off how much she had gained and she was sure that Randy liked it too. Her sweats were getting tighter on her too. She had now had a full on potbelly that made her waistband tight and uncomfortable and her ass totally filled out the back, pushing out. Her \"Yummie Tummie\" had become her favorite top and it was very tight on her too. Her belly nolled it up a good amount to reveal her bellya nd her breasts pushed out on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was enjoying getting to eat all kinds of fatty food constantly and was enjoying gaining. She thought all the extra weight looked good on her and she knew Randy did as well so she saw no need to diet and loose the weight. With all the extra weight she was gaining, she was becoming more and more out of shape. The same was true for Amber, Rosa, and Linda. Because of this, Ashley cut down the exercises they did into a few stretches and then they worked on their cheers for awhile before all but Trixie go out together and get a snack at a fast food resturant, usually McDonalds, Burger King, or Taco Bell..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Randy's relationship with Ashley and her thickening waistline may have caught the eye of Ashley's classmates and especially her cheerleading squad teammates, but to them it was of little concern.  For Ashley's mother, who had never been slender herself and retained cruel memories of what that could mean, it was a different matter.  This was especially so since Ashley seemed to her to be in denial that there was even a problem.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger, we need to talk,\u201d Rona Morton said to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not usually a difficult task for us\u201d he replied.lightly before assuming a look of more serious concern. \u201cWhat you really mean is, there\u2019s a problem and you think I\u2019m not paying it adequate attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not entirely. I\u2019m sure you are very well aware. You\u2019ve never hesitated to have your hands over the rolls and collops of my body any chance you get,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger grinned broadly \u201cwell, i do have this license that says i have permission to do just that!  But where is this going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll not be coy. Genes or not, don\u2019t you think Ashley is starting to take after her mom a bit early? She\u2019s only 18!\u201d Rona blurted out in a rush.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd heading up the cheerleading team with a boyfriend who seems to love every ounce? Oh yes, a walking dirigible \u2013 maybe we should contact Goodyear for a surplus hanger?\u201d her father said with obvious exaggeration<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger \u2013 please try and be serious about this. I\u2019ve tried talking to her and she just blows me off like its no big deal.\u201d Rona said with an edge in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Morton reacted sanguinely. \u201cPerhaps it isn\u2019t?  Think about that for a moment. Our daughter has a pretty good brain and her grades show it.  I think she triangulated that Kim quite nicely.  She could have thrown a hissy fit over things and sulked all year. Instead she just stayed on the team and bided her time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like her political minded Dad suggested and OK, you win a point on that one. But it doesn\u2019t it bother you that all holiday season she was having seconds on everything sight? The she chooses lemon cake slices over melons for after school snacks? And now polishes off any leftovers with Randy after school as a matter of routine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs Randy bothered?\u201d Roger replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything but!\u201d Rona declared. \u201cI\u2019ve even heard him ask if she wants him to warm them up without her having mentioned it. Then he has some but she usually winds up with more. He\u2019s an absolute enabler \u2013 and I know you know exactly what that term means.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I\u2019ve never enabled anyone against their will and you know that\u2019s true, right? So what you\u2019re saying is that instead of being bothered he seems to be encouraging and may be turned on by her appetite? Just like another couple I seem to remember,\u201d he grinned and reminisced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were in college when all that started, and I was beyond having to worry about high school peer pressure. And I wasn\u2019t ever a cheerleader anyway.\u2019 Rona reminded her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, in high school you were already lovely and well beyond where Ashley is.  I\u2019ve seen the pictures and only wish \u2018d known you then \u2013 you\u2019d have had the dates others got, believe me. Apparently the apple doesn\u2019t fall too far from the tree. And you\u2019re right \u2013 I\u2019m not creating the situation but I\u2019m not disturbed by it at all. Ashley doesn\u2019t have your problem. Randy\u2019s a nice young man \u2013 you have to give him that. So what happens if you make all the goodies go poof, including leftovers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve  tried that,\u201d Mrs. Morton sighed resignedly. \u201cThey just  bring in fast food. Randy\u2019s got enough money that he can take her to a restaurant whenever he wants \u2013 and has been. \u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd talking to her directly has resulted in?\u201d Mr. Morton inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Mom, don\u2019t worry. Everything\u2019s ok\u2019  \u2013 or words to that effect.\u201d sighed her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if she doesn\u2019t want any help and we can\u2019t control matters, what\u2019s the issue? Your transference a bit perhaps?\u201d Roger asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know \u2013 but maybe you could talk to her and at least find out more of what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t think I have the whole picture \u2013 I just know she\u2019s getting fatter by the week.\u201d Rona lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but don\u2019t expect me to push for anything. I think she\u2019s fine. Tomorrow night after supper leave the dessert out and disappear. I\u2019ll take it from there,\u201d Mr Morton offered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- --- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next evening dessert was a freshly thawed Boston cr\u00e8me pie. For all her conscious concern about Ashley the Morton household had nerver been low calorie. Rona Morton cut three pieces and taking one for herself and then said, \u201cif you\u2019ll excuse me I need to make some phone calls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK mom \u2013 and the linguine tonight was delicious!\u201d: chirped Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you dear. I noticed you couldn\u2019t resist seconds,\u201d she gibed a bit as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked at her father and rolled her eyes.  \u201cI wish mom would stop worrying. I know I\u2019ve gained weight \u2013 and eating stuff like linguini and this pie isn\u2019t going to lose any. Why can\u2019t she understand that maybe that\u2019s not the game plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger Morton smiled, \u201cwell, that\u2019s quite a statement. You mean there\u2019s a plan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes \u2013 first I like being a bit more curvy. Second so does Randy and third it solidifies my position vis a vis Kim.\u201d Ashley declared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?  Why?\u201d asked Mr. Morton<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley took a deep breath and cut loose. \u201cShe\u2019s a diet Nazi who loves to bully others over their weight but has now picked up a few herself, as have the others on the team. If we stay bigger and she is too but we\u2019re still popular with the fans she is neutralized, not able to intimidate us like she used to if she comes back \u2013 which may be never. .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, who came up with all that mouthful?\u201d her dad exclaimed/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sort of emerged collectively daddy. You really like mom heavier, don\u2019t you?  Well there are guys who feel the same way at my age and its being expressed a lot more openly nowadays. You can like and date and be who you like.   Our team is a statement that chunky equals cute \u2013 after all, we are the Boars, wherever that school nickname came from!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Morton backed up a country mile upon hearing the school\u2019s nickname before replying.  \u201cYou should  ask your friend  and teammate Rosa \u2013 her grandparents and my parents were involved in that decision you\u2019ll find out fascinating; some people still hate us for our part, but we and Rosa\u2019s clan stood on the same side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Ashley inquired, puzzled that the subject seemed to have suddenly shifted.  It was unlike her father to lose focus so easily but something obviously had affected him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother time \u2013 but talk with Rosa first. Right now there are two pieces of Boston cr\u00e8me pie left. I\u2019m kind of hankering to have one. The issue, is what about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I take it there was a sub-agenda reason why mom left the room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m supposed to find out what\u2019s going on with you and the way you\u2019ve been eating. I think you\u2019ve already answered that question. What I'm curious about is whether you feel guilty about wanting another piece of that pie or are you happy that I\u2019m suggesting we share?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPass your plate and pick which one you want; I\u2019ll take the other.\u201d she smiled. \u201cDoes that answer your question about my guilt feelings? Hopefully you can reassure mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather and chubby daughter happily finished their treat, each feeling more secure in their relationships with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The next day after practice Ashley offered Rosa a ride home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to buy us some ice cream, we need to talk,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa, always willing to have an ice cream treat,  accepted with a little apprehension. Ashley had reinstated her to the team and since then treated her nicely, but always in a group setting, not one-on-one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ordering a couple of sundaes Ashley quickly came to the point, \u201dMy dad says his father and your grandfather had something to do with the school team being called the Boars and that i should get the full story from you. Any idea what he is talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa looked at Ashley with a strange wistful expression, pools of tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip she closed her eyes and responded, \u201cYour grandfather was a good man \u2013 one of the few who tried to stand up against  the stupidity. When all else failed they forced the Boars name on the stupid PC crowd who wouldn\u2019t let them keep the original..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Ashley said, totally bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy grandfather and your grandfather were on the school football team when it was called the Apaches fifty five or so years ago. They were friends, very close. As you know many Mexicans, including myself, have Indian blood in our veins. We felt the Apache name reflected that heritage, even though our tribal ties are different, and your grandfather agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome years after they had graduated it was no longer politically correct to name teams after Indians anymore. The state authorities passed down a ruling requiring teams to change their name. The school authorities here didn\u2019t want to fight it \u2013 \u201ctoo costly\u201d they said. That\u2019s when our grandfathers tried to step in. Your grandfather supplied money for lawyers and the campaign; mine marshaled the manpower. Your grandfather was called a traitor to his class, accused of being a supporter of racism racist and worse \u2013 but it was all a lie! It was my people who were the proud ones, defending our heritage and he was standing with us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl this was news to Ashley. But she immediately empathized with the view of her grandfather. \u201c Uh, you say it failed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa nodded her head. \u201cYes. The local politicians didn\u2019t want to take on the state and wouldn\u2019t lend the school district\u2019s name to a lawsuit even if was free to them. It could cause too many other problems they felt. Never mind that 2000 alumni wanted to retain Apaches. But they did agree to let the student body vote on what the new name should be.. So my people proposed and the student body chose the boar name \u2013 it meant that the children of all those who forced us to give up the name Apaches would graduate as wild pigs. And although few graduating know the meaning, the ones who forced it down our throats know.  Some I am sure still hate your family for its role.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley  bowed her head. \u201cWe\u2019re not like by a lot of people for all kinds of stuff Rosa, most of it just envy, because in truth, as far as i know, like with your Grandpa, we\u2019ve mostly used our money to help others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa reached over and touched Ashley\u2019s hand. \u201cI know that Ashley. You\u2019ve always treated me nicely. You\u2019ve never made remarks about my clothes not being as fancy as yours or consider me too poor to talk with. My mother and her friends work in many homes. We know many things, Yours is not one who has a bad reputation. You pay fairly and treat others justly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Rosa. You have no idea how that touches me,\u201d Ashley replied. \u201cHaving money your born into isn\u2019t my fault, but with it goes a responsibility to use it wisely and not condescend to others. /It can go away and be lost \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make anyone any better or less for having or not having. I\u2019ve bee taught that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa spoke kindly. \u201cWe have a saying that my mom uses at times \u2013 when we leave this earth we all take the same things and the coffins aren\u2019t that different,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d agreed Ashley as they got ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd thanks for the sundae,\u201d Rosa noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime,\u201d smiled Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy Waring\u2019s family was of the same social strata as the Mortons. Their money wasn\u2019t nearly as old or as much, but as Ashley shared with him Rosa\u2019s revelations Randy understood what she was getting at..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that accounts for a few things, he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way the selection for cheerleader was rigged to get Kim in- rumor has had it it was directed as payback at your family, it had nothing to do with you. Or your comparative ability\u201d he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve known that Randy, but thought it was over other issues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a package, but it\u2019s the same people  \u2013 i just wish there was a way to give them payback,\u201d he grumbled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have an idea?\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot immediately \u2013 but give me a few days,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had wanted to tell her last night but it was late and they were both tired. Ashley had already had breakfast and left for school when Rona joined her husband at the table to talk about Ashley. \"So what did you find out?\" she asked him before taking a sip of her coffee. \"Well you are right about her gaining weight which I had already been aware of as well. You were also right in that there was something going on there though I don't think it's the reason you think. She is gaining weight puposefully. She and Randy both like her extra curves and explained that alot more people their age are now okay with being heavier\" Roger explained before stopping to let Rona sink that in. Rona thought over all of that as she drank more of her coffee. \"Well that is great that kids are more accepting of being heavier and that she like her extra curves...I just didn't expect that. Doesn't she any guilt over it?\" Rona asked. She felt bad and not to mention weird asking that, it was like she wanted her daughter to fill guilt over it when she really didn't. \"None whatsoever\" Roger replied with a smile. \"It's nice to hear that guys Ashley's age have the same preference for heavier women like I do\" he continued before leaning over and kissed his wife on her lips. \"Also, believe it or not, her gain has helped in cheer by solidfying her position against Kim\" he added.  \"Well this is all good news. I am happy for Ashley and not to mention relieved by this news. I am not going to comment negatively on her gain or try to stop it again. In fact I will do just the opposite, I will do my part to help her keep gaining\" Rona vowed with a smile. Roger nodded approvingly. \"I'm pleased to hear that and I know Ashley will be too\" he replied with a smile before leaning over to give her another kiss on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Ashley woke up to hearing her mom calling to her to get up and that she would have breakfast ready for her when she came downstairs after she had slept in past the time her alarm clock went off like always. She slowly pulled the covers off her, stood up, stretched, and walked into her bathroom. She turned on the shower, used the toilet, took off her clothes, and stepped into the shower. She took a nice warm shower, turned off the water, dryed herself off, and wrapped a towel around her. She walked back into her bedroom, walked over to her closet, and began to look through her clothes to decide on what to wear. A mix of both feeling lazy today and the overcast she saw outside her window, she decided to put on her juicy sweatpants that said juicy on the butt which was very appropriate due to the growth of her booty which she was very proud of, a white t-shirt that rolled up revealing her pot belly, and the matching sweatshirt,  Her sweatpants fit her snuggly around her thighs and hips with her butt pushing out the back. Though not embarassed about her potbelly or showing it, she stilled zipped up her sweatshirt over her t-shirt since it was the morning and it would be cool. The sweatshirt fit her tight with her breats and belly obvious bumps in her sweartshirt. After finishing getting dressed, she sat down at her vanity, she fixed her hair, did her makeup, and sprayed on her favorite perfume aptly named Dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley then headed downstairs and into the kitchen. Her mom greeted her with a smile. \"Good morning sweetie. I make your favorite, chocolate chip pancakes and there is more if you want it\"  her mom said as she carried over a big plate of chocolate chip pancakes smothered in butter and maple syrup. The sight and the smell made Ashley very hungry. She licked her lips as she heard her stomach grumble. Ashley quickly took a seat at the table where there was already a glass of milk and orange juice waiting for her. Her mother brought the plate of pancakes over to her and set it down. \"Enjoy hun\" her mom said before getting herself a cup of coffee and joining her at the table. Ashley had already dug into her pancakes took a couple of big bites. \"Mm, this is soo good mom, thank you\" she replied with a smile. Her mom smiled back, glad to see her daughter indulging herself and throughly enjoy it. \"Ashley hun, I want to apologize to you for badgering you about your weight. As you know I was heavier when I was younger and it wasn't always nice for me. I was worried that might happen to you if you keep gaining. Also I wasn't sure if you were happy with your gain or truly aware of how much you had gained. As you might have guessed I asked your father to find out what was going on with you since as I hadn't been able to find out. I realize now that I hadn't been going about it the right way and I apologize for it. I love you and I was just worried about you. Your dad told me about your talk yesterday morning. I am glad to hear that you are enjoying gaining and in fact I am going to start doing my part to help you again. This breakfast is just the start. No more am I going to make negative comments about your gain or try to stop you from gaining. I will help you gain\" her mom said with a smile. Ashley had been continously eating her pancakes as she listened to her mom's words. She stopped eating when her mom finished and looked over at her with a surprised look that quickly became a smile. \"Mom, thank you so much! I am shocked and I don't know what else to say but thank you. I am sorry that I didn't explain all of what I told Dad last night before but it wasn't until recently that I fully realized all of this\" Ashley replied.  She happily ate the rest of her pancakes and asked for more which her mom happily brought over and she finished those as well. She had nursed both her glass of milk and orange juice over her breakfast and finished both glasses as well. \"Mm, that was delicious mom. Thank you\" she replied happily as she leaned back in her sweat, patting her full and somewhat stuffed belly. After gently rubbing her belly for a couple of minutes, she got up, hugged her mom. \"Thank you for the delicous breakfast\" she said sweetly before headed up stairs. She then brushed her teeth, grabbed her purse, slide it over her shoulder, put on her shoes, and headed downstairs, called good bye to her mom and dad as her dad had joined her mom in the kitchen, then headed out the door to her car, got in, started the car, backed out, and started to head for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her mom, Ashley's mom stopped the negative comments about Ashley's gain, trying to stop her gain, and doing her part to help her gain. She was making all of Ashley's favorite dishes (particularly all of the fatty ones), baking all of her favorite foods, and keeping the house stocked with all of her favorite snacks so she always had something to snack on when she was at home. Ashley took full advantage of this and loving it. The results in the form of more pounds started to come quickly much to Ashley's suprise and deliight. Randy was also happy about Ashely's mom's changed attitude and her helping to fatten up Ashley. Everyday he saw Ashley, she seemed a little heavier and more beautiful. He was loving this as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

During the first week of her summer vacation, Amber began to practice and practice. However all this practice had put a lot of stress on her body, as her own practices became more and more intense. Till finally one day she had an accident.~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you are finally awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh?\" Amber said in a drowsy voice. \"What happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you pushed yourself to hard, young ladies like you should really know their limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's vision then began to focus and she realized she was in a hospital bed.

How bad is my leg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry it is nothing too serious, you just work your leg to hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So will I be able to get this cast off soon then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is kinda hard to say at the moment. Depending on how well it heals we can take it off in about a months time, or it could be as long as two months. But for sure it will be off before you return to school so don't worry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way Amber couldn't help but be worried. \"Isn't there something I can do to speed up the process?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you need to just rest. You have worked yourself so hard already, so now you need to settle down and get some rest. Just try and relax and enjoy you summer vacation as much as you can. Look, some of you friends even dropped off a card for you. \" The doctor handed her the card and then left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card was signed by everyone from the cheer squad, saying stuff like, \"Hope you gets well soon\" and \"Sorry we can't be there for her.\" and of course Kimberly put \"Just be ready for practice\"</span></div></div>",

She sat there in an empty house as her parents were at work and her young sister (2 years younger) went to New York for vacation. Amber felt really depressed not being about to do anything and like most girls her age who feel depressed she ate junk food. She grabbed a bag of Oreos and flopped in front of the TV. Throughout the rest of the day she grabbed whatever snack she could get her hands on and watched TV.

She stayed inside her house all week just watching TV, going on the Internet and munching on her snacks nearly all the time. Feeling sorry for her daughter's broken leg and ruined summer, Amber's mom quickly stocked up on anything her sweet little princess desired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mother busy with work and shopping for food and her father busy with his business meeting, Amber stayed home alone most the time. Which is probably one of the biggest reasons why Amber didn't notice her weight gain. Because Amber had developed a nasty habit over the week which was totally destroying her perfect body. Amber no longer ate just because she was depressed or hunger, now she ate just because the food was there. Whenever she saw a box of cupcakes or Oreos, she would rip them open and began to munch on them while watching TV. It became so bad that she didn't even notice all the binge she was doing. She would surf the web with one and eat Oreos with her other had. With her biggest exercise of the day being limping from the entertainment room to kitchen, her body began to take a major change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink shorts she was wearing now squeezed around the newly soften thighs, while her ass began to fill out the shorts more pressing against the pink material. Her midsection wasn't safe either. Her tone core was no more, as a pouch was pushing against her waist line. Her waist also began to puff over her sides a little bit forming a small muffin top. Her face had even filled out a little, too with a some what soften up cheeks. Her summer goal of beinging in the best shape of her life backfired as she was now in her worst shape. She was by no means fat compared to everyone at her school though, but she was no longer considered fit. She was now a little on the plump side. Being if she had on regular clothes you would only see a girl with full cheeks and small belly sticking out and a nice ass. Some guys would still like to date her and all, but if Kimberly saw her she would freak out and yell at Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut cheer would have to be on hold for her till her leg healed back up. In the mean time Amber will just have to keep herself busy watching her TV shows and surfing the web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But, with no one else showing up and the captivating aroma from the pastry box enticing her Amber decided to let him stay. Almost immediately she grabbed for a jelly filled donut and Kevin knew he'd made a wise move.  They chatted and played some board games, then Amber asked what caused him to come by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're smart, I've always liked you and  I was hoping you'd let me be a friend,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmart?  That's not something you normally identify with a cheerleader you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotten among the  best grades in every class we've had together,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber knew he was right but surprised anyone had noticed, especially one she\u2019d virtually ignored, although she had no idea why. . Kevin had just seemed retiring and not her type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so what is your GPA?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost 4.0, but I don't have your acrobatic talent. Mine is music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  Do you play the guitar and sing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can - wind instruments and the piano as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Wee have a piano. Let's hear you play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, \" replied Kevin and went to the piano.  Without batting an eye he pounded out a three minute medley that had elements of classical, ragtime and rock.  Then he said, \"now ,let's get serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes he began a Stephan Foster piece, Old Swaneee River, but this time he sang the words as well.  At the end he turned to see Amber\u2019s reaction and she applauded sincerely. He was truly a personality I his own right \u2013 no wonder he didn\u2019t try to fit in with the cliques. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was really good.  Would you like to stay for lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy to \u2013 what are we having?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.

Each contained a zfench bread pastrami sandwich with potato salad, chips and a piece of coconut pie for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do better with more notice,\u201d he remarked as she sate her sandwich with gusto..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKevin.

She wanted to meet him and so suggested that he stay the next night for supper. Amber called him and he accepted - then wondered what they were having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno - probably meat loaf or chicken. Its what we usually have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask your mom for permission to let me cook the meal. I promise you won't be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering Kevin\u2019s comment that he could do better if given more time Amber asked her mom, who quickly gave her permission,  The next day as Amber was lying on he couch watching TV Kevin showed up with a couple of bsags of groceries and a box of pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what are we having?: she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waldorf salad, boneless leg of lamb, green beans almondine, garlic potatoes and from Denmark Apple Almond Cranberry pie for a unique dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can cook all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And more. My mom runs a catering firm out of our house and I've been cooking for years.   I know - not your usual teen hobby.  Well, I like old cars and sports as well, but tis should make the impression I want on your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I'm responsible enough to be trust one with her daughter - which is whist tonight is all about, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber grimaced. She knew he was spot on, but didn\u2019t want to admit it.  So she listened to her belly and changed the subject. \"Sounds great - but right now I need some lunch and it should be these pastries.  Do you have enough left over from yesterday or another sandwich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in fact I was planning on it.  Give me 20 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was waiting Amber idly consumed a donut and an \u00e9clair, but still had room for Kevin's pastrami sandwich and another donut. He had one of each as well, then excused himself. Two hours later he emerged from the kitchen to announce that the salad was cooling in the fridge, the dessert was cooling on the counter, the veggies were finished and the lamb was roasting in the oven.  He noticed that by this time the remaining two pastries had vanished and smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 5:30 he exclaimed, \u201cOK, its time to set the atmosphere. Where are your tablecloths?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn the hall pantry \u2013 but we don\u2019t normally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did expect you would.  But in that box are two candles with holders plus some cloth napkins. I want this to be really special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber shrugged and let Kevin set the scene, even doing a formal table setting. As you might imagine the evening was a success.  Her mom was satisfied and her father was impressed, especially after Kevin gave an exhibition of his music skills. However, that night Amber noted her clothes seemed a tad snug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she thought, \u201cafter a meal like that it is no surprise. I may be gaining a few pounds but in a few weeks I\u2019ll be able to work it off.  Kevin is sure a lot different than I imagined.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of July Amber was back on her feet, but under instructions to \u201ctake it easy.\u201d Kevin by then had stopped buying daily pastries but did cook meals for her and her mom as a weekly custom.  Amber without being conscious of it was eating more than she had been previously and was filling out nicely.  Had she gotten on a scale she would have discovered herself to be , approaching the 130 pound standard that in theory was the \u201climit\u201d for cheerleaders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came time to suit up for cheerleading the first week of school Amber was bemused to see that she wasn\u2019t the only one to have gained weight.  Rosaline of course had always been stockier, but it looked like Ashley might also have picked up a few pounds.  But Amber was possibly now the heaviest member of the squad and as such became the primary target of Kimberly\u2019s sarcastic tongue. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Amber, What did you do? Have an all summer long ice cream social? I can see who\u2019s joining Rosa at the base of the pyramid \u2013 no way can anyone support you on the second tier.  Trixie will be our new flyer \u2013 and I expect you to lose ten pounds by Thanksgiving. Is that clear\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber felt guilty, but also angry. Her one time posse leader Ashley had been bossy, but had never demeaned her in such a fashion. But she felt helpless to fire back against the bullying and assert her right to be herself. Her reaction was to go home and consume a bag of cookies, then have seconds at supper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin expectedly was angry to hear about what had happened and was very reassuring to Amber, assuring her that she was far more lovely in both body and disposition than her judgmental team captain.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to acknowledge that she was thicker around the midriff than at the beginning of summer, but her broad upper torso and wide hips kept things she felt in proportion.  She knew Kevin claimed she looked fine and his opinion was more valued than Kimberly\u2019s any day. So what if she was now on the bottom of the pyramid?  She wasn\u2019t sure that her leg should be risking a fall anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber of course was rationalizing. She had no desire to diet and indeed felt Kevin might even be annoyed if she did. Thinking about Ros and Ashley she knew she wasn\u2019t the only one on the squad with a few added pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth of course Kimberrly\u2019s eyes were more accurate than Amber\u2019s in estimating her gain.  She was now well over 130, not merely approaching it as she liked to think.  But her assessment of Kevin was correct. He liked her curves as much as she did,  There was a double purpose to his exhibiting his culinary skills to her and her family \u2013 he didn\u2019t want her even thinking of diets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber tried putting in some of her older clothes.  Always snug they were definitely now too tight.  So, OK, she was heavier. But wasn\u2019t gaining a few pounds as you got older normal? For all she knew she might be taller too. The more she thought about it the more she felt like gaining some more weight just to frustrate Kimberly \u2013 but then she thought about the threats she\u2019d made to Ros. Deliberate defiance could get them both tossed off the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on her bed, her undersized old clothes in hand, thinking about what Kevin had said. \u201cYou are the only one who can decide what weight is right for you.  Not me, not Kimberly, not anyone. I think you\u2019re just fine \u2013 a bit thin for your height even. But that\u2019s subjective and my opinion. Its your body and your life.  So you have to decide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening she cornered her mom, who was a bit stout herself, and asked bluntly, \u201cdo you think I\u2019m getting fat? Do I need to go on a diet\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom had been more definite than Kevin., \u201cno and no \u2013 definitely not!  Please darling, I know you love cheerleading but don\u2019t start developing an eating disorder like so many girls are today!  I don\u2019t want you to have to go into therapy like those poor things on Oprah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig chance of that.\u201d thought Amber. She knew anorexics saw themselves as fat even when they weighed less than a hundred and were fearful of eating anything. Bulimics compensated by stuffing and purging. She knew she was just the opposite. She didn\u2019t think of herself as especially large, loved eating, and in her view didn\u2019t eat that much,  The more she thought about it the more she rejected Kimberly\u2019s position that she needed to lose 10 pounds \u201cor else.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m, just going to be my own person \u2013and f I ever get too big for Kim then bye bye cheerleading,\u201d she finally decided.  The next day, as a deliberate gesture of defiance, she and Kevin had a high calories entr\u00e9e and dessert within eyesight of a fuming Kimberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t do his every ay,\u201d she confided to her boyfriend, \u201cbut this afternoon I wanted to make a statement!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the next practice Kimberly demanded that everyone get on a scale for a weight check.  Rosa did,, but Ashley and Amber refused, stating she had no right to make such demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the captain and I set the rules,\u201d she stormed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if they discriminatory and illegal \u2013 check the Internet. Even University cheer squads are abandoning such standards,\u201d Amber pointed out. \u201dAs long as I can do splits and tumbles as good as anyone I have a right to be here even at 160 or 180.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re denying my authority?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m denying that you have the right to abuse that authority by telling others what they should weigh,\u201d replied Amber,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you admit that you\u2019re a tub and just don\u2019t like me pointing it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself or anyone here tubby, but even if we were that\u2019s a subjective term that has nothing to do with our right to be here,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly sensed that Amber was spoiling for a fight and feared that she might win. She\u2019d obviously been doing factual homework that the intellectually lazy Kim hadn\u2019t.  The fact was that Amber was excellent in all her routines and had been a junior varsity squad heads who probably had ambitions for Kimberly\u2019s job the coming year. Unlike the more phlegmatic and less skilled Rosa she might fight and win if pushed too hard. Kim backed down, swinging her head and saying \u201cyou\u2019d better decide to do what I\u2019ve told you or you could be sorry. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kimberly stormed off, leaving Rosa and Ashley amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwow, you really took the queen bee to task,\u201d Rosa said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m no drone in her hive,\u201d snapped Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d confided Ashley, \u201cI know we\u2019ve not bee lose, but for what its worth I\u2019m sorru you had to put up with that crap and thankful you spoke up.  OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked at her former mentor and said \u201cThanks. From you that took a lot. I appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she and Kevin walked off and word of the confrontation began circulating around the student body.  But to Amber the important thing was Kevin\u2019s assurance hat he would stand by her.  That evening as she and her family enjoyed the chicken marsala dinner he had prepared her parents also swore to back her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat with that girl?\u201d Amber\u2019s dad asked after he heard what had occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must be insecure inside and compensates by bullying and trying to control others weaker than her I guess,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cBut Amber\u2019s not controllable. She has a mind and a will of her own and she gives respect to those who earn it rather than threatening to harm her if she doesn\u2019t. Its how I\u2019ve tried to be and its part of why I like her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this summer you weren\u2019t just trying to be Sir Galahad to the incapacitated princess?\u2019 Amber commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I recall we discussed our GPAs rather than your tumbling scores in our first real conversation \u2013 that was a calculated diversion from your cheerleading persona and it worked,\u201d Kevin grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. Now that I recall you were acting as though that part of my life wasn\u2019t really even that significant to you,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I was at every Junior Varsity game you ever performed in \u2013 I knew your skills. But you\u2019re partly right, I had been impressed by you as a person before I even knew you were on the squad. You tackle your classes just like I do, which is rare, but you were oblivious to the similarity. While you were still part of Ashley\u2019s posse I knew it wasn\u2019t the time. I was in a world of music, business and other interests that she likely wouldn\u2019t have approved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber\u2019s parents were amazed at the seemingly casual but obviously well thought out calculations of Amber\u2019s boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo by bumping Ashley Kim did me a favor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInadvertently.  But you watch \u2013 Kim\u2019s overreaching and getting a bad rep.  She\u2019s going to stumble and when she does expect Ashley to pounce. If you notice she hasn\u2019t quit the team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that was just to please her parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey no doubt agree.  But my info is that its personal as well.  She believes she\u2019s better qualified and deserves the position.  Do you think Kim earned it fairly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t see how. It was like Kim came out of nowhere and grabbed it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd not even that. Kim was given it by people who wanted to teach Ashley\u2019s family a lesson,  Kim doesn\u2019t realize that, of course. Right now she thinks she\u2019s Miss Superior and is off on a power trip with an ego the size of the Astrodome waiting to go pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley probably thinks she\u2019s superior as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know her like you do, but I feel her attitude is one of quiet entitlement that comes with those who are born to power - I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen her bully or abuse anyone, Its different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber thought a moment. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re right. She was at times patronizing and condescending, but I can\u2019t think of her ever insulting people like Kim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts called class. People like her don\u2019t do it even to those they regard as their inferiors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe even apologized to me for the way I\u2019m being treated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed \u2013 like I say, she\u2019s taken a fall, learned some lessons and is looking for payback. her fury is building and she\u2019s biding her time looking for an opening. Now, if I\u2019ve pontificated enough is everyone ready for Cr\u00e8me Brule for dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kevin really had impressed Amber's parents both with his cooking and his words. It was exactly what Kevin had wanted to do. Amber was glad to have finally found a boyfriend that her parents liked but she liked alot too. Most of the boyfriends they had approved of before were nerds. Kevin was definitely not a nerd so he met both his parents and her wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber giggled when she heard Kevin ask who was ready for Creme Brule for dessert. Even though she was quite full, she still had room for dessert. She had a big sweet tooth after all and she always saved room for dessert. \"I am\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's mom also agrees to have oen while her dad says he will take a little of his wife's. Kevin nods, picks up the dirty dishes, and heads back into the kitchen. A few minutes later he returns with two Creme Brules. He set one down in front of Amber and the other down in front of her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber eagerly picks up her spoon and digs in, taking a bite. \"Mm, so good\" she moaned softly. Her mom took a bite and agreed and then her dad followed suit. They finished their dessert and then headed upstairs to read and watch tv, giving Amber and Kevin sometime to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have really impressed my parents. You are the first guy I have liked that has done it\" Amber said. She couldn't believe that she had just met that but she felt comfortable to be honest around Kevin. In a way it seemed a bit early to tell Kevin she liked him when he wasn't the type of guy she usually dated but she had realized lately that she really did like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad. I like you alot Amber. I am sorry that we didn't get to know each other sooner but better late then never\" Kevin said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber giggled and nodded. She happily talked with him about them as she finished her creme brule. It was so good and she was so concentrating on their conversation that she didn't realize how fast she was eating it until she had finished it. By that time, they had agreed to officially start dating. \"Aw, I can't believe I finished the Creme Brule already. It was so good. I should have eaten slower since I am sure I can't have another one\" she said with a cute little pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily\" Kevin said and he quickly rushed into the kitchen to return a moment later with another creme brule. They continued talking as Amber ate the second one. She tried to eat it slower but found it impossible. After dessert, they retreated to the couch where they cuddled, and talked some more. Then before he left, her gave a good night kiss that sent her up to bed in a happy stuffed daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a school wardrobe carefully selected to leave room for growth Amber really wasn\u2019t concerned about gaining weight given Kevin\u2019s attitude and her mom\u2019s concerns.  She and Kevin were instead focused on maintaining their grades and enjoying activities that most kids their age never thought about.  Earlier in the summer Kevin had taken her 80 miles to see a mini-rodeo, on another occasion 6 miles to see Navy fliers in an air exhibition, and one weekend they\u2019d traveled to see a country and western show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin really liked Amber and he knew her active mind was stimulated by the unusual, and with school back in session he knew weekdays would be occupied by cheerleading no matter who headed the team. He also knew hat meant that weekends were the best time to share activities with Amber \u2013 \u201ccultural enrichment\u201d activities  that more often than not involved food with plenty of calories..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visit by country singer Merle Haggard, for example, made for an associated visit to the Mesquite Inn, featuring such delicacies as bison burgers whole wheat penne pasta and goat cheese salads. A flower festival led them to discovering a family caf\u00e9 with specialties such as pumpkin pancakes, peach and brie cheese canap\u00e9s, grilled lemon trout, and asiago pilaf.  Each week Kevin tried to find some new and different treat for his Amber and she enjoyed every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen as predicted Kimberly took her tumble and Ashley, now much plumper herself, reassumed the mantle of squad captain Amber felt no pressure to diet., even as her weight shot past 150. She was learning from Kevin novel men=u items to serve her family like Spinach and Arugula Salad with Tomatoes and Oranges, Rosemary Orange Green Beans and Orange Roughy with Red Pepper Sauce.  Of course she couldn\u2019t help share this knowledge with classmates and as a result they began calling her the campus \u201cJulia Child,\u201d which she treated as a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led Monica Raynes, editor of the school paper, to have an idea for the school\u2019s food court.  She\u2019d read an article about a Washington DC school whose cafeteria service was so bad students were shunning it, so thy brought in outside chefs to retrain the food service workers and revamp the menu.  She wrote an editorial <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would happen if the ASB ran the cafeteria\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts not likely that the unions and faculty would go along, but like Martin Luther King I have a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this dream the food in our cafeteria would be part of the curriculum.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I\u2019m talking student-designed menus cooked under supervision by student chefs and served by student workers who are our classmates. It would provide work experience in an industry that employs 1 out of 7 Americans (look it up!), partially relieve funding problems for the District and perhaps even provide some extra funds for the ASB.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSound crazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, its not so loony when you hear what Kevin Marshall and cheerleader Amber Hollings discuss with their fellows \u2013 and even prepare for themselves on the weekends. We have the recipes and skills, and costs could be managed if we have the commitment.  Why not start with a once a week \u201cstudent food day: with various clubs taking over selected duties of our food service staff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so insane after all, is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly beats the alternative being pushed by outside corporate interests who want to push KFC and the Mexican telephone company (Taco Bell) down our throats. Those who want such fare can get it off campus within three blocks.  I think we can do better in-house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dream or a nightmare?  You decide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Amber weren\u2019t briefed ahead of time, but the article definitely caught he community\u2019s attention.  A local talk show host asked them along with Monica for an interview. Kevin asked Monica and Amber what they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica of course was all for it.  Amber was more analytical. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s focus on variety and practicality \u2013 this is actually doable you know, especially if they\u2019re paying people so they don\u2019t lose interest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin agreed. \u201cObviously students can\u2019t do all the cooking because we have classes, but the menus would be a snap -  and if you\u2019re paying the servers you\u2019ll have people standing in line for the jobs,.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio agreed to the program and showed up with folios of notes so hat they wouldn\u2019t freeze up.  The host put them at ease and the audience response was one of interest.  One caller, however, challenged hem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is behind this?  I can\u2019t believe three kids just made this up one afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin jumped on the question.  \u201cActually we didn\u2019t dream it up at all. Monica wrote thee editorial based on our jabbering about what we do anyway on the weekends. I\u2019ve been cooking for several years and Amber is quite creative as well, but it\u2019s just an interest. I play three musical instruments as well, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m aspiring to be a recording star. If youth can do music and be respected at age 16 or 18, why not food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica chimed in \u201cWhat problem do you have with teens looking to take charge of their lives instead of just mooching off others.  It seems everybody wants to say to kids \u201cwe have a program for you\u201d instead of asking \u201cwhat do you think you can do for yourselves.\u201d We want to be part of the answer, not treated as the problem that needs to be fixed when it comes to education!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was proactive. \u201cYou may not know it, but a lot of latch key kids make peanut butter sandwiches or microwave popcorn as it is after school.  Kevin and I happen to have tastes that go beyond that \u2013 and Monica saw that we could share them with others on a larger scale because we were already doing it. She\u2019s the school paper editor \u2013 its her job to have some independent vision!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young people came across not as rebel activists trying to tear down the establishment, but as would be entrepreneurs \u2013and the audience was impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext help came from an unexpected source. As a result of the program the local restaurant association chapter contacted the school superintendent, suggesting funding of a program in food service as an elective class.  Suddenly Monica\u2019s dream had legs, although that aspect couldn\u2019t be implemented until the next school year. .  But there was still the problem of the food service employees union.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end even the union was placated when affairs were ranged to make sure no jobs were lost. Instead the food variety was expanded one day a week. The regular food service workers focused on preparation while the students did the serving.  Amber and Kevin wound up heading an advisory team that worked on the menu. For the balance of the year every Friday was student menu day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this of course enhanced both their reputations and Amber\u2019s waistline (along with Kebvin's). But since they were now semi-celebrities not even Kimberly dared complain.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Amber's enhanced popularity (not that it had been lacking before), and Kevin's populary growth, they were starting to hang out with more people and specifically more couples. They would hang out with these other couples at break and lunch and then do things together after school and on the weekends. Their after school and weekend activities consisted of them attending some kind of event like a car race or a surfing even where they (especially the girls) would be snacking alot and then go for dinner afterwards. It was always alot of fun and continued to add to Amber and Kevin's waistline, especially Amber's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Saturday Amber and Kevin were going to the Fall Out Boy concert with a new couple, Nina and Robert. Robert was a good friend of Kevin's and from his same social group. He had dirty blonde hair with blue eyes and stood at 5'7. He had a husky built and had a small chubby tummy but was considered cute. Nina was a pretty and popular girl with light blonde hair and blue eyes. She stood at 5'6  and 135 pounds with slender body, c cup breasts and a little round belly. Nina and Robert were alot like Amber and Kevin as they were another popular girl with not so popular guy couple. Nina had a great personality and was alot of fun to be around while Robert was more reserved but very nice and funny. Nina had always been friendly with Amber but it hadn't been until recently that they had become close friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concert was in the next town and started at two and so they left from Amber's house at 10. At about noon they stopped at Panera breads for lunch. Amber ordered the Frontenga Chicken hot panni sandwhich with chips and a large soda. Nina ordered the Chipotie Chicken signature sandwhich with chips and a large soda. Kevin ordered the Tuna salad cafe sandwich with a small soda and Robert ordered a bowl of the chicken noodle soup with a small soda. As the boys paid for the food, the girls grabbed some utensils and napkins before finding an empty booth, Amber on one side and Nina on the other. After paying, the boys waited for the food before bringing over to the table, and sitting down next to their girl. Everyone grabbed their food and dug in while talking about their favorite Fall Out Boy songs and other favorite songs of theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Robert ate their sandwhiches at a regular pace while watching with great interests as their girlfriends hungrily ate their sandwhiches. Robert was an fa and feeder just like Kevin. He loved Nina's little round belly and wanted to see it grow bigger. He wanted Nina to grow all over. Kevin had promised he and Amber would help him encourage Nina to grow. Nina already loved to eat and ate enough to maintain that small round belly of hers so Kevin assured Robert it wouldn't be hard to get Nina to gain. All they had to do was get her to eat more and constantly while he (Robert) told her how much he liked her belly and wanted to see her gain more weight. All three, Amber, Kevin, and Robert had agreed to bring Nina into the world of gaining over dinner though they would make sure that Nina got plenty to eat at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were so hungry and their sandwhiche was so good that they finished their sandwhiches and chips before the boys finished their meals. The girls nursed the rest of their sodas while talking about who was dating how and other school gossip. Since Nina was engaged in a conversation with Amber, Kevin and Robert used the opportunity to discuss the plans for dinner later. After the boys finished their meals their meal, Kevin gazed over at the girls with a smile. \"Now before we go I think that we should get our lovely girlfriends a treat to eat before we continue on to the concert. \"Sorta of like sweets for the sweets eh?\" Robert asked with a chuckle. \"Seriously though I think it's a good idea\" he then added. \"Well I know I can't ever so name to sweets so I am in. How about you Nina?\" Amber replied. \"Me neither. They had a blueberry muffin so could you get me that please?\" she asked Robert sweetly with her best smile. \"Of course\" Robert said before quickly heading over to the register while there was no line to get it for her. \"How about you beautiful?\" Kevin asked Amber. \"I would like the cinnamon roll\" Amber told her. \"Be right back\" Kevin said before joining Robert at the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still thristy and I want some soda for the road so I am going to get a refill\" Amber said after the boys left. \"Sounds like a good idea, I will get one myself\" Nina said. The girls got up and walked over to the soda machine and each refilled their drinks before returning to the table. A minute later the boys returned with the sweets after paying. Both girls having big sweet tooths eagerly dug in. In between their big mouthfuls, they did ask their boyfriends if they wanted any but they refused as they wanted their girlfriends to have their treat all to themselves which the girls didn't mind in the least. After finishing their treats, they got back into the car, and drove the rest of the way to the concert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concert was excellent. Amber and Nina screamed, danced, and sang all through the show while Kevin and Robert enjoyed lising to the movie. Amber enjoyed having more ass to shake and it didn't escape Nina's notice how much fun Amber was having shaking it, how much Kevin was enjoying slapping it, and all the attention she was getting because of it. Nina had always thought it would be nice to have a bigger ass as guys seemed to like girls with big asses. After the concert ended, they got back into their car, and started to head out. \"So where should we go to eat for dinner?' Kevin asked as they drove out of the concert venue parking lot. \"Ooh, I know. The Cheesecake Factory. I saw one not too far from here and we haven't been there in awhile\" Amber suggusted. \"Fine by me, cool with you guys?\" Kevin asked Nina and Robert who both agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving to the Cheese Factory, parking, and getting a seat in a comfy booth with Amber and Kevin on one side with Nina and Robert on the other, they all began to look over the menus. After they all had a chance to look over the menus for a bit, Robert looked over at Nina with a smile and said, \"Get whatever you want and however much you want. It's my treat\". \"Aw, thank you Robert. That is sweet of you\" Nina replied sweetly. \"That goes for you too Amber\" Kevin grinned at her. \"Thanks Kevin\" Amber giggled cutely. Amber ordered the southern fried chicken sliders for an appetizer and a cheese pizza for her main course with a soda. Nina ordered the fried macaroni and cheese for an appetizer and the four cheese pasta for her main course with a soda to drink. Kevin just ordered a main course of shrimp and chicken gumbo with a soda and Robert just ordered the pasta arrabbiata with a soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they placed their orders and got their drinks, Amber took a sip of her drink and looked over at Nina. \"I have had their four cheese pasta before. It's delicous. You will love it\" she replied. \"Oh good. It's always been one of my favorite dishes\" Nina replied. A few minutes later the girls' appetizers were brought in and they both eagerly started eating as the the boys looked on with smiles. \"You know Nina, I love to watch you eat. You seem to really just enjoy eating, particuarly good foods. You seem at your happiest when you are eating and there is something very sensous about it\" Robert said. \"Well I do love to eat as you can tell by my eating habits and my little round belly\" she said with an embarased little laugh. \"I love to eat too Nina and I am heavier then you so you have nothing to worry about\" Amber said to her with a reassuring smile before eating some more of her fried chicken sliders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be truthful Nina, I like your little round belly. I would actually like to see it bigger\" Robert said. He surprisngly found it more easy and comfortable to say then he had thought it would be. \"Really?\" Nina asked him in surprise but not in a bad way. \"Yeah and you would be surprised how many guys like a girl with a tummy\" Robert replied with a smile. \"It's true Nina. Alot of guys like girls with curvier and heavier figures. It's more attractive, feminine, and sexy to us\" Kevin added. \"Myself and the other girls on the squad have recently realized this and found guys who love us heavier. We are enjoying getting to eat all we want and the extra weight we have put on. Like you I have always enjoyed eating and now for the first time I am really getting to indulge in all of my favorite foods without guilt and then Kevin and I get to enjoy the extra prounds I have gained. It's fabulous\" Amber explained as she finished off her fried chicken sliders and washed it down with a couple sips of her soda.  \"Wow, that sounds fabulous! I would definitely enjoy being able to do that. I had noticed how much more you had been eating lately and it's effects on your body and how you have loved and enjoyed it all. I was tempted to try it but I didn't think a guy would find me attractive if I gained but obviously I was wrong\" Nina replied as she looked over at Robert with a smile. He returned the smile and said, \"I would love it if you gained but the choice is yours. You are beautiful as is and gaining weight will only make you more beautiful in my eyes\" he said in a sincere tone. \"Honestly Robert I would love to enjoy food and gain weight like Amber has been doing. I honestly want to and now I can with the help of my boyfriend who will enjoy my eating and gaining as much as I am\" Nina replied honestly with a big smile. With renewed energy, Nina quickly finished off the rest of her appetizer and washed it down with a couple sips of her soda while Robert looked on with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the main courses was served, the girls quickly dug in while the boys looked on with smiles. Kevin and Robert enjoyed eating their food while watching the girls really attack their food. Both Amber and Nina seemed to be enjoying their plates, stuffing bite after bite into their mouth, moaning in pleasure, only stopping to wipe sauce or cheese off their face, and take a couple sips of their soda. The boys finished their plates as they hadn't been as filling as the girls and as the girls got full, they encouraged them to keep eating and before long both girls had finished their places. \"Oh wow, I am so stuffed. I haven't ever felt this stuffed before but it feels so good\" Nina moaned softly as she laid back in her seat, rubbing her bloated belly in one hand while taking another sip of her soda. Robert looked over Nina, a big smile spreading across his face, loving what he saw. \"Doesn't it feel so good to be stuffed?' Amber agreed with a smile as she laid back in her seat, rubbing her tummy as well after taking another sip of her soda. Kevin beamed over at Amber, loving seeing her so full and bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know both of you are pretty stuffed but I bet you have some room for dessert. I know Amber does\" Kevin said with a chuckle. Amber giggled at that. \"Oh I do have room for dessert. You know I always save room for dessert\" she said with a smile. \"How about you Nina?\" Robert asked her. \"I doubt you want to let Amber eat more then you since you seem to be pretty convinced you love to eat more then she does\" he said with a wink, trying to awake Nina's competitive side to get her to have some dessert. \"Well I do love desserts and I doubt I will be able to resist after I see Amber's dessert so okay\" Nina agreed with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amber had been more open with Nina and Robert than anyone else about what had been happening on the Boar squad.  She and the others truly didn\u2019t mind being larger \u2013 and knew that Kimberly, if she returned, would be unable to reverse the effects no matter how much she ranted and stormed.  Although, if Kevin was right, Kim wasn\u2019t getting any smaller either and had mellowed considerably in her weight bias. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe media notoriety for the school cafeteria experience explained a lot \u2013 and now at the Cheesecake factory the already slightly stuffed dates were about to select dessert   The Factory is famous for its over 50 legendary cheesecakes and specialty desserts, so they had plenty of options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh look!\u201d exclaimed Nina, \u201ca sundae of ice cream and brownies with Lady Godiva chocolate. It even has whipped cream and almonds  \u2013 now that has to be something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can give me a bite and I\u2018ll share whatever I get with you,\u201d remarked Amber. Although she was comfortably full she felt a little competitive towards her counterpart. If Nina was going to have a full dessert so would she! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d asked Kevin innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast time I was here I passed on the chocolate tower truffle cake \u2013 it\u2019s a real work of art.\u201d Amber replied with an aura of experienced authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? How so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLayers of fudge cake interspersed with chocolate truffle cr\u00e8me and chocolate mousse \u2013 you\u2019re the cook.  How complex is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery.\u201d  Kevin acknowledged, his mind mentally calculating the probable calories.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Amber pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin paused.\u201d \u201cA slice of lemon raspberry cream cheese cake.  Robert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you mix cheesecake and Dutch Apple Streusel? It looks intriguing so I think I\u2019ll find out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four teens placed their dessert orders with a coffee topper and were truly stuffed by evenings\u2019 end. But as Kevin walked Amber to the car he cradled her love handles gently with his palm and walked slowly. She could tell he was reluctant for the night to end and she felt the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home she was tired and ready for bed, too full to even consider a midnight bagel and cream cheese treat like she sometimes did. Nor did she explore the kitchen pantry where a carrot cake lay in wait,  As she fingered her plump cheeks, soft belly and tender inner thighs she was conscious that, except for Rosa and possibly Ash she was now the largest on the squad, thirty five pounds heavier than the year before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thing cheer season is going to be over in a month,\u201d she thought. \u201cI\u2019d be too fat for the uniform \u2013 but why don\u2019t I care?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answers she knew were multiple. She loved eating, especially with Kevin.  The generous meals at Rosa\u2019s, the big lunches at school and ample breakfasts at home weren\u2019t bad either  She\u2019d become a foodie and inside knew and accepted that.  It helped that her peers were porking out as well and no oe was criticizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her assertion to Nina had surprised even her \u2013 but Kevin and Robert backed her up.  It was fun to be fat, at least for her; she did like how guys ogled her growing curves, and as she drifted off to sleep she was happy thinking about food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept she had no way of knowing that Ashley and Kim had been speaking with Rosa, or that Randy and Kevin were getting together the next morning with Brian, Don and Bradley for breakfast. Amber was a follower, and a very good one, but not a grand strategist. Randy, however, was and a foundation was being laid for some things neither the cheerleaders or the town factions that so hated the Morton family could have anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Amber and her friends knew none of this.  She did know that she, like the others would probably be sleeping in.  Amber\u2019s mom had promised to make vanilla blueberry crepes in the morning  and, had she thought of it, the picture would have given her a smile and caused her tastebuds to water.  Butt she was too sated and slept soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise Trixie had gone to a movie with Don, then enjoyed a Baja Fresh chicken Diablo burrito on the way home. She\u2019d played computer games until after midnight, then wandered into the kitchen and found some left over chicken and dumpling soup and some banana cake.  That was more than enough to insure her slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, everyone was well filled, happy with the significant other in their life and content \u2013 except for Linda. Even though assured that there would be no retaliation for her prank, she had been nervous about her unmasking for a week \u2013 and that had manifested in a lot of eating, not from hunger or joy but from nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her protestations of relief about not having to east pizza and macaroni till she popped Linda had effectively been doing just that. She started easting meals similar to her classmates at lunch, but the real changes were in the afternoon and evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonday she\u2019d had a box of macaroni and cheese after school, then ice cream after supper.  On Tuesday it was an out of the box pizza and the butterscotch pudding. Wednesday she had a chance to attend an hibachi b-b-que and had a plate in her hand the entire evening \u2013 surprising her mom who asked why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201c just hungry I guess,\u201d she fudged. Her mom accepted the answer and said no more \u2013 but might have if she\u2019d seethe two pieces of pie and here of cake she\u2019d had for dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday night she had a real treat \u2013 a carton of Reese\u2019s Pieces pastel colored eggs that were on special display at the market.  She managed to nibble through the entire carton while studying.  All that did was make her super thirsty so she went over to a local dinner and had a \u201ccake shake,\u201d  For those unfamiliar with this concoction it is drink served in a large bowl that is a blend of Vanilla ice, Cake Creme Frappee, Rainbow sprinkles, and 1% milk, all topped with Homemade whipped cream and sprinkles.  Its great for lovers to share, but Linda drank alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday she went with her parent\u2019s to her uncle\u2019s housed where she ate normally for supper \u2013 but hen snacked the entire evening. To her mom this was quite unusual behavior and evidence tat something was troubling her daughter.  When they got home she decided to confront her, but in a way that she hoped would bring results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLinda, come in the kitchen for a moment. I have a surprise\u201d she said,\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke out a quart of pistachio nut ice cram and laid out two bowls. Linda\u2019s mind wanted to resist, but her eyes got big and her saliva did a Pavlovian response, so she gave in as her mom said \u201d\u201cHere, thought we might share this as we talked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, er, why?\u201d Linda replied as she accepted her bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tell me. You know I\u2019m not one to worry about pounds \u2013 but what\u2019s behind the improved appetite? You having boy problems?\u201d\u2019 her mom queried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLack of boy is more like it,\u201d said Linda\u201d every girl on the cheerleading team except me has gotten fat and they all have guys, now how weird is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to be like them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda shook her head. \u201cNo, not deliberately anyway. I\u2019ve just developed an appetite this past week. I\u2019ll try to be better!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLinda,\u201d her mom said with as much kindness as she could muster. \u201cDon\u2019t let me control you. If you want to eat, or not eat, do it to please yourself \u2013 not me. But if you\u2019re eating because something\u2019s bothering you I\u2019m, here for you. OK\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda smiled. \u201cOK \u2013 I can tell you this. I made a big mess and was forgiven, but I\u2019ve been fearful that it might come out anyway. That may be sprat of it. I\u2019ll tell you what I did \u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Linda finished her mom just shook her heads \u201cAshley and Amber seem pretty mature and charitable for teenagers. Well, enjoy your ice cream \u2013 I hope it helps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she left, with Linda and her thoughts alone, knowing that the rest of the quart was in the freezer.  But she felt full and simply went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Maybe I shouldn't have gone to that party last night.' Rose thought to herself as she hurried into the locker rooms, dragging her cheer bag behind her already half unzipped. Once inside she threw her bag on the bench and began to strip her gray sweats and sweater off as fast as she could. She then moaned to herself, \"God, why did Kimberly have to make practice so early on Saturdays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill half asleep, she unzipped the other half of the bag and pulled out her uniform. She threw on the top without trouble, but like with everything else she struggled with the bottom half. Kimberly had given all the girls the same size uniform as last year, but it seems poor Rose added a little extra fat around her rear again. She looked in the full length mirror near by and was disgusted at what she saw. Her black panties squeezed tightly around her ass and began to sink into her fat. It seems to be just fat now with barely any muscle as she felt how jiggly it was. \"Great, just what I wanted to see in the morning\" Rose said, giving her butt a little slap which responded with a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many tries of tugging and pulling, her skirt finally went up to her hips. \"At least I haven't gotten to big for my old uniform.\" A slight muffin top became barely visible, that wasn't there last year. This all must of been because all the slacking off she did during her summer break. Rosa tried her best to diet over the summer, but she was to use of her mother's cooking. It was a wonder how her older sister mange to stay so slim, she eats the same amount as her. Exercise didn't go well for her either. She would slack off to much with no one there to keep yelling at her. Beside she would rather spend time getting ready for a party than to workout. The cheer squad seemed to be the only thing that kept her weight down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to worry about having to do back flips and cartwheels during practice. She didn't have much time to think about that, because as soon as Rose stepped outside Kimberly began to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been. Practice started thirty minutes ago! Everyone else was her twenty minutes early, while you were thirty minutes late! It is the first fuc........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose just stood there trying her best to ignore here. 'Dam, first day of practice and I am already getting yelled at.' was all she thought when Kimberly keep yelling. Kimberly went on and on about how things are going to be different this year and how she is tried of Rose slacking off all the time. Rose then let out a loud yawn, which really set Kimberly off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU EVEN TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY!\" Rose then knew she made a mistake and tried to apologize but it was to late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuriously Kimberly yelled, \"WELL YOU KNOW WHAT...\"</span></div></div>",

She then began to walk back to the rest of the team as Rose began to plead to Kimberly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this me. Please let me stay on the squad. I have been in cheer for like my whole life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been in it for barely one year and yet you are not even on the same level as me. Just leave your gear in the locker room and get off my field.\" The other members began practicing immediately, fearing Kimberly would do the same to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose ran back to the locker room trying her best not to cry. She couldn't believe she just got kicked off the team and no one on the team tried to stand up for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in her car for about ten minutes and fixed her makeup so her family couldn't tell she was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she walk thru the front door her mother greeted her from the kitchen. \"Welcome home sweetie. Did practice end early or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose could smelled the eggs and bacon her mother was cooking. \"Something like that I guess. I don't wanna talk about it right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when your done upstairs, come back down and have some breakfast with us.\" Rose's hunger soon took over her sadness, as the smell of the bacon sizzling and eggs frying entered thru her nose. She knew if she stood downstairs any longer she would go gulf down some breakfast. So she ran straight to her room and change out of her work gear and back into her light blue silk Pjs . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose then flopped on her bed and sighed, \"Great, I get kicked off the cheer squad and my mother is already trying to stuff me with food. It won't be long till I turn into a disgusting fat-so now.\"  She buried her head in her pillow and let out a scream.</span></div></div>",

It's not my fault that I know how to have a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could they kick her off the squad? They needed her. How would they do the pyramid? Without her, it would be unstable, and Kimberly would fall off and break her leg. Then they'ed all be like 'Come back Rosa, we need you, Kimberly was stupid and wrong to kick you out. We're so, so sorry!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with this idea, Rosa sat up in bed, and immediately her nostrils were quivering as the smell of bacon wafted up the stairs. She licked her lips subconsciously. She silently debated whether or not to resist the temptation, then shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I'm off the team, I might as well enjoy myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa lounged into the kitchen, a fairly modest affair. The walls were a pastel cream, and were dominated by two large bay windows, which let daylight stream in, illuminating a tasteful oak decor.  All of these little details were lost on Rosa, whose attention was instantly grabbed by the sight of a table covered in food. Crispy bacon was piled high on one plate, and a massive bowl of scrambled eggs was sitting next to it. There was a stack of pancakes in front of each chair, and two large pitchers, one of milk and one of OJ, sat on a sideboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa sat down and quickly began filling her plate with food. Two big spoons of eggs, a handful of bacon, a big glass of milk... She was just about to dig in when her mother wandered in, carrying a tray of cupcakes, each delicately iced with pale pink frosting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Rosa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Despite living in the U.S for years, her mother still spoke with a slight Spanish accent <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to call you down. I see you've already helped yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She said this last part with a wink, noting her crowded plate. She was a plump woman, in her late thirties, and like Rosa, most of her weight was carried in her hips and ass. She was simply dressed in a white blouse and tan skirt, though both items were covered by a heavily-embroidered and much used apron. She smiled as she set the tray down, and pulled off a pair of bright orange oven gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't hold back on my account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa dug in, shoveling egg into her mouth, pausing occasionally to stuff a few strips of bacon in there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMmmmmmmmMmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how many times she had it, it always surprised her just how good her mother's cooking was. Even as her mother sat down next to her, she didn't slow her pace. She continued to eat, grinding the crunchy rind between her teeth. Eventually she stopped, but only to pile more food on to her plate. She hadn't allowed herself to eat like this in months, and now she was really enjoying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was beginning to feel full, her mother asked her the question she'd been hoping to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened at cheerleading practice?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So enjoy your food., a few pounds will do you good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa realized her mom was inferring that she'd gain weight and never be back on the team, and wasn't really concerned about it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After breakfast, Rosa grabs a couple cupcakes for the road, slide her purse over her shoulder, and heads out to her car. She gets in, takes off her purse, setting it down on the passenger chair, pulls out a napkin from it, wrapping the cupcakes in the napkin, and putting it into her purse. She then started her car, backed out, and started heading for school. She had originally planned to save the cupcakes for later but their intoxicating smell was making it hard to resist. Finally she decided to give in. She pulled into the parking lot of the Starbucks on the way to school, found a spot near the front of the store, parked, grabbed her purse, and headed inside. She got into line which luckily wasn't too long and before it was her turn. She ordered a Cinnamon Dolce Frappuccino Blended Coffee, pay, and then stand off to the side to wait for her drink. A minute later, she picks up her drink, walks over to an empty table, and takes a seat. She is still pretty full from breakfast but she does have a little room left. She crosses her legs as she sets her purse down on the table. She pulls out the napkin covered cupcakes. She pulls out one and takes a bite. \"Mm, so good\" she moaned softly before washing it down with a sip of her drink. The cupcakes are so good that she finishes both of them quickly. She decides to finish her drink on the ride over to school. She picks up herp urse, slides it over her shoulder, grabs her drink, and the napkin, and heads out of the store, stopping at the trash can to thow away the napkin. She gets back into her car and drives to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching for a spot in the school parking lot for a few minutes, she finally finds one, and pulls into it. She grabbed her purse and drink, got out of the car, locked the doors. She then sauntered into school drinking her drink. She had been expecting everyone to be talking about her getting kicked off the cheerleading squad and so was trying to bring too much attention to herself or look over at too many people. To her pleasant surprise, only a few people were really talking about it, and none were saying anything that nasty or said anything to her.  Maybe I do have some people on my side or don't agree with Kimberly she thought to herself which made her feel even better. She got to her locker, opened it, and began looking through it for what she needed for her first couple of classes while she finished off her Frappuccino. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a familar voice, Rosa turned and smiled as she saw her crush Bradley. \"Hi Rosa\" Bradley smiled at her. Bradley was a white guy with short blonde hair, blue eyes and a thin physique but with just the right amound of muscles. He had broad shoulders, muscular arms, and a six pack. He was what she called hot. Despite his good looks, he seemed to be very shy around girls. He was always very sweet to them, especially her, always complimenting her and asking how she was but had never asked her out. It was a complaint that many girls shared with her. \"Hi Bradley, how are you?\" she asked him sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing good thanks. I..would like to ask you something. I know it's going to seem out of the blue but I have wanted to do this for a while. I am not sure how to do this but...will you go out to lunch with me today?\" Bradley asked her with a hopeful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my god, Bradley asked me out, he asked me out Rosa thought to herself happily.  Bradley asking her out was something that she had been wanting for a long time and to finally have it happen, it made it almost worth it that she got kicked off the cheerleading squad. It also made her feel more confident that this meant that Bradley didn't just like her because she was a cheerleader as she was sure that he would have heard by know that she had gotten kicked off the cheerleading squad. Rumors and news spread fast around Oak Hills High. Kimberly is the head cheerleder but I am the one with a date at lunch she thought to herself happily. \"Of course I will go to lunch with you Bradley, that sound lovely\" she replied cutely as she gave him her best smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I will meet you here at your locker at lunch time\" Bradley replied before walking over to Rosa, giving her a hug, before walking off to his class. Rosa could only smile as she felt Bradley hug her, feeling same and warm in his strong arms, causing her whole to body to tingle in pleasure. After Bradley walked out, she got the things she needed out of her locker, finished her drink, tossed it into a trash can, and headed to her first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her breakfast, cupcakes, and frappuccino all in her tummy Rosa\u2019s already concave belly was looking its chunkiest as she made her way to class. Along he way she encountered Trixie, whose first thought was \u201cYeah, Rosa\u2019s packed on a few \u2013 I can see that gut even under the pullover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut openly Tricie was nice to her former teammate. \u201cHi, Rosa \u2013 you look well today. I\u2019m so sorry about what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Kimberly makes too much of her own rules  I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that she\u2019s so skinny herself, I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s had some battles with the scale herself.\u201d noted Trixie with a bit of a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould be, but truth is I\u2019m from a background that doesn\u2019t judge everything by its  size. I might even surprise her by gaining a bit more and getting a boyfriend now that I\u2019ll have more time.\u201d replied Rosa.  She didn\u2019t tell her that she had a lunch date with Bradley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAre you kidding me? You can get over not being cheer so easily?\u201d\u201c noted Trixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen Ashley was running things she was a little bit superior at times, but she ran things for the Boars and didn\u2019t just put herself center stage.  It was a team and while she was Captain we were her mates. You had your job and did it \u2013 no issues, no special rules to make her look special.  Kimberly thinks its all bout her. She even brags about not doing her own homework \u2013 she intimidates guys into doing it. What kind of example is that?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie thought a moment.  Ashley indeed might be a little snobbish, but her scholastic efforts were her own.  Rosa was essentially right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did Kimberly get to be captain then, if Ashley is so great?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley\u2019s family has a lot of wealth and influence, and there are those who resent it and don\u2019t want a member of that clan being top dog. So Kimberly comes along and strings get pulled. My information is that Kimberly was just a convenient puppet and is too vain to even know it.  What I don\u2019t get is Ashley taking it and staying on the team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is kind of strange, I have to admit. Maybe she just likes the glamour?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d said Rosa. Frankly if she would have left, so would have I.  Well, I have to get to class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Trixie to think about the situation Rosa went on to her first period.  She was thinking about lunch with Bradley.  Kimberly wasn\u2019t worth her time.  As she slid into the molded desk she noticed that her bloated midriff seemed a bit more snug than normal, but paid it little mind. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rosa's classes leading up to lunchtime seemed to take forever but finally it was lunch time. Yes she thought to herself as she heard the lunchbell ring. Despite all she had eaten earlier in the day, she was really hungry by now. She stood up and stretched a little, smiling to herself as she noticed her booty jiggling and one of the nerdy boys in the class, a guy named Melvin watching, unable to take his eyes off of her. Now while she thought it was wrong to use your looks to tease a nerd to get him to do your work for you, she didn't however think it was wrong to tease the nerds for fun. \"Hi Melvin\" she said sweetly with a smile as she grabbed her purse, slide it over her shoulder, grabbed her books, and sexily sauntered off, swaying hips and booty to tease him. Melvin could only watch her walk away, mesmorized, and sheepishly wave good bye though it was too late for Rosa to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to her locker, put away her books, retouched her hair and makeup as she wanted to look perfect for her lunch date afterall, and sprayed on a little perfume. She had just finished and had closed her locker door when Bradley came over to her. He seemed to walking with more confidence this time around and she liked it. \"Hi Rosa, you look beautiful. You ready to get some luch?\" he asked her. \"Thanks Bradley. I am, I am starved\" she replied cutely with a giggle. Bradley offered his arm to her which she took, and allowed him to lead her out of the school and over to his car. He helped her in, got in himself, started the engine, and they were off. \"So where would you like to go for lunch?\" he asked her. \"Hm, I am in the mood for Taco Bell today\" she said after a moment. \"Good choice. I like Taco Bell myself and luckily there is one not too far from school\" he said before heading towards Taco Bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at Taco Bell a couple of minutes later, Bradley helped Rosa out, and they headed inside. The line was a little long and they got in line behind the last person. \"Hopefully this line moves quickly\" Rosa said to Bradley with a smile. \"Hopefully\" he agreed with a nod. \"Now remember, this is my treat and order whatever you want and however much you want\" he continued. \"I will and thank you' she replied sweetly with a smile. A couple minutes later it was their turn to order. Bradley ordered a chicken fiesta burrito with two crunchy tacos and a small soda. Rosa then ordered two bean and cheese burritos with three cruncy tacos, nachos, cinnamon twists, and a large soda. Bradley looked over at Rosa impressed and she giggled a little. Bradley paid and then they went off to get their drinks as they waited for their food to get ready. Bradley got Coke while Rosa got Mountain Dew. \"Why don't you grab us a table while I grab our food?\" he suggusted. \"Okay, good idea\" Rosa nodded. She sauntered off to find a table, swaying her hips and ass to tease Bradley. She smiled to herelf as she felt both his and some other guys' eyes on her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa found a booth near the back and slipped inside it. She set her drink on the table and took a couple sips of her soda. She set her purse down next to her, pulled her cell phone out, checked her text messages, and replied to a few. She looked up with a smile when Bradley came over with their food. \"Here we go\" he said proudly. \"Mm, it all looks and smells delicious\" Rosa said as she watched Bradley set the tray down in front of them. They each grabbed their food and a couple of napkins off the tray and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBradley ate his food at a normal pace while happily watching Rosa dig into hers with a gusto. She was so hungry and the bean burrito was so good that she finished it quickly. She stopped only for a couple sips of her soda before starting on the second bean burrito. Bradley smiled as he watched Rosa eat. He liked it when a girl had a big healthy appetite and had the weight to show it. He was both a fat admirer and feeder and while he didn't broadcast it, he wouldn't consider himself a closet version either. He had his eyes on Rosa since the first time he saw her. He thought she was beautiful but definitely wanted to see her grow and particularly on her bottom half. He had happily watched her booty grow over the past couple of years. He now wanted to help grow it bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not lost on Rosa that Bradley was really enjoying watching her eating and she made a big show of it. She closed her eyes and moaned softly as she ate bite after bite. Before long the second bean burritto was gone before being followed quickly with two cruncy tacos. \"Enjoying watching me eat?\" she asked him in a sweet and sexy tone as she took a couple sips of her soda. \"Oh I am. I find a girl with a healthy appetite very hot. Also there is something very sexual about the way you eat. I can tell that you really love to eat\" Bradley replied. \"Oh I do love to eat\" Rosa replied in that same sweet and sexy tone as she started on her third cruncy taco. Rosa continued to happily eat her food while Bradley continued to compliment her and secretly encourage her after he finished his food. They also got to know each other a little better. Before long Rosa had finished all of her food and sat back against the booth, moaning softly, breathing a little heavy, as she patted her stuffed body. \"Mm, that was so good. I am so stuffed\" she moaned softly. She found herself enjoying the stuffed feeling which was a painful but pleasant feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa finished her soda but was still feeling thirsty from all the cheese but didn't feel like getting up. She was feeling too stuffed and lazy. \"Bradley, could you refill my drink?\" she asked him cutely with a cute little pout. \"Of course Rosa, it would be my pleasure\" he said. He got up, grabbed Rosa's cup, refilled it completely, and returned to the table. \"Thank you\" she said sweetly with her best smile. Bradley finished his soda while Rosa drank some of her refill as they chatted a little more while Rosa digusted. After about 10 minutes, Bradley helped Rosa up, and they headed out to his car. They drove back to school and headed inside. Rosa was moving a little slow with all the food and soda in her stomach but she liked the heavy feeling it left her with. Her belly was pressing out again her shirt, even more then before and her jeans felt tighter around her hips and butt. When they got to her locker, Rosa gave Bradley a soft kiss on his cheek and said sweetly, \"Thank you for a delicious lunch Bradley. Give me a call sometime\" she said in a sweet and flirtious tone as she pulled a pen out of her purse, and wrote her number on his hand. She then grabbed her binder and book for her next class, closed her locker, gave Bradley a flirtious little wave, and sauntered off, though a bit slower this time, swaying her hips and ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh I definitely will. Count on it. You have only begun to grow he thought to himself as he enjoyed the beginning of lunch's effect on Rosa's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After drinking all of that soda and having a smaller bladder, it wasn't too far into 5th period that Rosa had to go pee. Luckily for her, her 5th period teacher was Mr. Lloyd, a young good looking math teacher who was said to like girls and was easier on them. Because of this, Rosa was able to easily get excused to use the bathroom. After getting excused, she got up from her desk, headed out of the classroom, and down the hall to the girls' bathroom. She walked inside and walked into one of the stalls. She did her business and then walked over to the sink to wash her hands when she heard a flush and noticed the stall on the far corner of the bathroom open, and saw Amber stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa hadn't noticed anyone else in the bathroom when she had walked in but then again she hadn't really been looking as she really had to go so she was a little surprised when she saw Amber come out. \"Hi Amber\" Rosa greeted Amber with a friendly smile as she began to wash her hands. While Amber hadn't defended her when Kimberly kicked her out, Amber hadn't supported Kimberly's decision to kick her off the squad either, and of all the girls on the squad, she had always been the nicest about about her weight so she didn't feel any ill will towards her. She just hoped that Amber would still be friendy to her and want to be her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rosa, I have been meaning to talk with you\" Amber said with a friendly smile in return as she walked over to the skin and also began to wash her hands. \"I wanted to apologize to you for Kimberly kicking you off the cheerleading squad. She is a total bitch and on a power trip. I totally felt bad about what happened and not standing up but I love cheering and I didn't want to risk losing my spot. Her kicking you off the squad is totally stupid as you were not the only one to gain over the summer. I gained some weight over the summer and probably more then you did\" she said. She didn't bother to add that she had lost most of the weight though she had sinced gained some back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa finished washing her hands and began to dry them off. \"Thanks Amber, that means alot to me. I totally understand you not wating to lose your spot on the squad and I certainly wouldn't ask you to risk it to speak out against Kimberly on my behalf. I appreciate the thought though. I will admit I was upset about it first but I am feeling better about it now. Since now I am not on the cheerleading squad I don't have to worry about my weight anymore so I can eat as much as I want without guilt so I am starting to take advantage of that. I also like having more time to relax and party. At first I thought it was the end of the world when it first happened but after talking with my mom I started to see the positives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was really impressed with the way you handled it when Kimberly kicked you off. I am not sure I would have been able to handle it as well as you were able to. I am glad to hear that you are concentrating on the postives of this instead of all the negatives. Not only will it make you happier but it's healthier for you\" Amber replied with a smile. \"By the way, even though you are not on the cheerleading squad anymore, we can still be friends and hang out\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Rosa agreed as she finished drying off her hands and tossing the paper towel into one of the trash cans. She smiled as she heard Amber say that they could still be friends and hang out even though she wasn't on the cheerleading squad. \"Totally and I would love to. Would you like to come over to my house today after school? We can hang out and work on some homework. I am sure my mom will be plenty of snacks for us to eat\" she said with a giggle. She knew that Amber, much like her loved to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds great. I will meet you in the quad after school\" Amber agreed after finishing washing her hands and drying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I will see you then\" Rosa agreed with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls headed out of the bathroom together, waved good bye, and headed off to their respectives. Feeling happy about the day's events, she stopped at the cafeteria on the way to her class which was out of the way to get herself a soda and a pack of chips before heading back to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since Amber got a ride to school with Kevin that morning, she rode with Rosa in her car back to Rosa's house. On the ride over, they talked about their day while Amber sent Kevin a text message that read: 'Going over to Rosa's house to hang out. Can U pick me up later? ' She smiled when Kevin texted her back a minute later. 'Sure, just call me when you are ready' he had texted back. <br>\r\n15 minutes later they arrived at Rosa's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After Rosa parked in the garage, both girls got out, grabbed their stuff, and headed inside where they were greeted immediately by Rosa's mom who was in the kitchen. \"Hello girls. Have a good day at school?\" she asked them with a smile. \"I did. I went out to lunch with this really cute guy that I like and we are going to go out this weekend\" Rosa replied in a happy excited tone. \"That's wonderful hun\" her mom replied. \"I also had a good day. Nothing new or special to report I am afraid\" Amber said. \"Well that's okay. I'm glad to see you Amber. It's been awhile since you last came over\" Rosa's mom replied as she gave Amber a hug. Amber hugged her back. She had always liked Rosa's mom who always really sweet to her and not to mention a good cook. \"Well you girls must be starving. I know Rosa likes to have a snack when she comes so I made a big plate of friend fries with ketchup on the side to dip into. I am also baking some blueberry muffins that I will bring up to you later\" Rosa's mom said as she handed the plate of fries over to Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom\" Rosa replied with a smile. \"Can you get us some drinks Amber? You know where they are\". Amber nodded and walked over to the fridge. She pulled out two cans of coke and followed Rosa upstairs to her room. It hadn't escaped Rosa's mom's notice that Amber had put on some weight and thought it looked fabulous on her. She didn't say anything as to not embarass her. Yes she knew from Rosa that all of the girls on the cheerleading squad had put on some weight but thought it better not to say anything to keep Amber from getting too self concious and dieting. She just hoped that Rosa would also put on some weight and that Amber would continue to expand as well. She thought they would both look more beautiful and feminine heavier. She was a feeder at heart and was going to do her part to help fatten them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom is so sweet' Amber said once they were back up in Rosa's room. They took a seat on Rosa's bed and began snacking on the fries. \"Mm, these fries are so good\" Amber said. \"Oh I know. These are actually packaged fries but they are so good\" Rosa after eating a couple before opening her coke and taking a sip. \"I have been enjoying getting to eat a whole buch of different delicous foods with Kevin but I still enjoy having fast food as well. I was actually in the mood for it so these fries are hitting the spot\" Amber said before eating some more fries after dunking them in the ketchup. \"Oh, I love fast food. I so know what you mean. Somtimes you just get bad cravings for it\" Rosa replied with a smile laugh. \"So how are things going with you and Kevin?\" she asked Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are going really well. I am so happy. He is a great great. Really smart, sweet, fun to be around, and he makes me laugh. He loves my new curvier and he encourages me to keep eating. I love it that I can eat without guilt around him\" Amber said. \"You look happy Amber. I am happy for you\" Rosa replied honestly with a smile. \"So tell me about Bradley. He is cute and very sweet but he always seem so shy\" Amber said. \"Oh I know, I always thought that too so I was surprised when he asked me out. He really is sweet though and we had fun hanging out at lunch. I ordered a big meal and he encouraged me to eat it all too\" Rosa said. \"Well it sounds like we both have found ourselves a couple of good guys who like to see us eat. We are very lucky\" Amber replied with a smile and a laugh.  \"I have to agree\" Rosa replied with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept snacking on the fries as they talked more about their boys before moving on to the school's latest gossip.  They also touched on the rivarly between Kimberly and Ashley.  Both girls ate their fair share of fries and before long the plate was good. Luckily Rosa's mom came in just at that moment with a big platter of delicious looking blueberry muffins. \"Looks like I came up here with these just in time\" Rosa's mom said with a laugh. \"You sure did mom. Even after all those fries I am still hungry\" Rosa replied with a smile. \"Well enjoy the muffins and Amber would you like to join us for dinner? We would love to have you\" Rosa's mother said. \"Sure, I would love to\" Amber agreed with a smile. \"Excellent\" Rosa's mom replied with a smile before picking up the empy plate and headed back downstairs.<br>\r\nThe girls decided to start on their homework while they started on the blueberry muffins. The muffins were so good and they were busy focusing on their homework that they didn't pay attention to how many muffins they were eating. They continued to nurse their cokes as they ate more of the muffins while doing their homework and chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long they had finished their home and their snack. \"Dinner is ready\" Rosa's mom called up to them a few minutes later. \"I guess we finished just in time\" Rosa replied with a smile laugh. \"Well then let's head downstairs. Even after that snack I am still hungry\" Amber admitted with an embarassed little laugh. \"Me too\" Rosa said before they headed downstairs into the kitchen. \"Come sit down girls. It's just us three\" she said as she gestured for Amber and Rosa to take a seat which they both do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa comes up over with two big plates of nachos sitting one down in front of Amber and the other in front of Rosa. She then goes back into the kitchen only to return with two plates of big bean and cheese burritos and again sets one down in front of Amber and one in front of Rosa. \"Please dig in and eat. What would you like to drink\" Rosa's mom asked. \"Coke please\" both girls said at once and laughed. Rosa's mother brought them each a coke before getting her burrito and joing them at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. These nachos are incredible! Are they homemade? The burrito is delicious as well\" Amber replied. \"The nachos are homemade and I am so glad you like it all\" Rosa's mom replied with a smile. \"This is really delicious mom. thank you\" Rosa seconded. The nachos and burritos were so good that both girls couldn't stop eating them, stuffing bite after bite into their mouth, only stopping to lick cheese off their face and drink sips of their coke when they got thirsty. Rosa's mom watched in delight as both her daughter and her friend indulge hoping that they ate every last bite. \"Ooh, this is so good but I am not sure I can eat another bite\" Rosa moaned after finishing her nachos and just having a little of her burrito left. \"Me too but it's so good that I can't stop. I have to have the last of my burritto\" Amber moaned before finishing off her burritto and washing it down with her soda. She had already finished off her nachos. Not wanting to be outdone by her friend in front of her mom who was always wanting her to eat more, Rosa picked up the rest of her burrito and finshed it off. \"Mm, that was so good. I am stuffed\" Rosa moaned as she leaned back in her chair, patting her stuffed belly and taking a couple sips of her coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no but I made your favorite, chocolate chip cookies. You have to have them\" Rosa's mom said quickly with a hurt look. A mix of hating to see that look and her love of chocolate chip cookies, Rosa sighed and said, \"Okay I will have a couple of cookies but Amber you have to have a few too\" she said. Rosa's mom smiled to herself, she always knew how to get her daughter to eat more. \"Of course I will have a couple of your mom's delicious chocolate chip cookies. How could I say no?\" Amber replied with a giggle. The girls finished off their sodas as Rosa's mom got the cookies out of the oven and placed them on the table for the girls. \"Let me get you so milk\" she said before pouring them each a glass and setting one down in front of both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cookies looked and smelled so delicious that despite how stuffed they were, they couldn't resist and eagerly reached for a cookie. The cookies were so good that the couldn't stop eating them and they were further distracted by their gabbing about their boys. They eventually finished the whole plate of cookies along with a couple glasses of milk. Rosa's mom watched this all approvingly and made a mental note to herself to have Rosa invite Amber over for dinner more often. Just like her daughter, Amber had a good appetite and she seemed to be able to get her daughter to eat more since she was eating more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rosa wake the next morning to the sound of her alarm going off. She groaned, reached over, and shut it off. She was having such a good sleep. She started to fall back asleep but was woken up by hearing her mom telling her to get up and that she was making breakfast. She could smell her mom's cooking and it smelled delicious like always.  She sighed as she pulled the covers off of her, stood up, and stretched. She made her way into her bathroom that was next to her room and closed the door behind her. She turned on the shower, took off her clothes, used the toilet, and then stepped into the shower. She took a nice warm shower and then dryed herself off. When she finished drying herself off, she hung up her towel, and then noticed her scale. She knew she had put on some weight recently but didn't know how much. Wanting to see, She took a deep breathe, walked over to the scale, and stepped onto it. She watched as the scale went up to 148 pounds. Oh my god, I have gained 19 pounds she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out of her bathroom and back into her bedroom. She walked over to her vanity mirror and began to look for any changes. She had a small round chubby now with a beginning love handles. Her face and breasts remained the same. Her thighs were thicker and getting closer to rubbing against each other slightly. Her hips were a little wider as well. She turned around to see that her butt has also gotten bigger. It was softer, rounder, and stuck out more. As she continued to glance at her reflection, she had to admit that the extra weight looked good on her. Even though sometimes her big ass embarassed her, she was proud of it and liked seeing that it had gotten bigger. She was off the cheerleading squad now so she didn't have to worry about her weight and plus most of the girls on the squad were gaining weight as well so why shoud she freak out that she had gained? She shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, she wiggled into a pair of her jeans which was somewhat of a struggle due to her gain but she was able to get them on. She then put on a white t-shirt, sat down at her vanity, fixed her hair, and did her makeup. She came downstairs and smiled as she saw her mom bringing breakfast over to the table. \"Mm, smells delicous mom\" she said. \"It is, sit down and eat hun\" her mom instructed. She smiled to herself as she noticed that Rosa's jeans were tighter on her and her belly was sticking out through the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa sat down and looked over her breakfast. There was a big stack of delicious chocolate chip panckes with butter and maple syrup along with a plate of eggs and bacon. It all looked so good and depsite all she ate last night, she was really hungry this morning. She happily dug in and ate it all much to her mom's delight. During her meal, her mom brought over a glass of milk and oj both of which she dranked. \"Mm, that was delicious\" Rosa said with a girly burp when she finished her meal. She then headed back upstairs where she brushed her teeth, and grabbed her things for school. When she got downstairs, her mom was waiting with two poptarts wrapped to go. \"To snack on on the way to school: her mom said. \"Thanks mom\" she said as she took the poptarts as she headed out to her car. She still had some room for two poptarts. She got into her car, turned on the engine, backed out, and headed for school. She began to eat the poptarts as soon as she got on the road and finished them before she even go to school.</span></div></div>",

She was sure if it wasn't a class she liked and that her now boyfriend Bradley was in it, she would never make it. The class was History which was one of her favorites and she was quite good at it. Being good at gossip and knowing information really paid off in history classes when you needed to remember dates and causes and effects. After a quick stop at her locker to grab her history book and binder, she made her way to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked into class, she saw that Bradley was there and he was gesturing for her to take the seat next to her. \"Hey beautiful, come sit down next to me\" he called to her with a smile. She was so glad that Mrs. Nelson didn't give them assign seats and they could each change seats each class or just sit it the same one. She walked over to the seat, taking a seat, crossing her legs, and setting her book and binder down on the desk, she leaned over and gave Bradley a kiss on his cheek. \"Good morning handsome\" she replied sweetly. She was a little surprise by her boldness with the kiss but Bradley seemed to really like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBradley returned the kiss on her cheek and smiled over at her. \"Good morning beautiful. How are you? Good morning so far?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was nice other than having to get up early. I took a nice warm shower, a big delicous breakfast, and now I am getting to see you so pretty good\" Rosa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you had a breakfast and a big one at that. I hate it when I hear girls say that skip breakfasts. They are crazy, I mean breakfast is the most important meal of the day\" Bradley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know, totally! It's crazy\" Rosa agreed with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have some news that I think you might find interesting and not to mention like\" Bradley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Do tell\" Rosa said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am sure that you are not too found of Kimberly after she kicked you off the squad but would you be surprised that Ashley is not too fond of her either?\" Bradley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa shook her head and replied, \"Not really. I mean Ashley was the captain before Kimberly came and took it from her. We never really understood why. I mean Ashley was the captain last year and there was no reason why she couldn't maintain that title this year. She was really upset about losing the position to Kimberly. They view each other as threats and havne't gottena long\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ashley found out that Kimberly has been getting guys to do her homework instead of doing it herself. Ashley found proof of this and showed it to the principal. The principal took Kimberly off the squad until she started doing her own work and bringing her grades up and put Ashley back in charge\" Bradley said with a smile, figuring that Rosa would be happy at this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I want to say I am surprised but for some reason I am not. It seems just like Kimberly to do that. I know it's not good to want revenge but I did and this news was exactly that. It was swee revenge\" she said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not all. I am friends with Ashley's boyfriend and the three of us were hanging out before class talking about what happened with Kimberly and she said that she was going to look for you today to talk with you. She wants to reinstate you\" Bradley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, wow!\" Rosa happily exclaimed. This truly had been good news. She had been enjoying her break but she did miss cheerleading. \"This is great. I will try to talk to her today about that so I can get back on the squad\" she said. She paused a bit before continuing. \"I have gained a little more weight since Kimberly kicked me off the squad, I hope it won't get me kicked off the squad\" she said. She knew that Ashley was more fairer then Kimberly and hadn't given her any trouble about her weight, but also she hadn't been this heavy before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry too much about that. Ashley has put on some weight herself as well as Amber\" Bradley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa had noticed that but she doubted either would were bigger then her. Even if they weren't if they had gained weight, maybe her gain wouldn't be such a big deal and wouldn't cause Ashley to kick her off the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher then came in and class started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know you are <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The next day at lunch, they meet in the quad and agree to go to McDonalds for lunch and to go over in Ashley's car.  After driving over to McDonalds and getting their food and utensils and napkins, they walk over to an empty booth, Ashley sitting on one side while Rosa sits on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa had ordered the double quarter pounder with cheese with supersize fires and soda. Ashley got to the dobule cheese burger with supersize fries and coke. Both girls were really hungry and eagerly dug into their food. After eating for a bit, Ashley spoke. \"Rosa, first I want to say that I apologize for Kimberly kicking you off like she did and that myself nor any of the others stood up for you\" Ashley said in between bites of one of her cheeseburgers before taking a sip of her soda. \"I have to admit I was upset at first but I later realized that you and the others didn't want to risk getting kicked off the squad either\" Rosa said before stuffing a mouthful of fries into her mouth and eating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, we are a team, we support each other, and stick together. I preached that last year and then I forgot to practice what I preach so again I am sorry\" Ashley said honestly. \"Anyway, Kimberly was so out of line to kick you off the squad like she did. It was not a good enough reason and she wasn't the only one to have gained weight. As you know though, I found out that she was getting nerds to do her homework, I got proof of this, showed it to the principal, and she is off the squad until she gets her grades up and that could be awhile. I am back to being cheer captain and I would like to offer to reinstate you as a cheerleader\" Ashley said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I accept. I would love to be a cheerleader again\" Rosa said excitedly before eating some more of her burger. \"Thank you for bringing me back. I was enjoying my break but I missed being a cheerleader\" she continued. \"I know you are not supposed to want to revenge but it felt so sweet to get it in the form of you proving she was not doing her homework to the principal\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was glad I could help. It's no secret that I didn't like her to begin with and when she kicked you off I liked her less. It was really a win win for me, I got to kick her off the squad and bring you back\" Ashley said as she finished her first cheese burger and started on her second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa was really hungry and had just finished off her quarter punder with cheese when she thought of something. \"When Kimberly kicked me off the squad, she demend me to be too fat to be on the cheer squad. I have to admit that I have gained some more weight since then. I hope that I am not now too fat to cheer\" she said with a blush and embarassed little laugh before shoving another mouthful of fries into her mouch and eating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosa, you are not too fat to be a cheerleader at all. Surely you have noticed that both myself and Amber have put some weight on recently. We think it looks good on us, making us look sexier, curvier, more feminine, and our boyfriends agree. The extra weight looks good on you. Besides our school mascot is the boar, we are allowed to be curvier then most cheerleaders. I told the girls on the squad that I won't give them a hard time about their weight if they don't give me a hard time on me and they all agreed. So to sum up, you are fine for cheer and will be even if you gain some more weight so don't worry\" Ashley said with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and Rosa finished off their meals while contining to talk about cheerleading, upcoming competitions, Kimberly, and the latest gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa still had some room for dessert so she ordered an apple pie with a medium chocolate milkshake. Ashley having a big sweet tooth herself, ordered a apple and a small chocolate milkshake. They happily eat their desserts on the drive back to school while conting to catch up on the latest gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day flew by in a blissful blur for Rosa. After lunch with Ashly, Rosa attended the rest of her classes with a there but not there feeling, as she was so elated from being reinstated stated to the team. And not only was she reinstated, but the whole team did not care about her additional weight, even gaining some themselves. Feeling like celebrating, Rosa treated herself to a giant cookie from the cafeteria, while fully aware that she had just had a big burger and large sides, plus two deserts. After all, Ashley said that she wasn't too fat to be a cheerleader!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady for the day to end, Rosa walked into her last and least favorite class, French. She never quite understood the language. Lucky for Rosa, she shared that class with Amber. As the happy girl sauntered into the room, Amber couldn't help but notice that Rosa's gut stuck out even more than the night before, and her jeans were ready to burst at the seems. Rosa sat down in a desk next to Amber, her ass easily filling out the seat and said with a sad undertone, \"Hey girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was confused. Rosa had walked in like she won a million bucks, but now she sounded depressed. Amber carefully replied, \"What's up Rosa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa looked over at Amber with a sad face, but with a gleam in her eyes and said nonchalantly, \"Oh, nothing. Ashly just reinstated me to the cheer squad,\" and was no longer able to keep a straight face, and smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber took a second to process the huge news that Rosa had just given her and exclaimed, \"NO WAY!!!\" so loud that everyone in the class looked at her. She put on a sheepish face that said 'sorry', then continued with what she was saying. \"That is so cool, Rosa! Now you can be part of the squad again, plus you'll get to see the everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, I know! I'm just a little worried that I gained a lot of weight since Kim bounced me. Ashley said it was fine but I'm not sure. Plus I haven't been exercising at all. I'll probably just be a weak point on the base, and theirs no way I'm gonna be a flyer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Don't worry about it, your not the only one who gained weight,\" Amber jiggled her growing potbelly for emphasis. \"Even Trixie is starting to pack some on, and Kim's intern, her name is Linda by the way, was stocky to begin with. Not to mention she has grown under our influence, haha. And don't worry if you think you're weak; its nothing a week or two of conditioning can't fix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, even Trixie,\" echoed Rosa. \"I just can't imagine that stick of a fresh man gaining. I just hope we'll have a flyer next year, right? We may have to use a freshman or someone from the JV team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, and we all have boys too, except Linda, and they all want us to gain! What could be better?\" reassured Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Know rig--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Rosaline, perhaps you and Ms. Amber would like to pay attention in class,\" said Mrs. Algren in flawless French. Rosaline only heard her name, the rest beyond her, and replied, \"Bon jour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amber, wanna come over to my place to celebrate my reinstatement?\" Inquired Rosa, right before the bell for the end of the school day was about to end. \"I'm sure I can get my mom to whip something up for us to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was up the air about the idea because Kevin had given her a ride to school again, up until the point when Rosa mentioned her mom's cooking. Then she had to go. The cooking of Rosa's mom was that to die for. Amber said, \"Definitely! Let me just call Kevin real quick, and tell him to pick me up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery thing got cleared away and twenty minutes later, Rosa arrived at her house with Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, I brought Amber home with me again! Could you make us something to eat? We're not really feeling too specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, honey, no need to yell. Hello Amber!\" Said Rosa's mom, walking out of the near-by kitchen with her trademark apron around her chunky waist. \"To answer your question, Rose,\" She said in a tone that said, 'I have godly timing', \"I just got done making quesadillas. Did you girls have a nice day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I have an awesome day?\" echoed Rosa in a sarcastic tone, \"I only got reinstated to the cheer squad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's great honey! We better have a celebration dinner tonight!\" chimed Rosa's mom. \"While I make it, you girls can go have those quesadillas as a snack. I may have some brownies done before dinner also; I'll let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks!\" said both the girls at the same time. They then turned to each other and laughed, before heading up stairs to Rosa's room and starting on their snack.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was so good that they quickly finished their first one and moved on to a second one. As they ate, they talked more about cheerleading like what was going to happen with their routines now that they had all gained weight, if and when Kimberly was allowed back on the squad, how they liked their gains, and the latest gossip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really love where my gain has gone. I love having a big ass, thigh thighs, and wide hips. They are all traits of being a latina and I am proud to be a latina and of it's traits\" Rosa said as she finished her second quesadilla and reached for a third. \"I have always been jealous of your ass as I see all the guys checking it out but I love the pot belly that I have devloped recently\" Amber said as she proudly patted her belly. Rosa blushed at Amber mentioning all the guys checking out her ass. She of course knew it was true and loved the attention. \"Well thank you and your potbelly is beauitufl too\" Rosa replied. \"Thanks' Amber smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa's mom comes up with two big glasses of milk and a tray of brownies. \"I figured you girls would need some more snacks. You are still growing\" she said with a smile. She set the snack down in front of them before heading back downstairs to make dinner. The girls shared a smile and then giggled before finishing off the rest of the quesadillas. They each took a couple more sips of milk before digging into the brownies. \"Mm, so good\" Amber moaned softly before quickly finishing off her first brownie. She licked the chocolate off her fingers and washed it down with a sip of her milk. \"Oh I know\" Rosa giggled after finishing her own and washing it down with a few sips of her own milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly Rosa, I am really amazed that you have stayed as slim as you have for so long. Your mom is such a great cook. She makes such delicious fattening meals and brings you such delicious fattening treats that I don't know how you do it. I know if I started to live with your mom I would turn into a total fat ass\" Amber replied with a slight blush and an embarassed little laugh. While the thought of that was a little embarassing, it also seemed kinda nice to her as well. \"You better not tell her that. If she heard her that, she would make sure to feed you lots and turn you into a fat ass. She would love that. Trust me, I know she is doing that to me\" Rosa replied with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and Rosa continued to talk as they ate the rest of their brownies and then washed them down with the rest of their milks.</span></div></div>",

The other day, one of her best customers asked her to paint her a series of pictures of a lady stuffing herself and bloating. Isabella was a real artist. She could only paint something she had a model of. She had already resigned herself to start stuffing herself and painting herself in front of a mirror, but Rosa was perfect. You see, Isabella was a little... unique. She was lesbian, and she was into her sister. As her sister stuffed herself, she realized she was into fat girls, too. Rosa asked constantly to stop, but Isabella told her the painting wasn't done yet. In truth, Isabella had done 6 paintings, and needed jut 4 more for the collection the guy ordered. Rosa finished pizza 7... 8... 9... and then was done. She sat there, rubbing her stomach, bloated beyond belief. Isabella had made up a whole bunch of BS about how she stayed trim with mother's cooking. Isabella finished the 10th photo, which was about Rosa after the stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Isabella sent the pictures. Suddenly, the man who had asked her for them had a few more requests for stuffings, in order:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Rosa:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the girl eating 19 boxes of cookies and a post-stuffing painting.<br>\r\nThen, a 15 gallon ice cream bloat and a post-stuffing painting.<br>\r\nNext, A cake stuffing of 5 pizzas and a post-stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the next day, Isabella received another email for a different girl to do the following (each with post-stuffing paintings):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrownie bloat (7 pans)<br>\r\nSoda bloat (13 liters)<br>\r\nFried chicken bloat (5 KFC family buckets.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, whoever he was, payed well. Each picture was worth $500 dollars to him, plus the materials cost. Isabella tried to find a suitable girl for the other stuffings, but finding none, prepared herself to do it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWARNING: ISABELLA AND ROSA GAIN FROM THIS POINT ON</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rosa resigned herself. She simply could never say no to her sister, ever since the two of them were young. Of course, this had led to plenty of weird incident, but those somehow made the two of them closer. And further prevented Rosa from saying 'no' to her sister. Besides, she was paying her; and she needed money as her car had broken down a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, she sat down in front of the couch, only for Isabella to start painting her. She started with the cookies; their mother had baked them. And she knew how to bake cookies. Rosa was eating with restraint, delicatelly picking each cookie. But as the evening went by, she started to throw it to the wind; she was lost in the taste of the cookie, and the oddity of the moment. It's true that at moment, she had forgotten why she had been kicked out of the team. Why was she worried about gaining weight. That she was worried about gaining weight. The food was simply too good to pass, her sister had too strong a grip on her. And so, she started not to notice what she was doing to herself. Finally, after a few hours, Rosa was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella was, of course, vaguely aware of what was going on in her sister's head. She watched, as Rosa kept shoving more and more cookies in her mouth, each faster than the last. Isabella was breathing quickly; worried that she might get caught. Rosa had stopped pleading with her, as if she had given up. It's true that Isabella could tell that her weight loss effort would be lost. Her own effort too, as she was also going to stuff herself the next day. Finally, Rosa was done, with a loud moan. Isabella had never felt this way. She help her sister to her bed; the soft touch of her plump body was beyond words. All the way upstairs, to her room, Rosa kept moaning. She was in pain, Isabella could tell. But she was sure that, despite her belly being stretched to its limits. As Rosa laid down her bed, too exhausted to get changed, Isabella helped her to change into her pjs. Halfway through though, she stopped, leaving Rosa into her underwears. Rosa was confused about this, but she didn't really care about what was happening right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabella... my belly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Rosa... I know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said those words, she laid next to her sister, and started to rub her belly. Rosa was surprised, and in her normal state, she would have complained. But she had stuffed her brains out already. And the belly rub felt extraordinaly good to her. She just closed her eyes until she could feel better. And so, she didn't notice that Isabella was getting undressed to her underwear at the same time. Rosa was still unaware of what was happening, and honestly, she didn't care. There was a warm feeling in her belly, and the rub made her more comfortable and at home than she had ever felt. After a while though, her belly felt much better. Isabella kept rubbing though for a few minutes. Rosa also felt good even though her belly wasn't in pain anymore. Isabella realized that Rosa was not in any position to say no to anything (well, perhaps, not anything), and she figured she could take advantage of that. So, after much hesitation, Isabella decided to make her next move. She shifted her body, and put herself on top. Now, you had two women, both in their underwear, one on the other. Rosa was so surprised that she actually opened her eyes. But Isabella's mysterious and calming smile soothed her immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, sister. Just enjoy the moment. Let the warmth carry you, not your thoughts\" Strange as it seemed it is exactly what she did. She wasn't thinking, just enjoying the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters stayed like this, each enjoying the moment, Rosa in a mindless, comfortable and peaceful way, and Isabella in her devious ways. It was Isabella that moved first, when she heard her parents coming home downstairs. She moved quickly, putting her own pjs, and Rosa's, before getting back into her bed. Rosa was surprised at this, but she felt so exhausted that she didn't budge; she barely helped her sister put her own jammies on. Isabella rushed back into bed before her parents could see her, and cuddled to Rosa. She responded by putting her arm on Isabella; the soft embrace of Rosa was more than she could bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that cute? Our two girls, still cuddling together, just like when they little girls\" Said Rosaline's and Isabella's mom to their dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear, yes it is\" He considered taking a picture, but changed his mind for feat that it would wake them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two sisters slept together, peacefully. The next morning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That next day, after classes, Rosa returned to her home. The day had been pretty ordinary; though she had sorry looks from her (former) squad, they didn't bother to adress her to tell her how they felt. But their faces did look fuller to Rosa, which made her angry, at the hypocrisy of the team and the injustice of it all. She wanted nothing to do ever again with the cheerleading squad. Ever. But she still felt conscious about her weight; she felt that last night's binges had a toll on her. She was surprised though that she didn't really care about cheerleading and the politics behind it, as she gossiped with a few fellow classmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real shock was for that night. After she was done with her homework, she heard Isabella arriving. As Isabella and Rosa prepared for Isabella's stuffing for the night, their parents got into the living room, and sat down with the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in for the shock of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're... we're... we're adopted?\" Isabella could only stutter. Rosa remained silent, completely lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, we should have told you years ago. We adopted both of you, because I couldn't have any children\" Rosa's mother said, about to burst into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but... so we are not really sisters\" Rosa stammered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By blood no. But you'll always share the ties that has been biding you all those years. Always\" The father said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll let you digest it. But please know that, no matter what, we will always love you\" Their mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa's world was completely rocked by this. So many questions. But amongst the whirlwind of thoughts that was besetting her, she was thinking about Isabella. She was a stranger now. No, that was unfair to think that. The same held true towards her parents. She had grown up with them. Her father's word came back to her. He was right. But still. There were many questions that she wanted answered, and as fast as possible. But she was much more introsepct, now, at lost about herself and her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Isabella, things were completely different. Though she feigned surprise, she was actually well aware of this; she overheard her parents mention it to one of their uncle one night, but never dared confront them, when she was still pretty young. She went through the same things that Rosa was about to go through; but it shaped her in a decisive way. It's what made her the artist that she became; at first the paintings were imagining her 'real' family, and focused on her mother. Then, her 'real' self. It shaped her vision as an artist. But the one thing she never knew before was about Rosa. She thought that Rosa was her biological sister, as well. Which is why she was so confused and troubled when she first experienced desire for her sister when she became a teen. It took her a while to learn to  accept that increasing desire, and live with it. Though she'd never act on it. Until Rosa started to gain weight; then it was more than she could bare, and so she started her movements, knowing that it was headed for disaster. But now that Rosa knew, no that there was no more blood relations between them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa left to her room; so did Isabella; they both left quite pensive. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unlike some of her teammates Trixie never wanted diva power, dominating and controlling others. She just wanted recognition. A latchkey kid living with a weight conscious aunt absorbed with a civil service career, recognition in her mind equated to keeping a tight belly with constant workouts and eating as little as possible.  This and a big bust, she thought, was the best way to get guys.  And getting guys was the real reason she was on the cheerleading squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly it hadn\u2019t worked out that way.  She\u2019d seen Kimberly bounce Ashley as Captain, only to have Ashley acquire a boyfriend and about twenty pounds as she uncovered Kimberly's deception and bounced back on top.  Amber had gained even more and had a nice guy too. And the deposed Kimberly was gaining so much that rumor had it she wasn\u2019t even coming back, but she still had a boyfriend as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie had no one, and rather than exercising so obsessively she secretly wished she could eat like her more porky teammates. . But instead of eating burritos or lasagna for lunch she stuck to her salads and squelched her envy. After all, no one was keeping her from having a cheeseburger if she wanted to. She was just better than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was she?  Could she give herself permission to go against her aut\u2019s injunctions and have some ice cream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne afternoon in early November she caved in and bought a pint of Ben and Jerry\u2019s, devouring it in the park before discarding the evidence in a public waste basket.  It had been divine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what its like,\u201d she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day she skipped over the salads and bought a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches.  Again she enjoyed the flavors.  Nervously that afternoon she explored her belly, then got on a scale to explore the damage.  She couldn\u2019t find any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d she thought\u201d Ie been depriving myself for nothing. My metabolism apparently can handle this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weekend at a Saturday night party she allowed herself to have here pieces of pizza for the first time in her life, and it felt good.  The next day she had a grande burrito and taco bell. Feeling guilty, she again checked the scale. Still no damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so as Thanksgiving approached Trixie relaxed her guard, trusting her metabolism to let her eat like she wished. It took nearly two months and the Xmas holidays before she really began to notice the slow changes in her body. A pair of her jeans seemed tighter and there was a softness in her midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, am I developing a pot belly?\u201d she asked herself, resolving to exercise and cut back.  But of course it didn\u2019t happen.  She knew her aunt wasn\u2019t really watching, the Cheerleading squad didn\u2019t care, and she was getting now attention from guys that she hadn\u2019t had before.  Had she been more discerning she would have been able to see that it wasn\u2019t her relaxed attitude towards food that was actually drawing the guys. What she had was a more happy disposition. But such nuances of understanding weren\u2019t in her mental computer and her lifestyle change continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cheerleading session ended so did Trixie\u2019s workouts.  This left more time for socializing and eating and by March a doughiness was developing around her midriff but she didn\u2019t care. She knew she\u2019d gained. Her pink and green tube tops were tight in the tummy and by April were requiring her to wear an overblouse to hide budding love handles. She\u2019d also had to stop wearing both of her pencil skirts and her panties and bra were leaving red marks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn class she was aware that her tummy was ballooning over her waistband and she needed to be sure to keep it covered. By May she was enjoying snacks with her homework and buttery muffins for breakfast in he morning. Other things were starting her day as well. Everything told her that indulging in starchy breakfasts of waffles with strawberries and whipped cream along with snacks for six months had added some weight.  She was finding the tightness of her clothes secretly exciting \u2013 and was amazed that her aunt wasn\u2019t even noticing. When she looked in the mirror she saw not a fat girl but one who actually had a shape. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her grades were up, she had a social life, and despite whatever weight she may of gained thought she was likely the lightest member of the most porcine cheerleading squad in town. She didn\u2019t eat as heavily as they did during the week, but Saturday night parties were another thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie on a good evening had become a carbo queen. 4-5 pieces of pizza, a bag of chips, 5-6 chocolate chip cookies \u2013 any of these or a combination was normal for a Saturday night, and usually led to indulging on Sunday as well. Her tighter outfits now showed a pronounced belly bulge and her hips were broader, but the fact was that she\u2019d stepped up two cup sizes and liked the attention. Of course she\u2019d also gone from size 4 to 8 and on some occasions was resorting to sweats.  This she didn\u2019t mind and for some reason her aunt didn\u2019t say a thing, if she was even noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the mirror Trixie could be honest with herself. She had an undeniable  tummy bulge, her thighs came together and two rolls of fat were developing on her sides above her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should be exercising more\u201d she thought as she dressed on Saturday night, but then promptly forgot the idea. Instead she went to another party where she indulged in brownies, pizza, chicken wings and ice cream with soda. Over the course of the evening she had four plates of food, each with  at least 800 calories.  Naturally her jeans were supertight, so she pulled out her shirt tail and quietly unbuttoned them, allowing them to slide below her belly while her belt prevented her pants from falling off.  No one seemed to notice, but it served as a an additional reminder to her of how chubby he was actually getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m getting fat,\u201d she admitted the next morning as she was sitting on her bed with her still swollen belly resting next to her thighs. \u201cI can\u2019t even wear my old pants and last night my newer ones had to be unbuttoned I was so stuffed. So why am I more hungry than upset?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of the reason was her main beau Don, who liked to make out and rub her belly, which she found arousing. He\u2019d buy her food whenever she wanted, even though she tried not to do it. But he told her that she had a \u201cpassion\u201d for food in her eyes when she was snacking and that he liked it.  And she knew he was right. She enjoyed his treats and attention and knew dieting would mean giving them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen news came that Kimberly wasn\u2019t returning to the squad.  Fat Kimberly now. The one with the letterman boyfriend Brian. The one now bigger than Ashley, Amber or Ros, all of who had guys too, Could it be that she really didn\u2019t need to be feeling so guilty?  That some guys didn\u2019t mind meaty girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to corner Kimberly, the same Kimberly who used to harangue others for gaining weight and was now a chubster herself,  and find out what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Kimberly was willing to talk \u2013 but after school at a diner over a snack with her boyfriend present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret, Brian will pay,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie slid easily into the booth.  So did Kim, but it was obvious that she must be pushing 160. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear you can come back to cheer but won\u2019t be.  I thought it was your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore.  Until my dad retired from the navy we moved every few years and I wasn\u2019t grounded. Cheer was an easy way to get attention when we came here I thought, since I\u2019d lost some weight and was pretty good at routines. I tried to find happiness that way but it didn\u2019t work.  Then I overreached and got into trouble and had to take counseling. That and Brian changed my viewpoint.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd like me got an appetite,\u201d Trixie observed to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe honest \u2013 do you mind the pounds or are you hearing scripts in your head telling you you\u2019re being naughty,\u201d asked Kimberly as she demolished her stack of fries and sucked on her shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it \u2013 I\u2019m afraid of what my aunt and others will say but I\u2019m tired of doing two hours a day of exercise and running just so I can be everyone\u2019s ideal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot everyone\u2019s\u201d noted Brian. \u201cAren\u2019t you Ron\u2019s girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd doesn\u2019t he give you food whenever you want it? Even though he doesn\u2019t push it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care what I weigh, that\u2019s true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you really asked him,\u201d said Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo guy in his right mind will come right out and tell a girl what she should weigh,  but if you asked him whether he\u2019d prefer you 110 or 210 you might be surprised if you could get a straight answer out of him,: Brian said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrian is trying to say that there are men who like girls heavier \u2013 and this school is full of them,\u201d continued Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncluding Don?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll need to ask him, but I believe so. When you\u2019re really into chowing down does he pause and just watch you with a smile, Maybe offer you part of his food when you\u2019re finished?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, yeah, now that you mention it. And he never tells me I need to cool it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd does he offer you snacks and treats and sometimes leave food at your place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes \u2013 ok I guess you know something. So what do I do with my aunt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Brian, \u201cyou can wait until she speaks up and defend yourself, or you can be proactive and tell her you are happy.  She should at least respect your wishes even if she feels otherwise,.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, you\u2019re right \u2013 but I don\u2019t know if it will go that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * *<br>\r\nTrixie didn\u2019t immediately confront her aunt, but she did test herself by eating more heavily at lunch wit her fellow cheerleaders. She found that like her weekend eating that she was comfortable with it. She also realized that it would make her larger if she kept it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week later Trixie, who frequently did the cooking anyway, prepared a nice beef stroganoff meal for her aunt, who immediately suspected something was up. But she let Trixie set the pace. After it was over, Trixie got serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuntie, I want to first tell yoi that I appreciate everything you\u2019ve done for me, \u2018cause I know you think I\u2019ve been a fairly decent niece since mom died and even been a help to you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes child, is something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly that as I point towards graduation next year and becoming an adult I have to make decisions based on what\u2019s right for me and not necessarily what everyone else expects. I guess its called finding yourself and being what\u2019s best for you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer aunt became disturbed \u201cYou\u2019re not planning on skipping college and joining the military I hope?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, nothing that extreme. I\u2019m not even going to move out and live with a guy like some people. And you know I don\u2019t smoke, drink or do drugs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou already have your driver\u2019s license and you know the rules about getting a car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I have to have a job and pay for the insurance \u2013 pretty standard and not the issue. I\u2019m a little scared to say it, but I need to get tis out because you need to know,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the issue is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a cheerleading squad of fatties who really don\u2019t care about their size and if things work out I\u2019ll be proud to be their captain next year no matter what my weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Aunt sat dumbfounded. The announcement, while surprising, was hardly of the magnitude she\u2019d feared. \u201cWell, I knew you\u2019d gained some but didn\u2019t expect you to be so defensive and almost proud about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonest, Auntie, I ran my legs off and did workouts until I was blue in the face while starving myself and was miserable and virtually dateless. Since I\u2019ve relaxed a bit and let myself gain as few pounds things for me are just happier and better. And I\u2019m hardly a cow \u2013 Marilyn Monroe was bigger than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarling, you are who you are in your generation. In mine girls who weren\u2019t size 8 or less were just not part of the in crowd. But if young people today don\u2019t care and you\u2019re happy, who am I to fight it?  Just try to stay heakthy- OK\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was as shocked as her Aunt was relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if I have to get some size 12 clothes with my next social security check its OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Aunt smiled \u201cIts your money, you know that. You\u2019ve been buying most of your own clothes for three years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, good. Well, for dessert we have German chocolate layer cake and I plan on having two pieces. This may be the beginning of a trend.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Ashley again took over the team Trixie slowly started become a closet eater.  Whenever she knew her aunt wasn\u2019t watching she used her Social Security funds increasing to underwrite eating whatever she felt like.  She was confident that she exercised enough that she really wasn\u2019t likely to gain much \u2013 certainly not compared to the rest of the team she was using as her standard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I have a little padding and bigger boobs I can have a cool boyfriend too,\u201d was her reasoning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly established a routine based on her aunts obsessive checking up on her. If her aunt called her on her cell and told her that she was getting home late she knew she was safe. She could bake fresh cookies in the afternoon, then devour them with cold milk before preparing supper. She just had to be sure to air out the house and dispose of the trash. If not cookies, then some bakery treat, like some donuts, fritters or \u00e9clairs.  The game was to make sure her aunt wasn\u2019t aware of what she was having, thereby avoiding the criticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at school she gradually was changing over to eating like her peers and snacking as well \u2013 a little here and there to begin with, a daily candy bar, which became two. Slowly a slight muffin to began to bulge out into an obvious tire of soft flesh over her tight pants. She resorted to wearing her shirt tails out and discreetly unfastening the top snap when seated..  For cheerleading she took over Amber\u2019s old outfit and it was very loose, but as her breasts stepped up a cup size and her ribs began to disappear under a soft layer of flesh she knew she\u2019d added some weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was convinced she was looking hotter by the day. In class she would at times fondle her soft muffin top, thinking about what she\u2019d be eating later in the day. At home she would . She would stripped and stand in front of the mirror amazed at what she was seeing. Her body was so round yet not really fat, but far bigger than it once had been.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the after xmas sales came she pulled $400 out of her SWS savings accunt and bought a whole new wardrobe on a loose size ten. That exercise confirmed to her Aunt what she been suspecting \u2013 Trixie had outgrown her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is all this,\u201d she demanded of her neice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA new wardrobe \u2013 and yes it\u2019s a size or two larger Auntie, have these things called breasts and a butt now and my clothes don\u2019t fit,\u201d Trixie announced,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour belly has been growing as well by the looks of things. What have you been eating, child&gt;?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather you not call me child, bit obviously I\u2019m eating enough not to be a skeleton. I have a boy friend now as well, as you my have noticed.,\u201d she said to preept one of her aunts favorite predictions about guys not liking thick chicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer aunt stood stupefied, the turned and left the room after saying \u201cNo, you\u2019re not a child anymore and can do what you want. But you\u2019ll learn in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie knew what she meant- guys would use a bigger girl until something better crossed their path. But she wondered how her Aunt could be so sure of that \u2013 she\u2019d always been thin and was cast aside anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her Aunt hadn\u2019t asked for details Trixie hadn\u2019t lied having a boyfriend.  Amber\u2019s boyfriend Randy had a friend, Don Mathieson, who he\u2019d arranged to take her to the fall dance. Since then they\u2019d had a few double dates and ate lunch at school with some regularity. They weren\u2019t committed to going steady, but had become friends. He was intelligent enough to be a companion and a good conversationalist in a mixed group. It was more social activity than she\u2019d had all year up to that point, and it was obvious from the way he bought her food that her weight wasn\u2019t an issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big problem was quite the reverse. Trixie thought of him as being as skinny as a rail. She began to think of ways to fatten him up. Don enjoyed her efforts, which basically consisted of cooking after school goodies to share with him, and encouraged them, although thus far they hadn\u2019t shown much effect. But it became a shared interest and that\u2019s what he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this activity wasn\u2019t lost on Linda, the new addition to the squad. She saw Trixie as the main roadblock to her own ambitions for being captain of the squad the net year and wanted Trixie out of the way. She tried some rather lame anonymous tricks on Trixie, such as bogus forwarded emails describing phony faculty member scandals with Trixies name attached. The trail of the emails was designed to throw suspicion onto Kimberly, but no one believed they had originated with the ex-captain. She had no motive. was trying to get back in good graces and would if anyone hold a grudge against Ashley rather than Trixie. The question was who was doing it, and why.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trixie, whose real name was Erica, had acquired her nickname in Intermediate School. She got it because she wore a blond ponytail and was somewhat of a social climber than a team player. Neither she or her aunt had any idea that the term began in Chicago with a meaning anything but a complimentary in intent, someone who would turn a trick with anyone if that\u2019s what it took to get ahead.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sassy persona was a reflection of the insecurities from having lost her mom.  But now, in high school, she\u2019d successfully taken a step independence from her fat phobic aunt.  She\u2019d resolved to not obsess over her weight and, if possible, add a few pounds to her new boy friend Don \u2013 a goal she\u2019d mentioned to her Aunt to explain her likely increased use of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rachel had Trixie invite Don over and immediately understood her point. Don was 5\u2019 10,\u201d maybe 115 pounds. If Trixie was 130 (Aunt Rachel suspected it might be a bit more) she actually outweighed her taller, super-skinny boyfriend. But he was polite, obviously intelligent, and treated Trixie with respect.  That counted for more than his physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn odd match physically \u2013 but she could do worse,\u201c  Aunt Rachel thought to herself.  But it actually made her feel better about something she needed to share with Trixie the next weekend,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie, I have to leave town for work for at least two weeks \u2013 it could be a month. Would you mind staying over at Louise Woods place? She has a spare room since her kids are gone and would make you breakfast. Then you could try your hand on your little project with Don.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was totally surprised. Her Aunt had never left her for more than a day or two in over 12 years. But she embraced the idea instantly. Louise\u2019s house was three doors down the block and she knew her fairly well.  She was one of the few people who still called Trixie by her name of Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts settled then \u2013 and good luck. Just try not to gain too much yourself wile I\u2019m gone. You know how Louise used to feed her kids. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie remembered the three Woods children. They certainly weren\u2019t slender, but neither were they especially large.  But she did recall that her Aunt used to be critical of the ready availability of treats that Mrs. Woods kept on hand.  There were times she\u2019d cared for Erica in the evening and she was a good cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next Monday school would be resuming after the holidays and Aunt Rachel would leave the Saturday before with Trixie at Mrs. Woods. The mystery of the bogus emails remained unresolved but with the passing of the holidays Erica had let it slip from her memory. She had time alone by herself to fill her way - and that meant filling the bellies of herself and her boyfriend.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Monday Erica stood in her room in Louise Wood\u2019s house, contemplating her slightly pudgy cheeks. The face looking back at her had slight dimples and a bit of fleshiness beneath her chin. She bit her lip, thinking that she looked cute and wondering what her school coaches and aunt would do if they knew what she was contemplating \u2013 a month of good food and rich desserts. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing her Aunt off at the airport with Mrs. Woods on Saturday night the slightly stout host had taken Erica home and shown her the room that would be hers.  Then she asked when Erica would like to get up on Sunday morning, saying \u201cI\u2019d like to offer you a welcoming breakfast \u2013 but don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll mind. Is your appetite good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m a cheerleader and swimmer, Mrs. Woods, so I\u2019m not dieting or anything. I get plenty of exercise. II don\u2019t want to impose, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be ready for any breakfast you make,\u201d she\u2019d replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Sunday morning Mrs. Woods prepared an apple pancake breakfast with scrambled eggs and beef patties, It was easily 30% larger than what Aunt Rachel would have done, Erica thought as she poured syrup onto her stack of three pancakes, \u201cSo this is what Auntie was expecting.  Well, I\u2019m going to be a good guest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow this afternoon I have a friend, Leilani, coming in from out of town.  You don\u2019t have to come to supper with us if you don\u2019t want to, but we\u2019re going to the Old Spaghetti Factory.  Do you want to come along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sure.  That place is classic,\u201d answered Erica.  She knew about the place, housed in a renovated streetcar terminal, with some of the booths inside the shells of ld cars, but had never been there. This was definitely something her weight-conscious Aunt Rachel wouldn\u2019t be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night she met Leilani, a large Hawaiian woman weighing well over 200 pounds. Both she and Louise turned out to have good appetites and as their guest Erica followed suit, dining on a stomach-stretching Caesar salad, bread with butter, and the spaghetti with rich meat sauce.  Knowing she was at healthy weight Erica didn\u2019t even consider calories, thinking only \u201cyummy! This is great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was still her attitude on Monday as she adjusted her outfit an prepared for breakfast \u2013 which for her typically meant some melons, a bowl of cereal and a piece of toast.  But that was with her Aunt, not Mrs., Woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Erika, I hear you.  Breakfast will be ready shortly,\u201d she called as soon as Erica opened her bedroom door enroute to the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? What are we having?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuffins and quiche \u2013 I hope you enjoy it,\u201d came he reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, OK, great.  I\u2019ll be there in about ten\u201d Erica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is quiche?\u201d she wondered. She had never had the dish, but soon found out that it was an egg-based custard like filling in a shell similar to pie crust \u2013 ingredients flexible.  It was luscious, and Erica had two large pieces. She also saw the potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are excellent!,\u201d she declared as Mrs. Woods smiled. \u201cCould you teach me to make them?  I have a little project \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained to Mrs. Woods her intention to make dishes for herself and Don with the hope of helping him add a few pounds to his lanky frame. Mrs. Woods gladly offered to help in any way she could,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica already had her Monday meal for Don planned. She had him snack on Doritos with melted cheese while she prepared entrees of pasta and chicken for upper, then serve ice cram for dessert.  Don enjoyed the attention and even allowed himself to be plied with seconds with his portion being larger.  Of course before times Erica normally had never had seconds at all, so what she was getting was also extra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise had told Erica that a neighbor had invited her to do a dessert for a bar-b-q on Wednesday and that she and Don would be welcome.  Don readily accepted the invitation on that night they both enjoyed a grilled Portobello Mushroom on the BBQ with some Balsamic Vinegar and melted cheddar cheese. along with a burger, potato salad, fries and a couple of cokes. Then they brought out dessert \u2013 a pineapple upside down cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, you are doing your best to get me eating more,\u201d Don remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promised. Aren\u2019t you enjoying it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, honestly, yeah,\u201d he agreed, noting to himself that Erika was sating pretty well herself. Don actually hated being skinny, but had never gained weight readily, so he appreciated the extra effort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis b-b-q is great \u2013 but have you ever eaten at Oscar\u2019s Roadhouse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo \u2013 what\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fifty\u2019s like place where they serve you exotic burgers in an old car hub-cap \u2013 although really the one hey use for a plate wasn\u2019t ever used for that.  Want to go Saturday night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Erica agreed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was that on Saturday she and Don were each devouring anaheim pepper chicken burgers with cheese and hebero mayo, served along with the obligatory baked beans, cold slaw and sweet potato fries, quaffed down with a bottomless raspberry teas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Adams meanwhile had been introducing Erica to new things to try on Don, which of course meant that Erica had them too.  She trued to make sure that he always had more and generally succeeded. However, her own penchant for candy bar snacks at school and the ample breakfasts from Mrs. Adams made up for any shortfall. <br>\r\n. <br>\r\nThe third weekend Mrs. Adams invited both Erica and Don to a wedding reception at her church. Who could resist?  Well, certainly not Erica, who by now had an appetite eager to explore new vistas. After all, how many receptions does one attend in a year? Nor don, who had never dreamed a pretty girl like Erica would do so much with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly found out it was more like a brunch, some deep fried eggrolls filled with meat, chicken with ricotta cheese and gravy over rice pilaf...  But her favorite part was the chocolate mousse. Erica had never had mousse before and she told Don \u201cit was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. I thought it was ice cream at first.  Then, duh, I should have noticed they were serving it to nearly 80 people and it wasn't melting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do realize we just crashed a reception where neither of us knew either the bride or groom?\u201d Don asked as they went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know \u2013 but Mrs. Adams said 80% of the people were there from the bride\u2019s side. By sorting with the groom\u2019s side of the aisle it balanced things out. They don\u2019t know we\u2019re not related to someone who attends there every week.  Wasn\u2019t the food great?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that it was,\u201d marveled Don.  It seemed as though Erika was utterly shameless in her efforts to get him to eat.  Thing was, he was enjoying it and his pants were tighter. He\u2019d had to let out his belt a notch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now the fourth and final week before her Aunt\u2019s return. Knowing that all good things might soon becoming to an end she went on a splurge fit, taking Don with her. There was another B-B-Q invitation, Three pieces of grilled chicken along with rice and salad plus two kinds of pie and a cake for dessert found their way to her gullet. Then the next evening she and Don hit up a Chinese restaurant (Don\u2019s treat) and on the next two days had fast food fests at Taco Bell and Desert Queen (courtesy of Erica).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waited with Louise at the airport Don confided to his girlfriend that her efforts had been successful \u2013 he now weighed 122 pounds, meaning he\u2019d put o seven in one month.  Erika smiled and said she didn\u2019t know hers and wasn\u2019t going to look, but they both knew she had probably gained some as well. Louise planned on taking everyone out to supper and they were both ready for dessert. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel returned on schedule Friday evening, tired but pleased at the success of her month log assignment. She gratefully accepted Louise\u2019s hospitality and made no remarks as Erica and Don ordered hearty steak and potato meals, then had sundaes for dessert. They were obviously still in a happy relationship and she knew better than to interfere. Erica went home with her Aunt Rachel, thanking Louise for her month of hospitality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gave her niece a good night hug, not failing o notice the soft mess of her niece\u2019s flesh, but held her peace and retired to her room. Erica was pleasantly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Erica preened herself in front of her mirror, donning a size 8 bikini that had been fine at 130 pounds but which was now definitely snug and was too thin to properly contain her belly. Her top was also too small, as the cups could scarcely contain her expanded breasts.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo far so good, but I\u2019d better get one bigger \u2013 can\u2019t have Aunt Rachel seeing me bursting out of this,\u201d she observed. Her thighs were getting noticeably bigger as well.  As she got ready for breakfast she decided to wear loose fitting clothes so as not to attract undue attention from her Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strategy worked.  Rachel slept in, affording  Erica a chance to make s jalape\u00f1o and cheese quiche as a surprise. She served it with a quarter cantaloupe to her aunt, who complimented her on her developing cooking skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good.\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIs this the kind of thing you\u2019ve been feeding Don?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, once so far. But actually this is the kind of thing Mrs. Adams does. Would you like to have this kind of breakfast here during the week?  I could make it for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was that Erica didn\u2019t want to give up the type of flare she had been enjoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn special occasions perhaps \u2013 but not regularly. I can assure you I\u2019d gain weight rapidly, much more than a young person like you, if I regularly ate like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the day Erika went shopping, picking up a size 12 Bikini styled after her size 8.  After a burrito combo in the food court she headed home for nap before Don picked her up for a Chinese buffet,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the buffet she had three plates, including some deep fried eggrolls filled with meat, chicken with ricotta cheese and gravy over rice, sweet and sour chicken and honey walnut prawns.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday morning Rachel surprised Erica with a small stack of waffles and some scrambled eggs. It was only half the breakfast she\u2019d become used to, but her niece was appreciative of the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least she\u2019s not lecturing me about how I need to diet,\u201d she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day she and Don went o a concert in the park and Rachel told her niece to bring him home for supper.  There she had prepared a green bean casserole with chicken.  Both Don and Erika had generous portions, and Don openly discussed Erica\u2019s cooking and its impact on his waistline.  As he bragged abut her abilities with strata casserole it confirmed the success of the effort of whist was being attempted. What surprised her was that he was totally aware and supportive of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon showed the better appetite, but then went a step extra in asking about dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m, sorry \u2013 I don\u2019t normally do that,\u201d replied Rachel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK, answered Don, recognizing his faux paux.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, perhaps you two might just go some place and have something by yourselves,\u201d Aunt Rachel graciously replied.  An hour or so later they did just that,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning Erica wondered what her Aunt might say.  Predictably she was up enjoying television, but hit the mute button as Erica started for her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a moment, sweetie?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure,\u201d she said, conscious that her belly was absolutely bulging from a banana split and burger combo freshly eaten on top of supper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly what is a strata casserole?\u201d she asked, hearkening back to the dish Don had bragged about at supper. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeveral ingredients layered on top of one another in a casserole dish \u2013 like sliced potatoes with eggs and salmon in between. Its another thing I learned from Mrs. Adams,\u201d Erica replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems I overlooked your aptitude for the kitchen in raising you,\u201d Rachel said. \u201dThe truth is, I never mastered such things myself and it didn\u2019t occur to me in this age that someone like you would be interested in what ovens were used for \u2018cause my generation thought they were old fashioned already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThings today are convenient but have so many preservatives, Aunt Rachel. People my age are concerned a lot about getting back to older ways. Did you know that even fresh tomatoes in the produce aisle only have 1/8th the nutrition value as they did a hundred years ago/  A lot of people are actually starting to grew their own!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was stunned. She hadn\u2019t expected a home economics lecture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, well would you like to set aside the area behind the garage to grow veggies and do some cooking for me as well?  I\u2019ve never had a strata casserole and it sounds like I need to get with the program?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Erica realized tat her Aunt had strangely shifted from her position rejecting such an idea earlier in the evening. \u201cWell, uh, sure. But if you gain a few pounds like Don has please don\u2019t fuss,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung lady, be merciful to an older woman. I\u2019m trying not to fuss over the way you\u2019re filling out, so give me a break.  Alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Auntie,\u201d Erica said contritely as she bent over and hugged her Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd one other thing. What about supper \u2013 do you think you could delay things a bit and include me on occasion?  You don\u2019t really need to split your supper into two meals just to act like you\u2019re barely easting.  You have better use for your Social Security benefits I\u2019m sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica winced. \u201cI take it I didn\u2019t cover my tracks very well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gone four weeks and what I had for a spice collection is way down \u2013 and then there are ones I never use. That told me some heavy duty cooking has happened even if you did throw out the garbage.\u201d Aunt Rachel declared, and then smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I should be proud of you for carrying through on your little project; he does need some meat on his bones and you\u2019re doing it up front.  And as for you, well, its your body, so if you don\u2019t mind I guess I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuntie, I\u2019m still a cheerleader and on the swim team \u2013 its not like I\u2019m really getting huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not at all \u2013 at least not yet.  But what I see coming in time will just have to be.  You seem happy enough and I\u2019m now resolved that I\u2019m going to enjoy your efforts. OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Auntie \u2013 now can I go to bed?  Its after eleven?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly \u2013 sweet dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room Erica disrobed and sat on her bed, fondling her distended belly and looking at her once thin arms, now featuring a slight roundness. Heavy exercise or not, she was getting plumper.  She knew what her aunt was alluding to, bit like the others n the Boar high School squad the fact was that she rather liked her more Ruebenesque figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018When  I get over 160 I\u2019ll start counting calories,\u201d she resolved, \u201cbut I\u2019ll have graduated by then   Right now Don is project #1 and I can\u2019t be distracted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sent him a text message thanking him for a great night and the ice cream \u2013 then clicked off the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next Sunday Don and Erica started the garden and worked out a menu for the next week, including two supper meals with Rachel. Tuesdays was pot-roast with baked potato and asparagus plus lemon meringue pudding for dessert.  Thursday was a tuna casserole wit a dessert of apple pie.  Admittedly some of the veggies, especially the ones in the salads, were coming from Louise Adam\u2019s garden as the one Erica and Don had started wasn\u2019t producing yet, But she had to admit they looked and tasted better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Erica made breakfasts on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Monday was poached eggs with corned beef hash, Wednesday was a salmon strata and Thursday was waffles with strawberries and melon.  Aunt Rachel, who fully realized the calories involved much more than Erica, still found herself looking forward to the next surprise, which truly surprised her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel picked up on something else as well. Don was openly happy about his own gaining and his part in working on the garden while Erica cooked. But he seemed equally happy to watch Erica and Rachel enjoy their food. She began to wonder if there wasn\u2019t a dual dynamic at work here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf so, I\u2019ll let it ride,\u201d she thought. \u201cIts only for a few months,\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chapter next<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs February came so did first semester grades. Erica had three A\u2019s and 2 B\u2019 \u2013 her best ever in High School. She attributed it to her studying with Don \u2013 which was definitely a factor. Of course they had been eating together as well, so to celebrate they naturally turned to food, in this case a moderately expensive restaurant called Tony Romas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Tony\u2019s is known for its beef and pork ribs, but it also has chicken, steak and fish. This evening, after an appetizer of baked potato soup, they had some great fish specials. Erica had pan-seared sesame crust Mahi Mahi while Don ordered Norwegian salmon. Both came with rice and vegetables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had now been over a month since the last of the mysterious pranks, but Trixie, aka Erica, hadn\u2019t totally forgotten,  Neither had Don, and he had been doing some sleuthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t prove for sure who your email hoaxster is, but I think I know, he remarked as they sipped their soup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d Erica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour teammate Linda \u2013 using a connection at her cousin\u2019s house so that it can\u2019t be easily traced back,\u201d theorized Doin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d exclaimed the startled Erica, \u201cHow did you come to that conclusion?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA friend of mine over at the university knows how to tracks hackers. The same principals apply to emails.  We traced all three emails back to a common Comcast hub \u2013 but Comcast doesn\u2019t service this area. So it seemed like a dead end. But then an announcement sent by Linda\u2019s brother Walter for the Spanish Club came out; in it he casually mentioned he was composing it from his cousin\u2019s house by plugging in his notebook.  Now that cousin lives half \u2013 a county away, over in Comcast cable territory. We traced it and bingo, same hub.  Of course, all that proves for sure is a possibility; anyone with access to any machine linked to that Comcast hub is equally possible - but the coincidence is striking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d stammered Erica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo for one \u2013 if people believed the emails then Kimberly is off from Cheer permanently and Ashley gets to nominate the successor, who would possibly be Linda. If they suspected you then all the better because neither Ashley or Kim would have any other choice.  At least that makes sense to me,\u201d said Don<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo much intrigue!  Don, you know that despite my nickname I\u2019m really not a ditz and I don\u2019t need cheer drama to be happy. I was hoping being in cheer would get me with a guy, and I kind of like what\u2019s happening with you, big fella.  The goodies you\u2019re enjoying are of more interest to me than that kind of drama,\u201d Erica said ss she reached over and stroked his forearm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sort of figured that. And by the way, I did get a new pair of trousers to accommodate your efforts,\u201d Don noted  as he moved from his empty soup bowl to the fish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWell you need to keep up the effort and catch me, cause I\u2018ve put on a few too.  I really hope you\u2019re bigger than me by the end of summer.\u201d she smiled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I keep eating like I have been that\u2019s possible \u2013 I\u2019ll be over 170, which with my height wouldn\u2019t be bad,\u201d Don said pensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica bit her lip.  She knew she wasn\u2019t yet over 150, but unless her own gain slowed she too could be past 170 by September.  That would definitely be too much for cheer and Linda, assuming she was guilty, might get her desire by default. Actually it didn\u2019t seem to matter that much. She was enjoying Tony Romans atmosphere and her luscious supper. But there was a question she needed to address.,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm \u2013 let me ask you something,\u201d Erica said. \u201cI\u2019m not predicting it will happen, but what if I get up to non-cheerleader proportions, would that make a difference to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon looked sat her and smiled, \u201cYes, it would make a big difference. We could have more time together since you wouldn\u2019t be at practices. And then you\u2019d get me up to where you want for sure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner proceeded to its conclusion and neither felt like dessert. They went home stuffed,  Don had dropped his bombshell and now needed to wait and see how Erica would handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile with the new semester the cheerleading team switched over to basketball. The routines were less demanding, coming only for infrequent time outs and not involving pyramids and the like. Erica took Ashley aside and told her of her suspicions; she was amazed to find hast Ashley had wondered the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Confront her, then bounce her? I can understand why you might want to \u2013especially if she confesses,\u201d Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica paused. \u201cNo, at the time I was upset but its history and not being continued. Now it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 and who would we replace her with at this late date? But at some point I\u2019d like to find out why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgree. I think you\u2019re very wise for a Junior,\u201d smiled Ashley. \u201cTry for awhile  to get close to her, maybe she\u2019ll get enough guilt to come forward; if not, I\u2019ll confront her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple of weeks Erica continued plying Don with after school treats such as apple crisp with ice cream and pumpkin pie with Kool Whip and cinnamon rolls with milk, Carmel brownies, cherry cobblers and the like.  Every day it seemed featured a new goodie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was responding nicely. He\u2019d twice had to let t out his belt a notch and then bought some new trousers. But also noticeable was the impact on Erica\u2019s posterior and thighs.  As a result her shorter tops no longer covered her waistband. Her plumpening belly and small developing love handles were plainly visible for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon loved this. It fit in with the chunky boar look Ashley and her friends were promoting as a sort of latest fad. He made sure to compliment her on her se look and it gave her a confident air even at lunch as she now openly ate dessert virtually every day. One teacher commented on the exposure and she feigned a  crestfallen look <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it didn\u2019t use to show. Guess I\u2019ve picked up dome weight,\u201d Erica  remarked. But inwardly she had no doubts or regrets. At least 20 others on campus had exposed guts bigger than hers \u2013 what were they going to do? Outlaw bare midriffs over a certain size on campus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica readily adapted to the new reality, even buying a new outfit and wetsuit for the swim team, whose season was about to start. This didn\u2019t prevent a little teasing from  another team member as she caught her devouring an oversize almond Joy candy bar before practice \u201cHey Erica, getting a little extra booty there I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was ready. \u201cNot that it matters, but haven\u2019t you read your papers? A little fat can be good for a swimmer. Too little weight hikes frontal drag in the water according to a University of Miami study.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to deliberately stay chunky,\u201d responded her classmate, mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how I do in practice \u2013 but its not a given that thin is in for swimmers. I can tell you that my boyfriend likes my added curves and I\u2019ve no desire to diet,\u201d Erica said as she took another bite out of her bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so what\u2019s with the wet suit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBottom line, it makes me faster in the water. The suit covers the torso and legs but not the head, shifting my centre of buoyancy toward the feet and putting me in a more horizontal position, This further reduces the frontal surface area which makes direct contact with the water. With wet suits, I\u2018m simply more streamlined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh, alright, So then you\u2019ll be faster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn freestyle yes, although research says my bun is too big for the backstroke, so that\u2019s not going to be helpful,\u201d Erica said, finishing off the last of her candy bar. <br>\r\n.<br>\r\nOnce in the water Erica\u2019s constant cheerleading exercising asserted itself. Fat or not she had plenty of muscle and easily out distanced everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon for his part loved indulging Erica\u2019s new gourmand appetite as well as his own. On Saturday before noon  he took her to a local food court Round Robin to share a Rajin Cajun chicken burger (deep fried chicken smothered in buffalo sauce, topped with pepper jack cheese) with steak fries.  Then they went to the next door Coldstone\u2019s where they each had a whole Love It sized cake batter ice cream filled with M&amp;M's and gummi bears.  She ate every bite and would have had some of his except that he\u2019d finished it off first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night they went to a privately hosted game night with pizza, chicken wings, salads soda and of course ice cream.  Erica contentedly grazed all evening, consuming four pizza slices, an equal number of chicken wings, potato and macaroni salads, and two huge bowls of ice cream.   One of her classmates shook her head, noting the two large love handles forming on either side of her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Sunday morning the binge, for that is the only fair thing to call it, continued.  She had her usual pancakes, eggs and sausage for breakfast before Don picked her up.  Then she offered to buy him some Kripy Kreme pastries to tide him over until lunch since he\u2019d failed to have breakfast. He ate half of them, but she got a Krispy Kreme original glazed doughnut, a divine powdered doughnut with strawberry filling, and a custard filled puff. This was followed at lunch by a crisp burrito with regular mexi-fries and two tacos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was truly as her Aunt Rachel had said, becoming a pudgy princess. But to her the important news as she looked in the mirror towards the endof February and saw her increasingly fleshy cheeks and underchin was that Don was developing a real belly and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor four weeks she\u2019d made a point of being nice to Linda, watching to see her reaction.  The junior cheerleader was never rude to her fellow underclassman, but seemed a bit withdrawn.  She looked longingly at lunch as Erica would devour a pizza or cheeseburger, sometimes with hot chocolate and an apple fritter chaser. Erica was constantly sharing with Don, trying successfully to get him to out eat her but still having more than Linda \u2013 who never seemed to eat anything more than a salad or mini-portion..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally one day when Ashley had the team together after school at a neighborhood taco caf\u00e9 there was a featured special of tilapia taco with pineapple-cilantro black beans and rice. Linda as usual just had one while everyone else was having at lest two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Erica, \u201chave another \u2013 its free and soooo good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood for you and Miss Perfect, maybe \u2013 but you\u2019ve both got what you want. You\u2019re just patronizing me \u2018cause I\u2019m poor with no boyfriend.\u201d Linda said softly, but Ashley heard. Rosa and Amber were preoccupied refilling their sodas and hadn\u2019t noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly Ashley turned to Linda and confronted her. \u201cIs that why you starve yourself, reject others and send emails using other\u2019s names?  Because you don\u2019t have money or a boyfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was startled, even more so when Rosa, suspecting what was going on, pulled Amber away, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, Erica and I know those emails came from a Comcast site and that you have a notebook you use at your cousins. But we\u2019ve been hoping you\u2019d become a friend and explain why you did it.  We\u2019re not mad \u2013 the silliness hurt no one, but it tells us you\u2019re hurting. Now what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho else knows?\u201d she trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say for sure \u2013 the guys figured it out. But no one wants to report it. We want to know why,\u201d the team captain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not bouncing me?\u201d Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a month,\u201d Erica said. \u201cWhy would we do it now with only a few weeks to go and Kim possibly coming back? You\u2019d be pushed back to JV automatically  \u2013 so why create a sandal?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet\u2019s eyes welled up with tears. \u201cI knew that \u2013 and wanted so much not to have to go back down. I have parents that would beat me if I weighed what you two do \u2013 and they want me to win honors. Cheer is what I\u2019m good at, not debate  or swimming like you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so driven by fear and self-limitation.  Let me let you in on a secret. Kim\u2019s thinking of not even coming back \u2013 so what do you think about that if it happens?\u201d stated Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d exclaimed Erica, \u201cWhy&gt;\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll explain herself if it happens I\u2019m sure . All I know is that its what her boyfriend Brian thinks best and she\u2019s thinking about it. Meanwhile I\u2018m happy with the team we have and there may be some surprises after the end of March.  But Linda, no more shenanigans, OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda nodded. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have to eat pizza and macaroni till I pop as a penalty? I thought you guys would be sooo mad you\u2019d make me eat until I was huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley shook her head. \u201cthis team is called the Boers \u2013 we\u2019re not small. But those of who eat do it because it tastes good;  we\u2019re in better condition than a lot of people expect. Now, do I have your pledge to behave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, captain\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica couldn\u2019t wait to get on her cell and tell Don he had been right \u2013 and then ask what he knew about Kimberly. She was intrigued by his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRumor has it that Kim is listening to Brian; she knows that she was used to hurt Ashley.  She is not wanting to diet or be used as a tool anymore.

If you want you can change stuff about the characters, but please just try and follow the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try and make the weight gain somewhat realistic (so nothing like gain 100 pounds after one meal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-With revenge it doesn't have to be all that realistic. You can use some magic and stuff. (just no 500 pounds in one day type of thing)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Make it so they don't want to gain weight if you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Use the spell check tool whenever adding a chapter please<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any comments or question feel free to leave a review or send me a mesage on here. <br>\r\n</td>",
