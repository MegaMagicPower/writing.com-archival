Initially I had considered eating him myself, but after a moment decided that it would be better to give him to Tifa; his power would make the main course far more entertaining. As I floated above, watching the group intently, I seemed to go unnoticed. It was fortunate that I had not enlarged myself to match Tifa's size; besides, it's always more satisfying to eat a giantess at regular human size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with my current power I could tell I was no match for the group below. It seemed advisable to pit them against one another, tensions were already high, but it proved unnecisarry.

The ground began to shake, granted my altitude was far too great to feel it, as Tifa once more came clearly into sight. It seemed she was eating much faster than I had estimated, at this rate Midgar would be gone in a few hours at most. It almost made me jealous for a moment, though I had long ago bored with devouring cities, however I reminded myself that everything she ate would be going into me soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Tifa taking the offensive against the beings below I decided a new plan was necisarry, and vanished form sight. An instant later I reappeared a few inchs off the ground, in front of Drolos. \"Well, it appears that your going to have to put your fight on hold for the moment. I'd say you could use all the help you can get...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer I spun around and focused on Tifa. Blue sparks of energy began to crackle down my four foot ebony pigtails, longer than my body, and they lifted to point at Tifa much like turrents. With a flash a jolt of blue energy struck the giantess, knocking her back. With that I turned to the others. \"My name is Caren, I suppose you could call me a giantess hunter. I saw your little problem, and thought I could aid you.\" It was highly doubtful in my opinion that I would be turned down. I was now in a very good position; if Tifa took the advantage I could chisle her down just a bit. And if her opponents began to win I could pick a few off, and let Tifa finish the rest. Either way the fight would end with both sides weakened on the verge of death; and which point I could devour them all.  </span></div></div>",

Today, thou shalt witness a story full of sheer excitement and fun, a story about a giantess, a being considered by many to be non-existent. So whosoever enjoys fantastic stories, sit down and heed my words.<br>\r\nTwas in a time of unrest in the world. The world was slowly recovering from the threat through meteor, and like many other people, the materia-thief Yuffie Kisaragi tried to live her life in a normal way again. So she returned to her home village of Wutai.<br>\r\nSo far, things seem to be quite normal, but now for the special events. Because a rather mysterious and strange seeming man also lived in Wutai. He was about 25 years old and quite normal looking. The colour of his hair was dark-blond, and it was relatively short. His eyes were blue, and there was a scar on the left side of his face, probably from a sword. He didn\u00b4t talk that much and prefered being alone, but Yuffie couldn\u00b4t help but feeling fascinated about this man. There was something she liked about him, and so she visited him quite often. The man himself didn\u00b4t knew what to think of that, since Yuffie could be extremely annoying sometimes, but she was also cute and nice most of the time.<br>\r\nSomething that surely gained Yuffie\u00b4s interest was the fact that man had a large collection of materia, and all kinds of materia, no matter whether for attack, defense or other purposes. Of course, the materia were not the only reason for Yuffie to visit him, since she found out about his collection after their fist meetings.<br>\r\nAnyway, one day, Yuffie wanted to visit him once again - by the way, his name is Yuriev - but he wasn\u00b4t at home, or at least Yuffie thought so. That was perfect, because she now could take a closer look at his materia. Of course, she had no intention of stealing them...at least she decided to try not to steal. And there was one materia that really caught her attention: a materia that was considered to exist no longer, a size change materia.<br>\r\n\"Amazing! Where did he get that from?!\"<br>\r\nNow that was tough for Yuffie. She wanted this materia at all cost, but she didn\u00b4t want to steal from her new found friend Yuriev. So she decided to borrow the materia; at least she wanted to take a closer look at this rare item.</span></div></div>",

He needed the materia to grow back, so Yuffie taking it away was a bad turn of events. So he did the only thing one could do in such a situation: he jumped on her right foot, unnoticed by Yuffie, and attempted to get the materia back soon. But first he had to climb Yuffie\u00b4s body in order to somehow get noticed by her. Maybe by climbing into her ear?<br>\r\nAnyway, as for the materia...</span></div></div>",

But it might have been preferable if he had not seen the following turn of events. Yuriev realized to his surprise that the constant shaking that was caused by the impact of Yuffie\u00b4s foot whenever she took a step suddenly stopped, thus Yuffie stood still. He first thought that she noticed him on her foot, but that was not the case. Instead, Yuffie brought the materia really close to her face, like a curious child. The materia was now directly in front of her mouth. Normally, no one would have considered this to be a disturbing situation, but in Yuriev\u00b4s case, it WAS disturbing. Yuffie suddenly choked slightly due to some irregularity in Yuffie\u00b4s breathing process. However, this slight choke was enough to unfold the drama: Yuffie inhaled the materia, as far as Yuriev could see, and hearing a *gulp* sound, followed by a *splash* coming from Yuffie\u00b4s belly, Yuriev realized in shock that she swallowed the materia.<br>\r\n\"This can\u00b4t be! That stupid girl...\"<br>\r\nHe was obviously upset because of this, and it\u00b4s quite understandable, since this materia is his ticket back to his normal size. But now, the materia rests within the belly of a tomboy-ninja girl. Not exactly a calming situation.<br>\r\nYuffie was holding her hands on her belly, since her stomach was growling and rumbling due to this unexpected snack that has landed in the depths of her tummy. She knew that she had a lot of problems now.<br>\r\n\"Oh no...what do I do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Despite expecting a taste-test, the slippery appendage astonishes Yuriev by flicking him into the pitch-black esophagus right away, and Yuffie swallows him whole with a soft gulp. From the outside, one might notice a small lump squirming on its way down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere seconds, Yuriev is deposited through a tight sphincter and falls onto the spongy floor of the ninja girl's hot, slimy stomach. The walls are pulsating a little, and a nearby greenish lake bubbles eerily with acid.

It gives off a very faint green glow...the size materia! YES!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find it?\" Yuffie asks, softly prodding her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did!\" Yuriev responds from within the ninja-girl. \"Now, uh, can you let me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...nope!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just so FILLING! I've never felt this satisfied with eating a tiny person...then again, I've never eaten a tiny person before. But I'm not letting you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Yuffie walks off without a care in the world, leaving Yuriev stuck in her gut. Inside, the tiny guy is startled by a drop of acid splashing on him from the ceiling of his prison...but to his surprise, it only burns through his clothes, not his skin. Maybe the materia made him immune? Maybe the acid wasn't strong enough? Either way, he's alive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped, but still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monstrous growl echoes throughout the stomach, nearly knocking Yuriev off-balance, but somehow he manages to avoid a painful fall. He takes a look at the materia in his grip, and quickly realizes that there isn't enough room inside Yuffie to use it and grow back to normal size. He'll need to get out of this hellhole if he wants to be big again...but how?</span></div></div>",

Then, she sees this beautiful blue diamond that glistened in the sun light.<br>\r\nAmy: Wow! Sonic would LOVE this!<br>\r\nAmy picks the gem up, unaware what secrets it held and what it was about to do.<br>\r\nAmy suddenly sees the gem light up and she starts shivering.<br>\r\nAmy sees the city shrink.<br>\r\nAmy: Wha.. what's going on here!? What the f*** is going on here!?<br>\r\nWhen Amy's shivering feeling stopped, she was glad that her clothes grew with her, it would be SO embarrassing! Then Amy stood up and she stood at the awesome height of 100 ft! Then Amy saw what she had wanted all along, Sonic! She snook up on Sonic.<br>\r\nAmy: Hey ya Sonic!<br>\r\nSonic: BWAH!! Oh... uh... hey Amy... um... how are ya?<br>\r\nAmy: Good! Hey Sonic, check this out!<br>\r\nSonic: Check what out?<br>\r\nAmy walks closer to Sonic, revealing that she's a giantess.<br>\r\nSonic is stunned to see this.<br>\r\nAmy: Well, what do ya think?<br>\r\nSonic: That's so impressive Amy! And you look really good that way too!<br>\r\nAmy: Really?<br>\r\nSonic: No... I mean yes! HA! Tricked ya!<br>\r\nAmy: You are so tiny Sonic! And you look really cute that way too!<br>\r\nSonic blushes.<br>\r\nAmy was about to pick Sonic up, but then she felt that cold feeling again, causing her to shiver, and she grew to 200 ft!<br>\r\nAmy: Now, you're even cuter!<br>\r\nSonic can't comply! Sonic was being flattered by giantess Amy, no wait, TRAMPLED by giantess Amy with all her compliments and affection. Sonic was enjoying it too.<br>\r\nAmy reached down again and she set Sonic on her shoulder. Sonic lied back on her neck.<br>\r\nAmy sees this and playfully scratches Sonic in the belly, accidentally tickling him in the process. Amy does it again.<br>\r\nSonic: *laughs*<br>\r\nAmy tickles him more.<br>\r\nSonic: *laughs* Okay, okay Amy.<br>\r\nAmy tickles him some more.<br>\r\nSonic: *laughs* Okay Amy, thats e-*laughs*-nough!<br>\r\nAmy keeps tickling him.<br>\r\nSonic: Amy, I said that was e- HAHAHAHA!!! STOP!!! STOP!!! HAHAHAHA!!! Ha-heh... HAHAHAHA!!!<br>\r\nAmy: I'm gonna crush you ya little critter! (playful voice)<br>\r\nSonic: PLEASE STOP!!!! HAHAHAHA!!!!<br>\r\nAmy stops.<br>\r\nSonic: HA-heh-heh... uh... (wipes the tears from his eyes)<br>\r\nAmy: I love you Sonic! (kisses Sonic on the cheek, but to Sonic it feels as if Amy kissed his whole right side)<br>\r\nSonic blushes and tries to hide it. (but fails)<br>\r\nAmy: Are you blushing?<br>\r\nSonic: NO!! No... I'm just hot, yeah, I'm hot for running all day.<br>\r\nAmy raises her brow, shooting him the look.<br>\r\nSonic: YOU BETTER GET THAT LOOK OFF YOUR FACE... NOW!!! GET THAT LOOK OFF YOUR FACE OR I SWARE TO GOD I'LL... alright I blushed.<br>\r\nAmy: *chuckles* Heh heh, you didn't to hide it, I mean it's <i> okay </i> to blush! :D<br>\r\nSonic: You're right...<br>\r\nLater... </span></div></div>",

She woke up, greeted her pet chao, Cheese, got herself dressed and went downstairs for breakfast, which her mother Vanilla had already set out for her. \"Morning Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Cream dear, waffles for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she ate her breakfast happily, without even a care in the world. She never had any reason to be worried, her mother was always happy to take care of any needs she had, and if trouble ever came knocking, their faithful robotic companion Gemerl was right there to defend them. All in all, Cream was a very happy little girl, except for one thing that seemed to be bothering her more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished your breakfast sweetheart? I'll take that for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Mommy! I can do it!\" the little girl hopped down from her chair and went over to the sink to place her dirty dish in the sink, but she was disappointed to find that she couldn't reach the sink, even as she stretched as high as she could, even on her tiptoes. \"Come on!\" Cream then felt the glass plate being lifted out of her outstretched hands, and she looked up to see Gemerl looking down at her while he placed the plate in the sink himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hurt yourself kiddo,\" the robot said. \"You're just not tall enough to reach the sink yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat instantly ruined her good mood. <i>Not tall enough.</i> She NEVER seemed to be tall enough. She wasn't tall enough to ride the big rides at Twinkle Park, she wasn't tall enough to reach things she needed on the high shelves without having to fly, she wasn't even tall enough to put a darn dirty dish in the sink so that her mother or Gemerl didn't have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Gemerl didn't mean to hurt her feelings, he was just being helpful like always. But nevertheless, what he said hurt, and the little girl's face seemed to droop as she walked out of the room with a depressed frown on her face. \"I'll be in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream?\" Vanilla's words went unanswered as she watched her young daughter trudge up the steps with Cheese slowly fluttering behind her the whole way. \"Gemerl, what on Mobius just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think I might have hurt her feelings,\" the robot rubbed the back of his metallic neck. \"All I did was take the dirty dish from her because she couldn't reach the sink...and then I told her she just wasn't tall enough to reach it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla frowned in pity, for both her daughter and the robot who clearly was upset over what he'd done. \"I'll go talk to her later Gemerl, why don't you go outside and start restocking the firewood? Don't worry, I know you didn't mean any harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" And with that, the robot walked outside to complete his assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, up in her room, Cream was desperately trying to straighten herself as much as she could without getting on her tiptoes, her back pressed flushed against a measuring sticker that was on her wall. As she marked her place with a pencil, she turned back around to see where on the sticker she was, and the moan that escaped her lips could almost be heard downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 feet, 3 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so small.\" Cream whimpered and hopped onto her bed, hugging her pillow as she searched for comfort while Cheese fluttered over and nuzzled her face. \"Why do I have to be so small Cheese?\" she questioned her pet with unshed tears in her eyes. \"Everyone I know is bigger than me, and they never let me help them anymore when they go to stop Dr. Eggman from hurting people. I want to be useful, I want to be helpful! I'm just...I'm just so tired of being tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the upset 6-year old heard a knock on her closed bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream?\"</span></div></div>",

Still nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I told you!

Part of her felt bad for tricking the young scientist, after all he was one of her very best friends...but the opportunity to grow was just too much to pass up. She was so used to feeling small and helpless, so many times in her young 6-year old life, she had had to be rescued by her friends simply because she was too small to defend herself without Cheese there with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she knew that would change very soon, and she couldn't wait until it started. \"I know what to do!\" Giggling to herself, Cream looked around her room for a pencil, and she found a pretty red one that she used for drawing whenever she was bored, and she went over to her bedroom wall and pressed her back against it, using the pencil she was holding to make a mark on the wall that showed how tall she currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chao chao?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Cheese,\" Cream replied with a slight frown. \"I'm still the same size as before,\" her smile then returned as she quickly remembered what she did. \"But that will change very soon! I'm gonna get real big, I can feel it!\" Cream then enveloped her chao friend in a tight hug, causing the emotion ball floating over Cheese's head to turn into a heart thanks to the show of affection. \"How big do you want me to be Cheese?\" she asked with a giggle. \"How about as big as Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chao!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger?\" Cream giggled again. \"Okay, how about as big as Mr. Sonic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chao chao!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even bigger?\" Cream just kept on giggling, loving the little game that she and her chao friend were playing.

Indeed, when she'd gone up to check on her a week ago, she was surprised to find that Cream was not only no longer upset over what happened at breakfast, but she was amazingly chipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Tails had done a splendid job cheering her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut since that day, the single mom couldn't help but feel like something else had changed about her young 6-year old daughter. Almost like the perspective was off, like she didn't look quite the same as she had since that day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she was bigger than she was supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after Tails' visit, Vanilla began taking it upon herself to measure her daughter to see if her suspicions were correct. On the first day, nothing seemed to change, then on the second day she noticed that her daughter had gained an inch in height, bringing her to 2 feet 4 inches, much to the young girl's delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the next day she gained another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 4 brought another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd ANOTHER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was officially a week, and Cream was waiting to get measured by Vanilla to find out if she'd grown yet again. As Vanilla made the mark, she fully expected her daughter to have gained yet another inch in height...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't expect was for her daughter to have gained 3 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big am I NOW Mommy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out. Her daughter was growing FASTER than a weed, it just wasn't possible for anyone to grow this much, this quickly. Her dear daughter had gone up 8 inches in height in just 7 days, putting her at 2 feet and 11 inches tall, 4 inches taller than Tails, who was 2 years older than her. \"You're...very big sweetheart,\" Vanilla forced a smile and stroked her daughter's head. \"You're going through quite the growth spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Isn't it awesome?!\" Cream grinned and had to restrain herself from jumping up and down with glee. \"I hope I keep getting bigger and bigger! Do you think I'll keep growing Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla again hesitated to answer, while her daughter's joy was infectious, her motherly concern was still fighting for dominance in her mind. Nevertheless, she finally graced Cream with a soft smile and nodded at her. \"I'm sure you still have a lot of growing to do dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream squealed in excitement and hugged her mom tightly, then she let go and ran towards the door. \"I'm going outside to play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay Cream, just...just be sure to come inside for lunch!\" Vanilla watched her growing daughter head outside with her chao Cheese trailing behind her, and as soon as the door closed, her smile was replaced with a frown. \"Something is very wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gemerl walked in. \"She grew again?\" the robot asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3 whole inches today.\" Vanilla crossed her arms over her chest. \"I'm worried Gemerl, this type of growth spurt just isn't natural...I can't help but wonder if Tails has something to do with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can find out if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla pondered this for a moment. \"I just don't know what to do...\"</span></div></div>",

He knew how much this meant to her, and as long as she was happy, then he was happy. Plus, the bigger she got, the more of her there was to snuggle, so even Cheese had something to gain by her amazing growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the growth stopped, and Cream gave a content sigh as she opened her eyes after reveling in the feeling of growing, and she looked down to see that Cheese seemed much farther away than he had before. By her limited estimations, she decided she'd grown about a whole foot taller this time, putting her at an amazing 3 feet and 11 inches, a very impressive size for an average adolescent Mobian; being just a 6-year old bunny made her size even more impressive. \"Wow Cheese, I grew a LOT this time!\" she grinned widely and giggled with raw excitement. \"I think I'm even bigger than Mr. Sonic now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chao chao!\" the small blue creature cheered and flew up to his bigger owner's face and snuggled it. \"Chao chao chao, chao chao chao?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" the 6-year old rabbit tapped her chin in thought before smiling again. \"You're right Cheese! This means that I'll probably be allowed to help my friends again when they go to stop Dr. Eggman!\" she threw her fist in the air in celebration. \"I should go show Amy how much I've grown!\" she suddenly realized. \"I know she just wanted to keep me safe, but now that I'm big, we can bring Team Rose back together again! Who knows? Maybe I'll get even BIGGER and I'll be able to help Mr. Big in battle!\"</span></div></div>",

But then she regained her train of thought and began to plead with her. \"Please Mommy, you don't need to call a doctor! There's nothing wrong with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream,\" Vanilla replied. \"You've grown nearly 2 feet taller in only a week, and that extra foot happened just now! You're not only growing, you're growing faster and faster, that just isn't how this is supposed to work dear, you may have a pituitary gland disorder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla bit her lip as she grew more anxious to get past her daughter. \"It's the thing inside of us that makes us grow, but if it starts working too hard, other bad things might happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh,\" Cream suddenly smiled. \"Well you don't need to worry Mommy, I know it's not a pitu...a pituary gland problem!\" Cream struggled to say the word. \"I know exactly why I'm getting so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh!\" Cream nodded. \"You see, when Tails came to visit last week, he showed me a size ray he was working on, but he thought it only made things shrink, so he shrunk a watermelon REALLY small, but when he tried to make it bigger, nothing happened right away, but I saw it start to grow when he wasn't looking, so I ate it to try and get bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream! You shouldn't-\" But Cream wasn't finished yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I asked Tails if he tried it on people yet, and since he was sure it didn't work, he shot me with it! So I'm going to be growing a lot more really soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! So it's OK Mommy, I'm not in any danger, in fact I want to keep growing bigger and bigger! I want you to be proud of me, you always told me that you were proud of me for becoming such a big girl, and now I'm getting bigger a lot faster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am proud of you Cream, this is...this is just a lot to take in, I have to think about this.\" Vanilla sighed. \"I know you're enjoying how much you're growing, but there are other potential consequences to think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Vanilla noticed something...her daughter was growing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh it's happening!\" Cream cheered. \"I'm growing even bigger! I hope I grow a lot this time!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was at that moment that none other than Amy Rose appeared over the hill that led to the house of the rabbits, and as soon as she saw the 7-foot Cream, her jaw dropped and she just stood there in complete and utter shock for several minutes, and would have been that way for several more minutes if Cheese hadn't spotted her and went over to her unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chao chao chao?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the little creature's chirping snapped the pink hedgehog out of her stupor, and she shook her head to regain her bearings and gave Cheese her attention. \"Cheese? What...what happened to Cream?! She's HUGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chao chao chao, chao chao chao chao, chao chao.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Amy smiled slightly, trying very hard to act like she'd actually understood what the chao had just exposited to her. \"Guess I better go and talk to my uh...'big' little sister.\" Amy continued walking towards the two rabbits, with Cheese fluttering next to her the whole way. Then as soon as she was within Cream's direct line of sight, she observed the young rabbit's eyes light up with excitement. \"Well...uh...hey there Cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy!\" Cream gently placed her mother back down on the ground and went over to Amy, who at her current size, was only about a third of her height. \"Look at me Amy! I'm big! Now I can help everyone stop Dr. Eggman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blinked in shock as she tried to not lose herself to her own mind again. Seeing Cream up close really drove home just how huge she had gotten; even Big the Cat was smaller than her now. \"Uh...yeah Cream, yeah, sure! But uh...how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It was Tails who helped me, but he doesn't know yet.\" Cream answered the question that Amy couldn't quite finish. \"See, I ate a watermelon that he tried to make bigger with his shrink ray, and then he shot me with it since he thought it didn't work, so I guess this is what happened! But I definitely don't mind! Now we can bring Team Rose back together and save the day from bad people again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy still didn't respond, instead looking past the rabbit to get a look at Vanilla, who simply shrugged and gave her a concerned expression. Clearly, the formerly little girl's mother was just as at a loss as she was, she would have to play this by ear. \"Y-Yeah! Sounds great Cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl squealed and jumped up and down in excitement, clapping her hands in joy...it was the jumping that caused a problem though as her now increased size also came with a proportionate increase in weight, causing her jumps to make small earthquakes that shook the area around them. \"This is so exciting! I've been wanting to help everyone for so long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Easy Cream!\" Amy exclaimed as she tried to keep her balance. Thankfully Cream stopped jumping soon after that, rubbing the back of her neck with a bashful smile on her face. \"Looks like you still have to get used to your new size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" Cream giggled with a little embarrassment. \"Although I have a feeling I won't be this big for long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy raised an eyebrow at that. \"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm,\" Cream nodded excitedly. \"I have a feeling that soon I'll be even bigger than this! I hope I get a LOT bigger! Maybe I'll get so big that we'll be able to make Dr. Eggman surrender and then we won't have to fight him anymore, and everyone in the world will be able to feel safe from him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Amy had mixed feelings...the thought of Cream getting that big filled her with unease...but her intentions were so purely innocent and good that - while she was still concerned - she couldn't help but smile. \"Who knows Cream? Let's just take this one step at a time, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me!\"</span></div></div>",

The girl wiped her tears away and tried to her best to speak clearly. \"Why do I have to be so small Mommy? I don't want to be small anymore, I used to be able to go on adventures with Amy and Mr. Big, but then Amy said that it was too dangerous because I was too little, and she doesn't want me to get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was just looking out for you, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Cream wiped away more tears with the back of her hands. \"But it still doesn't seem fair! Every day I wake up and I do the same things, I want to go on adventures again! I want to be able to help my friends whenever Dr. Eggman tries to do something mean!\" Cream glanced at her chao, who was looking at her sadly. \"Cheese and I have already proven that we can handle danger, but now I have to stay behind because I'm too little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla frowned and pulled her daughter into a hug, placing her into her lap so she could comfort her better. \"Oh Cream, some day you're going to be a big girl, and then others will look up to you instead.

He is a yellow belt in karate, proficient in science and maths but enjoys more abstract subjects like literature. He can sense the presence of spirits and can also determine if someone wields special powers like himself. He wears glasses only to watch TV, look at a blackboard/whiteboard and to make out detail in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis personality is usually philosophical, calm, logical but spiritual, focused, romantic, open and sympathetic but he can lose control under stress and instead express a confrontational, desperate, instinctive, bitter and merciless attitude, but he never holds a grudge but will form a strong dislike of someone if they've caused problems for him or for people he feels most strongly about. Occasionally he takes a light-hearted attitude and exhibits effeminate, almost camp, traits and sometimes minces down stairs but will walk normally on the level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending on the time where this is set he might show macrophilic attitudes if he's entering, in or past puberty.</span></div></div>",

He has the power to shrink, transform into anything (Objects, people, etc), and control other people, but his offensive Kagune's is the same as Kaneki's, and is able to shout needles out of his Kagune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe became an orphan at the age of 5, when his parents mysteriously died. Ever since then, he never trusted any ghoul or human, abd grew with hatred to both of them. Eating not only humans, but also ghouls. This led him into becoming a Kakuja. Since he would mostly his victims at such a small size, he had become well known to the CCG as the \"The Hidden Killer\" in the 13th ward. However, no one knows what he looks like. He was a threat to the CCG being ranked as an SS-rated ghoul, but he was a small help, when he would kill many highly wanted ghouls. But he did the same of the high ranked investigators in the 13th ward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he reached the age of 13 he disappeared from the 13th ward and fled to the 20th ward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen in the story line does this take place?</span></div></div>",

Since then he survived on his own, and began killing humans and ghouls. But no one even knows what 'The Hidden Killer' looks like, not even the 'Killer' wears\" Enji explained. \"I feel really bad for 'The Hidden Killer'\" Hinami said with a sad face. \"And why do you feel that way\" Yoshimura asked. \"Alone from 5 years old, and never been loved for most of his life\" Hinami explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you met 'The Killer' what would you do\" Yoshimura asked. \"I guess, show he or she has a friend and isn't alone\" Hinami answered. \"Good answer, Hinami\" Yoshimura said then said goodbye and walked out the door to run an errand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A week later</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There had seem to be a recent siting of 'The Hidden Killer', here in the 20th ward. One of the CCG's special investigators was recently attacked, but escaped alive. Now, the investigator is here to share his story. So sir, what exactly happened when you encountered the ghoul\" the radio lady said. \"To begin with, it was a very scary experience. To fight against someone you can't even see\" he said. \"Are you saying that this is an invisible ghoul\" she asked. \"Maybe or maybe not, the Kagune the 'Killer' penetrated when deep into my arm, yet the holes it left weren't so big either\" he said. \"What else happened with your encounter\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, the ghoul spoke to me\" he said. \"Really! What does 'The Killer' sound like and what did it say\" the lady asked. \"It seems like he can change what his sounds like, so I don't know if its male or female. But 'The Killer' said that 'He told the CCG to stop chasing' and that 'The Killer' told us once\" he shared. \"A voice changing ghoul that can't be seen either. Very interesting, we will get back to you all later\" she said before going into commercial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that guys\" Hinami said energetically. \"Yes, it seems like 'The Killer' is in town\" Enji said. \"I really hope 'The Killer' keeps that word. Before the CCG gets crazy\" Touka said. \"Yeah, me too\" Hinami said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimura came through the back door and said</span></div></div>",

U guys can do something similar to that.Oh if your posting for first time in asterics(*) tell us quickly how U character looks like so we can picture the story better. And no one is indestructable or all powerful, you may use someone else's character but you can not humiliate the character, Oh and mild vore(no phychotic women),only women grow or men shrink, dont go too far ooc(out of character), also mild language is allowed plus some swears and mostly have fun!</td>",
