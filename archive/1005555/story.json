            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The story starts at one morning at the home of Lyn and her mother Kate. It was Tuesday and the sun has already risen and a few rays of sunshine glare through the shutter on Lyn's room. She lied on her bed and was sound asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keep late hours yesterday and didn't catch very much sleep since her mother was at home for the first time since months. There was so much they had to talk about and Lyn totally forgot the time. Her mother Kate just finished an excavation in South America where they found a more then 1000 years old skeleton of a real dragon. But since she was forced to work with the government in such special cases, there was no chance that this finding would come public, but there was no reason why she couldn't tell it her half dragon daughter. Lyn really shown interrest in the work with dragons of her mother and she wouldn't tell any other person about it. Her very existence was forbidden and the government and the hunters wouldn't hesitate a second to strike her down. But Kate already took care of everything with the help of a few friends. They altered any traces and evidences of Lyn's origin to save her life. Over 17 years she lived the life of a normal human girl and her secret was never revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Lyn rolled over in her sleep and the sun started to shine on her closed eyelids. The tickling sunlight woke her up and she slowly opened her sleepy eyes. Then she began to stretch herself and her wings spread from her back. Full extended she reached a wingspan of 1.80 metre and her scales which covers her wings sparkles crimson red in the sunshine. Her also crimson red tale wagged wild as she stretched herself. Her tale was connected to the bottom end of her spine, directly over her butt and approximately 1 metre long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn yawned very loudly and rubbed tired her eye's. Slowly she rise up from her sleeping position and looked still tired with her blurry eye's on the alarm clock. she couldn't exactly see the time, so she reached out for the clock with the one hand and scratched her back with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so tired\" she thought as she tried to read the numbers on the little clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still 9:18... to early to wake up...\" she said to herself like in trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden she realized that it was actually to late for her to sleep. She jumped up and looked again on the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? 9:18 aah 9:19??? I am terribly late for school\" she shouted surprised and stood up from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school already began one hour ago and Lyn have to hurry. Quickly she unbuttoned her pink pyjama and ripped it open. She took her arms out of the short sleeves and threw the pyjama jacket off her back. But the clothing still hang on her wings. All her clothes she wear at home has a large hole on the backside for her wings, because it is much more comfortable for her. Then she moved her wings like arms to slip out of the pyjama. On top of her wings where little claws shaped like small human hands. She used them like her actually hands to get finally off her clothes from her wings. After the jacket she put off her pyjama pantie and kicked it into the corner to the rest of her laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she stripped herself into her underwear, she walked over to the mirror and admire herself. Lyn had a ribbon between her teeth as she brushed her brown shoulder long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky! Looks like I haven't gained weighted from the sweets I ate yesterday evening\" she thought as she looked her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn watched like nearly every girl in her age for her weight. At her height of 1.68 cm she  had a very athletic body. She really love sweet things and often eat too much of them. Thats why she gained some unwanted extra pounds in the shape of little love handles and a bit plumper breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breasts are still okay, but I have to do something about the love handles\" she thought as she looked closer on her problem areas, her nice B cup breasts and her little love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished brushing her hairs, she tied them to a single pony tale with the red ribbon. After that she graped her school uniform, a light blue blazer. like all her clothes, this one was one size bigger than she usually would wear. The reason is really simple, she still needs extra room under her clothes to hide her wings and her tale. As she slipped into the shirt with her right arm, her wings started to wrap around her torso and pressed against her skin. Now she could put on the shirt and her small wings were entirely covered by the fabric. The same happened as she put on her skirt, her dragon tale wrapped around her waist like a belt and disappeared under it. Now she looked just like a girl her age should look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she left her room and...</span></div></div>",

She jumped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the sphere where two men in modern military garb with guns drawn and ready frozen into the ice. In the ice with them was a creature not that diffrent from Lyn. It had small dragon wings and a small tail and was coated in snow white scales. The claws on ats fingers and hawk-like feet where splayed wide as were its arms and raptor like legs. Lyn wondered how the creature and the two men had come to be frozen inside the sphere, then she saw it move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature turned its head to look at the driver of the forklift and sneered. It drew its legs and arms in by its chest and then resumed its previous position, the icy sphere exploded and sprayed anyone near by with icy shards. The creature ran straight for the airport building alowing Lyn to get a better view of it, the creature was wrapped in a snow white robe that looked like it conseild armor and a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that thing?\" Ann screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is its heading this way!\" Lance shouted as he ducked under a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn decided to...</span></div></div>",

The soilders fire in unison and Lyn thought the creature was a gonner for sure. The creature simply dived and weaked through the shots as if it were no more than a game of dodge ball.<br>\r\nWhen the creature got close to the soilders it breathed a white sparkling cloud at them, Lyn thought it looked beutiful but the soilders rann before it. Lyn saw why as the cloud advanced, it froze everything it touched. <br>\r\nThe cloud swept forward freezing boxes and guns the soilders had dropped in their flight. The cloud moved fast but disapated quickly freezing the legs of the slower soilders and complete freezing those who tried to hide from the cloud.<br>\r\nThe creature made a tromendous leap and crashed through the window mear feet from Lyn. Things seemed to slow down as Lyn turned to look at the creature as it shattered to glass. Lyn saw the creature look at her and made eye contact with her for but a moment but in that time Lyn read something in the creature's eyes, \"I know what you are and we'll met again soon.\"<br>\r\nThen time flowed normally and Ann screamed as the talons on the creature's feet sliced into a soilder who screamed in agony and dropped his gun as he fell to the floor. The creature continued down the hallway and weaved around the soildiers's fire as it worked its way to the exit. Lyn saw the gun next to her and the soildier it belonged to gasping weakly and reaching for his gun still trying to stop the creature.<br>\r\nLyn grabbed the gun and aimed at the creature but hesitated. She couldn't think of the creature as a monster, it was to much like her and probably only wanted to be free. But it was hurting people and might even kill someone if it got into the town.

Then all color faded from the creature and it collapsed as a pile of ice on the ground. Lyn almost cried thinking she had killed the creature on accedent. <br>\r\nThen a cry went up and the soilders pointed their guns at the roof and Lyn saw the creature crawling across the roof. It threw itself to the side wall to avoid the next wave of darts and hissed angrily. The creature spat out a small cloud of its frezing mist and a sword made of ice formed in the mist. The creature grabbed the sword encasing its hand in ice as the mist froze to it.<br>\r\nThe creature jumped into the crowd of soildiers and sliced up their gun to keep them from shooting at it.  The soildiers leapt at it attempting to dog pile it but the creature slid under the men and ran out the doors into the street and jumped skyward vanishing from sight.

Mrs. Gren squinted her eyes in a glare and turned around said, \"It seems you weren't the only one who decided to take half the day off, we have a new student who will now stand up and introduce herself to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Glen used this tacktic to try and embaress a new student but the girl who had been sitting in the corner seemed unfazed and rather stone faced. The girl was nearly six and a half feet tall with sun starved skin and snow white pants and shirt. She had long flowing white hair that reminded her far to much of the creature that had escaped the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl carried herself like a warrior and said in a commanding voice, \"My name is Dracas and I will joining you in class until I choose otherwise. If you have a problem with me say it to my face and try not to act like a coward and go behind my back. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand went up and boy named Harold asked, \"Any reason your afraid to step into the sun? Or are you just scared of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class chuckled a bit but feel silent as Dracas leapt across the room and kicked Harold out of his chair. Mr. Glen was shocked to silence for several second, then he turned red faced and shouted, \"Go to the principle's office NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You care to try and make me?\" Dracas asked leveling an unnevering glare at Mr. Glen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Glen called in security and after Dracas flattened the first two more had to come in with guns leveled before she would back down and follow behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe she challenged the Dragon like that, the Dragon has a nasty temper.\" one of the students in the back said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's definitly got the right nickname.\" another student replied. Lyn hated when other students used that nickname on her teacher. She understood why they used it, she knew the reputation dragons had made for themselves, but she still didn't have to like it. Also, it wasn't as if dragons got the rep on purpose. After all, if dragons really were mindless beasts, she wouldn't even be here; though she knew she could never say that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of her secret made her glance at her friend Ann a few seats away. She hated having to keep this from her, they were best friends and shared everything together. Well, obviously not quite everything, but still. There was also Draco who she had considered telling because of his vast ammount of dragon lore, she thought he might be able to answer some questions she had about herself. But she had dismissed the idea quickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow she longed to tell Ann and Lance, her other best friend, and especially Vaan, the boy she had a crush on. She looked to the front of the room to where he was sitting, taking notes on the teachers lecture. True, he was a senior and she was a junior, but she asked for this class since it was a class taken by both grades. She knew he was into the paranormal and supernatural stuff, so he might be okay with it, but she didn't know how Ann and Lance would take it, so she kept quiet so as not to seem like she was singling anybody out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class was over she caught up with Vaan to chat with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vaan, wait up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, oh, hey Lyn. What's up?\" Vaan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if maybe you would like to come over for dinner tonight.\" Lyn responded, somewhat sheepishly. Vaan looked a little taken aback by her request and suddenly looked to be deep in thought; so deep, that Lyn was thinking that he might refuse. Her feelings must have reflected on her face because as he looked at her his suddenly brightened as he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'd love to. Say around 7?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven sounds great. See you then!\" Lyn ran off at a giddy gait. 'Yay, I've got a date with Vaan, woohoo. I can't wait to tell Ann and Lance.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaan watched as Lyn ran off. He really liked her and was looking forward to their date. Suddenly his face darkened again after she turned a corner. \"Man, my Master will not be happy about this. I just hope he's in a good mood. Hah, like that could ever happen. I swear that guy was born frowning.\" Sighing, he headed off to his next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to his next class, Vaan wondered breifly about the new student and thought that maybe she was a monster to be exterminated. He would ask his master about her as well.</span></div></div>",

However she wasn't scared enough that she peeked above the box to see what was happening. The hooded figure strode into view and she was able to get a good look at it. The figure wore a cloak that covered the whole body, and wore a hood that hid it's face. In it's left hand was a long hooked spear with an eerie blue glow on the tip.

Lyn turned away, unable to watch anymore. The feeling of the other dragon was suddenly gone as quickly as it had come, and when she looked up the figure was standing over the corpse, and although the hood still hid most of his face, his head was raised enough so she could tell he was smiling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew, then, that he did nothing provocative, so she knew the man in the hood attacked and killed him for no other reason than the fact that he was a \"foul creature.\" Lyn was furious. Suddenly her body began to heat up, soon she was enflamed, both figuratively and literally. The hooded figure turned in the direction of the disturbance, and saw what looked like a giant fireball which grew to no ends. Finally, at fifteen feet it stopped, and a figure emerged. Four long scaly legs sprouted from the bottom, with claws as green as emeralds, and scales as red as roses, with a sheen that reflected the fire very well. A tail sprouted from the back and curled around front which had to measure twenty feet in and of itself. Eyes as green as the claws shone through the flame as a long, triangular head emerged. Next were the wings, large and menacing, with a span of at least thirty feet(it was a large alley). Finally, the flame died away, and a long thick neck attached to a large, lean body typical of a four-legged animal was revealed. The man was stunned. This dragon was very large, at least fifteen feet at the shoulder. The dragon he had just fought couldn't have reached that high with his head held up. No, this dragon was far to large for him to fight alone. He turned to flee, but found the dragon blocking his path. 'How is this beast so fast and agile?' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?\" Lyn boomed in her dragon voice. \"YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST SLAUGHTER MY FELLOW DRAGONS AND GET AWAY WITH IT?\" She reached her left-front paw up, extending her claws to the max and swung at him. The man raised his spear in protection, but he may as well have waved a spagetti string. Lyn's claws gashed his right hand, and the spear flipped 180 degrees, nicking him in the cheek. He was dumbfounded. No dragon had ever gotten past him like that. He reached under his cloak and threw something to the ground. The smoke cleared and he was gone. Lyn thought about pursuing him, but she figured he wouldn't be hunting for a while, and besides, had more important matters to attend to. She calmed her rage, and reverted to her somewhate human form. Fortunately for her, dragons are able to mesh their clothes into their forms, so she didn't have to worry about covering up once she was back to normal. She scooped up her bag with her dress, and headed out of the alley and down the street for home to prepare for her date. As she turned out of the alley, a figure emerged from some crates on the opposite side of the alley that she ran from. The figure was Ann, who tried to catch up to Lyn to ask her about something. And she saw everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom on top of the roof of the shopping center two figures were watching Lyn and Ann as the left. The figure on the left was the creature from the airport now with a huge broadsword slung over its back. The figure on the right was a little taller then the creature and was completely wrapped in black cloth concieling every minor detail about it, it did not block out the fact the figure had a long tail and two large bat-like wings though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we follow them?\" the creature asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, let them have their privacy,\" the wrapped figure said, \"We'll see them at school tomorrow anyways so we'll just wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to raise the shop keeper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd best go ahead and try, other wise my dad will kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two figures dropped to the ground and place a hand on the body of the shopkeeper. The figure's hand glowed green and the wounds on the shop keeper closed but his chest remained still. The figure hissed in annoyance and the green glow around his hand brightened briefly and the shop keeper gasped and started to breathe easily. By the time he had opened his eyes the two had vanished.</span></div></div>",

Another figure landed behind the creature and bent over the boy of the shop keeper. The cloaked figure seemed unsure about what to do against this new foe for a moment then he hefted his spear and thrusted it at the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature vanished and raked its claws across the cloaked figure's back and was carried away from the man's spear by its own momentum. The creature stood teeth barred growling at the man looking ready to face down an army. The man swung his spear again and this time the creature caught it by its shaft and snapped it in its grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stepped back startled and the creature appeared behind the man, it had made another fake out of ice. The creature tapped the man on his shoulder and he turned to see the creature grab his cloak to hold him still. The creature pulled a fist back and, with a snarl, slammed its fist into the man's chest sending him flying across the street to crash into a trash can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man slowly climbed back to his feet and ran off.

Lyn rised the gun in her hands and prepared to fire, when the man sliced the barrel of the gun clean in half,and walked past her toward the white creature and roared,\"Nala!Stop playing around and finish this, or I'll finish it for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn dove behind a nearby table just in time, because the white creature, whose name is Nala, leaped onto the reptillian man and gave him a kiss before leaping back into the air and onto the ceilling to dodge a volley of darts that came towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The reptillian man slammed his fist into the ground and a wall of earth formed in front of him, protecting him from the darts. Then the wall sank back into the ground and he charged forward and roared at the first soldier, covering him in a strange green liquid but soon found out that the liquid was acid,the acid reduced the poor man to nothing more than a pile of goo &amp; he continued on through the crowd of soldiers, slaughtering any who stood in his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn watched in horror as all those soldiers were slaughtered like mere animals: cut in half, decapitated,or melted into a pile of goo,\"Dear god,what are those things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LYN!We have to get of here,NOW!\" Lyn snapped out of her trance and was pulled through the airport towards the exit by Lance,with Ann,who was on the verge of having a panic attack,right behind them.

Lyn hated when other students used that nickname on her teacher.  She understood why they used it, she knew the reputation dragons had made for themselves, but she still didn't have to like it.  Also, it wasn't as if dragons got the rep on purpose.  After all, if dragons really were mindless beasts, she wouldn't even be here;  though she knew she could never say that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of her secret made her glance at her friend Ann a few seats away.  She hated having to keep this from her, they were best friends and shared everything together.  Well, obviously not quite everything, but still.  How she longed to tell Ann and Lance, her other best friend, and especially Vaan, the boy she had a crush on.  She looked to the front of the room to where he was sitting, taking notes on the teachers lecture.  True, he was a senior and she was a junior, but she asked for this class since it was a class taken by both grades.  She knew he was into the paranormal and supernatural stuff, so he might be okay with it, but she didn't know how Ann and Lance would take it, so she kept quiet so as not to seem like she was singling anybody out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class was over she caught up with Vaan to chat with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vaan, wait up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, oh, hey Lyn.  What's up?\"  Vaan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if maybe you would like to come over for dinner tonight.\"  Lyn responded, somewhat sheepishly.  Vaan looked a little taken aback by her request and suddenly looked to be deep in thought;  so deep, that Lyn was thinking that he might refuse.  Her feelings must have reflected on her face because as he looked at her his suddenly brightened as he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'd love to.  Say around 7?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven sounds great.  See you then!\"  Lyn ran off at a giddy gait.  'Yay, I've got a date with Vaan, woohoo.  I can't wait to tell Ann and Lance.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaan watched as Lyn ran off.  He really liked her and was looking forward to their date.  Suddenly his face darkened again after she turned a corner.  \"Man, my Master will not be happy about this.  I just hope he's in a good mood.  Hah, like that could ever happen.  I swear that guy was born frowning.\"  Sighing, he headed off to his next class.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the Hooded figure reached home he slammed the door behind him and started breathing heavily.  He looked out the window to see if the dragon had followed him, but it didn't look like it had.  Most normal humans couldn't see dragons, unless they had some special ties to the creature, or if they were born with the special ability that allowed them to do so, like he had.  Still, there was something about that dragon;  before it had raised its' claws, they had stared directly into each others eyes.  Something about the eyes disturbed him greatly, but he didn't know why.  After he calmed down he looked at his hand.  There was a large gash along the back of it that would need immediate treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I better take care of this before my date tonight.\"  As he walked upstairs to the bathroom he flipped his hood back to reveal the face of Vaan, who was very excited about his date with Lyn.  The Master hadn't been too upset when Vaan told him about it, just so long as he got his hunting done beforehand.  As he reached the bathroom, though, his master came up and stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's a deep wound you have there, Vaan, surely you didn't get that from the old man I sent you after, did you?\"  The Master kept his cloak and hood on all the time, so Vaan didn't know what he looked like, but he could tell that he was a little miffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Master, I finished him off very easily, but once I did another dragon appeared, this one much larger than the old man.  It had to be at least fifteen feet tall at the shoulder, and it was in very good shape, faster than any dragon I've delt with before, and it swatted my spear away as if it were nothing.\"  Vaan gave an accounting of what transpired, leaving out the part where their gazes locked, he would rather figure that one out himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master was silent for a moment, then began speaking:  \"Did the dragon have rose-red scales and emerald green claws?\"  Vaan nodded fervently.  \"I see.  Apprentice, I believe that dragon was the child of the giant dragon you slay three years ago.  I was able to track it to somewhere within this county, but could not track any further.  It appears our search is over.  The creature can be no more than 17, so it must be a student at your school.  Were you able to ascertain what gender the creature was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, master, but I was more interested in escaping with my own gender intact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite.  Well no matter, there are other ways of identifying a dragon.  Go, wash up and enjoy your date.\"  With that he left.  Vaan turned back to the bathroom to treat his would and rid himself of the smell of dragon blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt seven that night, Vaan arrived at Lyn's house for their date.  He took her to a nice restaurant where they talked about school, sports, etc., finally the topic settled on the supernatural.  Not on purpose, it just happened.  Lyn figured that since they were on the subject she would see where he stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Vaan, I've been into the supernatural a little myself, and I would have to say my favorite creatures are dragons.  How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, dragons are cool and all, but I wouldn't want to meet one up close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, afraid he'll burn you to a crisp if you look at him the wrong way.  See, that's the trouble with our understanding of magical creatures.  Most of it is based on the briefest of observations so we don't really know anything.  For all we know, dragons are very nice people and would probably invite you for tea or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting point, and we could argue about this all night, but lets save that for another time.  Tell me about yourself, Lyn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I grew up here, for starters, with my best friends Ann and Lance.  I've lived alone with my mom for three years, ever since my dad died.\"  Vaan perked up at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Died?  That's awful, how did he die, if it's alright for me to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay.  It was, uh...a car crash.  You know how it is:  Raining, slippery road, turn the car just a little too much and off it goes.\"  Now Vaan wasn't like most people, he could tell she was trying to make up a story to hide the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for asking.  If you ever want to talk about it, I'm here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Vaan, that means a lot.\"  Vaan took her hand in his and they gazed at each other.  As they looked into each others eyes, Vaan got the same feeling that he had earlier when he looked at the dragon.  He knew then that his suspicions were confirmed, to his dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's getting late, we should both probably be getting home now.\"  They paid and left, and after Vaan dropped Lyn off he crept around behind her house.  'I don't know why I'm doing this.  Whether she is the dragon from earlier or not I won't tell by peeking on her in her room.'  He climbed the tree in Lyn's beckyard and got a good look of her room.  Lyn was just undressing as he came up.  Her back was turned and she pulled her shirt over her head, and that's when he saw them:  Two little wings, maybe six inches each, small enough that they could be hidden under most garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaan had seen enough.  He hopped down, ran to his car, and drove home.  When he got there, he decided not to tell his master what he had discovered.  Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Lyn was at school on her way to class and ran into Ann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ann, what's up?\"  Lyn asked energetically.  Ann looked at her friend.  She seemed so normal, yet Ann knew what she had seen the day before and it was not normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lyn, I...uh...\"</span></div></div>",

Vaan flew across the hallway and slammed into the lockers there leaving a large dent where he hit. Draco climbed out of the hole in the wall and Lyn saw he had changed since this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco now had razor sharp teeth in his mouth as his lips curled back as he growled. Draco's hands were cover with red scales and had long dagger-like claws that looked like they could carve through bone. He had a long scaly tail thrashing back and forth behind him like a preditor stalking its prey. His hair had faded in color as if it had been bleach in the sun for a few hours. Lastly Draco's mistivous eyes had been replaced by draconic eyes rolling with hatred and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaan straightened up and raised his spear shouting, \"You think you can take me!?! If I can beat him,\" Vaan motioned at Mr. Glen with his spear, \"Then I can take yo-!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco chose that moment to charge and sliced through Vaan's spear as if it was water and slammed him into the lockers with his foot saying, \"Enough of your bull sh*t! Let's see you back it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco tossed Vaan across the hall and sliced him across the face with one claw and nearly bit off his right hand.

And you call yourself a dra...\" Draco's voice was cut off by a the sound of a gas motor and Draco himself seemed slightly fearfull.<br>\r\nBRAAAAA KA KA KA KA!<br>\r\nIt was hard to see how it happened, but Lyn watched as a man seemed to zip across the floor with a large half foot wide sword in front of him.  The man then performed a kind of an upercut with a sword at the arm that Draco was holding Vaan with.  Draco recoiled in pain, releasing Vaan from his grip.  Once the man stopped moving, Lyn was able to see not only that the man was very young, as in around twenty, but that the sword he was holding was less of a sword and more like giant chainsaw with white teeth.<br>\r\nDraco held on to his bleeding wrist, sneering at the newcomer before he said \"Vio, you slime, how dare you show your face around here.  You are banished from here by your own kind remem... wait!\"<br>\r\n\"That's right\" the man said \"I am not Vio, I am Gatt, his son.

As if you killed that boy, I would have been forced to kill you.\"<br>\r\nDraco roared as he swung his unharmed claw at Gatt who tried to block it with the chain sword, only to be flung away.  Landing on his feet, Gatt yelled at Vaan \"HUNTER, GET LYN AND RUN, AND IF YOU HARM A SINGLE HAIR ON HER BODY THEN I WILL BE FORCED TO KILL YOU!\"<br>\r\nVaan looked at Draco, then Gatt, then Lyn, then Draco again before running towards Lyn and taking her by the hand.

Vaan tried to retreat but a booted foot kicked him in the gut and sent him crashing into the lockers across the hallway. Draco stepped out of the hole where Vaan had just been standing holding a long katana in his hand and a deadly look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Ms. Glen and asked, \"Are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I broke a wing,\" she grunted, \"but I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then hurry up and turn back to your human form,\" Draco said leaping over the debry and glaring at Vaan, \"I'll handle him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell you will!\" Vaan said standing up and drawing another spear, \"You only surrived this long is by taking me by surprise! If I can kill a dragon I can kill a human like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco straightened and was silent for a moment after this was said, then he started to growl. Draco's eyes started to turn red and claws like scyth's grew from his fingers as he continued his angry growl. As his growl escallated in two blood red twenty foot long wings sprouted from his back as did a six foot long tail that ended in a spear tip. Finally long razor sharp teeth grew from his mouth and Draco loosed an enraged roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now Vaan had been transfixed by facination of the transformation. Now he lifted his spear and thrusted it at Draco's heart. One of Draco's wings moved to block it and Elizabeth was surprised to see the spear stopped by the thin wing membrain. The wing swung out wards and threw Vaan off balance as Draco grew blood red scales across his whole body and his face stretched into that of a dragon's. Draco now looked like a human with dragon parts strapped to his body with long white hair pouring out from behind the horns on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NO HUMAN!!!\" Draco roared and leapt at Vaan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaan thrust his spear again but Draco vanished and was behind Vaan in a heartbeat. Draco raked Vaan's back with his claws and knocked him flying with his tail. Vaan had hardly hit the ground when Draco was on him again. Draco bit off the head to Vaan's spear and press down hard on Vaan's chest, Lyn heard audiable cracking sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Draco pulled his arm back as if to punch Vaan but kept all of his fingers straight out making his hand a row of knives.

The red slowly fadded from Draco's scales and they lay down flat against his body. Several horns sunk into his body and his claws retracted as he continued to breathe slow deep breaths. Finally the spear point on his tail vanished and Draco stood up and calmly brushed the dirt and dust off his clothes and scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Draco was walking away Vaan grabbed the spear point and thrust it into Draco's back. Draco grunted and straightened but did little else to indicate he felt the attack. Draco reached behind him and pulled the spear point out of his back just before he kicked Vaan in the head. He examined the blue spear head that had a small trickle of crimson on it and whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really something tough if it managed to pierce even my hide,\" Draco said before tossing the spear head in the trash, \"Still not much of a threat to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your a dragon just like Lyn?\" Ann asked hiding behind Lyn a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no,\" Draco said, \"I am a dragon mixed of human and dragon blood like Lyn is, except I've got more dragon in me, but I am a vert diffrent type of dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diffrent type?\" Lyn asked confused, far as she knew there was only one kind of dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dragons are actually one of the most commonly occuring creatures in all the multiverse. My breed of dragons live in a year about two thousand years later than this one and in a diffrent deminsion to boot. However to prevent war with the other races in our universe, which is filled to the brim, we seek new settlements among the dragons of other dimensons. I was sent as a scout to introduce myself to the local dragon population and see if they would alowe us to live with them. Though it looks like only those of mostly human blood would be able to live here safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem pretty tough for a scout!\" Mr. Glen said stepping out of his class room in human form now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who better to send as a scout than the toughest individuals you've got?\" Draco said shrugging melting slowly back to human form, \"My father was busy so I was sent in his place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn was strugglingto take it all in.

See you at recess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn walked to her class. But with her thoughts she was still with Vaan. He was so perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt recess Lyn and Ann went sitting at a table in a corner. They were a little off beats so most of the others did't put any attention to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyn about you powers. You can change in dragon when you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It normally only happens when i get angry, nervous or hot. I did't ever really try to change on purpose. Since you now know my secret i might as well tell you. I have a tail two wings and those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed just for a moment her fangs. No one else looked at them so no one else saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you could control your powers you could be a super Hero. Like Ben 10 or Super men or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann keep it down. There are't many dragon slayers left because people don't believe any more in dragons. I like to keep it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but just tell me about it. Can your parents also change in dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No my mother is a human and my dad was a dragon. So i'm a half dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna tell Lance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Well i don't know. You understand but i don't know or he will understand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how about Vaan?\" She said slowly with a evil sparkle in her eyes making kissing sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it. Well if he really becomes my boy friend i will need to tell him sooner or later. I wonder of my kids will have dragon parts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told me you had wings and a tail right. I never saw them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hide then normally. I can hold in my fangs but i can only hold my wings in for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you're so picky with buying clothes. You know, Now i know it's gonna become a whole lot easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn was glad she could finally talk to someone about her being a half dragon.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still i think you should use your powers to help others. Some people say everything has a reason. Maybe you got these powers with the reason to help others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Lyn said nibbling on her lunch. \"But i'm not sure or it's wise to fight like a dragon. People could start to hunt me down. And there are some hunters already.\"     </span></div></div>",

Draco smiled and laughed again surprising Mr. Gren enough to make him drop his glare as Draco choked out the words, \"And just when I thought you couldn't get any uglier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn and the rest of the class, minus Draco, sank behind their desk as thunderclouds boiled over Mr. Gren's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sir,\" Mr. Gren said his voice deathly quiet and struggling to keep control, \"Have just earned a pass to the princeples office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall resist you non-violently and simply refuse to move!\" Draco said raising his voice and striking a defiant pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Gren went over and called in security and it took four personel just to remove Draco from the class room because he had wrapped his legs around his desk ridiculously tight.

She would have hit Vaan if he hadn't danced out of the way and he caught her before she tripped and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You later for school as well?\" Vaan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Lyn said blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to say more but she couldn't help it, Vaan was just so cute. Everytime she got near him she always got tongue tied and blushed. There was just that sort of thing about him as he starred into her eyes and her back into his. Lyn might have tried to kiss him if the mood hadn't been suddenly broken by the sound of a small engine revving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn and Vaan both looked down the street and saw someone zipping along at fourty miles an hour on a pair of rollerskates. The engine that she had heard was strapped to the skates and propelling the driver along. The driver started to slow down and stopped just in front of Lyn and Vaan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiyas Lyn,\" a fimiliar voice said as the skater removed his helmet, \"Need a ride to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Draco,\" Lyn said more out of habit than want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draco was a boy from her school, and a massive one at that. He had long golden blond hair and the body that would put Schwarenegger to shame. He might be considered handsom if he didn't tower over everyone with his seven feet in hieght and four foot shoulders. He was also a bit on the immature side and had a habit causing pranks that some considered worthy of being a mortal sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill he was a quick ride to school.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Lyn darted down a secluded alleyway to save time, she collides with a figure Lyn's mind had not the time to process. \"Oof!!! Watch where you're going!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyn?\" the voice was familiar to Lyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Lyn saw who owned the voice. Sprawled on top of her was Ann. \"I didn't know it was you...\" Lyn giggled, scratching her head, feeling bad for being rude to one of her few friends. Ann started making gestures but Lyn didn't pay attention, instead trying to apologize. \"I was in a hurry, and I figured I'd cut through here...\" Lyn finally sees her motions, and asks, \"What, Ann?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tail.\" Ann, as it was, was one of the only people in the world besides her mom that knew she was half-dragon. She had known since they were in pre-school and Lyn showed Ann her dragonic features while on a play-date, wholly unaware of the stigma against dragons and their ilk at that age (and because her tail had gotten stiff and cramped from being bound up for so long and she wanted to give it some fresh air). Ann had told her parents, but luckily, they were progressive minded people who believe in peace and equality with dragons, so Lyn and her mom had nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when Lyn fell on her bum in the alley, her tail unfurled and became exposed, unable to stay wrapped under her skirt, a reflex Lyn couldn't control well, much like when a doctor taps your knee with those hammers and you reflexively kick. It twitches a bit on the pavement before Lyn stands up and dusts herself off. \"You know, some days, I'm just tempted to stop hiding my dragon parts and let the whole world know I'm half-dragon. My tail gets so stiff wrapped around my hips all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you want to, and I wish you could to, because your tail is kind of cute, but society is still stuck in the dark ages when it comes to human-dragon relations.\" Ann said, trying to help Lyn hide her tail again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I can't stand is how my kind, half-dragons, are supposed to be so taboo, reviled, and despised, even moreso than pureblood dragons, or pureblood humans in the old-blood dragon circles. Why am I 'forbidden?'\" This issue always got to Lyn, so much that she didn't realize her eyes were welling. She wouldn't tell anyone to their face, but the stigma of being labelled \"forbidden\" cut her to the bone, and everyone who knew her secret had figured it out from talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn saw Lyn was agitated, and knew under certain emotional stressors, she becomes more dragon-like. Crimson scales were growing on her hands and forearms, which now were tipped in deadly claws. Ann put her hands to Lyn's claws and said, \"Calm down. Let it go for now. All we can do for now is go to school. Maybe one day we can change the world, but right now, getting upset won't help anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn sobs once, then calms down, her scaled claws reverting to human hands. \"Alright... But I still don't see the point. With how corrupt our government is, do you really think one person can change anything anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all her dragonic featured hidden, Lyn and Ann continue to run for school. However, a shadowy figure saw the whole exchange. He says, \"One person can change the world, young girl. In a weeks time, on your 18th birthday, I will greet you and all will come clear. However, it will mark the start of your greatest trial...\"</span></div></div>",

Lyn was sort of glad her mom had made it back for her 18th birthday. She had missed her last three birthdays and five Christmases, and it had caused some tension, but practically told off her boss this time, telling him she was going to be home for her girl's big leap into adulthood. The phone call telling her daughter nearly floored Lyn. \"I think I'm fired!! Isn't that great!!\" were the first words from Kate over the phone. She wasn't, but her boss still wasn't pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate the lemon cake baked for Lyn, the lights went out, and an ominous wind howled through the house, despite no windows or doors being open. When the lights came on, everyone saw a cloaked, armor clad figure with green hair standing on the table. Maya, Ann's ditzy mother, without skipping a bit, sliced off a piece of cake and held it to him, asking, \"Cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange gentleman scoffed, saying, \"Do not deign bother me with your human foo... Wait, is that lemon?! Gimme!!\" He greedily takes the plate and scarfs it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continues to devour birthday cake, Ann's dad Kyle asks, \"And no one is calling the cops why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn goes, \"Seriously, I was going to ask that very question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn leans over and says in a husky half-whisper, \"I think he's a dragon in a human guise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate walks up and adds, \"Exactly. I know him too. This is Ralguul, the envoy and vassal of Lyn's deceased father, and a keeper of ancient dragon lore. I've been expecting his return since I was to part ways with my beloved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what's going on...? Mom?\" Lyn asks, mouth half full of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain.\" Ralguul says, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone gathers around, he unveils a scroll with text foreign to all eyes but his own, and Kate's. \"What's with the ancient readme file?\" Lyn jests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, I know I should get these things scanned over onto a tablet or something, but the old sages say human technology is blasphemy, so here I am, stuck hauling scroll around...\" He shakes his head around. \"Enough about that!! Back on topic here, you just turned 18, which is an important moment in a half-dragon girl's life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why the emphasis on 'girl?' Where's all the half-dragon boys on their 18th birthdays?\" Lyn snarkily comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I know, there's never been such a thing as a half-dragon boy, so when I meet one, I'll tell you.\" Ralguul counters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never?!\" Lyn exclaims, surprised by this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Anyway...</i>\" Ralguul coughs, \"When a half-dragon girl turns 18, she must perform a set of trials to determine her fate, and her form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Form?\" Lyn blurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't interrupt. As I was saying, your form as it is, where you change into a full dragon when you become emotionally agitated or stressed, but otherwise lack any real dragon powers, is really a curse put on all half-dragons by a rare coalition of bigoted pureblood human and bigoted pureblood dragons who came together only because they hated the combination of their bloodlines even more than each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The. Fuck.\" Lyn growled, scales growing up her arms, and on her cheeks, before Kate managed to calm her back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half-dragons, in their pure form, which are known as 'Ryujin,\" were beings that vastly outstripped many of the strongest human warriors and sorcerers and could shrug off most pureblood dragons claws and breaths like a mere case of of paper cuts and halitosis. It often took a cadre of great legendary humans or dragons, or both, of their time period, to stop a rogue Ryujin, but luckily, due to the rampant air or racist and religious dogma, Ryujin were few and far between. However, when Martin Luther nailed up the 95 Theses, views began to change. Change scared the old sects. As more new Ryujin were being born, a secret cabal was made to deal with the Ryujin, and further make them taboo. A curse was placed on the bloodlines of both races, changing things so all half-dragons born from there on out would be the half-dragons everyone knows full and well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if half-dragon girls could simply take a test to become Ryujin, then why bother?\" Ann asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, human!! Let me explain!!\" Ralguul barks. \"See, it's not so simple. The key to this plan was to simply never tell them about the test. See, if a half-dragon fails to take the test, or refuses to take it, they would slowly devolve over the following weeks into full dragons, but a special breed of full dragons that have lost their sentient minds, and possibly their souls, a breed of exclusive 'breeder dragons,' dragons that only think about and exist to mate, breed, and perform carnal acts with anything that has a penis, all day, everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn couldn't articulate words of rage she was so pissed, clothes starting to rip as her hair began to pull into her scalp, torso coated in scales, and her height nearing 9', but Ralguul darts her with strange potion that mellows her out before she can transform any further, reverting her back to normal, and then presses on, saying, \"That should repress your transformation ability for the next hour. I don't need you going all feral while I discuss this with you. Besides, now that you are over 18, the more you fully transform, the less you will revert and the quicker you head toward the 'breeder dragon' fate.\" Lyn looked sullen, but got the message. \"Now, the trials require you to several things to prove yourself and break the curse. At the end of the trials you will have to make a choice, but first let me cover what happens if you fail the trial. You will remain as you are, and will be allowed to take the test again once more in your life, but fail to pass the re-trial, and well, a life of being a dragon whore for you...\" He then looks deeply into Lyn's eyes and says, \"Now, once you beat the trials, you should come to two doors, according to the texts. One will rip you in two and create a human you and a dragon you, and each of you will go your separate ways, end of story. However, the goal of all half-dragons is, and should be, is the other option, to become a Ryujin, because then the curse is lifted from you, and you become what were meant to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is so special about Ryujin?\" Lyn says, arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, Like I said before, Ryujin are more powerful than either pureblood humans or dragons, possessing powers they could only dream of, powers only possible by combining the lineage of man and dragon. As a Ryujin, you could take on whole armies alone with nothing but a grin on your face. Ryujin are no longer subject to the uncontrollable transformations half-dragons experience... because Ryujin lack that power, or more importantly, don't need such a power. Other than the fact that, according to the ancient scrolls, your wingspan and tail will double in size, your visage will not change in the slightest, but your fingernails and teeth as they are now will become 25x sharper than the typical dragon claw and fangs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... So I'll have a 7' some tail?! How will I hide it?\" Lyn exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you could.\" Kate says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the interest in me becoming a Ryujin?\" Lyn asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalguul puts away the scroll and says, \"It's what your father wanted. He said he didn't want his child bound to the curse, and hoped she would the prophesied one that could one day unite man and dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unite man and dragon?! You have high hopes for me...\" Lyn scoffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was another reason the cabal neutralized the Ryujin. A prophecy said it would be a Ryujin that ended the fighting between the humans and dragons, but whether by peace or bloodshed we are not certain yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too much...\" Lyn exclaims, pacing about the room. After a moment, she finishes, \"I'll take your dumb trial, but only because I don't to become some vapid dragon bimbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalguul states, \"Agreed. I will make the preparations. I will return in five days. Make your preparations by then. Until then, continue living your life as normal...\" Just as ominously as he entered, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya says, \"Okay!! Who wants to open presents?!\"</span></div></div>",

The little dog ran off yelping in fear as Draco righted himself and looked at his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Broke my watch to,\" he muttered, \"Going to take time to undo this damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco took off his skates and slid on his shoes and started to jog in place before he got into a running position.

She heard a hard thunk behind her and she hopped it was Draco hitting a tree. Lyn opened her eyes and saw that what she had expected to be a gash to be only a large scrape, she had gotten off fairly easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked over to where Draco was she saw that there was a large scaly ball on a car's hood surrounded by broken glass. As she watched the ball unfolded and revieled its self to be two large wings belonging to Draco. Draco fluttered his wings once dislodging several shards of glass before he turned to look at Lyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your part dragon as well,\" Draco said without emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that!\" Lyn asked wondering how he had figured it out and how to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The crash tore off part of your shirt,\" Draco said simply, \"It revealed your little wings and your little tail is sticking out of your pants as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn blushed and moved her tail back into her pants but failed to think of anything to do about her wings. She jumped as something cloth hit her in the face and she pulled it off to find it to be a shirt a bit big for her but would hid her wings. She looked up and saw Draco sliding on a new shirt as well, his old one having been torn to pieces by his wings unferling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco waited until Lyn had her new shirt on then touched her forehead and Lyn felt a shock run through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lyn awoke she found she couldn't remember arriving at school or having changed her shirt.

She glanced up at her \"rescuer\". She wasn't sure if she should thank him or not. He had been the cause of her discomfort after all. She was about to say something when he turned his face away from his skates and actually looked at her. Lyn instantly blushed, Draco's sapphire eyes sparkled back at her, his long blond hair falling softly into his handsome face. <br>\r\nLike most teenage girls, she couldn't help but search for a way out of this awkward situation...guys like Draco didn't exactly bring self-confidence, and Lyn couldn't help but notice that her hair was in a wild tangle from the crazy ride to school, while he looked like his hair had been worked on by professionals for several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes searched about deperately, and she nearly sighed with relief when she saw her best guy friend, Lance, not too far away. <br>\r\n\"Um...thanks...uh...\"<br>\r\n\"Draco.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Draco. Thanks for the ride. But...I gotta go. Bye!\"<br>\r\nWith that, she bolted away, shouting for Lance to wait for her. She could hear the bell ringing, glad that it gave her an excuse for not responding to Draco's calls. She was going to be late for class....again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance grinned at Lyn, stopping when he saw her running to his side. He kissed her lightly on the cheek when she reached him and breathlessly said hello. It was odd for her to be in such a rush and a quick glance over her shoulder both shed some light on the situation and made him more confused. A teenaged guy would explain the shade of pink that graced his friend's cheek, but what exactly had happened was still in the dark. The guy looked like he wanted to say something, and was picking up his skates to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyn. What's with-\"<br>\r\n\"Don't ask. I'll explain later. Just ignore him and maybe he'll go away. Let's just get to class.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok...sure. Whatever you say.\"<br>\r\nLance and Lyn had been friends since grade 1, and he had hung out with girls enough to know that sometimes you were going to be confused. They were such complicated people. Just when he had thought that girls LIKED the attention of attractive guys...<br>\r\nHe absent-mindedly ran his fingers through his dark blond hair. It hung in curls just past his ears. He couldn't say that he was bad looking...he made sure that he was clean and well-groomed, and his facial features weren't bad, just ordinary. However, there was nobody that showed interest in him. It wasn't that he needed a fan club like some of the people in school, but one or two admirers wouldn't hurt. Even to have girls run away blushing would be nice. He knew that Lyn just thought of him as a friend, but he couldn't help but feel a bit of envy towards the stranger that could make his best friend lose her natural cool so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait up!\"<br>\r\nBoth Lyn and Lance looked back at the calling voice. It was Draco, quickly walking towards them. Lyn looked almost frightened when she saw him.

It is black and green marble with red eyes made of gemstones that look like rubies.\"Sweet!\" I exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I look at the statue's eyes, they start to glow a fiery red and I see a vision of a large gold dragon. Yelping in surprise, I drop the statue on the floor, which leaves a dent in the linoleum and rolls under the kitchen table. I hiss through my teeth and a puff of smoke rises up to the ceiling. Annoyed, I crawl under the table and retrieve the statue. I look into its eyes again, but nothing happens. \"Must be losing my mind.\" I mutter to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to look at the letter after all, I unfold the paper, which is sealed by a bit of green wax. My Mom was always a bit of a drama queen. The letter is written in her tiny, precise hand. All it gives me is an address somewhere in Spain.  I throw the letter in a drawer in my room and put the statue on top of my computer desk.
