Luffy had wandered off from the rest of the group and was in the desert behind the hotel. He was practicing some of his moves, and coming up with new ones. He shot his arm into the sand, and pulled it back. When his arm came back however, something comes up with it. Luffy, curious as to what it is, goes and looks. The little thing that came up was a small glowing ball. It was no bigger than a marble, but extremely bright. Luffy rubbed the sand off of it, and he was blinded by a huge flash. When his eyes cleared and he could see again, he was shocked. The marble that he was just holing, was now like a beach ball compared to his now tiny body. He estimated himself to be only a few inches tall. Luffy decided that he couldn't be king of the pirates, being so small. So, he needed to get some help. He looked back at the hotel room and shot his arms up to the window, and grabbed on. He shot himself up to the window, but he went a little too far. He flew past the window and onto the floor of the room. Luffy stood up, and was confused already. It was light outside, but now it is dark. He turns around and looks up, and sees a huge foot headed his way. Unfortunately, for Luffy, he doesn't have enough time to move. The giant foot crashes down on top of him. One good thing was that he was not killed. He was only stretched out, it was like stepping on a piece of gum. He then heard someone talking and then saw fingers, pulling at his body. He is rushed through the air, and is looking into the lustful face of.....</span></div></div>",

It was either rub Nami's feet or be tortured, it was obvious what the correct answer was.  \"Sigh....fine.\" Luffy said defeated.  Nami grinned, \"Excellent!\" she said as she placed Luffy on the floor.  Luffy looked up to see Nami removing her shoes.  When she finally removed her right shoe (with an audible squelch) she sighed in relief and wiggled her toes in the air.  After she'd removed her other shoe she placed her barefeet on the floor and slid them towards Luffy, propped up on their heels so he could see her soles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was immedietely hit with the awful smell of sweat,  he gagged and Nami just giggled.  \"Yeah....they really stink don't they?  I've been on my feet all day, they're all sweaty and sticky!\"   Nami said grinning.    Luffy reluctantly walked up to her right foot and started rubbing.  Her sole was shiny and glistening with sweat, and the smell was even worse up close.  As he began to rub Nami shifted her foot burying his face in her sole, Luffy screamed and started flailing his arms, his screams were drowned out by Nami's laughter.   \"I want you to sniff all the stink out of them first!\" Nami cackled.</span></div></div>",

Luffy starts to yell but his voice is so tiny it can't be heard. Luffy stays in there for 10 minutes. Nami then says, \" Luffy I'll give you one more chance but you have to do what I say or else you go back into the boot, and this time for the whole day and night.\" Luffy quivers at the thought so he listens to Nami and tries to sniff the stench out of her feet. Luffy is so small it seems to look like it's going to take him hours to finish. He realizes the smell is not going away. He then yells at Nami saying, \"Hey! The smells not coming out at all.\" She says, \u201cI know it takes an hour for one spot to come out. Luffy compares the size of his nose to her foot. \"Hey! This\u2019ll take me days maybe even a week.\" Says luffy.  Nami says calmly, \u201cI know, I\u2019m just gonna tell the crew you went on vacation for a while and you'll be back later so we can continue on. I'll just keep you in my boot and every day from now on when everyone goes to sleep your gonna work on my foot smell. Luffy becomes frightened and runs away again. Nami picks him up again and says,\" I told you what would happen if you ran away, but I'll let you go this time because I changed the punishment, now if you try to run I'll tie you to my foot and put on my boot and even though your sniffing it, it won\u2019t accomplish anything because I\u2019m wearing the boot which just generates more smell. You\u2019ll stay in there for a whole day and that means you would be wasting a day in which you could accomplish a lot. Luffy dreads at the thought and starts to smell nami\u2019s foot. Nami's just smiles as she reads a magazine. Luffy then realizes that there are 2 feet and decides that his life is officially the worst.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Going Merry was traveling slowly across the Grand Line as the the pirates slept in their rooms(and Choppers doghouse). All except for one. Zoro was training his body, swinging a massive rod with hundreds of weights upon it back and forth in order to train his speed and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Darn! Still not strong enough to swing it faster.\" Zoro stated as he attempted to swing it back and forth as fast as he could. But the end result was a speed no faster than any ordinary swordsman. Dropping the rod and weights, Zoro said down. Completly exhausted. \"I need to get stronger. I must beat Mihawk to become the best swordsman in the world.\" Zoro heaved as he let his body relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly a bright flash of light fell from the sky. Zoro looked on from afar in shock as a pillar of light came down into the ocean. \"What the-!?\" Zoro said in disbelief. 'There can only be one explanation for this! A person who ate the cursed fruit!' He thought as the pillar of light began to move. And towards the Going Merry at lightning speed. Realizing where it was heading, Zoro shouted as loud as he could \"Everyone wake-!\" But he was unable to finish as the beam completly passed through the ship, engulfing him and the bow of the ship into it. Seconds passed and the light left the bow and proceeded onwards toward whatever it's objective was. The bow of the Going Merry was completly unharmed, but something had happend to Zoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can't see!\" Zoro said as he rubbed his eyes, the bright light blinding him for several minutes. Finally he began to see colors and objects until his entire sight was back in focus. And what he was seeing shocked him. \"What in hell has happend!?\" Zoro looked on in disbelief as he saw that the entire ship was massive! 'That beam of light must have made the ship huge!' He thought as he looked on amazed. 'Or maybe I shrunk!' Looking at himself, Zoro was shocked to see that he was tiny enough to be a foot tall or less. And his clothes were gone as well! 'Great! Now what am I supposed to do?' Thinking it over, Zoro decided exactly what he needed to do. 'I know! I'll get one of the others to find out what's wrong with me!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He ran as fast as he could towards the cabins, treading dangerous steps and rocking barrels. Even though he was small, he was able to move as fast as any ordinary man thanks to all his training. Arriving outside the cabin doors; Zoro began to think of how to get inside 'Now how do I get in?' He thought as he looked up at the door knob. 'I could jump, but I'd probably wouldn't reach it by at least a foot.' Thinking it over, he noticed that one of the door knobs were turning. And exiting the cabin was...</span></div></div>",

Come in!\" A rusty voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled at the young man sitting behind the counter of the little shop she had found. \"Hello.\" She said, as she looked around the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer and the crew had come to a new island in the New World, and she was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a rather peaceful one with a relaxed little town on it. After having to fight their way here all throughout the previous islands of the New World, this idyllic village was a welcome change of pace. So it only made sense that the crew would split up and go exploring on their own and, despite Sanji's protests, Robin had gone off on her own and ended up here, a lone little shop of trinkets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much for this one?\" Robin asked, holding up a rather plain, but chic, looking dark bracelet. She thought it looked nice with her little black dress and white hat, the same ones she had worn to Dressrosa some time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that one?\" The shopkeeper looked at the item, having to quickly look away from Robin as he did. He blushed as he answered, \"Uh, h-hold on...\" He then went into the back of the store to look it up, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin brushed it off, she was used to being stared at. It was a pain sometimes, but only really ever when she'd been recognized as a member of the Straw Hat crew. Robin hoped now wasn't one of those times. Thankfully, however, she hadn't seen a single wanted poster of herself on the island. Though it was odd for to recall that now, as now that she thought about it, there were posters for the rest of the crew, just not her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Robin could ponder about that any further, the shopkeeper returned, and put a mirror up on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to see it on yourself first, ma, ma'am?\" He stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes. Thank you.\" Robin said with a warm smile. She put the bracelet on and held up her arm in the mirror. It was pretty, she thought, but now the price. \"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, just, um, forget about that one. Something like this might be more your, er, style?\" The shopkeeper held up another accessory for Robin to look at, a little necklace. \"Or, eh, just forget about forgetting about it, and take them both for, hmm, one hundred berries? H-How's that sound?\" The man seemed to want to make a sale, but his nervousness was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin chuckled at the young man's display, but then smiled as she took a good look at the necklace he was holding. It was a small, green jeweled necklace with five jewels at the bottom, with the middle one a little larger than the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her interest in it, the shopkeeper handed Robin the necklace, his hands shaking a little bit as he did. Robin paid it no mind and simply put it on, and posed some in the mirror, looking at it from various angle. She had to admit, it did look rather nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lovely. I think I'll take them both.\" Robin said, handing the clerk the money. Buying into such a cheap ploy wasn't something that she usually did, but buying something sporadically felt good at times, as she'd come to realize in this second half of the grand line, with Nami's help and insistence for her to treat herself, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, ma'am, can't I interest you in anything else?\" The man asked. He pulled some more trinkets out for her to look at. \"This here is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you. I really must be going now.\" Robin cut him off. He just stared back at her, fumbling with another piece of jewelry, as if he was trying to think of something to say to get her to stay. But Robin simply smiled at him and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, er...\" Robin could hear the man behind the counter stammer. But she paid him no real mind and kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again.\" Robin said as she reached out to open the door and leave. But as she did, she noticed something odd. Her hand missed the doorknob she was about to grab. The raven-haired archeologist felt foolish for a moment, then tried again, this time grabbing a hold of the thing. She wanted to just leave then and there, but now she thought that her eyes seemed to be playing tricks on her, as it looked like the door was larger then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin blinked her eyes to try and adjust to whatever was causing this. But when she opened them again, the door seemed to be even bigger, and not only that, it seemed to be creeping upwards at an increasingly fast pace. Robin gasped as everything around her grew exponentially larger, inadvertently letting go of the door to cover her mouth as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's going on here? Could this be an enemy's trap, or...</i> Robin wondered, already about piecing together the morbid answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin turned around and saw that the whole store was getting bigger all around her. But, Robin wasn't even sure that such a thing was possible, except for a possible devil fruit power. But then again, what use would it be for a power user to grow this store? Unless, Robin reasoned as the answer clicked in her head and she understood what had happened, she had shrunk, and by the looks of things, she was still shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh dear, who would've thought that I'd meet my end by being shrunken by an enemy I never saw coming...</i> Robin thought as she continued to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready the incredible shrinking Robin was only about a foot tall. She realized her situation was a bad one, as she was now far to small to escape the store, but she remained as calm and collected as ever, never even stepping into a fighting pose even as her height dropped further. Instead, she simply turned back around to confirm her suspicions. The door was indeed too big for her to ever even think about opening now, yet she was still too large herself to crawl under the gap below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could wait a while to see if I shrink enough to get out from under the door. Hmm, but I might end up shrinking into nothingness before I can get any help...</i> Robin contemplated her options in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast!\" A loud voice shouted. Robin turned around quickly to look for the source of it, but before she could, she felt something huge pick her up, then cover her in darkness. For a brief moment she felt herself get whisked up into the air, then the hand holding her opened up and she could that it was the nervous shopkeeper who had picked her up. His seemingly defining trait held true as he held Robin, with his hand shaking nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled to himself as he stared down at her miniature form with a look that was a mix between disbelief, and glee. It was a look that confused even Robin, and she wasn't quite sure what to make of it, not that she really had time to make anything of anything yet. But right now this young man was the only person there, and she wanted to know if he would help her or not...</span></div></div>",

Dirty blond hair that flowed neatly to just below his shoulders, and dark, narrow eyes that seemed to shine whenever he looked at her. A little pudgy, he had been tall before she shrank, rivaling even her former height, but he was a relative giant to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the man was just continuing to stare down at her, with an almost hungry look. It made Robin a little nervous, but with her powers at her disposal, she wasn't too afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the way the man was practically ogling her tiny form, Robin decided to try and get help from him. He was, after all, the only one there, and since he already had her literally in his hands, she felt she really had no other choice but to take the chance. She just hoped that Chopper would be able to help her return to her rightful size later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you have to help me.

He literally shook with anticipation as he threw his head back to laugh louder, causing Robin to stumble and have to hold onto the man's thumb for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Careful!\" Robin yelled, getting irate with the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You don't get it, do you?\" He asked, looking down at Robin. \"I just shrank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Robin just stared up at the giant incredulously, though in the back of her mind she had a feeling that it was the case. Inwardly, she cursed herself for being so foolish at to trust the creep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! I'm a size man! My name is Runt Bigelow!\" The man introduced himself, then he pulled little Robin up closer to his face to get a better look at her. Robin, for her part, had to try hard to keep herself from gagging as his foul breath washed over her whole body. \"But, you can just call me... M-Master..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin groaned at the giant's suggestion. \"What is the meaning of this?!\" She demanded to know. Her voice was firm, but she knew that, holding onto the man's giant thumb for dear life, she didn't look the least bit threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Robin... Nico Robin...\" Runt sighed. \"Let me show you something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gulped as the man started to carry her back to the counter. She worried about what the man who wanted her to call him \"Master\" had in store for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the counter, he laid his hand down for her to get off. It struck Robin as odd that he'd let her go free from his grasp if he wanted to do something bad to her, but she accepted the chance and stepped down onto the hardwood counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, I'll be right back.\" Runt told her as he circled around the counter and then bent down to look for something inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone on the counter, Robin thought now would be a good time to escape, only, it struck her just now how small she had become. The accessories the shopkeeper had tried to sell her before were still there, ones that could easily fit on her before, but now magnified to gigantic size at her reduced perspective. Robin walked over to one of the rings and crouched down beside it, almost absentmindedly, and touched it. It was about half her size now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could wear this ring like belt, almost...</i> Robin thought. She wasn't sure, but she guessed that she couldn't be more than three inches tall now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't worried though, she had ample time to escape right now. So she got up and looked for an escape route. But, before she could do anything, the giant's hand came back down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah!\" Runt said. He quickly turned the shrunken Robin around so she was facing him. \"Not so fast, my little prize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was a little disoriented from being spun so quickly, but recovered and saw that the shopkeeper was now holding up some wanted posters, of her. He put the posters down on the counter, then dropped down to pull out some more, then repeated this action again and again. Robin gasped and watched in horror as the man, clearly a demented stalker of sorts, pulled laid out dozens of her wanted posters. The shrunken archeologist realized now that this man was the reason that there were no wanted posters of her in town, the deranged fan of hers must've been collecting them for himself, and Robin could only imagine what for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my lovely little Robin...\" Runt said softly as he organized the last of the posters together neatly. \"I've been a fan of yours for a very long time. It's so nice to finally meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared down at Robin as he spoke, though his tone was calm, Robin was nevertheless shaken by his admission. She worried about what she had just gotten herself into by coming into the man's store. Not able to spend another minute with the man, Robin ran off, not sure of where she could go, the drop from the counter was a fatal one at her height, but she had to try something, anything to get away from her insane \"fan\"...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately for the shrunken archeologist she didn't get very far as she was blocked by a massive glass wall slamming down in front of her, stopping her in her tracks. Robin looked up and saw that she had been put under a common drinking glass. She tested the toughness of the glass by beating on it, but it had no give. Robin could see that the shopkeeper was quite pleased with where he had her, and decided to try and distract the giant for long enough for her to plan her escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're a Devil Fruit user?\" Robin asked, surprised by her own calmness in her voice. It wasn't often that she could be caught off guard and almost helpless like this, but in this rare instance, she was, and it terrified her, though she tried not to let that show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right. I ate the Size-Size Fruit, and became a size man.\" Runt explained. \"But you have to understand, I did it for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I find that hard to believe.\" Robin said. She genuinely had no clue what the shopkeeper was talking about. But having no idea what the man's true intentions for her were made her more than a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since I saw your wanted poster, I've been a fan. I've followed you and your crews adventures up until this point.\" Runt admitted, holding up one of the posters for emphasis. \"So when I heard you were getting closer to this island, I was ecstatic, you see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And how does that help me?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted you so bad!\" Runt near shouted in response. Robin nearly flinched from the outburst. \"But I knew I could never have you, at least, that's what I thought anyway. But today you confirmed it when you shut me down after I just tried to give you a deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just wanted to sell me jun-\" Robin started to say, but was cut off by Runt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME TIME TO EXPLAIN!\" Runt shouted. This time, Robin was visibly shook by his outburst. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.!\" Runt apologized, dropped the poster and \"cuddling\" Robin's glass prison. Robin backed into the wall of her prison as the giant's hands blocked out all light for a moment, before letting up and revealing the giant's heaving face, now just in front of her field of view. Robin gasped at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Runt started up again, breathing in heavily. \"I found it! I found a Devil Fruit that would help me keep you as mine, forever! Man, what a deal that was!\" Runt looked pleased with himself as he seemed to recall the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was still shocked by the giant's sporadic attitude, but still able to piece together that the giant shopkeeper must've gotten a Devil Fruit as part of a trade somehow and ate it for the sole purpose of shrinking her down to be his little pet forever. If there was any doubt in her mind that the man had any sanity at all, it was erased now. The shopkeeper was psychotic and obsessed with her, and she knew, more then ever, that she had to get away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that I have you... Right. Where. I. Want. You...\" Runt poked on the glass containing Robin with each word, making her lose her balance and fall onto the wooden counter. \"I'm not letting you go...\" Runt said, sounding almost exhausted as he sighed the words out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gulped as the insane giant's rant went on. She'd never have guessed coming into this little shop in this otherwise peaceful village would spell her doom. But here she was, shrunk to mere inches tall and trapped under an ordinary glass by a demented giant that wanted to keep her like this for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was terrifying, to say the least, but Robin wasn't giving up just yet. She still had her powers, so she could still escape. However, now wasn't the right time, she reasoned, as the giant was sure to just catch her again. She needed to bide her time and plan her escape, then she could find her crew, anyone would do, and they'd help her return to normal, preferably after beating the shopkeeper to a pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, she could only wait, and hope that the giant would drop his guard soon...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh!\" Runt suddenly spoke, sounding as if he'd just remembered something very important. He shot up straight and took a quick glance at the front door of the store. He grinned warmly, then turned to Robin and said, \"Closing time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunt left Robin alone while he closed shop for the day, leaving the reduced pirate to her thoughts. His sudden shift from menacing overlord watching over Robin's every move, back to a mousey shopkeeper was a jarring transition for the shrunken woman to behold. Something about it made his earlier actions make a little more sense, though, Robin thought. If he was able to keep up the helpful, but quiet, proprietor of the store act up before just to cover up his darker true self, then it was understandable that she'd been caught in his trap so easily. Not that she ever wanted to admit such foolishness in hindsight, but just knowing this man was capable of such trickery made her feel a little better about being tricked by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was determined to not fall for any of Runt's tricks again. So she took the time he'd inadvertently given her to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Robin again tried to lift her glass prison up, but again to no avail. It wasn't an especially large glass by normal means, but to Robin's 3-inch scale and adjusted strength, it might as well have been like trying to lift Impel Down up from the ocean floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin grunted and let go of the glass. Even if she used her devil fruit powers it wasn't likely to help much, as her sprouted limbs were only as strong as she was. She'd have to try something else, she knew. Robin noticed the little slack the glass gave when she tried to lift it, and figured that maybe pushing it instead would be the way out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlexing her arms, Robin braced herself to move the glass that was nearly twice her current little height. Minuscule hands on the cold glass, Robin pushed with all her might and, to some surprise, she found that she was able to scoot the glass a little bit. Robin smiled, thinking she'd finally have some semblance of hope soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken woman pushed again, harder this time, and the glass neared the edge of the counter. One more push and she'd be able to drop the glass prison and escape. The only problem was that her captor would no doubt hear the glass shatter on the floor below, and she'd again be in trouble of being captured. But Robin wasn't concerned with that too much, she just wanted out, and she knew that if she were fast enough, she'd be able to get down from this accursed counter and hide, hopefully long enough to escape the creep entirely and get help from her crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Robin gave the glass a final, strong push, and sure enough, it fell. Robin reacted quickly and ducked down to avoid being taken out with the backside of the glass. The next thing she knew, the glass hit the floor below and shattered on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the..!?\" Came a distant shout from Runt. Already Robin could hear the giant man's footsteps coming back to her, and she knew she'd have to move fast if she wanted to make a clean getaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin got up as fast as she could and prepared to use her devil fruit powers to create a \"ladder\" of limbs to help her get down, then, once on the floor she'd hide and get out of the store. She folded her arms across her chest as usual and prepared to sprout her escape route...</span></div></div>",

Robin gasped and opened her eyes. She gasped again, but this time in horror, as she saw the large form of Runt standing over her, grinning creepily down at her helpless, shrunken state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no...\" He wagged his finger at the miniature beauty. \"That's not going to work in my store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What did you do to me?\" Robin asked, shocked by the fear in her own voice. It wasn't often she'd be caught completely off guard like this, but in the rare instances she was, it was only because she was afraid it was a hopeless situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious!? I took your powers away! Si za za!\" Runt laughed at Robin's reaction. He reached down and scooped the 3-inch tall woman into his hand, closing it around her, and blocking her from seeing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin gulped. Her situation had just gone from bad to worse. She'd already been shrunk, but now she was learning that this man had somehow taken away the use of her devil fruit powers. But Robin couldn't figure out how that was possible, as far as she knew there was no way it'd be possible without the use of sea prism stone, and since the man was a devil fruit user himself, that wasn't likely to her. Unless the size size fruit also somehow granted her captor the ability to remove her powers, it made no sense to the increasingly terrified tiny brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was wracked with possibilities, and reworking her thinking of how to better escape from this store without use of her powers, all while she rode uncomfortably in the giant's huge, sweaty fist. He had the upper hand on her, quite literally, the whole time. But she wasn't about to give up, even without her powers she'd make it out of here, 3 inches tall or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes seemed to pass during the ride, until finally she was tossed by Runt onto another hard surface. Tiny Robin rolled out onto the new room, but a moment later crashed into a soft wall. Robin was a little disorientated from all the movement. She rubbed her head and tried to recollect herself. She looked behind herself to see what she ran into, and nearly screamed when she saw it was her captor's giant hand, apparently 'softening' the blow of being tossed about like some unwanted toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Sorry, my little Robin pet!\" Runt cooed apologetically. Robin groaned inwardly, he might not have thought of her as a toy, but a pet was just as bad in her mind. \"Are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin quickly backed away from the giant hand and scurried into a corner. She got a look around the room, from what she could tell it looked like the back of the store and it was filled with product and some crates, but it also seemed to double as a bedroom for the owner. She was on a desk of some sort, maybe one that the man used to do his inventory or something like that, judging from the myriad of papers and pen and pencil holders. Runt was sitting down in a chair looking down at her. She shouted at him, \"What did you do to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... You're good. I'm glad I didn't hurt you!\" Runt sighed in relief, seemingly genuinely worried for Robin's well-being. \"Sorry for the rough landing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shook her head, she didn't want the man's twisted care. \"What did you do to me? How did you take my powers away?\" She repeated frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" Runt chuckled smugly. He seemed to take joy in having outsmarted his beloved Robin. \"It was pretty simple actually. Sea prism stone. You see?\" He pointed to the watch on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Robin a second to realize that his motion was meant to infer to her about the bracelet he'd given her earlier. Robin gasped in stunned realization as she looked at her seemingly normal bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I put the stone in there. Then I used my size size powers to shrink it to a more manageable size. Did you know that if you shrink something with my powers, it gets weaker? That's why you weren't able to feel its effects right away...\" Runt then chuckled to himself again, smacking his forehead playfully. \"Oh, of course you know that, judging from your time under that glass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin just glared up at the giant. She felt close to tears by this point, but after he'd revealed his secret to her, she thought of something. Robin quickly pulled at the bracelet on her arm and tried to take it off, but before she could she heard the man scream,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Size Size Reduce!\" Suddenly a beam of light shot out and struck the bracelet Robin was wearing. It instantly shrank down on her arm, becoming a tight fit, and making removing it near impossible. Robin gasped and tugged at the bracelet some more, but it was no use, it was way too small and tight for to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si za za!\" Runt cackled. \"How do you like that, fits nicely, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at the giant defiantly, and tried again and again to get off the accursed bracelet, but it was impossible. Robin eventually gave up and collapsed to her knees. She started to tear up, things were looking increasingly hopeless for her, and now she learned that she'd been powerless to fight back almost since she walked in. Whoever this creep of an owner was, he'd obviously been planned her abduction for quite some time, and was taking great joy in finally reducing and humiliating her. Robin sobbed.</span></div></div>",

Ever since the dark-haired archaeologist had joined the crew, she had been dying to get into a situation like this with her.  Well, not quite like this.  Now that the two of them were alone and in the buff, it was only a matter of time before Robin would be hers.  But, for the moment, she decided to put on her timid face.  Half-heartedly, she covered her womanly parts with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it!  How the heck did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin, who was modestly covering herself, looked up into the foliage above them, which now seemed miles high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, Miss Navigator, but I think I saw some sort of light shoot down from those trees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami boldly stepped forward, disregarding her \"modesty\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's as good a place to start as any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she began leisurely walking towards the treecover.  Robin blushed.  Something about seeing the Navigator's naked ass jiggling as it swayed back and forth was making her horny.  Quickly, she followed Nami's lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she led, Nami noticed a small puddle of water in the forest.  She had noticed it before, while they were still searching for firewood, but took little notice of it.  Now, at their new proportions, it looked just perfect for skinny-dipping!  At that point, Robin pointed out a set of tracks with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look there, Miss Navigator.  These tracks could be from whoever shrunk us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami noted with glee that Robin was becoming more comfortable with her body.

Yuudia smiled at them. \"Well what do ya want?\" \"MEAT!\" Yuudia just chuckled and gently put his hand on the floor for them to climb onto. Tashigi was still looking about nervously, but when the others got into the giant's palm, she quickly followed. Yuudia slowly stood up, so that he would not cause them to fall. When Vivi nearly lost her balance, he quickly told her and Nami to get into his other hand and sit down. This made it more stable and things worked better. They went to the main part of the home and Yuudia set them on a table. He then began to look around for some dried meat, becasue there was no fresh. He found it and set it on the table. \"Well, how are you gonna eat all of that?\" Yuudia asked. The meat was about as big as his hand so it was pretty large to the shrunken people. Luffy just grinned, and began to eat. Yuudia had to let the girls have a different piece of the meat because Luffy had eaten the other bit.

The group drew and the results were in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a red,\u201d Luffy says with a smile as he jumps around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m going as well,\u201d Nami sighs as she puts her and hand on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be joining you,\u201d Robin says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I\u2019m staying here,\u201d Usopp says as Chopper nods. Sanji was disappointed for not going on the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you go, let me fix you some lunch boxes.\u201d Sanji says as he went to the kitchen. Later Sanji came out with three lunch boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Sanji!\u201d Luffy says as he grabs the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all for you!\u201d Sanji yells as Nami says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be going now. Take care of the ship Sanji,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will Nami!\u201d Sanji says in a charming manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, Nami and Robin got in the Mini Merry II. The group made it to the island quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get exploring,\u201d Luffy says with a smile as Robin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Luffy,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be careful,\u201d Nami says as the group starts to move. The group kept on moving until they saw a blue block. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Ponegliff,\u201d Nami states as Robin went over to the Ponegliff. Robin started to read the Ponegliff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy sat the lunches down and looks around for anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if there\u2019s a treasure around here,\u201d Luffy says and Nami\u2019s eye\u2019s light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll join you. Let\u2019s look,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy nods and two start to look around the Ponegliff. Robin on the hand was reading it but found nothing of real interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much to this Ponegliff. The only thing it keeps on saying is you must be the right size to fit though the hole to get to the treasure,\u201d Robin thought as she tried to figure it out. Robin\u2019s reading was cut short when she heard a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin turns around to see Luffy and Nami looking a treasure chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook what we found Robin. There\u2019s got to be a lot of treasure,\u201d Nami says as Robin smiles at the comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s open and see what it is,\u201d Luffy says as he uses his strength to open it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chest shines a bright light and blinds them. The light was making the group smaller and smaller until they hit the mark of three inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the group gets their sight back they see\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Went and saw a sky island. Even stood up against the world government. Even meet a perverted talking skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Straw Hat crew was heading to a new island. It seems like the crew needed to get supplies before they went to mermaid island. Luffy was about to argue with Nami until he found out they were out of food. So when the group got to the tropical island, they split up. Zoro and Franky went to get supplies for the ship. Sanji, Usopp, and Chopper went to get food and medical supplies (After Sanji cried about not being with one of the girls). Naim, Robin, and Vivi along with Luffy tried to find anything that would help them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still need to find out more about the Mermaid island first,\" Nami explain as the orange hair maiden looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true Navigater,' Robin said as the black hair women wonder what kind of history it would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder it will be nice place,\" Vivi said as she looked at some of the jewels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we could be there now,\" Luffy said as he notice someone in a cloak that motion for Luffy to come froward. Luffy went over there from just seeing that the cloak person had a cool crystal orb. The Straw Hat women notice this and followed Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wish to find Mermaid island?\" The cloak person said as it turn out to be old women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. can you tell us how to get there?\" Nami asked as the old women asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you willing to risk your lives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We want to see Mermaid island really bad. So can you tell us how to get there Antie?\" Luffy asked with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if you have any information, please tell us,\" Robin said as Vivi added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old women had a smile on her face as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have sail a longs way. But first you need something to breath, but the cost will be unrighteous. So let's do this,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four Straw Hats watched as the old women made noise until the old women soon put dust on the four Straw Hats. Robin as shocked seem like it was not a worry as the dust seemed to do nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you wake up, Go south with the boat,\"  The old women said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean-\" Nami began until the orange hair maiden felt her eyes closed. So did the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy woke up frist worried about his friends but saw they were alright, then he check for his hat and saw that it was on his head. Luffy notice that the world was huge. There was a boat that was big enough for the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW! Everything looks huge,\" Luffy yelled as it woke up the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls saw that everything was big.

Soon the three woman felt a cool breeze. Nami and Vivi blushed harder as they tried to cover them selves.

Luffy rubbed the sore spot where Nami had hit him. Luffy then had a good view of Nami. Nami had a very attractive body.

That old lady said to take the boat and go south,\" Luffy said as he looked at Vivi. Vivi was attractive maiden as well. Vivi's breast were not as big as Nami or Robin's but they still had the perky part. Vivi also had nice curves as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way.

Nami and Viv wonder why Luffy's hat shrunk with him and their clothes did not. The two then notice how well built Luffy was. Luffy was well built and his manhood was somewhat hard to miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what should we do now?\" Robin asked as he notice the two girls looking at Luffy. Robin felt the same way, but could keep her looks to the captain hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do what that Lady told us!\" Luffy yelled with a smile. Nami looked at Luffy was about to argue. But stop and wonder where they were. They could be a different island away from the others.

The ship was about the right size, but at a closer look the ship was a bit bigger then the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the group got the ship, the shrunken naked group noticed they only reached up to a lower part the handle.

Nami hit Luffy and told him not to eat the food as they don't know how long they would be out in sea with them selves being shrunk and naked.

The ship even had a working oven and sink as Vivi turn them on and quickly turn them off from the fear her smaller size and could not turn them off.

Vivi blushed a bit as Nami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that Luffy doesn't care?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami thought it was just the curiosity that made Luffy peep on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know,\" Robin said with a smile still on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami sighed but thought about to see if Luffy would have the same reaction as the Alabasta baths.</span></div></div>",

Luffy sees that Nami is wearing a green bikini along with jeans. Robin is wearing that purple with pink sash and Boa is wearing her usual red clothes. Luffy pulls him up and sits Indian style as the three woman give him space, though Hancock would have loved to hug him she knew it wasn't the right time. Luffy looks around and sees that he and the three woman are on a tropical island. Luffy looks confuse as the last thing he remembers happening is being the the Thousand Sunny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's going on?\" Luffy asks as he stands up and wipes away the sand on his shorts. \"Where are we and why is Hancock here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said my name!\" Hancock thought with a warm smile on her face. The princess snake princess would jump for joy but right now it's not the time for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you not remember?\" Nami asks her captain, not believing that he could forget what happened two hours ago. Luffy gives another confuse look to Nami and the Navigator then answers. \"Luffy we were blown off the thousand sunny when were about to start a party,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's right,\" Robin adds as well. \"Do you remember now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy then moves his hand to his chin and grasp his chin with his index finger and with thumb pointing up  closes his eyes and tries to remember what happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a few days since the Straw Hat crew left Fish-Man Island, everyone is doing their routine schedule. Zoro is training with weights in the trainer room, Ussop is watering the plants on the ship, Sanji is thinking about what to make for Lunch for everyone, Nami is recording what they have seen on their journey on one of her maps, Chopper is making sure he still has supplies of bandages and medicine, Robin is reading a book in the library room of the thousand sunny, Franky is sailing the ship as always, Brooking is in the nest singing to him self and lastly the captain of the Straw Hats is sitting on his special seat looking quite bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's boring right now. I thought there would be something cool once we enter the new world,\" Luffy says to himself as he lies down on the Sunny's head. \"When are we going to have another big adventure?\" Luffy asks himself as he is about to look at the skies until he hears Brook's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a ship near by!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy gets up after hearing this and starts to look for it as his crew stops what they are doing as they run outside ready to fight with Franky still sailing the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the ship Brook!\" Nami yells the musical skeleton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just north of here,\" Brook yells back as he jumps down to join the others on the main deck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look and see a ship is a basic galleon with a pink mansion structure in the middle. Paddle-wheels are installed on the stern in exchange of a rudder, and instead of a figurehead, two Yuda are tied to the front, where they steer the ship. Luffy then looks up the sails and recognizes it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! It's Hancock and her crew!\" Luffy shouts as he gets a better look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the snake princess Hancock?\" Sanji asks as his eyes start to take the form of hearts. It's true while he was in hell and while Luffy was in heaven he also remembers that the Kuja pirates also help them out last time and got a glance at the most beautiful woman in world Boa Hancock. The cook felt like he turn stone insistently at just seeing her. Now he would be able to see in person now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be careful Sanji,\" Chopper thought as the cook suffered enough from the lost of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain that's the same person in charge of Amazon Lily the island filled with woman correct? Brook asks the straw hat young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep the same one! They had great food there!\" Luffy comments as he remembers the meal he had the island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course you remember that,\" Usopp comments at the rubber man, he knew that Luffy is simple but he thought that at least Luffy would have talked about a girl he thought was beautiful or something during the two years. Then again the captain was a different island that was close the island filled with woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope some of them are strong,\" Zoro smirks at the thought of fighting one of their strongest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would also like to meet this Snake Princess as well,\" Robin adds as with a smile. The older woman must thank Boa for helping their captain during his most emotional break down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're going to let them board,\" Nami comments on everyone being excitement about the Kuja pirates. \"Franky stop the ship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUPER! I can' wait either,\" Franky shouts as he sets anchor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the Kuja Pirate's ship to stop and put out a board onto the sunny. It didn't take long the Kuja pirates to step onto the sunny and start to have question with the men folk. Boa's sister Marigold and Sandersonia had told their crewmates to let Boa talk to Luffy first since it's been a couple of days since Boa had seen him. So while Straw Hat crew and Kuja are having talks with each other, Sanji taking glances at the all the woman and could take his eyes off of Aphelandra, the tallest of the Kuja Pirates.  \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoas closer to where Luffy is and sees that he is near the railing along with a orange hair woman and raven haired woman. Apparently the captain was complaining about Sanji not listening to him to cook up a awesome feast. The raven hair woman, who is chuckling right now at Luffy is close to her age while the orange hair woman is closer to Luffy's age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this must be Nami and Robin that he mentioned,\" Boa thought as she remembers Luffy telling her about his crew. Boa had sketched Nami and Robin's name in her mind since they were the only woman on Luffy's crew and she wanted to know more about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Luffy let Sanji meet everyone else,\" Nami said as the captain pouts as he looks at the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we gotta have a celebration! We're meeting an good friend,\" Luffy said as Hancock stops in tracks and starts to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He thinks were old friends!\" Boa thought as she starts to run towards the rubber man wanting to give him a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Nami eyes widen and is about to yell something but it's too late and storm hits them! Everyone tries to grab something to hang onto as the storm is so strong that it lifts the anchors on the ships as well! In a matter of minutes the ships were flying backwards. But unkown to the two crews on the ships, Luffy, Nami, Robin and Boa were all blown off the ship and to the sea water, luckily for the devil fruit users Nami still had her Clima-Tact and turn it into the boa form and is able to hold Luffy, Robin and Boa up with it. Devil's luck is once again on their side as Nami sees an unknown island and soon they wash up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yeah!\" Luffy shouts as he opens his eyes as the woman are happy to see that he remembers. \"We're not going to get any of Sanji's food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the women give out a sight while Boa feels bad about Luffy not eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy! That's the problem right now!\" Nami shouts at her captain. \"We're stranded on island that's not on any map of seen,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're on a mystery island?\" Luffy asks as he starts to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually yes,\" Nami answers her captain this would be the one time he would be correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're all I think we should explore our surroundings,\" Robin suggest to the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good. We should split up as well,\" Boa adds as wanting to be alone with Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Nami agreeing with the idea while Luffy is jumping up and down from the aspect of going on adventure. Nami then continues to talk. \"Luffy and I will go left and you two go right. We'll meet back up in thirty minutes,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why do you get to go with Luffy?\" Boa asks as she tries to gives Nami a glace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone needs to watch him,\" Nami responds back. \"Plus I have the best chance of getting back here with him in thirty minutes,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Boa could respond Robin is able to speak quicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright miss snake princess.

Before Nami could tell say anything to Luffy her own stomach starts to growl. The orange woman sighs as it looks like both Luffy and herself are thinking the same thing. Nami then looks and sees some yellow round fruit growing on one of the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy let's try out that fruit,\" Nami said as she points towards the tropical jungle side with the bushes that are growing the yellow fruit. \"That will at least stop our stomach's from growing,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me!\" Luffy exclaims, really liking Nami's idea. Soon the two walk towards the bush and both pick up the yellow round fruit and put it in their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this taste realy good,\" Luffy said as he chews the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It's has the right flavor of sweetness in it,\" Nami adds after finishing her fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Luffy and Nami could take another bite of the yellow round fruit, the two become sleepy soon lie down on each other and start to sleep.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ughh.. What happened?\" Nami asked herself as she rubbed her eyes open from her nap. She remembered landing on a strange island and falling asleep after eating some fruit with Luffy. But now, as she looked around, she couldn't tell where she was, or see any sign of Luffy for that matter. The grass was huge, and so was the bushes around. The bushes had what looked like gigantic fruit on them, and Nami couldn't help but feel like she had seen it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the..?\" Nami asked, wide-eyed as she saw her huge surroundings. The sheer size of everything was nearly giving her vertigo so she looked and to collect her thoughts, and then she saw that she was naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAAHH!\" Nami cried, and instinctively covered herself. \"What happened to my clothes!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her answer when she saw what appeared to be her green bikini top and blue jeans below her, but they were huge now and she felt like a tiny little thing standing on top of them. Then it clicked for the navigator, the huge plants and fruit and her now way oversized clothes, she must've shrunk somehow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, Nami, don't freak out! Don't freak out!</i> She thought to herself. She started walking backwards over her giant clothes absentmindedly and nearly tripped over them before touching the ground beneath. She caught herself and looked behind herself and saw a beetle, the size of a large dog! Nami gasped and tried to stay calm, but when the bug scuttled into her tiny, nude form, Nami lost it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAGHH!\" Nami cried. The shrunken woman threw her hands and up and ran away from the giant insect. Meanwhile, the innocent creature simply scurried off into the grass, frightened by the tiny woman's cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWIth tears comically flowing down her face, the tiny and terrified Nami ran across her oversized clothing, not watching where she was going. She bumped into some rubbery and fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Nami groaned, rubbing her head. She looked up and saw that it was her captain, Luffy, who she had run into. \"Luffy..?\" She called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nami!\" Luffy shouted gleefully. He had just gotten up himself and had been looking around his newly expanded surroundings. Luffy offered Nami his hand, which she gratefully accepted. When Nami got to her feet she took sighed in relief that Luffy was, and then decided to explain the situation to her captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy, listen, we shrunk somehow.\" Nami explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. No kidding.\" Luffy said with a big grin on his face. Nami thought his reaction to their shared prediciment was a little odd, but didn't may it much mind and instead went on to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I know that this is-\" Nami tried to say, but was interrupted by Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so cool!\" Luffy exclaimed with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha!?\" Nami was astonished at Luffy seemingly enjoying being so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this cool, Nami?!\" Luffy asked her. The smile that stretched from ear-to-ear never leaving his face. He reached out and grabbed Nami's shoulder, as if to encourage her to be excited about their shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! We're only like six inches tall now!\" Nami shouted, annoyed by her captain's behavior. She knocked Luffy's hand off of her shoulder, then she gasped, having remembered her nudity while in the motion. \"And we're naked!\" Nami cried, and immediately covered her front with her hands, and backing away from Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.\" Luffy apologized, blushing and turning away from Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was Nami in the nude now, Luffy was almost just as naked as her. Except for his signature straw hat, which had mysteriously shrunk with the rubber man. Luffy didn't mind himself being seen naked in front of Nami though, and was just turning away for the sake of her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a minute...\" Nami started slowly. She took a step towards Luffy. \"Your hat didn't shrink! What's that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Luffy murmured, touching the base of his straw hat. \"Oh yeah, I guess it didn't. Weird, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Like any of this makes sense anyway.\" Nami said. She noticed Luffy was still looking away from her. She smiled a little, happy that her captain was respecting her modesty. With a sly grin and a glimmer in her eyes, she lowered her arms and told him, \"You can look if you want, Luffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy gulped, and slowly turned around to face Nami. He felt his face turn even redder as he saw her. She was just standing there, letting herself be seen by him. If Luffy had been more like a certain perverse cook, he might've had a nose-bleed right then and there. But instead, he just wanted to tell her how good she looked, even if it wasn't exactly appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nami, you're beauti-\" Luffy started to tell her his feelings, but Nami suddenly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... For one million berries, that is!\" Nami told Luffy seductively, and rubbed her fingers together to signify money. Luffy nearly fell over upon hearing Nami's ridiculous amount, he stood shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One million berries! You're kidding me!\" Luffy cried. Nami shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! You've seen it, now you're going to have to pay up!\" Nami said slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you tricked me!\" Luffy whined. Nami grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I don't expect the money right now, so I'll wait until we're back to the ship!\" She told Luffy, blushing a little despite herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy hung his head, thinking that he'd have to pay off his navigator now, while Nami laughed at her successful play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seriously, Luffy. We need to figure out what caused us to shrink and how we can grow back to our normal sizes!\" Nami said. Luffy huffed, still feeling burned, but nodded his agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shrunken pirates didn't have much time to think about anything else afterwards though, as next...</span></div></div>",

Nami was happy to see that despite what happen two years ago Luffy was still Luffy, She and along with her crew mates were happy to their captain again after two years, the navigator didn't really have to think about that since they were in rush to get to Fishman Island. Since Nami is on Luffy's back she could feel that Luffy had gotten a bit muscular, the orange woman smiles it felt nice to hold to Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this isn't to bad,\" Nami thought, while still holding onto Luffy, though she wished that both of them didn't get shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy happily continue to swing using the giant tree limbs, despite Nami being greedy he is enjoying his time being with her.  It's been while since he was able to go on adventure on a new island with his friends so he was making sure to enjoy himself. Despite that Luffy is happy to see that Nami was still the same that she ever was and was still able to smile, he was able to see how strong she become when they had that fight Fishman Island. He knew that Nami didn't liking being shrunk but maybe they'll find some treasure and that will cheer up and be happy that they shrunk. Though despite being shrunken, Luffy could feel that some of Nami is still quite larger to him and they were pressing against his back. Luffy didn't quite understand himself but he like having Nami being on his back. The Straw Hat captain just chuckles and then just thinks about about having an adventure on this mystery island that makes you smaller. </span></div></div>",

They hope that Hancock would not die from love sickness. Aparantly the reason for Margret coming along was because of Luffy telling Hancock that Margret wanted to come to sea with Hancock's crew. Hancock listen and told her crew to let Margret on. The female crew was following Luffy's paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who you will find?\" Marget asked Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

The bird started to fly away and went over the island. The bird was flying back to a ship that held two people. A nineteen year old boy and eighteen year old girl. The boy had bright brown hair, wore a blue shirt with a white over shirt, black shorts, wore black frame glasses,and with wooden sandals. The girl had short black hair with black shirt, white skirt with black shorts, and with brown shoes. The girl looked at the bird and listen to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like people are on the island we live on,'\" The girl said with a stern face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they are nice people,\" The boy said with a smile on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuuto, you reallly can't trust these people. The bird says they are pirates,\" The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michiko, maybe they'll be gone tomorrow when we get back home,\" Yuuto replied, but notice that Mickiko gave the bird a ball. The bird flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you give to the bird?\" Yuuto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little bit of experiment that can shrink anything to a smaller size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think that a bit much-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks we can't be too safe. Don't worry as the shrinking smell will ware off tomorrow and the ones who will be affect by it will be the people that the drop it on and their crew who inhale any smell on the group will be shrunk as well. Don't worry we'll return them to normal when we get home and the only thing they have to worry about is a tattoo that last for a long time disappear. We'll be back next morning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really just want to use it......\" Yuuto thought as the bird was out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird flew over Luffy and the others and drop the ball. Luffy and the others looked and saw a small ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Luffy asked as the ball got in the middle of the group in mid air and let out a gas. The group inhale it and cough.
