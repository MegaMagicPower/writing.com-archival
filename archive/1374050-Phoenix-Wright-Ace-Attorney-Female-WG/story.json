However, it was early in the morning and, remembering what Phoenix had said about having to watch her weight, Maya knew there was no way she could satisfy her hungry desires now. Climbing out of bed, she got dressed and headed into the kitchen (?) of Wright &amp; Co. Offices, where Phoenix was sitting at the table eating cereal and reading the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting her belly and groaning in hunger, Maya failed to notice that she now had a slight buldge where a flat stomach once resided. 'Maybe I should lay off the burgers for a while...it's for my own good...' Maya thought as she gloomingly looked for something to eat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maya went over to the stove and scrambled some eggs and but some toast in the toaster.  This needs a little something\u2026bacon!  Bacon is great with eggs and toast. She rummaged through the fridge for bacon and sizzled some.  We still have a box of pancake mix, which would be easy to fix.  Then there\u2019s milk and orange juice, and I could cook up some hash browns for Pearly.  Nick\u2019s eating cereal, which might be good too.  Peanut butter and jam for the toast.  Where\u2019s the syrup? <br>\r\n\tA few minutes later Maya covered the table with a complete continental breakfast.  \u201cI\u2019d thought I\u2019d cook breakfast today, Nick.  Where\u2019s Pearly?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Phoenix looked at the feast laid out before him.  \u201cThat was a great idea, Maya, but Pearly was going back to Kurain this weekend for some training.  I just wanted to eat quickly, because we have a new case today.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally?  What is it?\u201d  Maya sat down and ate the food hurriedly.  Phoenix didn\u2019t notice because he was looking over the case file he was starting.<br>\r\n\t\u201cA woman was murdered in a supermarket yesterday.  Our client was seen at the scene of the crime.  After we meet him at the Detention Center we can check out the crime scene and interview any witnesses.  I\u2019ll just get some of your sister\u2019s files that might help us here.\u201d<br>\r\n\tWhen Phoenix left the kitchen Maya started eating faster.  Better finish this before we leave, wouldn\u2019t wan to spoil it.  After the last pancake was eaten and the milk from her cereal drained, Maya sat back and sighed with pure pleasure.<br>\r\n\tPhoenix was surprised when he came back in and saw the empty plates.  \u201cWhoa, Maya, you keep eating that fast and you\u2019ll outgrow your acolyte clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cHa ha,\u201d Maya cringed.  Her stomach was getting bloated from the speed at which she had eaten breakfast.  She secretly loosened her sash a bit as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTheir client at the Detention Center was a geeky looking man with ridiculous glasses named F. A. Feedem.  Throughout the interview he kept nervously looking around, as if he thought people were watching him.  \u201cDid you kill the victim, Shelly Ulite?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo-o!\u201d Feedem stammered.  \u201cI-I was just looking for her when I found here lying in that aisle.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooking for her?  Did you know the victim?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cY-yeah, just a little. I had seen her earlier in the supermarket when I was shopping and I tried to catch her attention, but I lost her for a while.  The next time I found her she was\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlright, Mr. Feedem, we\u2019ll just investigate the crime scene now.  If I may ask, what does F. A. stand for?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy name\u2019s Fredrick Alfred Feedem, but I found F. A. to be a shorter and easier nickname.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTen minutes later Phoenix and Maya walked into the supermarket where the crime took place.  With Phoenix\u2019s attorney badge, they were able to get into an aisle that was roped off: the snack food aisle.<br>\r\n\t\u201cMan, that\u2019s a really big chalk line\u2026\u201d Maya said.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.  The victim was 21-year-old Shelly Ulite.  She was rather overweight.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wonder why she was killed.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s what we need to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Something caught Phoenix's attention immediately when he began investigating. An unopened can of Coca-Cola standing upright only one inch away from the body outline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd... What's this doing here?\" Phoenix looked around, but there wasn't any soda anywhere in the isle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, I thought you hated soda!\" Maya had shouted in pure surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, there's a difference between 'hate' and 'dislike'. Two, I'm looking at it because it's evidence. This can was just sitting upright next to the body, meaning that if it wasn't knocked over when the victim fell, it was placed here after the murder was committed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya then spoke her own two cents, much to Phoenix's dismay, \"One, if it was placed there after the murder, I don't see how it's important. Two, nobody cares about the difference between 'dislike' and 'hate'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if the can was placed here after the victim was killed, then the killer probably was probably trying to loot the corpse. Why else would they had left it behind, unless they needed a free hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But couldn't have one of the police officers have left it?\" Maya suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The police may have made mistakes regarding who they've arrested in the past... But I'm pretty sure they know not to leave their drinks at a crime scene, Maya!\" Phoenix was louder then he needed to be, but he can't help but get frustrated when Maya comes up with theories like that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Please stop yelling Nick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Soda Can added to the Court Record*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think there's something over there at the end of the isle...\" Phoenix started squinting his eyes, trying to tell if he isn't just seeing things that aren't there, but he went over to it once he was certain. It fit perfectly into his hand and was made of clear glass. \"Why is this in a supermarket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a 'SUPER' market Nick! Of course it has things you wouldn't find in a normal one!\" Maya chimed in cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"It looks Maya's brain still hasn't woken up yet today...\") Phoenix couldn't help but sigh in his own mind. (It's absolutely stainless, not a drop of blood on it. Not to mention it's made of glass, so it would break incredibly easily. This means it couldn't be the murder weapon, but how does relate to the murder? I doubt it's here just by coincidence.\") <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Glass Ball added to the Court Record*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like there really isn't anything left that the police hadn't already taken back for forensics analysis, so perhaps we should go ask around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Look at all the food we haven't investigated yet!\" Maya had a ravenous look on her face despite having eaten a massive breakfast not too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... We're leaving Maya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Checkout Lane #3 ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like only one of the cashiers are here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LISTEN, OKAY?! IF YOU'RE HERE TO PURCHASE, I'M KIND OF BUSY DOING EVERYTHING ELSE!!!\" The man was absolutely furious, grinding his teeth to the point where enamel be seen being turned to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um... We're not here to buy. I'm Mr. Feedum's lawyer, Phoenix Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Nick, I wanted to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Maya!\" Phoenix turned his head at a speed that seriously is a contender for the world record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're here to ask what I know, don't. I wasn't scheduled to work here yesterday, so I didn't come.\" The cashier was more depresses then angry now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't here yesterday, yet you're here today?\" Phoenix was rather curious as to why he was here. You'd assume a market would be closed if a murder investigation was underway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the manager hates me, that's why! She said I have to come in today and do all the work by myself since she didn't too many people around to distract the police from their job! Why not just wait until they're gone?!\" Once again, the man began grinding his teeth to breaking point. \"Now I have to count up yesterday's profits, mop up all the floors other than the crime scene, and sort every single item in the entire store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you must be pretty good at your job if the manager has so much confidence in your ability to do all that by yourself in one day!\" Phoenix had stated in order to try and calm him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well... I guess that could be it.\" It seemed that Phoenix's idea had worked... For now at least. \"My name is Pape Arplast; I'm twenty years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mr. Arplast, you said that you didn't have work during the day that the murder had occurred, but did you know the victim?\" Phoenix hoped that perhaps knowing some background knowledge on the victim could establish a new lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know her? KNOW HER?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"... Dang it\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE'S HERE, SHE COMES TO MY REGESTER!! NOT ONCE DOES SHE EVER GO TO A DIFFERENT ONE!! EVEN WHEN MY LINE IS CLUTTERED WITH A DIFFERENT LANE HAVING NOBODY THERE BUT THE CASHIER, SHE TAKES HER TIME IN LINE JUST TO MAKE MY DAY EVEN WORSE!! EVERY SINGLE TIME, SHE FLIRTS WITH ME AND IT GROSSES ME OUT TO THE POINT WHERE I SPENT A WHOLE HOUR IN THE SHOWER WHEN I GET HOME!!\" Pape had become even more enraged then before... Which was quite a feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So I'm guessing you know her?\" Phoenix could water a garden with the sweat he had produced during that sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know her, but I wish that I didn't.\" It appeared that Pape had completely burned himself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking Nick?\" Maya noticed just deep in thought Phoenix had just suddenly become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears that Pape has a motive... But he couldn't commit the murder if he wasn't here.\" Phoenix began thinking again. \"... Pape, is the supermarket manager you mentioned here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she was being questioned by that detective, but they might be done with that by now.\" Pape is still really winded after that burst of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your time Pape. Time to head for the supermarket manager's office.\" Phoenix started walking towards the manager's office, with Maya following behind.</span></div></div>",

This certainly wasn't what I was expecting it to look like...\" Phoenix looked around, seeing more mystical items than just he had seen even during his visit to Kurain Village. \"I... Didn't think a supermarket manager would so into the occult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's nice to see some variety!\" Maya was definitely happy to see that someone else in town was into the paranormal, though she certainly wasn't expecting it to be the manager of the local supermarket. \"All you do is space out when I want to talk about it, Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk about it sometimes? All I ever hear is 'BUUURGEEEERS! NICK I WANT BURGERS NOWWWW!'\" Phoenix was simply joking, though Maya unfortunately didn't see through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Do I really sound like that?\" Maya started to tear up just a little bit, but both her and Phoenix were then interrupted by a woman wearing the supermarket's employee uniform. She was 28 years old with long black hair, and pearl earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I foresaw your arrival. You are Nick 'Phoenix' Wright, and Maya Fey, yes?\" Phoenix and Maya stood there shocked for a moment before she continued. \"I am Fiora Tune, and I manage this store you are currently investigating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um... I'd introduce myself, but you already know our names... somehow...\" Phoenix didn't know how to respond to this woman. \"S-So... Um... Ah! Could I... ask why you have all of these mystical items in your office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I have a gift Mr. Wright. I am able to foresee the future. I foresaw your arrival, I foresaw what would bring in new customers, and I foresee that you will finish questioning me and leave my office at exactly 1:28:56 PM. I believe that the spirits are leading me to a path of success with the ability they have gifted me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Phoenix wasn't any less confused, but at least he has a chance at learning new information from her. \"Could you tell me when you first became aware of the murder that had occurred?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday at 3 PM, I was alerted by one of the employees, Ina Stockwell. She's a junior in high school who recently I recently hired as a grocery stocker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, your gift foresaw her as an asset to the supermarket?\" Phoenix still had a hard time believing that Ms. Tune had the ability to foresee the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is the case. Normally someone requires a high school diploma before they can get a job as a stocker, but I knew because of my gift that she was better then any high school graduate in this city.\" Ms. Tune didn't even look at Phoenix and Maya while she was talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"I think that might be illegal...\") \"So about when she had reported to you...\" Phoenix was hoping to snap her back into reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. She had thought the victim was merely unconscious since the victim was collapsed on the ground with all the blood being covered by her head. After she lead me to the scene and I had realized what she did not, I told her to go call the police. That is basically all that had happened from my perspective. If you want all the details, you would have to talk with Ina. She should be in the storeroom.\" Fiora finally looked back towards Phoenix and Maya after she finished her explanation with a piercing glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yeah, thank you.\" Phoenix felt like the temperature had suddenly dropped ten degrees when he locked eyes with Fiora's glare. \"We talked with another employee before talking with you. Pape Arplast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pape is bar none my best employee. He is always on time, never makes mistakes, never has a single facial hair on his face, and never questions me no matter what request I may ask of him. I did not even need my gift to tell that he would be a fantastic addition. All I needed to do was look into his green eyes.\" Once again, Fiora turned her head and spaced out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really appreciate Mr. Arplast that much?\" Phoenix was certainly interested. He never heard a boss praise an employee this strongly before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is the best employee I've ever had. Although he does anger issues, they should no longer be restrictive for him.\" Phoenix's attention was immediately caught by that one sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by 'no longer'? Has he started taking anxiety medication?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it is because of murder. Pape had a seething hatred of the victim. I hate to say something so heartless, but I'm thankful that she is gone myself.\" Phoenix and Maya both reacted to Fiora's statement as anyone would after hearing someone say something along those lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Fiora just said really struck a chord with Maya especially. \"Hey! Why would anyone say that? Just because you'd admit that you'd hate to say that, doesn't make it any less horrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, and apologize. However, if that woman had come to this supermarket any longer, I fear Pape would have finally snapped and quit. I would do anything to keep my best employee from leaving, so I'm glad things worked out the way that they did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"Anything?\") Phoenix couldn't help but consider Fiora Tune a suspect after hearing that bit. All Phoenix could do for now though is transition to a different topic. \"Miss Tune, I was wondering... Did you actually ask Pape to do all of today's work all by himself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I personally asked him to come today and handle any work that had to be done today.\" It was subtle, but Fiora had proud tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... why? I don't think it would too much of an issue if there were more employees around during the investigation; in fact, it would tighten the credibility of any witnesses that are going to appear in court if their accounts match up. It just seems ridiculous to ask one employee to do the work of dozens.\" Phoenix couldn't help but find Fiora's reasoning strange... Even for someone who claims to be capable of predicting the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust him above everyone else on staff. I asked him to do it by himself because I know he'd do it perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix still wasn't satisfied with Fiora's answer though. \"So the reason you asked Pape to do it by himself was because he'd do it perfectly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mr. Wright, that is my reason. Are you satisfied now?\" Fiora began to do her intimidating glare once again, but that didn't stop the iron chains from appearing between her and Phoenix, followed by two red padlocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"Psyche-Locks...\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your time Fiora!\" Despite Fiora's comment regarding the victim, Maya seemed to get over it rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is fine, but before you go, could you tell me what time it is right now?\" Fiora oddly doesn't seem to have a clock in her office...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nick, let me see your watch!\" Maya gripped Phoenix's arm and pulled it, causing Phoenix to suffer sudden pain in his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Ow! Dang it Maya! It's... 1:28 PM... Wh-What?! You don't even have a clock in here!\" Phoenix was even more shocked then he was when Fiora's had guessed their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiora had formed a small smirk on her face. \"I can foresee many things Mr. Wright, like I foresee the outcome at tomorrow's trial. I won't spoil the ending though, that would ruin the rest of it.\" Fiora then walked past them, out of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that was weird.\" Phoenix just hoped this would be the weirdest it would be for a while, since he didn't think that he could take much more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey Nick, I'm starving! Can we take a break from investigating and go get a bite to eat? The grocery stocker is probably still being interviewed anyways!\" Maya as always was thinking about food, so Phoenix knew he had to get her something to eat if he didn't want her to keep bugging him about the entire rest of the investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I guess. Where, pray tell, did you have in mind?\" (Please don't be expensive... Please don't be expensive... Please don't be expensive...)</span></div></div>",

I've been waiting all day for a hamburger and I'm not letting this chance pass by!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouble Beef Burger isn't as expensive as you'd think it'd be for having \"Double the Beef\", but it isn't cheap either. But Phoenix also knew that \"Double the Beef\" also meant twice as filling, so maybe he wouldn't have to buy dinner for Maya later. \"Alright, Double Beef Burger it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Double Beef Burger ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burger time!!\" Maya burst through the door of the fast food place, unable to wait to completely gorge on burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was reluctant to step inside, knowing that his poor wallet was about to receive a drastic liposuction, but he knew that the longer he waited in that doorway, the hungrier Maya would get. He walked towards the counter, fearing the worst from Maya's appetite. \"Alright, what do you want Maya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I-\" Maya was about to list off two of everything on the menu, but she was interrupted by an employee on the other side of the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Phoenix Wright? I wasn't expecting to see you here!\" What immediately caught Phoenix and Maya's attention about the man at the counter in front of them was his hairnets. He had a big one that was used to cover the long brown hair that went down to his shoulders, but there was also one on his chin. The man had a beard that was also covered by a hairnet, this one having two straps that hung on his ears. He also had a deep voice that was so relaxed that it sounded like this man wouldn't even mind if the apocalypse happened. \"Let me guess; you heard of our famous Mega Burger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Do I know you?\" Phoenix was confused by how the man was addressing him. He was talking as if the two of them knew each other, but Phoenix was certain he had never met this man before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I know you, man! You're Phoenix Wright, the famous lawyer! Name's Sherman Allgood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, but I don't really think I'm famous.\" Sherman certainly could have overheard some things from customers about Phoenix, but he really doubted he was such a hot topic at a fast food place to be interpreted as famous. \"I've turned multiple cases around before, but that's only because the evidence led the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Modesty. I respect that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Well, at least he seems like a nice guy.) \"So Sherman, how did you learn about me? A lawyer isn't exactly someone you normally hear people talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherman yawned, his mouth forming a bigger smile than before when it was done. \"I'm a pretty social guy; I like talking to customers. Some of them happened to end up in the court audience during some of your cases. I've heard a lot of positive.\" Sherman is the type of guy who prefers listening to others' problems, so when he does talk, he gets straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix knew that what Sherman was saying was possible, but it still wasn't coherent. \"I'm glad to hear that, but I don't think that lawyers are something that people just talk about in a fast food place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Sherman yawned before talking. \"Conversations just flow from one topic to another sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sighed. Sherman didn't detail his explanation as much as Phoenix would have preferred. (Unfortunately, I don't think this topic is going anywhere past this point.) \"So have you heard about the murder that happened yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've heard; why are you asking? Did you take the case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherman didn't yawn this time, which told Phoenix that he might be able to get a conversation out of this topic. \"Yes I did, but I'm taking a break from the investigation since one the key witnesses is being interviewed right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. You know, the victim and defendant were both loyal customers here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I wasn't expecting that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherman chuckled a bit. \"Yup. Shelly Ulite was quite big on the Mega Burger; that one is famous for a reason! As for Fredrick Feedums, he usually only orders a drink; he mostly just comes here to observe the lady customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix raised an eyebrow out of curiosity. \"Observe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Fredrick is quite the fan of a lot of the female customers that come here. By the way, how did you learn of Fredrick's case? I've talked to him a few times, and he's told me that he prefers to avoid people unless he's coming here, so it doesn't seem likely you were asked by a friend of his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Phoenix was confused as to what Sherman meant by \"fan\", he decided it wasn't worth pursuing; besides, it would be rude to not answer Sherman's question. \"I was woken up this morning by a phone call from Fredrick's mother, Clair Feedums. She was in a panic since she had just learned that her son was arrested on the charge of murder, so she wanted me to defend him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see.\" Sherman chuckled again. Another employee then walked up to Sherman from behind, and whispered something into his ear. Sherman then turned to the other employee and grabbed something out of the other employee's hand. \"Oh, here's your wallet back Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" Phoenix reached into his pocket; his wallet wasn't in there. \"H-How did that guy get my wallet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That friend of yours gave it to him after she got her order to go. She left while we were talking.\" Sherman wore the same smile he had the whole time, not aware that what he said would horrify Phoenix even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix swiftly grabbed his wallet. \"W-Why does it feel so much lighter?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see the receipt for the food your friend got... Twelve Mega Burgers, ten X-Large Fries, three orders of Onion Rings, and five X-Large Sodas, which adds up to a total of two hundred dollars... plus tax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's face drained of color. He turned around and dashed towards the door in order to go find Maya so he could chew her out. Phoenix was still running when the door swung open, smacking him hard in the head. Before he lost consciousness, Phoenix heard the person who accidentally hit him with the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh drat! Sorry about that Pal!\"</span></div></div>",

Phoenix couldn't remember how he ended up falling unconscious; he didn't even remember anything after meeting Sherman Allgood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pal! You're awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix turned his head and was met with a familiar scruffy detective. \"Detective Gumshoe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see I didn't hit hard enough to make you forget me!\" The detective's expression changed to a frown as he scratched the back of his head. \"Um... Sorry about that, by the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Phoenix's head was still in pain, he decided that it wasn't worth holding it against the detective. \"It's fine, Detective. What are you even doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we finally finished all the witness interviews, so I thought I'd celebrate with a mega burger! I've heard those things are pretty good, and since this place is just down the street from the crime scene, I thought I'd give one a try!\" Thanks to Phoenix's forgiveness, Gumshoe was able to cheer up quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I told you things are famous!\" Both Phoenix and Gumshoe looked over and saw Sherman Allgood at the counter with the same relaxed expression as before. \"Glad to see you're alright by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sherman.\" Phoenix turned back to Detective Gumshoe. (However, I should ask Detective Gumshoe a few questions about the investigation before I leave.) \"So Detective Gumshoe, you said that the interviews with all the witnesses were finished, is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right pal! We finished interviewing the stocker girl just before I came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the investigation itself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it right there, Pal!\" Gumshoe quickly tensed up, causing Phoenix to jump a bit. \"I'm not helping you out this time!...\" Like before, Gumshoe's expression changed to a more depressed one as he scratched the back of his head. \"Well, um... I suppose I could at least give you something. Considering you've forgiven me for knocking you out earlier.\" Detective Gumshoe pulled a photograph out of a pocket on his trench coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix took a close look at the photo that Detective Gumshoe had given him. \"A photo of the crime scene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for future reference.\" Gumshoe seemed to be really remorseful about his outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crime Photo added to the Court Record*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Pal. It's just that the prosecutor in charge of the case is making us all be even more careful when it comes to revealing information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The prosecutor in charge of the case?) \"Hey Detective Gumshoe. Who exactly is in charge of the prosecution in this case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe went into deep thought for a brief second. \"...Well, I suppose telling you that isn't a big deal. The prosecutor you'll be facing tomorrow is-\"</span></div></div>",

Oh! Now that I think about, I didn't even ask if you had taken the case, I just assumed. Whenever I'm assigned a case, you're almost always the defense attorney!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought about what Detective Gumshoe just said, (Now that I also think about it, Gumshoe is almost always the detective in the cases I end up taking. Weird coincidence.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix pulled out the photograph of the crime scene that Detective Gumshoe gave him, \"Detective, you said that this photograph would be for 'future reference'. What did you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That photograph is the most important piece of evidence in this case. It's gonna be a big point of discussion in the trial tomorrow. Take a look at the victim.\" Gumshoe pointed at the body in the photo, \"Notice how there's no blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked carefully around the corpse within the photograph, \"... Not a single trace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally if a corpse isn't bleeding, that would suggest they died of strangulation or poisoning. But no, the victim died from <span class=\"cborange\">loss of blood.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" (The state of the crime scene contradicts the cause of death...), \"So the body was moved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the most likely explanation, but we've yet to make any headway.\" Gumshoe said glumly, \"We've searched the entire supermarket, yet found not a single trace of blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the murder was committed somewhere else entirely? Then why move it to a busy supermarket full of potential witnesses?\" Phoenix thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention all of the cashiers at the front, who the killer would have to pass by in order to reach the aisle where they left the body.\" Gumshoe sounded terribly pessimistic about finding possible breakthroughs. \"Where the victim died could make or break this case, so take some time to think about possibilities, okay, Pal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Detective Gumshoe. I'll try to figure out where the true crime scene was.\" After thanking Gumshoe, Phoenix thought about the new information he was told, (This case is more confusing than first impressions led me to believe.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Pal...\" Gumshoe interrupted, \"Where's Maya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Phoenix's eyes darted around the room. He had completely forgotten about Maya; getting hit on the head does that to you, \"I didn't realize she wasn't here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she with you when you came here?\" Gumshoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure she was...\" Phoenix rubbed his throbbing forehead, as if that would help him remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll let you know if I see her Pal. I've stayed here too long; I need to get back to the precinct. See ya Pal! Also, sorry again about your headache.\" Gumshoe then left after waving goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix tried to remember, but to no avail, (When did Maya leave?) He turned his head and saw Sherman Allgood still at the counter, relaxing since business was slowing down. Phoenix walked over to the counter to ask Sherman about Maya, \"Hey Sherman, can I talk to you about something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Sherman turned his gaze towards Phoenix, \"Yeah man; Ask away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there a girl with me when I originally walked in here? Wore weird violet and white clothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why? Did that bump on your head mess up your memory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix became embarrassed, \"This wouldn't the first time it happened...\" Ironically, this brought back bad memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherman laughed, \"Don't worry about it man. But yeah, your friend was here; she left just before that detective came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she by any chance mention where she was going?\" Although it didn't seem likely that Maya would mention that to a cashier, it wouldn't hurt to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherman scratched his head, \"No, but from what I know about fast food, people typically head back to their place when they get takeout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix cocked his head, confused, \"Wait, she got take out? But I was the only one with money out of the two of us...\"  Phoenix then came to a disheartening realization. He quickly pulled out his wallet, and looked inside to see two-hundred dollars missing, \"Did she really just spent two-hundred dollars on fast food?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus tax.\" Sherman couldn't help but chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's face drained of color, and he dashed for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherman quickly responded, \"Slow down! Someone might-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's face was suddenly met with pain for a second time as the door opened. \"Sorry for interrupting, Pal! I forgot my-...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoenix opened the door to his office and looked around, trying to find Maya. At first he didn't see her, but he did see take-out bags scattered on the food, all empty. Phoenix sighed, \"She steals my money, and then she leaves me to clean up what she bought with it.\" As Phoenix walked over to clean up the mess that Maya had left behind, he discovered that she was sound asleep on the couch, just hidden by its back. He then saw where all the missing food ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix held his free hand over his face as he groaned because he didn't want to look. He already knew that Maya is a glutton, but this was too much. Maya had eaten herself into a food coma. Maya's gut was a large mound of flesh, still taut due to digesting such an absurd amount of fast-food being a heavy burden for her body. Her robes just barely managed to constrain it from bursting out onto display, but it was still blatantly noticeable. In contrast, the rest of her body barely plumped up at all yet due to the previously mentioned issue with digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that Phoenix was already in a bad mood, but he couldn't afford to wait for Maya to wake up. There were still several things left to investigate before the day ended, and time seemed to be moving faster than it usually does. He quickly jotted down a note explaining that he came back to the office, but left again, using the excuse that he should try to meet with the stocker girl before she leaves the supermarket to go home. Phoenix continued to hold the ice pack to his head as he left, as the pain had just gotten worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">***Future Mart: Checkout Lane #3***</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Phoenix had failed to realize that he didn't know where the stocker girl was, or even what she looked like, his best option was to ask one of the other employees he met. Although this was where they met earlier, Phoenix didn't see Pape anywhere, meaning he probably finished counting up the supermarket's profits from yesterday, and went to work on another job he was given by Fiora. Phoenix glanced over at the door to the Fiora's office, which was currently locked tight like the pair of psyche-locks around her heart, (I actually forgot about Ms. Tune's secret. Hopefully I'll have time to look into it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this left Phoenix with no lead to follow, so he resorted to wandering around the supermarket in hopes of finding the stocker by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">***Future Mart: Baked Goods Center***</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter practically searching the entire supermarket, Phoenix ended up in the Baked Goods Center in the back, next to the aisle where the body was found. This was the only place Phoenix hadn't searched yet, so if the stocker girl was still in the supermarket, she would have to be here. Phoenix scanned the area, seeing all the variety of different pastries in display cases. There was also plenty of ingredients for baking on the shelves near the crime scene, although Phoenix noticed a gap between items while looking, (Hm?) Upon closer inspection, Phoenix saw there was baking soda farther back on that part of the shelf, but one box was missing, causing the gap that caught his attention, (That's odd...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA teenage girl casually approached Phoenix from behind while he was focusing on the baking soda. She had straight medium-length hair that was brown like her eyes, and was clad in the supermarket employee uniform. She crossed her arms in aggravation before speaking in a bored tone, \"Sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Phoenix was surprised the girl's sudden appearance, \"W-Where did you come from? This place was empty a moment ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not important, now might I ask what you're doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix, still recovering from the shock, replied immediately, \"Um, I'm investigating the murder that occurred here yesterday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl loudly groaned, \"Oh great, that means I have to repeat what I saw agaaaaain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Phoenix then came to a conclusion that was obvious in hindsight, \"So you're the stocker who saw the defendant flee the crime scene? Ina Stockwell, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIna sighed, and then answered Phoenix, \"Yeah, whatever, can we make this quick, I'd like to finish some time today.\" She then tilted her head to rest it on her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix didn't want to waste Ina's time, but he had a hard time focusing because something caught his attention...</span></div></div>",

You can\u2019t go around eating food from a supermarket.\u201d  But Maya wasn\u2019t paying attention.

Wadda ya think you\u2019re doing?\u201d  Detective Gumshoe came running over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEeekk!\u201d  Maya was so scared she swallowed the rest of the tarts and almost choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t go eating stuff in a supermarket without paying for it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee Maya, even Detective Gumshoe knows not to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t especially eat stuff here.  This is the crime scene, for Pete\u2019s sake!  You could be contaminating the evidence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry,\u201d Maya said.  \u201cI just thought it would be cool to grab something while the supermarket was closed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGumshoe chuckled.  \u201cIt\u2019s true the rest of the supermarket is closed.  We just felt that this was the only aisle that needed to be investigated.  So you can\u2019t eat anything in this aisle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing in this aisle?  Then\u2026Whoo-hoo! We have ourselves a loophole.  Come on Nick, free food!\u201d  She ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPhoenix winced to the sound of Maya tearing open boxes of cookies in the next aisle.  \u201cNice going, Gumshoe.  I think you just let the kid loose in the candy store\u2026and by \u2018kid\u2019 I mean \u2018bull\u2019 and by \u2018candy store\u2019 I mean \u2018china shop.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGumshoe looked downcast.  \u201cYeah, I know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what evidence have you gathered so far?  Do you know how the victim was killed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope.  The body didn\u2019t have any bruises or wounds on it, so it wasn\u2019t by physical means.  We won\u2019t know for sure until an autopsy is done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIsn\u2019t there any footage on the store cameras?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSupermarket\u2019s been having electrical troubles since yesterday.  The cameras weren\u2019t working yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAny witness?  I mean, why kill someone in a super market?  There are dozens of potential witnesses to see you do the horrendous deed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe crime was committed in the slowest part of the day.  There were only a few people here, including staff, the victim, and two witnesses who might have seen something.  We got the defendant picked up \u2018cause he was acting all suspicious.  On a hunch, we took his fingerprints and found they matched prints found on the floor right next to the body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat\u2019s not really enough to make a cause against Feedem yet, Phoenix thought.  And there\u2019s a good chance the victim wasn\u2019t killed in a struggle.  I have to find out more information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho are the witnesses?\u201d  Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere are only a few of them.  They were working in the area around the supermarket since before the crime occurred.  Street vendors, I think.  We\u2019ve already talked with them, but they didn\u2019t see anything too important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I should talk with them.  Now I just have to deal with Miss Competitive Eater over here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPhoenix found Maya in the next aisle over.  She had made quite a dent in the cookie shelf.  She was stuffing brownies down her throat.  Crumbs covered her robe, which looked a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGeez, Maya, what\u2019s your problem today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m just hungry, Nick.  I missed dinner last night because I was up working with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHow is that my fault?  She misses one square meal a day and suddenly she eats like she survived through a famine!  I guess it\u2019s from all those times she\u2019s been kidnapped and almost starved to death.  \u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here and talk to witnesses before you get us in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI knew you would always come back for my squid wheels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPhoenix flinched when a pink lunchbox was thrust into his face.  \u201cAngel Starr!

Where else would I sell lunches?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho is she, Nick?\u201d Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh that\u2019s right, Maya.  Miss Star was a witness in a case I had when you went back to your hometown to pick up your duties.  Did you witness the murder that took place in the supermarket yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.  I was just getting some fresh ingredients and dropped off a lunch for one of my boyfriends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne of my boyfriends?

But which to have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can tell you\u2019re the hungry type,\u201d Miss Star smiled.  \u201cIf you\u2019re interested, I have my special \u2018Ten Lunchbox Hungry Man\u2019 set.  Ten lunches and appetizers put together at an affordable price.  Ten pounds of my most fattening food to fill up those hungry tummies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds great!\u201d Maya said.  \u201cWanna split, Nick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, I\u2019m not hungry.  Um\u2026how much do I owe you, Miss Star?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about that, we\u2019re old friends!  However, I just might ask for a favor in the future.  You\u2019ll help me, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPhoenix gulped. \u201cCould I ask you a few questions, Miss Star?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaya went over to a park bench and opened the tower of lunchbox\u2019s she had gotten.  The lunches were stuffed with some of her favorites like macaroni and cheese, fish \u2018n\u2019 chips, pizza and chicken nuggets.  While Phoenix interviewed Angel Star, Maya ate with abandon.

Although I haven\u2019t been able to sell any with all the police presence here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you know about the crime, then?  Did you see anything at the supermarket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.  I just went there to get some more ketchup and mustard.  I didn\u2019t see anything on my way out, but as I was walking away this really geeky looking guy ran past me in a panic.  Say Nick, want a picture?  I could paint you a portrait as you pose with a half eaten Samurai Dog, wiping mustard off your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo thanks, Larry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh come on, Nick,\u201d Maya said.  \u201cGive the guy a break.

As Phoenix tried to get a strait answer out of Larry, the spirit medium continued to eat hotdog after hotdog. She was skilled at adding toppings so that each frankfurter was a different experience. Ketchup with mustard. Mustard only. Ketchup with cheese sauce. Chili and sauerkraut. Sauerkraut with onions and pickle relish. And one brave attempt of every topping at once. Oblivious to the amount of sausages she was consuming, Maya ate her way through every possible topping combination she could think of\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen Larry and Phoenix looked back in Maya\u2019s direction minutes later, they were in for quite the shock. The surface of Larry\u2019s cart was a Jackson Pollock of spilled condiments. No bun or wiener had survived Maya\u2019s onslaught. The gluttonous girl herself had her cheeks and hands painted with every possible edible hue. There were also stains on her noticeably looser sash. Her middle looked thicker too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLarry surveyed the bratwurst carnage. \u201cHot dang, Maya!

I happen to know you\u2019re the biggest eater in Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices! How did you manage to eat every single corndog?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHotdogs, Nick. Seriously.\u201d Maya rolled her eyes. \u201cI was just trying some variation. The next time you eat hotdogs you should try pink and blue sauce instead of just having it plain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBlue sauce?\u201d Larry repeated. He walked over to the back of the cart in order to open the bottom drawer. \u201cAhhhhhh! My paint! Those weren\u2019t condiments, Maya, that was PAINT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Maya\u2019s large mouth dropped open, revealing the disgusting, partially digested remnants of her hot dog dinner.

Maya felt as she had been starved for weeks on end, the poor hot dogs from Larry's stand completely erased from her mind, if not her bulging midsection. She couldn't help but nod in response to the dark figure's question, almost salivating from her sudden desperate need for food. It wasn't every time she got kidnapped that she got fed, she wanted to make the most out of a bad situation. The figure chuckled, the same thin fingers sliding over her cheek to slip a tube between her awaiting lips, a strap fixed gently, but firmly, about her face to keep it in position. Too hungry to care about the dire situation she was in, the fact this stranger was going to do something to her that had <i>killed</i> another young woman, or even about Nick, Maya eagerly awaited for what would come out of the promising tube. The stranger clearly picked up on her eagerness, a dark chuckle leaving him as a low whirring filled the silence of the room, a thick and creamy mixture being pumped along the see-through tubing to the awaiting spirit medium's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tasted like nothing she had ever tasted before in her life, sweet and refreshing, with a tang to keep it from being sickly. It was thick, filling, and any resistance the dark haired girl had, vanished all together the moment it settled into her stomach. Maya moaned about the tubing, the mixture tasted so good, and felt even better in her previously painfully swollen stomach, this just seemed to ease into the space, swelling gently in comparison. The fattening mixture increased, Maya's stomach starting to bloat further, the already strained material of her acolyte robes pulling tighter, her sash working loose as it was unable to contain the rising mound of flesh. The robes started to part without the sash in place, a peak of her pale flesh showing against the darker material as it fell from the increasingly chubby belly. Maya seemed oblivious, her only thought on the mixture working its way down her throat, and whether there was more to come, even as her belly grew enough to block her feet from her view. </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the hotel ran out of water chestnuts, so I had to come here to buy some.

A big man with a large mustache, named Mr. Grossberg, I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPoor Grossberg, Phoenix thought.  He missed his chance for the scent of fresh lemons\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTo bad about that,\u201d Maya said.  \u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone want to have it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve offered to the detectives, but they\u2019ve been far to busy to eat a nice dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll eat it!\u201d Maya licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cVery good, miss.

He had seen the victim right before she was murdered, it seems, and that\u2019s why the police were keeping him here until they could collaborate his testimony.  When he finished, Phoenix saw that Maya had eaten the whole dinner and was wiping her mouth with a napkin.

Then he went of to find Detective Gumshoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Gumshoe; I want you to take a look at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGumshoe took the box of toaster pastries.  He laughed.  \u201cI know you\u2019re just trying to be nice, but I don\u2019t need your pity.  I usually have instant oatmeal for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t a charity gift.  It\u2019s one of the items from the scene of the crime.  Call it hunch, but I\u2019m willing to bet that if these get analyzed the crime lab would find something different with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGumshoe inspected the box more closely.  \u201cThey look a lot like ones we found in the victim\u2019s cart.  Just about every item in the cart was already opened.  We thought the killer was rummaging through her purchases for something.  I\u2019ll try to get it in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s great.  Try to get it analyzed before court tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen he came back to where Maya was sitting he saw that she was half-way through a tall stacked ice cream cone.  \u201cWhere did you get ice cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hailed down an ice cream truck, silly.\u201d  Maya licked melted vanilla from her lips.  \u201cI tried to get him to wait for you but you weren\u2019t coming out here fast enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, come on.  We have some more leads to investigate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey spent the rest of the day checking witnesses and checking the alibis of everyone.  When they made it back to the office Phoenix sat down and cataloged his notes, trying to make sense of the Court Record.  Since Phoenix didn\u2019t ask for her help, Maya sat down on the couch and consumed several bags of chips while watching Steel Samurai reruns.  At ten o\u2019clock they both went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter midnight, Maya woke up to her stomach gurgling.  Getting up carefully, she snuck to the kitchen and rummaged for goodies.  She stuffed herself with an old box of doughnuts and raided half the fridge before she felt satisfied.  She snuck back off to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she awoke, Maya noticed that her stomach was flabbier, as her binges yesterday began to add pounds to her figure.  She tied her acolyte sash as loose as she could make it, and still it was stretched tight over a forming potbelly.  She didn\u2019t think of it, as her thoughts turned to the trial today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPhoenix was already getting ready when she went to the office.  \u201cWe still don\u2019t know a lot about this case.  I think I can manage the trial today, but I want you to get more information.\u201d  He handed her one of his old briefcases.  \u201cTry to find out as much as you can about the victim, Shelly Ulite, and her possible relation to Mr. Feedem.  I\u2019ll call you during recess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlright, Chief!\u201d Maya saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDetective Gumshoe approached Phoenix as the defense attorney entered the courtroom.  \u201cYou were right about those toaster tarts, pal.  We found this mysterious chemical in the box you had us analyze, and get this: we also found it in the victim\u2019s body and in her box of tarts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally?  What chemical was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can never pronounce chemical names, pal.  Crime lab discovered it\u2019s similar to a new appetite stimulator that negates the pain of overeating.  Supposed to help people with rare disorders or something.  I\u2019ll talk about it all when I officially announce the results of the autopsy.  The plot thickens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure Maya ate those kinds of toaster pastries yesterday.  But why would that chemical be there.\u201d  His eyes grew worried as he realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, pal?  Bailiff just called court to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPhoenix would have no way of contacting Maya for the next few hours.  \u201cMaya could still be under the effects of the chemical.  And she has the suitcase with my wallet in it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaya looked through the information as she waited for a bus.  Silly Nick, he\u2019s left his wallet in here.  I wonder if that means he\u2019s treating me to lunch.  Her stomach grumbled again.  My bus is coming.  Should I investigate first, or eat first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Inside was a lobby with extra wide chairs and numerous different soda and snack machines. Maya walked up to where a girl was sitting behind a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, my name\u2019s Maya and I\u2019m part of a law firm that\u2019s investigating the death of Shelly Ulite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean Shell? It was such a horrible thing that happened to her, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d The woman stood up. She was probably in her mid twenties but was one of the fattest women Maya had ever seen. Her large gut and extra wide hips, where most of her flab sat, were draped in a blouse that was cut short \u2018in all the right places.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m Cora Pulent.\u201d She offered a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly was Shelly\u2019s job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she was one of our best models.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was a model?\u201d Maya said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Here at HIPPO Magazine, we\u2019re all about embracing the heavier side of femininity. I must say, Maya, your costume shows off your \u2018budding\u2019 rather well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? These are just my acolyte\u2019s clothes,\u201d said Maya, oblivious to her chubby midsection. She pulled out a case file. \u201cDo you think Shelly might have dated this guy?\u201d She showed Cora F. A. Feedem\u2019s picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora smiled. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve seen him around. Poor guy was chasing after Shelly but never managed to catch her. I know they were childhood sweethearts once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning Maya\u2019s stomach let out a humongous growl. She clutched her stomach, embarrassed. She hadn\u2019t had anything to eat today, and her body was craving food because of the chemical she had ingested the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora giggled. \u201cSounds like somebody wants something to eat. Care to have lunch while we talk about the case?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nodded. Nick can\u2019t harbor me for eating and working at the same time, she thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead of being used for meetings, the long table was used for a buffet. Almost every food imaginable was there, laid out for the magazine\u2019s models and employees to eat. Maya sniffed and the juicy sent of her favorite food, burgers, met her noise. Saliva formed in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora smiled. \u201cOh please, pull up a chair and help yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya needed no second bidding. She leaped into a chair by a tray of burgers and grabbed a triple patty with four slices of cheese and the works. Maya ate in five big bites and grabbed another burger. Even before she had swallowed her second one, Maya grabbed a third and began eating it. Cora, helping herself to a steak, laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer craving for burgers settled for now, Maya went to investigate the other trays of food on the conference table. She helped herself to some macaroni and cheese, some greasy french fries, some more burgers, several slices of pizza, and washed it down with a big milkshake from a dispenser on one side of the room. For dessert she had a plate of cookies, a few cupcakes, and several slices of apple pie and cheesecake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Maya stretched back for a breather, the sash of her acolyte clothes noticeably tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora giggled. \u201cOh my, Maya, you have quite the appetite.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, but I\u2019ve just been so hungry lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya! Well shoot, as I live and breathe, girl, what a crazy spot to run into you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLotta!\u201d Maya gasped, for several different reasons. It was Lotta Hart, the photographer with the big hair and the big mouth, but other parts of her were now big as well. Lotta had blossomed into a 200+ beauty since the last time Maya had seen her. Lotta\u2019s green pullover struggled to contain a massive belly equal in size to Cora\u2019s. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been going wherever the wind takes me, girl. I actually came here for a part time assignment and I\u2019ve stayed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to get her on the other side of the camera too.\u201d Cora gave Lotta\u2019s stomach a slap. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, \u2018Lotta Belly\u2019? The girl with the stomach as big as her hair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, stop it!\u201d Lotta grinned in embarrassment. \u201cYa\u2019ll got any more fried chicken in here?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sure you wouldn\u2019t want to switch jobs and work for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Nick doesn\u2019t take me out for burgers anymore when we win a case, I might consider it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora laughed and exited the room.

She took a spoon and scooped up something from a basin. \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to be showing this to someone who isn\u2019t an official employee, but I reckon you\u2019re a friend, so it\u2019ll be ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya took the spoon from Lotta. In the spoon was something that looked like tan whipped cream. \u201cIt smells like cookie dough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on, have some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick cream instantly melted in her mouth, and Maya savored the sweet taste. \u201cThat stuff tastes fantastic! What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta whispered, even though there was no one else in the room. \u201cIt\u2019s the magazine\u2019s secret formula. The models always get some before a shoot and us staff get some after a job well done. It\u2019s almost treated like a currency around here. Supposedly, its lard sweetened with sugar and cinnamon, but that\u2019s just poppycock, ain\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Maya replied, not really paying attention to Lotta. She felt a second wind coming on got hungry again, so she grabbed another burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this one girl who quit a few weeks ago \u2018cause she said all the food was cooked in lard and it was harmful to her health. Now isn\u2019t that just silly? I know lard when I taste it and this chicken ain\u2019t fried up in lard.\u201d As if it would prove a point, Lotta helped herself to another whole greasy, fattening fried chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Maya, still not fully paying attention. That stuff really was delicious. Maya chewed her burger, but glanced at the cupboard where the \u2018formula\u2019 was kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you\u2019re really here because you\u2019re looking into Shelly\u2019s murder. Nicky boy got you working hard for him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya snapped back into reality. \u201cOh, Nick, that\u2019s right.\u201d She swallowed the last of her burger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wiped frantically at it with a napkin. \u201cDon\u2019t want a stain to set in. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Lotta ran to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was alone, Maya seized her chance. She bolted over to the cupboard were the formula was kept and set the jar up one the table. It held about a liter or two of the thick cream. Maya scooped it with her hand and let the deliciousness melt in her mouth like cotton candy. In a minute she had the contain empty and was licking the stuff off of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026And then the buzz hit her again. At once she felt hungry again, her belly screaming for more food. Maya attacked the buffet table, and now what she ate could be tracked in the bulk scale. She devoured four trays of burgers, three baskets of fries, five pizzas, several different bowls of pasta, two trays of hot dogs, a tray of tacos, three plates of cookies, two chocolate cakes, a apple pie, a peach pie, and a cherry pie, a gallon of milk and a plate of buffalo wings. She at as if she was in a eating contest, her mouth chewing and swallowing at lightning speed as her hands shoveled the food into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I managed to get it out.\u201d Lotta returned as Maya started on the fried chicken. \u201cGeez, Maya, at least leave some chicken for the rest of us.\u201d She grew worried as Maya finished the chicken and stuffed her face with a cheesecake. \u201cSlow down, girl, there\u2019s no need to eat that fast\u2026\u201d Lotta\u2019s gaze fell on the empty basin. \u201cOh no, you didn\u2019t eat all of the formula, did you. Good lord, I never saw anyone eat that much of it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya\u2019s stomach was numb from the sheer amount of food that was being crammed into it. She didn\u2019t slow down her frenzied eating, but her steps lagged as her body tried to move under such pressure. The edges of her vision got fuzzy, and as she swallowed her last doughnut Maya felt like she was falling into blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya awoke in a bed in a dim room. She groaned and looked around. Lotta was sitting in a corner fiddling with her camera equipment. The photographer looked relieved when she saw Maya stir. \u201cMan, girl, you were out of it for a good few hours. Your cell phone has been ringing for the past few minutes, but I couldn\u2019t find it. Is Nicky boy trying to call you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNick!\u201d Maya sat up and pulled her from her pocket. She pushed redial on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya!\u201d Phoenix exclaimed through the phone. \u201cWe\u2019re just about to reconvene in court! I\u2019ve been trying you the whole recess! Where have you been?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry, my phone wasn\u2019t getting reception,\u201d she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I need to know everything about the victim\u2019s life that you\u2019ve found out about.\u201d Maya told him the little she had heard about Shelly\u2019s workplace and how F. A. Feedem had been trying to meet the victim. She knew it wasn\u2019t much, and she felt ashamed for not finding out any more information in the time she had to investigate. Surprisingly, Phoenix didn\u2019t seem all that worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said she worked for HIPPO Magazine? Hmm\u2026 Edgeworth presented some evidence related to that magazine. I might be able to use this. Bring anything you can when you come to the courthouse. And one of those magazines would help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya groaned and groggily thought about what she should do. She could try some more rush interviews and get all the information she could before she left. Her hand strayed down to her belly. She peered at it in shock. Her much bigger, fatter belly poked out from her acolyte robes and sat in her lap. Oh dear\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1. Maya breaks down and cries. She can\u2019t go into a courtroom looking like this!

She had to lean to the side to see past it. Pleased with her meal, she plopped down at a table, the chair groaning under the strain as her wide hips and fleshy butt oozed over the edges. She immediately began to dig into the formidable mountain of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mound shrunk, and after only thirty minutes, all the food was gone. \"Oogg...\" She moaned, rubbing her sagging tummy. \"Nick is going to be upset I put so much food on his  credit card, but it was WORTH IT...\" She grinned, and stood, noticing one fry left on her tray. She leaned over, and simultaneously, her clothing gave way. Her gut flopped out the front, her breasts threatened to pop over the top, and her titanic hips and shelf-like butt tore the back right open. She blushed,looking down to not see her feet at all... She couldn't even see the floor for several feet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to the bathroom, exhausted from this minute task, and looked at herself. She was officially huge. Her hips were wide enough to take up an entire park bench, and her butt big enough to lift her up, and supply a very nice cushion. It jutted out atleast a foot from her back. Her stomach was massive and flabby, but could barely compare to her lower half, which had taken the brunt of the weight. It sagged to her knees, and she could barely reach around it. Her thighs were covered with thick cellulite, and her arms were nearly as thick as her waist used to be.  Her breasts were roughly the size of her head, but barely sagged, resting upon her large gut. She had puffy chipmunk cheeks, and three chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, \"Atleast I'm right near the clothes shop...\" Apparently caring more about her lack of clothes than the additional two hundred pounds she had packed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled back to the store she had been in before, only to find nothing fit! She sighed, and stared out the window, noticing a store called the Plump Spectre. It was apparently a plus-size acolyte's store. She smiled and clapped her hand together, waddling with great effort to the store, and finding a large size that was a few sizes too big, just in case, she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur obese beauty now...</span></div></div>",

After leaving the court in such a rash manner she was too embarrassed to return, especially at a larger size;  she could remember how everyone in the courtroom's eyes were burning through her robes, and she definitely was not ready to experience something like that again.  She waddled over to a bench that sat next to the mall's entrance and sat down, making sure to lower herself gently so that she didn't shatter the wooden seat under her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurain was not an option at the moment, and with no transportation and so much extra weight she was not even sure if she could make it to Nick's place, much less the trian station.  With her hindered mobility as a constraint she was not even sure if she would be able to make it to the court house again, and with no hard change on her she was more or less stuck in the area of the mall.  She let out a distressed sigh as she raised her head to the sky, before noticing a familiar building off in the distance:  the headquarters of HIPPO magazine!  They would surely be willing to let her crash there for a bit until she built up some courage to return to the court room.  And with all of the extra weight she put on she could apply for a job there.  It would certainly be a better job than her short stint at Tres Bien.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Maya approached the entrance to HIPPO Magazine, something caught her eye in the alleyway behind the building. An overturned bucket of fried chicken sat in the middle of the alley, with freshly gnawed bones spilling out of it. But Maya was more intrigued by what appeared to be a stack of photographs caught under the paper pail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya tried to bend over to look at the pictures, but realized that this would be impossible given her new girth. Maybe if she tried to bend her legs, she could get on her knees and put her hands out here to steady herself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPLOP! Maya\u2019s attempts at leaning to look over her massive belly proved to be disastrous, as the shift in her center of gravity caused her to fall flat on her face! Well, not exactly flat on her face because her fall was nicely cushioned. Maya felt her flabby rolls jiggle from the shock of her impact. Luckily, her head managed to land right by stack of photos, so Maya picked them up to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first photo seemed to be taken from a window right above this very alleyway. Maya recognized the placement of a dumpster that was just a few feet to her left. A large girl was talking a cell phone. She looked a little familiar\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya snapped her fingers. The woman in the photo was Shelly Ulite, the victim of the case being tried in court today! Maya studied the photo intensely. Shelly was dressed in very fashionable clothes, which would be expected for a model to where. Shelly was wearing skintight designer jeans that accentuated her hips, and a tank top cut low enough to show off her generous cleavage yet also short enough to leave her luscious belly exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya flipped to the next photo, which must have been taken a few moments later. Shelly was walking toward the street, but her path was cut off a mysterious man. He was wearing a tweed cap, sunglasses, and a scarf to disguise his face, and wore a heavy jacket. Although this photo only showed Shelly\u2019s backside, Maya could tell that the fat model was startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next photo made Maya gasp. Shelly and the mystery man seemed to be having some kind of an argument. Shelly\u2019s posture suggested that she was yelling at the mystery man. The man\u2019s expression was undeterminable from the objects that covered his face, but he held something shiny in his hand. It looked like a knife! But there was another person in this photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man that was standing on the sidewalk outside the alleyway was peering around the corner of the next building, watching the argument take place. Maya peered in closer to look at the man\u2019s face. It was F.A. Feedem, their client and supposed murderer of Shelly Ulite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next photo Mr. Feedem was running towards the mystery man, arms outstretched and mouth open. The mystery man hadn\u2019t noticed Mr. Feedem yet, as he was too busy raising the knife over his head to stab Shelly, who was backing away in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second to last photo scared Maya the most. Mr. Feedem must have finally gotten the mystery man\u2019s attention, because the disguised stalker was poised in the middle of a punch to Mr. Feedem\u2019s jaw. Shelly had turned around to run away. Her now visible face had a look of panic on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last photo Mr. Feedem was laying on the ground, apparently dazed. Shelly was no where to be seen. The mystery man had almost disappeared. Only his leg was visible in the corner of the photo as he ran to the street to escape. Although the photos showed a frightening scene, they were just the perfect piece of evidence to prove that some one besides F.A. Feedem had the desire to kill Shelly Ulite. But who would be taking photos of a scene like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya struggled to roll onto her side so she could look up the side of the HIPPO Magazine building. A clothesline dangled from an open window with a few photos clipped to it. A camera on a tripod was also sticking part way out of the window as well. It was probably Lotta\u2019s room. The photographer had a knack for accidentally taking pictures of the crimes Phoenix and Maya investigated that would end up becoming important pieces of evidence. Lotta had done it again; it also explained the signature skewed angle of the attack taking place, a knack shared by many of Lotta\u2019s photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever mind that now. Maya had to get these photos to Phoenix as fast as she could. They only problem was, she was so heavy she couldn\u2019t lift herself off the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang, Maya, how\u2019d ya get down there?\u201d a voice rang from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLotta!\u201d Maya gasped. She quickly hid the photos under her tremendous bosom. \u201cAh, ha-ha-ha\u2026It looks like I\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot, that\u2019s apparent. Just hang on a sec\u2019 and I\u2019ll come down and get ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lotta who took these pictures. The girl must\u2019ve have left a window open and her camera had fallen over just as the confrontation between Shelly and the mystery man had taken place and luckily took shoots of the scene below. Lotta had developed them since that time, but did she really know what her camera had taken pictures of? Nevertheless, Maya tucked the photos into a fold of her robes under a fold of her flab for safe keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta came out of a side door, followed by Cora. The two fatties helped Maya to her feet, which was a strenuous task for all three of them. Lotta and Cora had perspired a bit but Maya was very hot and sweating profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord sakes, girl, you\u2019re sweatier than my uncle\u2019s pigs! Why don\u2019t you come inside where it\u2019s cooler? Would you like a drink of water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please,\u201d Maya panted. Lotta and Cora led her inside, where the AC cooled Maya off quickly. Lotta sat her on a plump couch and Cora fetched Maya a tall glass of water. Maya thanked her for it and guzzled it down in ten seconds. Maya leaned back, feeling much better although she still breathed heavily from the strain of getting to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora spoke up. \u201cOh Maya, your figure has greatly improved since the last time we met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah,\u201d Maya giggled. She realized her boobs were almost completely exposed and covered them with her robe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tilted her head to one side in thought. \u201cWe still have that set from the Japanese garden shoot. A few modifications and we could dress it up in a spirit medium/occult theme. Oh, and we have a bunch of beautiful robes that you could wear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a young girl Maya had thought it would be cool to be a model and have hundreds of pictures taken of her. That old desire had finally climbed through a mountain of flab into her brain. She grinned. \u201cSure, it sounds cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora led her into a dressing room that was painted in pink and had a rack of fabulous clothes, plump couches, a full length mirror, and a big mirror on a table covered with makeup and sub sandwiches. \u201cJust put on whatever you like first, and then come on out. We should be ready with the set by then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya shuffled through the clothes on the rack. \u201cOooohhh\u2026\u201d She held up a purple and black robe that must have been made out of very expensive material. She changed outfits, making sure that the photos of Shelly\u2019s stalker stayed hidden under the heap. She slipped on the skirt of the costume, which barely managed to fit around her waist, and latched it. The upper part of the robes covered her shoulders quite well, and a black piece of cloth covered her chest. But the folds of the robe were cut backwards and flared out behind her, leaving most of her belly exposed. Maya giggled at her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled out the door onto the set, which had undergone changes very quickly. The tradition plants and stone statues remained, but the lighting was much darker. Neon lights were set up in the back, as well as colored blotches made by spotlights that must represent spirits. And a huge glowing Magatama dominated the backdrop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora marveled at Maya\u2019s appearance as she waddled in. \u201cOh Maya, you look absolutely gorgeous! Now, Lotta will just be taking pictures and I\u2019ll talk you through a few poses, okay? Just relax and have fun. We\u2019re going to have to give you a pseudonym and a catchphrase. Hmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta piqued up from the camera. \u201cHow about Mystic Maya: Extra Large and Extrasensory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo, I like that one. It fits wonderfully!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya as a little nervous at first, but once she got over her initial jitters she modeled quite well. She went through many poses including a sexy stance showed off her girth; back-over-the-shoulder as she leaned on a statue, her massive butt pointed at the camera; seductively lying on a reinforced bench, every single one of her curves highlighted; and various other poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya, you\u2019re a natural at this.\u201d Cora said. \u201cFind a different outfit, something a bit brighter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya returned to the dressing room and changed into a brilliant red furisode with woven yellow symbols that were stretched by her belly. Although this time she was fully clothed, the tight fabric hugged every roll and lump of her body, with a low cut on the neckline that half-covered her breasts. This costume got an even better response from Cora and Lotta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we really have to do something with those long, hanging sleeves. Try some mystical arm movements,\u201d Cora suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya gestured with her hands. \u201cOle! Ole!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLotta laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bullfighter, Maya. You\u2019re so much bigger than the bull, he\u2019ll die of fright when he sees you.\u201d They all cracked up at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, after several hundred pictures and a score of revealing to accentuating, dazzling to gothic robes, Maya was taking a break in the dressing room. She now wore a striking red and orange flame patterned robe with a bright orange obi long enough to fit around Maya\u2019s waist, although it fit snugly. The robe was open, as Maya wore a white under tunic that supported her breasts and cut off at her thighs. The robes were short, as the outfit was designed to leave plenty of chunky leg to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya refreshed herself with a soda, and glanced around the dressing room. A thought in the back of her mind bothered her, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. Suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1.\u2026Maya realizes this was the victim\u2019s dressing room!

I figured the wind blew your pictures outside, so I...grabbed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is this what's making you nervous, sweetie? Maya, I know that you're a good person and have a clear conscience. So, if you want these photos given to Mr. Wright's case and help him out one final time, then I can help you with that problem of yours.\" Lotta said, reassuring Maya that it wasn't too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya eyes opened wide with hope as she asked, \"Really? You do that for me?\" \"~Giggle~ Yep. Besides, I'm friends with the Chief of Police after a certain deal we made, and you can say that I think it's time for him to return the favor.\" Lotta replied, as Maya tightly hugged Lotta out of pure joy, as their big bellies smooshed against each other while Maya said, \"Oh thankyouthankyouthankyou so much, Lotta!\"</span></div></div>",

And thanks to that new amount of evidence, Mr. F.A. Freedom was not charged with murder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later on that in his office, Phoenix Wright found a letter from Maya, as it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Nick, <br>\r\nIf you're reading this letter, then you now know that I am no longer your assistant. It's not that I hated that job or anything like that, it's just that I found a new job that I really, really love a lot. If you don't believe me, then check out the photos of me that came with the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely, <br>\r\nMaya Fey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick then looked at the pictures of a fatter Maya, as she posed in front of the camera's lens. Nick knew that if this is what Maya wanted, then he wasn't going to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 days later, Maya was now at HIPPO Magazine's Lounge Room, with a full belly after eating strawberry ice cream with Cora Pulent. \"Ooooohh. So....~light burp~...full.\" Maya said, as she rubbed her full tummy, hoping to relieve some of the pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya now wore a super large kimono that was around her size. She managed to get a little bigger over the past 2 days. Her belly now sagged halfway down her thighs, as her butt now was the size of two beachballs. Her breasts were now at Double F-Cup size, as they slight jiggled with each movement. Her legs have become large thunder thighs, as they would rub against each other if she walked. And her arms were coated in fat, while her head &amp; face developed a thick double chin &amp; chubby cheeks.</span></div></div>",

She waddled out of the room, neglecting to change into something less revealing, her thick thighs wobbling and rubbing together as she exited the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to a stunned Lotta, and said, \"We're gonna have to pick this up another day.\" Before waddling to the elevator, and heading for the bottom floor. The soft, annoying noise of the elevator music eased her nerves. She glanced around, blinking as she noticed a sign. \"Weight limit: 580 pounds.\" She blushed, realising she was almost big enough to break elevators. Sighing, the final floor dinged and she waddled forth from the contraption, the steel cables almost sighing in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled outside, and attempted to hail a cab...

She had been practicing how to project her spirit, and now was the perfect time to do so! She sat down in the middle of the street, attempting to sit cross legged, but her massive belly got in the way. She sighed and simply knelt, her belly nearly touching the ground as it covered her thunder thighs. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and began to concentrate. Suddenly, she felt light. A lot lighter, due to the fact she no longer had an extra 500+ pounds to heave around. Grinning, she glance down. She was still huge, but, ectoplasm weighs a lot less that fat. Sighing, she floated over the city, searching for the courtroom. Seeing it, she grinned, and floated down. She drifted into the courtroom, a heated cross-examination with the witness occurring. Mr. Feedem looked fairly dazed. The case must not be going well. \"Ask him about the alley!\" Maya shouted at Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick blinked and glanced around. \"What... Maya?\" He asked aloud, causing the entire courtroom to stare at him oddly. He chuckled, then heeded her advice. \"Tell us about the alleyway, Mr. Feedem!\" he said, pointing his finger at he man dramatically. The Judge seemed stunned. \"A-alleyway?\"<br>\r\nNick nodded. \"The alleyway.\" <br>\r\nMr. Feedem blinked, remembering the event. He began to describe it exactly as the pictures had. The judge raised an eyebrow. \"And do you have any evidence of this occurance?\" Phoenix's face blanked and he began to sweat.<br>\r\n\"Thanks alot maya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya returned to her body, furious, when another idea came to her. She glanced around, and spotted a little kid. \"Hey, kid!\" She said, waddling to the stunned youngster. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll give you five dollars to run this to the courtroom. Give it to Phoenix Wright.Tell him Maya sent them.\" She said, handing him the photos and the letter. The kid grinned and nodded, snagging the items, and running to the court room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I'm about to lose...\" <br>\r\n\"I declare the defendant... Gui-\" The judge was interrupted by the door bursting open, a young boy dashing to Phoenix, demanding five dollars for something in his hands. \"S'from Maya!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed and handed the kid some money, taking the file, and smirking. \"OBJECTION!\" He shouted dramatically, presenting the evidence. \"TAKE THAT!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cEr, what is this?\u201d The judge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe defense has just received some evidence which could wildly affect this case. We wish to submit it to the record immediately!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was just about to procure a guilty verdict\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry, your honor,\u201d Edgeworth interjected. \u201cIf new evidence has been found that will tip either side of the case, it is our duty as a court to examine it.\u201d Edgeworth gave a smug look in Phoenix\u2019s direction. \u201cHonestly, Wright, I thought you had lost your touch, but once again you pulled the ace out of your sleeve at the last minute. You have that cat-swallowed-the-canary grin on your face again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha ha\u2026\u201d Phoenix grinned embarrassedly. \u201cAnyways, your honor, remember Mr. Feedem\u2019s testimony about witnessing a confrontation in the alleyway of the HIPPO Magazine building?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we presumed it to be baseless testimony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong! The defense will submit these photographs as evidence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge looked them over. \u201cHmm\u2026Oh my, this is a scary scene\u2026boy, that one man looks familiar\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe should, your honor,\u201d Phoenix groaned. You had to zap the judge with a cattle prod in order to get his brain moving. \u201cThat\u2019s the defendant, rushing in to save the victim from her attacker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so THAT\u2019S what these photos show\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Feedem,\u201d Phoenix continued. \u201cI\u2019m curious. Why would you rush in to protect some woman, you\u2019ve never seen before in your life, from some mugger? As you can by these photographs, you can\u2019t see the knife the stalker is holding. If you hand seen it, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t have risked your life protecting some woman you never knew. Yet you rushed in to protect this woman. Why? And why would you rush to the side of this woman days later when she ends up dead in a supermarket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026er\u2026\u201d F.A. Feedem was getting red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpill the beans, Mr. Feedem. What is your connection to this woman? It\u2019s because of this connection that you are now sitting in the defendants\u2019 chair as her murderer. But from these photos it seems you wouldn\u2019t want any harm to come to her. Why is that? What\u2019s your connection to the victim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkayyy, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m a FA, are you happy now? That\u2019s way I\u2019ve been trying to get in contact with the victim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence in the court room for a moment. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d the judge began. \u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to contact the victim because of your initials?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m a FA. A fat admirer. To me, fat girls are the most beautiful things on the planet. I had been looking at pictures on the HIPPO Magazine website when I recognized Shelly as an old friend I grew up with during high school and college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were really friends with the victim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not exactly. I just had this really big crush on her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you took a chance trying to reconnect with an old classmate,\u201d Edgeworth surmised. \u201cAnd that placed you under suspicion as being her killer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge looked confused again. \u201cBut this makes it sound like he would be the one stalking the victim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so, your honor,\u201d Phoenix added. \u201cThe defense has a second piece of evidence to submit. We believe that it will show that someone else had motive to kill Shelly Ulite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge looked at the letter he was handed. \u201c\u2018If I can\u2019t have you, no one should\u2019? Voy Erst? Who is this Voy Erst?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a hunch, your honor,\u201d Phoenix began. \u201cBut from everything we\u2019ve heard up to this point, the defense suggests that Voy Erst is the disguised man in the photo, the man who was stalking Shelly Ulite with malicious intent and her real killer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite the theory! Good job, Mr. Wright.\u201d The judge banged his gavel. \u201cIf there is another suspect in this case, I want the prosecution and the defense to investigate it. Before I hand down a verdict, I want to be 100% convinced that Mr. Feedem is the real killer, or that someone else killed the victim. Court is adjourned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix walked through the courtroom lobby towards the doors. Edgeworth walked up beside him. \u201cI had a feeling HIPPO Magazine was going to play a bigger part in this whole affair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaya\u2019s still investigating over there, I think\u2026\u201d Phoenix still couldn\u2019t shake the weird image of Maya\u2019s spirit he seen in his mind\u2019s eye. Phoenix headed down the courtroom steps, and was surprised that Edgeworth kept pace with him as he made a turn. \u201cAre you coming with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness, Wright. You know the next logical direction this investigation will take.\u201d Edgeworth shrugged. \u201cIf the prosecution and the defense wind up in the same spot, that either means they are both equals in their ways of thinking or the defense simply wants to mooch evidence off the one lawyer who knows what he is doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey! Phoenix thought. Who\u2019s following who here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey pals, wait up.\u201d Detective Gumshoe came running up behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re coming along too, Gumshoe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChief wants me to check out the magazine. The rest of the investigation crew is still processing the supermarket. I didn\u2019t mind volunteering at all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever that\u2019s supposed to mean, Phoenix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, look at us,\u201d Edgeworth said. \u201cAren\u2019t we the motley trio of the judicial system?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what are we getting ourselves into? Phoenix thought, growing worried.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't suppose you've seen a dark haired girl, white and purple robes, going by the name Maya Fey?\" he asked \"Lately she's er, somewhat...  on the chubby side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Though I suppose in here, that's not much of a distinguishing feature...) he reminded himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man flashed him a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the new girl?

Law Firm. He struggled juggling all three, let alone opening the door, so Maya was more than happy to jump up and take one of them off of his hands. The young medium practically pounced upon the opportunity to get her hands on something nummy for her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just take these off your hands, Nick!\u201d Maya said devilishly as she ripped the box from the defense attorney, \u201cHere, you can keep the coffee!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2014Maya!\u201d the porcupine-headed man whimpered in confusion as the large box of donuts was stolen from him only to be replaced by two piping hot cups of coffee. Which of course he dropped as a small trickle of the heated brown liquid splashed out from underneath the protective plastic cap and into the crevice of his palm, creating a large stain on his signature outfit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwOwOw that\u2019s hot!\u201d Phoenix cried out as the liquid seeped through his outer layers to scald his skin, \u201cThat\u2019s really, really, REALLY HOT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, Nick!\u201d Maya hollered after swallowing a bite of her precious breakfast, turning on a dime to face her injured boss (but not before making sure that the box in which her breakfast came in was securely placed upon the coffee table), \u201cAre you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It\u2019s a sad say when a box of donuts gets better treatment than I do around here.</i> Phoenix thought to himself as he pat at his rapidly cooling torso, <i>No respect I tell ya, no respect.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Maya.\u201d He said rather bitterly, \u201cJust be more careful next time you endanger my life for baked goods!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Maya said, her hands folding behind her back as her head hung low, sniffling a little bit. Had Phoenix paid more attention to the physical well-being of his young assistant, he would have noticed a slight curvature to Maya\u2019s physique\u2014namely in the vicinity of her stomach. However he <i>also</i> would have noticed that she was hiding a donut behind her back. But he didn\u2019t, so let\u2019s move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh jeez, not my blue suit\u2026\u201d Phoenix\u2019s face twisted into a frown as he took in the sight of his damaged signature suit courtesy of a nearby mirror, \u201cI was hoping to try and get a client today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just wear another one?\u201d Maya almost sounded like she was begging, obviously she felt really bad about the whole ordeal, \u201cAt least until that one gets dry-cleaned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat \u2018other one\u2019? I only wear this one outfit!\u201d Phoenix exclaimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense Nick, but aren\u2019t lawyers supposed to be rich and stuff?\u201d Maya asked impishly as she returned the donut to her lips, \u201c You've only got one suit, we only get basic cable, heck you've still got a VCR! I think it\u2019s time we took in a big client before General Electric starts shutting off lights!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don\u2019t you live in a village on the outskirts of the country with little to no technological advances?</i> Phoenix felt like asking, but he deemed it unworthy of pressing forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>OBJECTION!</b> I just bought that DVD player two weeks ago!

How have you been keeping it clean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix got quiet, his mouth shrinking down to a sliver, <i>Th-This is my only set of lawyer clothes\u2026 I just get it dry-cleaned every week\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNevermind that now.\u201d Phoenix adjusted his stained collar professionally, \u201cJust hurry up and eat your breakfast so we can head down to the Laundromat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we stop for burgers on the way?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO BURGERS UNTIL YOU FINISH YOUR DONUTS!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe this is why I wouldn't make a good father\u2026</i></b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end, Good old P.W. decided to treat Maya to O'Ronalds burger joint seeing as it was on the way to the laundromat and figuring that if there were to be more mustard and ketchup stains on his shirt (knowing the messy eater that Maya was,) than at least he'd get them before the laundromat rather than after, and get the most out of his money.  As the two continued walking the few blocks towards the O'Ronalds (\"Still no drivers license yet Phoenix?\" teased Maya) a loud siren suddenly pierced the air.  An ambulance was now hurriedly zooming down the street, pulling into the O'Ronalds parking lot a short distance down the road.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two quicken their pace, jogging down the block until stopping in front of the yellow and red colored restaurant. A group of police officers were now blocking of the entrance to the house of hamburgers with lines of yellow <b>CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS</b> tape. Phoenix at first grimaced at the familiar sight having invested many a crime scene before, then he suddenly smiled, this wasn't his problem today! \"Well look at the Maya.\" he said practically whistling, \"Looks like the place is closed off. Oh, well\" and at this he was already starting to walk down the sidewalk again, \"guess I'll have to treat you some other time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya did not follow him, instead she was already ducking her top knot under the police tape. \"Oh, come on Phoenix\" said the woman whose sense of adventure was one of the few things more powerful than her hunger. \"Look I think I see officer Gumshoe let's just go say 'Hi.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya wait!\" cried out Phoenix but the kimono clad girl was already working her way up to the front door. <i>Why can't I have one normal day?</i> thought Phoenix begrudgingly following Maya. As he approached the restaurant's doors, Phoenix suddenly remembered why he specifically avoided the O'ronalds restaurant. A lone clown stature posed out front, frozen in place while posing with a cheeseburger. It really creeped him out! The wide eyes staring blankly at any passer by, the clowns makeup covered mouth open forever in a horrible <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">grin</span> scream. But that wasn't even the worst part-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go you whippersnapper! I've done this procedure plenty of times. *Honk* Why back in my day real policemen politely escorted you if you were taken into the patty wagon. *Honk Honk*\" Wendy Oldbag was shockingly being carried away arm and arm by two policemen. Half walking half being dragged the two officers handling her were having a hard time struggling with the (Septu-? Octo-? Nona-?) genarian. That, yes even that, was even sort of a normal sight for Phoenix these days, but what had really been the kicker was that today Wendy apparently was dressed completely as a clown, red rubber nose, makeup, and honking novelty horn in all. This was the trademark of the O'ronalds restaurant where every employee who worked there, from janitor to kitchen worker, all were forced to don a clown costume.  As he watched the crusty with age clown apparently still jabber as she was driven away by the police, Phoenix was suddenly startled by an angry voice shouting from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Pal!\" said the baritone voice causing Phoenix to jump a little in surprise. Turning around it was none other than Dick Gumshoe huffing and puffing as always and with a disgruntled look on his face. \"Sorry but it's police only in there! Oh it's you!\" The officers unshaven face seemed to lighten up a bit in recognition of Phoenix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi Dick! Look I'm sorry about Maya. I'll get her and go....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah it's okay. Just don't touch anything s'all.\" said Dick holding the door open for his lawyer chum. (<i>Why couldn't you be a little more strict as an officer?</i>) Thought Phoenix giving up all thoughts of a normal day as he entered.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya?\" asked Phoenix entering the restaurant.  \"Ph<i>oeeeeeeniixxx</i>\" came the girl running up and nearly in tears. \"Maya? What's wrong?\" said Phoenix wrapping a consoling arm around the crying girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's terrible! Josie's dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead? Wait, who's Josie?\" Maya pointed a finger to the only filled booth in the restaurant. Well filled with a corpse. Very Filled! Folded over, face first into the table an obese sized sable haired woman appeared to be dead. Her casaba melon sized breasts serving as a small almost comical cushion between her down turned face and the table. All around the collapsed corpse a collage of garbage including wrappers, ketchup packets and napkins remained strewn about  the untouched booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, officers already have a suspect down at the station.\" said Officer Gumshoe's voice abruptly and from behind them. \"As well as two of the workers here a counter worker/grill worker, and...um the security guard.\" Dick's eyes rolled a bit remember having to wrangle up Wendy. \"I...guess you can't exactly take any evidence yet, <i>since you're not on the case yet.</i> But I guess you can look around till Edgeworth get's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edgeworth! He's on the case already?\" asked Phoenix his eyes turning to narrow slits at the thought of the smug pink clad prosecutor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but he hasn't been the to the crime scene yet and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind. Look I've got a funny feeling that if Edgeworth's on the case, I'll probably be hired for the defense.\" Explained Phoenix. \"And who knows what evidence he will 'eveal dramatically in court. I should probably get as much information from the crime scene as I can, <u>and fast</u>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now where to start.</i> Phoenix turned about, taking in as much of the restaurant as he could, his mind now working at full speed to process as many details as it could. The watery eyed girl in front of him seemed like a good place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Maya you said you knew who this was?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y<span class=\"cgrape\">eah! It's Josie Chestnut! World famous competitive eating champion three times in a row!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">And you know her...how?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">She's, one of my idols! I want to be a champion like her! Well, after a movie star, or the pink samurai, or an astronaut or-</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.W. zoned out as the girl began to ramble on.  <span class=\"cblue\"><span class=\"cblack\"><span class=\"chunter\">(Why am I not surprised. Maya already eats a ton, she might as well win an award for it. Speaking of awards...This lady sure looked like an eating champion! She probably would have had a-wait a minute..)</span></span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Gumshoe. How do you already have a suspect? I mean how do you know she was murdered? What if she had a heart-attack?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when the original ambulance came for her, the noticed that her cheeks were strangely already blue. They took a blood sample and found traces of poison in her blood system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Poison! But how?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is just from the initial report from the lab but it appears her body had been overdosed on sleeping pills. Which we also found on the suspect at the time of arrest...That's about all we know right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh.</span>\" said Phoenix glumly. He knew things weren't what they seemed when it came to cases like this but that wasn't a good start for the defense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden ringing emanated from the large police officer. It was the silver samurai jingle! Phoenix and Maya turned back to the copper who looked a little ashamed by the ringtone. but took out his cell phone regardless. \"Yeah...Yes  <i>Mr. Edgeworth!</i>...No they didn't move the body....Yes....I told him...Sorry...\" A grim look overtook the gruff man as if he'd been thoroughly chewed out over the phone. Then spurts of smoke erupted through his nose, the officer now clearly getting worked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Edgeworth</span>?\" guessed Phoenix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, he said he's on his way.\" a dishevel Dick answered. \"Dat' guy ain't even got the nerve to'- say thanks before hanging' up!\" said an obviously angry Gumshoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Well-just give a few minutes and we'll be out of here before he shows up.</span>\" said Phoenix getting a little anxious himself. Not just from the thought of running into that damn Miles, but being stuck in the small restaurant with an angry officer Gumshoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to get a leg up though...What could Phoenix do that Miles couldn't? Scanning the 'murder scene' for one last clue, Phoenix turned to Maya. Maya! Of course that was it! Miles didn't have a spirit medium and especially didn't have a member of the Fey family. He could get Maya to channel the spirit of the deceased Josie Chestnut and get as much info as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Maya, this is going to sound a little weird, and I know it's sudden but could you channel Josie's spirit for me</span>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">What!</span>\" gaped the girl in plum colored clothing \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Right now? Really?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Yes. I need to get as much info as I can before Edgeworth arrives</span>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well..I don't know if I can...</span>\" said Maya a little hesitant to summon the spirit of her idol on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">We'll go to the Kong Burger nearby for cheeseburgers...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Okay!</span>\" cheered the girl and once again approaching the corpse. Slowly she got into the focus, and the lights in the room seemed to dim a bit. Then the girls necklace, specifically her magical magatama, began to glow brightly. Maya had  begun to mutter a few mystical words when-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So she used her excessively enlarged ass as a bean bag chair, she leaned her head on a hand, which in-turn was supported by her thigh.<br>\r\n a large blast would cause her massive ass to quake with power every half a minute or so. looks of strain and effort eventually faded as she eventually stopped helping them out and just let them flow naturally. they ranged from bubblers that lazily vibrated her cheeks, to loud \"woooshes\" that rushed out with vigor. <br>\r\nuntil eventually...<br>\r\nMaya felt a deep gurgling deep in her lower bowels, she placed a hand on it absentmindedly and gave a slight push. \"NHG-mmmm...\" she figured  it was just more gas building up. with her grunt, she was rewarded with another loud flapper that oscillated her ass. her eyes suddenly snapped wide as a clump of liquid and semi-solid waste shot from her anus and slammed against the wall behind her. <br>\r\n\"ooohhh...\" Maya moaned as she rubbed her still flat tummy. her ass churned, rocking Maya back and forth up and down as it convulsed, like a water balloon half empty, sloshing around and around. She leaned forward so her breasts squished into the floor, her mass of ass pointed straight up. she grabbed the mound of flesh known as her backside and massaged the fat in soothing circles. her stomach continued to roar and her ass shook with built up pressure, Maya joined the noise with moans of pain all the while. <br>\r\n\"if you're going to go! go alrea-EHHAA!!\" Maya began to plead with her ass for release, but mid request she got what she wanted. with a final cry, her ass ass erupted into a geyser of shit,spewing gallons and gallons of crap all over the kitchen, some of it even landing outside, through the open window. gaseous, burst mixed with slimy logs burst from her asshole, causing it to rain down all over the room. Maya remained face down crying out in pain and in the pleasure of sweet release. her face burning red in strain and embarrassment, if someone saw this, she would die! so many mixed emotions emotions running through her mind, all the while enough waste was flying out her enlarged ass to fill a landfill. she reached back to grab some ass blubber, to push some flab out and give her geyser of an asshole more room to vomit up more shit and hopefully get this over with quicker. her eyes widened again when sh realized...<br>\r\nher ass's swelling had gone down substantially, almost back to normal size even. she had to stop this, she wanted to have a bigger butt, just not stupidly huge! she gritted her teeth, she used both her hands to physically mash both her cheeks together. her ass buckled and rebelled. it wanted the rest of this stuff out!<br>\r\n\"n-no!\" she ordered her butt, as her bowels resisted a bassy fart escaped every few seconds as if she was strangling her ass and it was taking it final breaths. her stomach bubbled with the rest of the waste boiling within her, Maya didn't care though, she wanted to keep this butt! she flipped onto her back again,causing her body to splash into the metaphorical ocean of liquid waste on the floor. both her hands still wrestling with very \"vocal\" anus.until she slammed her buns into the puddle she sat in, effectively silencing it. she crossed her arms over her modest rack and gave her rear a stern look, to see that, her ass had stayed large!<br>\r\n\"yes!\" she raised her arms up into the air, her eyes closed and an ear to ear smile on her face. her look of happiness slowly turned to one of concern as she heard her belly speak up again. a low subtle roar started low in her stomach.<br>\r\n\"oh no you DON'T!\" she remarked as she slammed her ass into the floor again. the gas bubble rocketed through her body, but in the opposite direction! Maya's arms quickly wrapped around her mid section as the bubble bounced around inside her, before rushing up her chest and...<br>\r\n\"I-I.. don't feel so... so..URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP\" Maya began to state before her throat bugled and the gs bubbled exploded, forcing her lips to part and flap from the force. the belch was so titanic, Maya's whole body trembled as she slid across the floor like an air hockey puck. she her back slammed into the counter as the burp raged on, Maya reached her arms out to brace herself against the surface she smashed into. the monstrous roar, fainted to a low growl in her throat after about 3 minutes. Maya was gasping for breath after such a long outburst of gas. Maya didn't have time to rest as she felt her nipples harden and her breast quiver. <br>\r\n\"AHA!\" she cried out again as the modestly small lumps of fat burst forth, causing her robe to part and expose her enlarged peaks. Maya gripped the top of the counter and moaned louder than ever as her womanhood trembled. her breast swelled until finally resting fully in her laps, they were so large, Maya couldn't see her legs. Maya once again panted as she came down of her borderline orgasm. she gazed at her chest, a smirk came across her face as she quickly realized what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nchoice one) stay with Maya as she plays around with her breast enlarging burps!<br>\r\nchoice two) follow the girl outside, who had Maya scat fall on her through the window and now has to go through what Maya just went through. </span></div></div>",

Mia stopped, just a few doors down from the lost and found, she supported herself on a nearby table her other hand on her gut. another splattering blast fired out of her. Mia looked back to check the damage to see... her ass had doubled in size from when she left the break room!<br>\r\nshe gasped as her eyes went wide in shock, they suddenly snapped shut as she involuntarily pushed out another blaring, moist fart. her ass churned as it thrust forward with more layers of fat. MIa moaned as she bent over with her arms wrapped around her stomach, it kept its steady pace of making noise, as it had this whole time, but this was different, it was a deep, furious bubbling lower in her abdomen. She knew what was about to happen, she had to do something fast! she looked around frantically for a garbage can or anything she could void her bowels in only to nothing but a table and a water cooler. she gasped as she got an idea, she sprinted down the hallway grabbing her ass to keep it from bouncing around and spewing her load all over the floor. she slammed her shoulder into the door to the lost and found. a small empty room with a couple table, paintings on the wall and 3 bins; one for clothes, one for electronics and one for miscellaneous items that didn't fit the other two categories. while what she was about to \"drop off\" would be best fitting for the latter, she dumped everything out of the clothes bin and promptly squeezed her cheeks into the opening of the bin. <br>\r\n\"NHHHGG HRRRG!\" Mia gave an extremely loud, feminine grunt as the flow of fluffy chucks began with essentially a fire hydrant of waste bursting from her anus, splattering violently against the bottom of the bin and splashing back up to dirty her enlarged cheeks. this went on for a couple minutes, all the while she twisted, moaned, and pushed, trying to get it all out of her system. a loud gaseous explosion rattled the bin below Mia shaking her whole curvy frame. her anus quaked before it sputtered out fresh waste once again. as this went on and on, Mia felt the bins grip on her huge ass slipping as she had more and more wiggle room. Mia looking down with eyes squinted in effort as she saw her ass's swelling had mostly receded! Mia gasped as a smile began to form on her face <br>\r\n(this will all be over soon) she thought as she grunted again, wanting to get this over with faster. Mia pushed so hard her anus stung as the diarrhea spewed out at twice the pace. her ass shrunk so much more quickly that the bin didn't hold the sides of her ass anymore and she fell into it! she splashed into her mess sending splashes of into all over her already messy behind and in a short proximity around her. Mia sighed, mad about falling in, but relieved it was finally over. she raised herself out of the messy bin and walked over to the pile of clothes she had to dump all over the floor. she grabbed a shirt and a skirt, she cleaned off her messy rump with the shirt. <br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry whoevers shirt this is...\" she apologized aloud as she finished wiping and toss it into the disgusting bin. she squeezed herself into the new skirt jumping up and down to fit. her belly rumbled again, Mia hoped she just stirred some extra trapped gas from jumping around. she felt a strong pain in her chest as she placed an open palm in between her breasts with a confused look on her face. suddenly a loud. dry roar exploded from her throat parting her red, glossy lips and blowing a few papers off the table in front of her.  Mia didn't even have time to ask: \"what was that?\" before she involuntarily bit her lip and groped her breasts in arousal, her twin mounds burst forth snapping her bra, but not ripping her shirt. <br>\r\n\"mmmm.. mmmm!\" she tried so hard to hold back her orgasm driven cries as she fell onto the ground, powerless to do anything, but fight her own body and squirm. her breasts continued to swell out before stopping at DDD-cups. Mia panted as she glanced down, her huge breasts now stopping her from seeing her feet, her face was beet red from exertion, arousal, and embarrassment, but she did like that final result, and the \"improvements\". a smirk graced Mia's face as her stomach rumbled with more gas once again. </span></div></div>",

Or notice how much larger everything was getting. Items originally easy for her to move become much harder, requiring standing on tiptoe and using both hands to accomplish. Her feet, already about six sizes too small for her heels, were having trouble maneuvering in the clumsy ivory heels. Her business suit was literally hanging off of her shrinking frame, the sleeves covering her now tiny arms. Mia's face had regressed into more of a cutesy look, slightly round and her eyes filled with wonder. Her breasts were gone, replaced by the washboard that was a small, six year old child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...where's the candy?\" she whined, looking at the remainders of what was once a respectable office. The bookcase had been trashed, the file cabinets demolished, stacks of paper thrown to the floor, and more importantly, every drawer of Deigo's desk had been ripped open and searched. And yet she had not found one piece of candy. Mia put her finger in her mouth and stared a little at the room around her. \"Why is everything so big?\" She glanced at her body, the suit hanging off. \"Why don't my clothes fit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was still busy contemplating the situation with what part of her adult mind remained, but instantly stopped as she spied the golden goose: a single bar of Hershey's chocolate, resting on the floor. She scrabbled quickly to it and ripped open the wrapper, tossing the trash aside into a pile of important-looking legal documents. Taking a small bite, she immediately fell upon the rest, having succumbed to the sugary delight and the sweet sensation of it hitting her tastebuds. Mia quickly finished the treat off and looked around for more, her head whipping around so much you'd think it would break her neck. Seeing none in the office, Mia trooped out of the room, eager to find more candy. Her clothes, still hanging on to her shrunken frame, gave her decency from perverts. However, Mia failed to notice a thin layer of pudge building up on her small form, going directly to her belly...</span></div></div>",

As she walked in, a groan could be heard followed by the clanking of a cup on mahogany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...guess I know better than to leave stuff out for you, kitten.\" Diego Armando chuckled, walking over and picking Mia up. Turning to face Marvin Grossberg, the owner of their law firm, he shook his head in disbelief as he returned to the couch he had been sitting on. \"What in the world am I going to do with you...I guess I should have listened to you when you told me she was curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrossberg cleared his through loudly, shifting his position before standing up and wincing. \"Oooh...ow ow...w...well.

Why don't you keep candy in your office?\" she chimed, gobbling up the chocolates as if they were popcorn. Each one caused her to push out just a little more, her skirt having been abandoned back in the office and her jacket working more as a dress. \"I only found one chocolate bar, and it wasn't even that big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa....wait...you ate the candy on my desk?!\" His dark skin paled a little, his eyes bulging as he continued to keep Mia on his lap, feeling her grow just a little heavier as she worked through the bag.</span></div></div>",

Taking another deep breath to calm himself down fully, he smiled confidently as everything clicked neatly into place in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.

Almost like her sister Maya. Well...I may as well try to explain everything. Here's hoping there's still SOME of the old Mia in that little fat cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing his throat and standing up, he walked over to Mia and put his hand on her head before kneeling next to her. \"Mia...I have a confession to make.

I had it measured exactly to match your body weight, but since you drank the coffee before eating it...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia beamed at Diego as he stumbled through the sentence, the tanned man unusually ruffled due to the size of his partner. Hugging him, she giggled lightly as she kissed him on the cheek. \"Don't worry! I'll be fine! It was really really good chocolate after all, so there's no reason why I should get sick, right?\" she said childishly, her face still shining with happiness as she pulled away from her senior. \"And even if I do, Big Brother Armando will take care of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-big brother?\" Diego sputtered, looking at the little girl in disbelief as he stood. Shaking his head once more to regain his composure, he looked back down at Mia and, with another deep sigh, smiled again. \"Y...yeah. You shouldn't get sick. But before you have any more snacks, you have to promise me that no matter how hungry you'll get you'll let me know, okay? You can't go worrying me about what you're eating, kitten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Mia said with the same wide smile, nodding and causing her round face to develop the slightest hints of a double chin and the dimples on her cheeks to grow a little more pronounced.</span></div></div>",

As usual, there was a small stack of papers awaiting her on her desk; a few memos here and there.  She sighed to herself as she hung up her purse and went over to her desk to see if any new cases had arrived.

Setting the package down of her desk she looked upon it and decided to open it by herself to savor the surprise for herself.

Come on Wright, its only the first day and we can catch up on everything tomorrow. Phoenix stood there for a few seconds perplexed at Mia's decision. All the while Mia smiled at him with beautiful clear eyes, knowing he would listen. Phoenix though for a moment why shouldn't he take the day off. It would be a nice break from all the work he had to do. Finally he decided to go along wth it. \"Alright then, I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

The tape ran across the box cover all the way from one end to th other. Mia, frustated at the work she had to do complained to  herself a bit. \"Oh come on, stupid packaging\". Mia used her slender toned fingers to grab at the handle in front of her and pulled it revealling a pair of scissors on top of some papers and envelopes.

Her calves had kept their tone, though it was slightly softer to the touch. Slowly moving her hands up each leg, she felt the smoothness that her extra weight lent to her legs. Moving up to her butt, she noticed that while it was larger, it was still shapely, almost enticing to her. Turning around, and at this point stripping back to bra and panties to better assess her body, she looked at the area she feared the most: her stomach. There was soem slight softness there, but she didn't have jelly rolls or a potbelly, only the faint beginning of love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her examination forward, Franziska reached possibly the most pleasing aspect of her changes: her new breasts. Cupping them gently, she noticed they felt warm to her touch. <i>I never did admit it to myself, but I was always jealous of Mia Fey in this department.</i> Franziska actually felt like a woman who did not need to bull her way through men at this moment: she could merely walka nd they would clear her path for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her arms, there wasn't any changes there, just a slight softness covering the muscles she knew lay beneath. Her face was unchanged.

While it was true that her figure had changed in one night, it hadn't changed in a bad way in her eyes. Looking at her much larger breasts, the formally flat-chested Franziska felt a surge of pride at them, as well at her expanded rear. As for the rest of her body, Franziska admitted that she liked the feeling of softness her body had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always thought gaining weight was a foolish idea, but now,...\" Franziska mumbled to herself. She was happy and interested in the fact that she had gained an hourglass figure through last night's binge. For most of her life, Franziska had been secretly envious of other women and their figures when compared to hers. It seemed that puberty had been unkind to Franziska, as she had been flat chested and without any curves for most of her life, so naturally she was over joyed to see she had finally gotten what she had been secretly desired for so long, and all she had to do was gain some weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranziska thought about this. The idea of gaining weight  seemed like an idiotic idea to her before, but after seeing the effect it had on her body, she was having second thoughts. Seeing as how she was the last von Karma, Franziska tried to justify the act of gaining weight as helping her body to become perfect, as since she was walking the road of perfection, she naturally most have  the perfect body to match it. And if gaining weight was the way to do it, Franziska  would do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, thought Franziska was loathed to admit it, she liked it. She liked last night's binge, and how good it felt to be totally stuffed, and she wanted to stuff herself more. But most of all, she loved her new figure, and how beautiful she felt. She loved her new hourglass figure, and she wanted to make it bigger, to make up her years at being a flat-chested girl, and she wanted to start right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden hungry growl coming from her stomach interrupted Franziska's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I so foolishly hungry after all I ate last night?\" Franziska asked herself. Another growl came from her stomach, and Franziska shrugged, deciding to simply get something to eat and end her stomach's growls. But first, Franziska decided to put back her clothes on., though she had some difficultly putting back on her dress and skirt. She eventually succeeded in putting her clothes on, though they remained tight on her. Franziska looked at herself in the mirror, and noted  that the dress had starteched herself around her breasts, showing just how big they had gotten, and the top button showed signs of strain trying to hold in her breasts, while her butt poked out of her skirt. She made a mental note to buy larger clothes for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother growl acme from Franziska's stomach, reminding her to get something to eat. She walked out of her room, feeling her thighs rub against each other, and into her office. She looked at the fridge and remembered how it was full of cakes last night, so she thought that perhaps there was still something in there. She walked over to the fridge, ready to see if there was still something in it to fill up her stomach's hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Franziska opened the fridge she found that it was... </span></div></div>",

She stripped down to her bra and underpants (sky blue, to match her hair), and sized herself up. Her breasts had seemingly gotten a teensy bit smaller and plump, but nothing like what she had fealt earlier. Besides, they couldn't grow too big TOO fast, right? (COUGHCOUGHLOGICALCOUGHCOUGH). She rubbed her small, curved butt. It was hard and stiff, just like she had kept it for months. But her belly jutted out a good inch or two. She groped it tenderly, frowning. It wasn't necesarily a good feeling....  it was just too HARD to her. Maybe she could soften it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! My outfit! Good lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly strapped it on, but the buttons squeezed hard against the straps. She looked definitley like she was beginning a pregnancy!

So, she made herself a big continental breakfast and ate like a woman starved. About halfway through, she started to feel full, but managed to finish up and headed for work, having satisfied her stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, until lunchtime, that is. Her stomach was roaring for food, and Ema didn't want to deny it that pleasure. She headed over to a local restaurant and ordered as much as she could eat, which was a lot. A half-hour later, Ema had realized that she was late. In a rush, she paid the bill and took the leftovers with her. Throughout the rest of the day, she appeased her hunger by snacking on dough cakes, as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she got home, she re-heated the leftovers from lunch and chowed down, and after that, she made a large sundae, which she happily gobbled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for over two weeks, until her superiors had finally had it with the overgrown detective and kicked her out. By this time, Ema weighed approximately 275 pounds and was having trouble finding clothes that fit. With her job canned, Ema was in dire straits: if she couldn't find another job, and quick, she could kiss her whole lifestyle goodbye. That's when she saw two large posters: one was advertising an eating contest, with the winner recieving $10,000. Ema thought that $10k would be enough to live on until she could find another job. That's when she looked at another poster, and this one was asking for new talent for a BBW modeling magazine, with a starting pay of $250. While it wasn't as much as the prize money being offered at the contest, this would end the need to find a job, if she was accepted. She was torn about which opportunity to take.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also, an added bonus to doing the modeling gig is that getting clothes that aren't on the verge of bursting at the seams would no longer be a problem, leaving more money on the better things in life namely science-related items and more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll head down to that magazine's headquarters...\" thought Ema before her gut interrupted her train of thought with a growl. \"...Tomorrow. Might as well give myself more of an edge at getting the job if I keep eating. After all, the bigger I am, the better!\" She concluded before taking a slip from the bottom of the flyer with the number and location of the magazine's HQ and started to waddle away to the nearest buffet, munching on some Snackaroos to tide her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, she was sitting in the waiting room of the magazine, simply named \"Extra Large\", polishing off a jumbo bag of her favorite treat before throwing it away in the trash next to her and opening up another bag. Ema shifted her weight in the chair a bit and adjusted her skirt a bit before getting back to her snacks. The clothes she chose to wear to the appointment were basically the only clothes left that weren't dirty or missing buttons thanks to her growing frame, it also happened to be the same clothes she always wore as a detective, but at a much larger size with the exception of the gray skirt she chose as a more comfortable alternative than the skin-tight pants she wore when she was still thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her outfit was clean and nothing was broken or torn, it was still very small for the 275 pound former detective. Ema couldn't close the top button on her blue dress shirt as her breasts were so large that the pressure from being pressed together would cause the button to pop out. The same situation was with the bottom button, her belly poking out and over the skirt's waistband in proud defiance. Ema was also careful not to drop anything as she (rightfully) feared that if she tried bending down to pick it up, the skirt would rise up to show the world her panties that were on their way to becoming a thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes passed with the only sounds being Ema's chewing until the receptionist, a chubby woman who looked barely more than half of Ema's weight told her that everyone is ready to see her now. Ema dumped the rest of her second bag into her mouth, threw it away in the trash and heaved her bulk out of the chair and waddled into the next room (choosing to lick any stray crumbs off her fingers first.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

At first, Ema was a bit awkward at the job, but eventually, she took a shine to it and her fame started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the younger Skye sibling was told she was getting her picture taken for her first cover story for the magazine's next issue. Along with that, it will also be her first shot where she will be wearing nothing but a lab coat (at her insistence), which gave her another case of the first time jitters and as such, she was always eating something to calm her nerves every chance she got since she was informed of this news 2 weeks after she started working. By the time she went into Extra Large's photo studio, her popularity wasn't the only thing that grew as she gained an extra 30 pounds, making Ema 310 pounds of modeling blubber! She examined herself in the changing room's mirror after taking off her clothes, looking at where all of the extra poundage went. Her face was rounder and grew a third chin and while her breasts, thighs and hips were an inch or two bigger, it was her stomach that took the bulk of her gain thanks to constantly stuffing herself to the gills. It hanged over her crotch and seemed to be divided in half with a horizontal line across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma took this all in, feeling at peace, while absent-mindly rubbing her gut. \"You know, this job is the best thing I ever did. But I should take up on the offer to get enough exercise to keep moving around if I'm going to keep this up, scientifically speaking.\" she said to herself as she put on the lab coat. She tried to button it to close it up a bit only to realize that the coat was designed with no buttons at all. \"Figures.\" she muttered as she opted to hold it as close as possible to cover her nipples, though her belly took care of covering up her lower half. \"Well, if it's going to be that way, might as well improvise.\" as she waddled out of the changing room, still holding the ends of the coat as close as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks later, Ema opened up her mail while eating a sandwich to see herself on the cover of Extra Large with her standing slightly to the side and blushing as she tried to cover her breasts with the coat and a caption reading \"Skye's the limit: Who says science is boring?\" She scowled at the idea of science ever being considered boring in the first place until she saw the next piece of mail being a $2000 bonus for both doing the cover AND breaking 300 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was thinking of what she could spend that bonus on, the phone rang and Ema answered it thinking it was the magazine calling but it was really...</span></div></div>",

She was startled, causing all of her fat to jiggle for a second, except for her stomach which only stopped when she put her left hand (putting down the rest of the sandwich in order to free it up) to make it stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lana? Is something wrong?\" asked Ema in surprise. Over the years, the Skye siblings lived their lives a bit further away from each other, even after Lana was released from jail, usually calling when something was urgent though they do make visits to each other when they have the time. However, Ema's recent changes in lifestyle made her reluctant to talk to her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing is wrong. I just got back from out of the country. How have you been?\" replied Lana, still maintaining her calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma breathed a sigh of relief. \"Good, she didn't see me in that magazine.\" she thought. \"Oh, I've been fine. Just...kind of going through some weird times right now\" answered Ema with a bit of a laugh at her choice of words regarding what has happened in her life recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can tell me all about them soon because I'm actually on my way to see you. I'll take you out to eat so maybe you can eat something for once.\" said Lana with a soft chuckle. \"I'll be there in about 5 minutes so you should get ready. See you then.\" she finished before hanging up, leaving Ema in a bit of a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot! What am I going to do? How am I going to explain all of THIS?!\" screamed Ema, grabbing her gut and love handles and shook them for emphasis before resorting to what she always did when she got nervous: eating. She picked up the rest of her half-eaten sub and starting shoving it into her mouth as she waddled back to her bedroom to pick out something to wear since the plus-sized bathrobe she wore to get the mail from her mailbox right outside her apartment door won't do. She opened her closet, filled with outfits she either bought or took from her job and eventually picked out a light sweater with a knee-high skirt. Nothing she has could ever cover up the extra 200 pounds she put on, but at least Ema knows that since she just bought it yesterday, her stomach or any of her rolls won't poke out which was an inevitability as she kept gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was finishing putting her clothes on, the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second!\" shouted Ema as she lumbered to the door, starting to get out of breath from her sudden rushing to and from her bedroom. She hunched over slightly to take a break before opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside was Lana, but she did look any different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Ema had most of her fat distributed into her stomach, the bulk of Lana's went to her hips, thighs and butt, causing her thighs to touch together while standing and the seat of the sweatpants to be a bit more strained than the rest of the pants. In fact, Lana's lower half was almost has large as Ema's despite being 80 pounds lighter. However, a large potbelly was sticking out of her clothes, her breasts were two cup sizes larger and Lana's face was puffed up with a second chin underneath her original one. In addition, there was a little smear of mustard on the left edge of Lana's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?!\" said both of the Skye sisters at once. \"How did you get so-\" they continued again at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, let's just have a seat and I'll explain first\" said Ema. She turned around and waddled to the living room with Lana following her. The two sisters sat across from each other in chairs that could barely fit their bottoms. Ema grimaced, concluding that she'll have to use her bonus on larger furniture as soon as possible but went on to explain how at first, she ate out of depression but eventually stopped caring as much until she got too big for the police department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though when I get nervous, I just want to eat until I can't take another bite.\" said Ema, then she patted her enormous gut and added \"Which is taking longer these days.\" with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing for work then?\" asked Lana<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I got a job as a model for a magazine. I just got a bonus for breaking 300 pounds and I can keep some of the clothes from the shoots. In fact, I can lend you some of the clothes that don't fit me anymore if you want.\" answered Ema. \"But what about you?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ema decided that she should enter all of the contests and make them her primary source of income. Ema looked over the pamphlet again and did the math: there were a total of 25 contests going on in the next two months (some of them taking place the day after a previous one), each a prize of $10,000. 10,000 multiplied by 25 is $250,000, which is double her annual salary as a detective! If she could win them all and saved at least half of each prize in the bank, she could have enough to last through any dry spells of contests, if there ever was anything like an off-season for eating. The pamphlet didn't go into that much of detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ema's new plan started. Every day that she didn't have a contest to join, she spent most of her time training by frequenting all-you-can-eat buffets to have, quite literally, all she could eat with the rest of her free time spent shopping for what she needs (usually just food) and lounging about her apartment, waiting for her stomach to digest everything so she could eat more, either take-out or from her kitchen. On contest days, she wouldn't eat anything until the contest, letting her hunger be more motivation to tear into anything placed in front of her and never stop until she wins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the last contest, Ema waddled into her apartment, dropping the check by the door and plopped down on the couch. As she sat there to catch her breath and wipe the sweat from her forehead, she thought about how every thing in her world had changed. At first, she would barely win or come in second place but as her \"training\" and competitions continued, her appetite increased so Ema started winning five minutes before the rest, then ten minutes, and then twenty minutes with room to spare for some of the food the disqualified contestants didn't touch. Of course, the increase in Ema's appetite was due to Ema growing fatter until her current weight of 400 pounds, most of her new fat went straight to her stomach, hips and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of her weight gain, Ema looked like a different woman than before, making some changes out of apathy. Her wardrobe was nothing but sweatsuits as she preferred something that could stretch when she was eating and plenty of them have permanent stains from her meals. Ema also let her hair grow out long enough to reach her lower back and she rarely wears makeup as it tends to smear when she's eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma grumbled when she got a look at herself in a mirror on her way to the kitchen. She'd have to get a haircut soon as she found the hair catching in some of her folds and when it falls in front of her face when she's trying to eat to be annoying. Also, she noticed that her sweatpants were getting too tight again, so she'd have to find a bigger pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ema has a bigger problem. As her weight sky-rocketed, it was obviously getting harder to move, both in her apartment and outside. In fact, she was almost late to her most recent eating contest as she had to ride the train and then walk since she was too big for a cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, she had to do something. It turns out there were more contests year-round and Ema doesn't want to miss a single one for the money and all of the fun she had in each contest. She racked her brain trying to figure out what to do. She could go to a gym, either to (1) strengthen her muscles or (2) shed some of the weight. Or she try something else like (3) using her scientific equipment to make something that could solve the problem or (4) just ask for help from someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((The \"try something else\" option can also be an author's choice. If you want any of the 5 choices, please make room for others to write one of the other paths.))<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The reason why is that everyone at the gym couldn't stop making rude comments about her weight and instead of instructing her on how to build muscle, they were trying to make her hire a trainer to monitor her diet and stick to fat-burning techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nerve of those guys! If they don't want to help me, I'll do it myself!\" fumed Ema as she squeezed into a seat on the train to go to a department store. Once there, she bought several sets of barbells and a machine to do leg lifts, paying extra for her purchase to be delivered at her apartment, along with putting it together AND taking her in the truck with them (a request that concerned the employees if the truck could hold everything with her until Ema dropped an extra $500 on the table.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything is said and done, Ema had a small personal gym ready to go. Though all of movement made her sweaty and tired to think about doing anything so she settled ordering a heap of take-out food for her lunch, after-lunch meal, pre-dinner snack, dinner, dessert and her midnight snack until she fell asleep on the couch, the TV left on.</span></div></div>",

Her sweatshirt was starting to function as a makeshift bra, which worked out great for Ema as a few weeks ago she decided to go bra-less since putting one on with the hooks was too much of a hassle, and the collar was stretched so her ample cleavage was perfectly visible. Her sweatpants weren't in any better shape as they were tighter than the sweatshirt and when Ema tried to adjust them, she started to have doubts on how long they will be able to last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ema got into her makeshift gym, she had to sit down on the leg lift machine because she was starting to get winded from the short walk, though it was a tight fit even though it was assembled with the widest option available for the seat. Once she caught her breath, she figured that she might as well start her routine with some leg lifts. But she could only manage doing two reps with the lowest weight possible before panting for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...jeez...This is harder...than I thought...\" complained Ema in between gasps and drenched in sweat. As she tried to get up to grab something to drink, she brushed her giant butt against a part of the machine that caught her sweatpants and the next thing Ema knew she heard a loud ripping sound as her sweatpants burst open, at first a small tear until her fat caused the rip to spread until her entire butt was exposed, revealing a pair of panties that were wedged into a thong of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" Ema was getting annoyed about all of the setbacks so far as she slowly waddled to her bedroom to take off her clothes.</span></div></div>",

While she complained and moaned about all of the moving around and having no pants that fit her anymore, she just ripped her sweatpants off, took off her sweatshirt, made sure the blinds were all closed and got right back to work only decked out in a bra she put on (noting that it was a bit more comfortable despite the work to put it on) and her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just as exhausted when she was trying to do the leg lifts, but Ema pushed through it because if she quit every time she got tired, she would have been immobile already. However, she made a mental note to stop after 5 more reps and eat enough food to make sure she isn't burning that many calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis addition to her habits went on for another month, each day she would eat her usual amount (i.e. eat until she is stuffed) and then work out until she was too hungry to work out then it was back to stuffing her face. When the day before her next contest rolled around, Ema was looking at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma naturally grew bigger and she is now up to 450 pounds. Though her face, breasts, butt and especially her globe of a belly expanded with more fat, her arms and thighs looked a little bit more firmer. There was still a lot of fat padding them to disguise any hope of muscle definition but Ema definitely felt stronger than she had before and able to lift heavier things, especially her massive frame without getting tired so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ema managed to order more clothes to fit her new weight (aside from some sweatsuits that feel loose on her, she also ordered a rather skimpy workout uniform to avoid having nothing to wear if something ripped again), she neglected to do much of anything in regards to a haircut as her hair, if it isn't tied into braids or a ponytail, now has reached near the bottom of her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should probably get this taken care of after tomorrow.

She was certainly overweight, Ema could see two chins accompanying her normal one and the fancy vest and long sleeved shirt with two large mounds on the shoulders had to be custom-made to fit her gut and breasts that looked to be a few inches and cups smaller than Ema's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's not as big as me. What were those guys talking about?\" Ema mumbled while walking closer to eye this new person. When Ema moved around the speaker, her mouth opened with shock as she saw why people would think that Ema might be in trouble this time. Ema may have a bigger chest or belly but this girl had the biggest ass she had ever seen. It was twice the size of Ema's and Ema is a girl who can take up an entire bench when she sits down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most amazing thing was that this lady was still wearing a skirt but before Ema could make any calculations about what size it would be, how much it must cost or even how can this woman even stand or think about bending over, the lass in question noticed Ema staring at her and promptly whipped her, her mounds of fat softened the blow but it still stung and unnerved Ema enough to yelp in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is impolite to stare, you foolish fool of a woman!\" shouted the woman \"Now say what you want or you'll receive another lashing from my whip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma, surprised at this woman's aggressive manner and rubbing her stomach where the whip hit her, decided to introduce herself fast and said \"S-sorry about that.

This...this is just a handicap I put on myself! A von Karma is always perfect, even when they do not look as such!

Ema wound up needing three chairs and Franziska kept whipping the stagehands for more chairs but they ran out after giving her a fourth chair and so folds of her fat was over the ends of the two outer chairs and the prosecutor's mood remained sour as she kept squirming to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma couldn't help but smirk at Franziska's misfortune but the blue-haired woman caught her and said \"Hmph! Still have no manners after my lashings, I see. But I guess that's to be expected from someone who let themselves go like you, Miss Ema Skye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I let myself go in the right places to win something like this.\" retorted Ema as she patted her stomach \"Try not to blame your loss on not having enough chairs to hold your giant butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you foolish...!\" Franziska was about to whip Ema for that comment on her shape when the whip fell to the ground away from her. Franziska struggled to reach it but her fat prevented her from bending farther than several inches and she gave up after several tries and wiped the sweat off her forehead. Then she came up with an idea. \"If you are so confident, Miss Ema Skye, why not make this contest more interesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Ema<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean a wager. A von Karma always seizes the perfect victory and I have no need for the money from these foolish games, but when you lose your winning streak, you will also never enter another contest again no matter how much you need the money...or the food.\" declared Franziska. \"But...if you do manage to beat me, you can name your own condition. It can be money, a new home, anything. Do we have a deal?\" she concluded as she stretched out a chubby hand towards Ema.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma shook her hand and said \"You're on! I hope you are ready for what I have in mind, von Karma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the whistle was blown signaling the start of the contest and the contestants tore into the food of choice, pies. One by one and sometimes by waves, people started to bow out voluntary or when they run away to the nearest place to vomit until there was only two people left: Ema and Franziska.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the bloated beauties were still eating at a break-neck pace and when one of them gained an advantage, the other caught up soon enough. Ema was caught off-guard by the fact that this is the first time in a long time that she didn't have a giant lead but she remained focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, one of the girls threw down their last pie plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who was the winner?</span></div></div>",

I shouldn't have had those hot dogs before hand.

But you shall lose eventually like a foolish fool like you always will. Now what do you want as your reward so I may leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma thought about what exactly she could ask from the fat prosecutor. She was well-off now financially though it could never hurt to have more money. But the other thing Ema has on her mind is simply social interaction. Ever since Ema got booted from the force, her entire life has been nothing but eating, sleeping and more recently, working out to make sure she's not immobile. No one really called her and when she went out in public, most of the people stared or made snide comments about her weight. While Franziska certainly has an attitude problem, she at least has an inkling of what it is like being incredibly fat and thus an opening for any sort of interaction, even if they would do nothing but eat. But Franziska seems to want to try and dethrone Ema again and anything time spent together could mean Franziska could win next time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat option does Ema pick?</span></div></div>",

The German prosecutor couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? For me to be your friend? What a foolish, foolish request for a fool to make!\" said Franziska, who couldn't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish or not, that's what I want. So you in or are you going to back out of our deal?\" asked Ema, not backing down or being fazed by Franziska's dismissal of her wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine. A von Karma never goes back on their word. We shall be...friends.\" Franziska plainly stated (with some difficulty at uttering the last word.)<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the beginning of a very odd friendship. Ema was always raring to go spend time with Franziska, excited that she has someone to relate to regarding her weight though the prosecutor was unwilling and uncomfortable being almost dragged over the city to either shop, eat or whatever else Ema wants to do (for example, one outing to the movies failed horribly when the two of them couldn't fit into any of the theater's seats.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut over time, Ema and Franziska got used to each other's personality. Franziska got used to being so \"informal\" and acting more casual around Ema while Ema got used to Franziska being so stubborn and competitive, especially when they were eating.  From time to time, Franziska suddenly turned their normal dinner into a repeat of the contest where they first met and while it was mostly the same result, Ema was occasionally caught off-guard (or filled up earlier in the day) that Franziska won a few times to her delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese impromptu contests and their appetites in general caused both of the girls to gain weight. It wasn't until recently that Ema convinced Franziska to check her weight (clinging to a part of her denial/reluctance to accept that she's overweight) and it was revealed that she was 400 pounds which meant more weight to her gigantic rear and the woes from being so fat was getting to her like it was getting harder to move herself around, especially through narrow halls and doorways. Several times, Franziska had found herself stuck and relied on Ema to push her out which always made the two girls blush when their flesh touched each other (especially when Ema had to place both hands on Franziska's ass.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, Ema was just about ready to have Franziska work out with her, assuming she could find room for the both of them to be in comfortably. It was certainly working for Ema because while she gained weight as well, she only gained 20 pounds, making her a total of 470 pounds yet she felt like she was moving around like someone 100 pounds slimmer than her. Also Ema finally got her hair cut to the style she had before she started gaining weight and started to wear makeup again when she went out with Franziska, who was also willing to set her up with the same plus-size clothing supplier that the prosecutor uses to wear something other than stretched-out sweats all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, the two girls were sitting in Ema's apartment (the first time Franziska was there), working on their pre-dinner meal when Franziska got off the couch (her massive butt taking up all available seating) to use the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Ema heard a cry of \"EMA! COME HERE!\" and lumbered off into the hallway towards her friend to find out what the outburst was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would like that to happen outside of a dream...\" Franziska finished before going to Ema's living room, trembling a bit after she stopped being so aggressive for a moment and confessed her feelings. Ema followed her into the living room, digesting what she said. More than friends, like lovers? Ema had also fantasized about the two of them a little (like right now when she was watching Franziska walk in front of her) but was it time to swear off guys altogether?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ema remembered what started down her path of obesity: the depression combined from messing up the test to be a forensic investigator so many times and that prosecutor, Klavier Gavin teasing her so much. Well, now she's fat with a hobby that pays far more than any police work and a friend willing to be with her as part of a couple. Ema made up her mind and waddled over to the couch Franziska was standing next to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Franziska, here's what I think\" Ema said before embracing Franziska in a squishy hug, their large stomachs bumping into each other, and kissed the blue haired prosecutor on the lips. Franziska's eyes widened before taking the impulsive \"answer\" in stride and shifted her bulk so Ema would sit on the couch and Franziska laid on top of her, kissing Ema deeply with her tongue while Ema squeezed a part of Franziska's wide ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two's moment was ruined however by the couch's legs breaking, sending the two down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is certainly quite the answer\" Franziska said with a smile as they try to pick themselves off the floor.<br>\r\n\"Next time, let's make sure something can hold the two of us before we try that again.\" Ema groaned, rubbing her butt.</span></div></div>",

If she were awake she would've estimated that the overeating was starting to affect her system but ala the poor woman wasn't and as she tossed and turned her brain began to engulf her deeper into her dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma wasn't sure where she was until she heard the sound of several dozen voices and the familiar sound of crunching that arose whenever she'd eat her favorite snacks. Ema then realized she was in the ever familiar courtroom she'd been to many a time. As she continued to munch away at her snacks she noticed defense attorney Apollo Justice (with magician Trucy Wright by his side) and that man...Klavier Gavin explaining the current legal case to all in attendance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma couldn't quite make out what Gavin was saying, something about a Van Latte who was found dead inside his coffee shop...or something close to that nature, Ema wasn't too sure and her continuous eating wasn't helping her hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case a short time later she was called up to the wittiness stand, having finished her snacks she threw the empty bag away before walking over to the stand. Amazingly she was able to give a detailed testimony to both Justice and Gavin but she also noticed she was at her normal weight despite the eating feast from the other night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma thought of it as weird since she was sure she'd be at least a bit chunkier then before but dismissed the thought as Apollo began his cross-examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justice pressed on her statements she did her best to back them up as best she could. But something strange was happening within her, she could feel it, whenever Apollo pressed she felt her clothes a bit tighter. No one else seem to catch on, even Justice who had a \"gift\" for seeing people's nervous-born traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless the pressing continued and the pressing on Ema's clothes continued as well. Was she actually swelling with each of her statements? She wasn't sure but she sure did feel like she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes went on and by now Ema was definitely fatter to a certain degree, not overweight but she was \"heavier\" then before but just like when this strange occurrence had began no one seem to take notice and it was as if she had always been of that body weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma was a bit taken back when Apollo loudly objected to her last statement. The young man stated his piece and just as Ema was going to respond she heard a loud rumbling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick-witted Apollo stood silent as he, Trucy, Gavin, and everyone else heard the sound come from Ema's belly. Shocked and wide-eyed she blushed heavily before mentally telling her stomach to shut up. But her belly would have none of it as she winced in what appeared to be a sting of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned in what appeared to be sudden agony as her stomach rumbled one last time before literally erupting out of her uniform! The rest of her body soon followed in her belly's example as a sea of flab exited or perhaps in this case became Ema's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic-stricken Ema could barely make out Apollo asking Trucy if this was one of her magic tricks which the much younger girl denied having any part in. Justice then wasted no time grabbing Trucy by the arm and leading her out of the courtroom as Ema continued to grow in size and weight. Klavier as well knew when to make a hasty exit once a \"performance\" had gone bad but not before the elderly Judge forced the musician to carry him to safety, Ema wasn't sure if Gavin was annoyed at the prospect of carrying the judge or brushed it aside as he just like everyone else wanted to get the hell out of the room that was being shallowed up by her ever-growing blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMove and more she grew and Ema could feel her sides begin to press against the walls of the courtroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please come back! Anyone, Apollo, Trucy, Mr. Wright, ...Klavier! Please help me!\" she shouted as best she could as Ema's fatten self continued to overtake more and more of the courthouse, her girth having escaped the confines of the courtroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe courthouse was just about to give up to Ema's massiveness as the young detective began to feel her head sinking the flab around her face. As a tear came down her right eye a vision of Ema's older sister Lana appeared in her mind. Ema mumbled Lana's name just as the courthouse's walls came down and her mind went blank...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a ear-bursting scream Ema jumped from her sleeping position, her heart beating like crazy as the cold sweat poured down her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her slightly plump stomach, Ema recalled her nightmare. Giving it a soft pat she stood up and walk out of her room toward the kitchen for a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should slow down this weight-gain of mine, take it nice and easy...no need to rush and I don't want \"that\" (recalling her dream) to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma figured it was more than likely impossible for her dream to become a reality but she was so shaken up she didn't want to take any chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe I could have a talk with Klavier tomorrow and see what his opinion is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDowning the last of the water in her glass, she walked off back toward her bedroom. Tomorrow was another day.</span></div></div>",

Although very hard channelings would cause many other spirit mediums to faint, Pearl was usually able to return to her body without one ounce of fatigue. So her sudden tiredness disturbed her a bit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl looked down at herself and her eyes grew big with shock. Pearl was normally short and skinny for her age, but now her midsection looked incredibly pudgy. She rushed over to a mirror in the corner of the room. Her reflection looked normal, but from the side view it looked like she had a pillow stuffed in her acolyte clothes. She stuck one hand under her robes and felt cool, squishy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door opened. Maya walked in, and her jaw fell to the floor when she saw her cousin. \u201cPEARLY? What happened to you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl was uncomfortable with her sudden weight gain and her cousin\u2019s strange actions. Tears started to well up in her eyes. \u201cMystic Maya, what\u2019s going oonnnnnnnnnnnnn?\u201d she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs chubby little Pearl stood their crying Phoenix came into the room. \u201cPearl, you\u2019re back\u2014WHOA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya crouched down to comfort Pearl. \u201cShh, Pearly, it\u2019s okay. What was the last thing you remember doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl sniffed. \u201cI-I-I w-was just training. I channeled a spirit and then\u2026well, I woke up just now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she was channeling a spirit\u201d Phoenix said. \u201cThat might explain why she was gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-gone, Mr. Nick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Pearls, you\u2019ve been missing for almost a day and a half. We were starting to get worried about you when you didn\u2019t show up last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was I doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you were in the middle of a channeling this whole weekend, I might have a fair guess of what you were doing. Well, not exactly you, of course, but someone else.\u201d Phoenix opened up a page in the newspaper. The picture on it showed a plump teenage girl running away from a buffet with an ice cream cone and a chicken leg. Although the food stains around her lips cloaked her face, it was easy to tell that her voluptuous body was stuffed into small robes, and her hair was done up in Pearl\u2019s signature pretzel ponytails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s that crazy girl who was eating all the food in the buffets and stores, right?\u201d Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. The police could never manage to capture her; she was amazingly fast for her size. It makes more sense if this girl was a spirit that Pearls accidentally channeled. Looks like she was dying to eat some food again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl, growing very afraid, started to cry again. Maya tried to comfort her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Pearly. You know that a spirit can\u2019t harm the medium it\u2019s possessing, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true,\u201d Phoenix added. \u201cAlthough in this case it seems that all the food this spirit ate had to go somewhere, and unfortunately Pearls got left with it.\u201d Phoenix and Maya tried to cheer Pearls up. They laid her on the couch, turned on her favorite TV program and even got her a bowl of her favorite ice cream, which was almost a disastrous move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Pearl,\u201d Phoenix said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can figure out who this rouge spirit is, and Maya could find out ways to make sure this never happens again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d Pearl said, starting to get a little more cheerful.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, she had never weighed this much before, but Pearl thought it made her look more grown up, and her belly jiggled whenever she poked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl had been snacking on treats Maya had been trying to cheer her up with all day, and when Phoenix brought Chinese take-out for dinner, Pearl ate more then her usual serving. She felt sleepy after this, so Maya went and tucked her into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl couldn\u2019t remember if she had any dreams that night. There was a strange, familiar sensation of flashing lights, but it happened so quick Pearl couldn\u2019t tell whether she had dreamed it or imagined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl stirred. She usually woke up before morning light to train before breakfast, but the sun was just rising and golden light came through the window. Pearl yawned, feeling slightly uncomfortable for some reason. She lifted her head, and gasped when she couldn\u2019t over the mound in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and dashed to the mirror in the corner of the room. Pearl was now chubby and plump all over. A large tummy poked out from her robes and over her waist. Her hips, tushie, and love handles were all flabbier, and her legs and arms looked a bit plumper. Her belly was the biggest thing, as it looked like she had swallowed two couch cushions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cried again, tears brawling from her face. Just as she started to cry Phoenix and Maya rushed into the room. \u201cOh, no,\u201d Phoenix said. \u201cI was afraid this had happened again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMystic Mayaaaa! Mr. Nick! What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Pearl sobbed huge, fat tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Pearly,\u201d Maya said, hugging her cousin. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix unfolded a newspaper. \u201cThe moment I saw the early release of today\u2019s newspaper, I knew I should be worried.\u201d The front page showed a picture of that mysterious fat girl running away from a mini-mart, with the headline FAT GIRL STRIKES AGAIN. \u201cWhen Pearls fell asleep, it looks like the spirit overtook her body again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is bad, Nick.\u201d Maya had a disturbed look on her face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that a spirit is supposed to posses a spirit medium against their will. This must be a powerful spirit, and since Pearly channeled her, the spirit must see Pearly as a portal to the real world and it could have power over her whenever she gets unconscious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there any way we can protect her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some powerful techniques, and I don\u2019t know any off hand. Come on, Pearly, we\u2019re going to go home to Kurain Village. The mediums there will know what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya got Pearl cleaned and dressed. The tubby child was too big for her small robes, as puffy skin poked out from any hole available. Maya and Peal walked to the train station.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because Iris was an unwilling accomplice to that murder, and she has been on her best behavior in detention, she\u2019s able to serve out the rest of her sentence under house arrest at the Hazakura property.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bikini led Maya and Pearl to a private channeling chamber. Maya was very confused. \u201cYou think the way to protect Pearly from this spirit is by making her gain weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot physical weight, my dear, spiritual weight. There have been a few times before when mediums have gained weight due to prolonged exposure to a certain spirit. It\u2019s one of the very few physical harms that spirit can make on the body they are possessing. It has to do with something about spirits can only return to the beyond they way they came out, so if they eat any food while being channeled it gets left with the medium. Sometimes these things go right over my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how exactly will this technique help Pearly?\u201d Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple, really. We\u2019re just going to make Pearl\u2019s spirit bigger than her body. I know it sounds strange, but it makes a little sense if you think about it in vague terms. A human spirit usually looks exactly like its body\u2019s physical appearance, barring death. Right now Pearl\u2019s spirit is currently as big as she is, so we\u2019re just going to plump up Pearl\u2019s spirit so that it looks bigger than her physical form. It\u2019s like shoving a cork into a hole. The spirit still fits within the medium, but from the other side the rogue spirits can see that there is too much soul for one person, and it deters them away because there\u2019s no room for them to sneak in and possess the medium. Follow me so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u2026\u201d Maya grimaced. \u201cHow abort you, Pearly?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll work, Mystic Maya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty, then! One Spiritual-Weight-Gain-Technique coming right up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBikini had Pearl sit in the middle of the room.  The tubby girl watched Maya and Bikini rushed around setting up candles and bowls of food in a circle around her. The food was important, Bikini said, because it would be used to fatten up Pearl\u2019s spirit. The bowls had to be placed in a complex arrangement so that the starches balanced the meats; the vegetables were directly across from the fruits, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is Pearl\u2019s favorite food?\u201d Sister Bikini asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChocolate chip cookies!\u201d Pearl exclaimed, hopping up and down in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGentle, girl, gentle\u2026\u201d Bikini said, signaling Pearl to sit still. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you don\u2019t move during the process.\u201d Bikini placed a bowl of cookies in front of Pearl. She sprinkled it with some water and drew a mystic symbol on the side of the bowl, as she had been doing with every bowl. \u201cThis will be the focal point for the technique, then, that we end with to return Pearl\u2019s spirit to her body. You have the defenses ready, Maya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Sister Bikini.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, we\u2019ll begin then\u2026Dash it all, where are the matches?\u201d Bikini and Maya looked around the room frantically for matches. When none were found, they ran out to a supply closet to get some, leaving Pearl alone in the room. She glanced at the bowl of cookies in front of her. Although she had gained weight over night, she hadn\u2019t eaten a single thing so far today. She leaned over ate grabbed some cookies and ate them. \u201cYummy!\u201d She was about to eat the rest when she heard Maya and Bikini return, so she sat back and acted like she hadn\u2019t moved at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, now we can begin! I\u2019ll start the technique, Maya, and you make sure Pearl\u2019s spirit doesn\u2019t leave this room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Bikini light all the candles that were placed between the bowls of food, and then sat back and did some chanting. Pearl felt very sleepy, and then she realized she was floating up away from her body. The light from the candles flared, and the image of a Magatama appeared around Pearl\u2019s spirit, keeping her in one spot in mid-air. As Maya concentrated on keeping Pearl in suspension, Bikini went around to each of the bowls in turn. She took the candle beside each bowl and used it to burn the food within that bowl. The food would be completely consumed by flame, leaving a spectral image of the food that would rise up towards Pearl\u2019s spirit. The spectral food would combine with Pearl\u2019s spirit, making it just a bit bigger every time. By the time Bikini reached the bowl of cookies, Pearl\u2019s spirit looked about twenty pounds heavier than her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cookies caught fire, Pearl could feel a burning sensation in her stomach. But wait, that was back in her body. Pearl\u2019s portly spirit fell back into the girl\u2019s form. Although the spirit was now much bigger than her body, all of the ectoplasmic wisps soon settled in their proper places. Pearl opened her eyes and blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHee hee!\u201d Bikini giggled. \u201cTechnique successful. Not a thing out of line!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, Pearly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel alright, Mystic Maya.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not 'bad' odd, but odd nonetheless. \"Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa, I feel...full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full? How? Your spirit should've stopped all of that by now...\" Maya Fey said. Pearl hiccuped, her belly jiggled, and it seemed to pooch out a bit more. Maya looked on as Pearl hiccuped three more times, adding another three pounds to her frame. Her eyes grew bigger than dinner plates at Pearl's sudden expansion. \"Wha-what?! That technique should've stopped the weight gain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl hiccuped again, but this time it looked like it added 5 pounds onto her already plump body, mostly in her thighs. They pushed tightly against her robes, the sides tearing a little. Her belly was beginning to strain the fabric of her robes, the purplish fabric clinging tightly to the growing dome. Sister Bikini had just noticed it, and was quickly rifling through a spiritual guidebook, trying to figure out what went wrong. Her pupils shrank as she read the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...I think we used the wrong seal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong seal?\" Maya asked confused, looking to Pearly as the younger girl hiccuped again, gaining another pound. \"Wrong seal?! Pearly's getting fatter...because of a wrong seal?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...the one for Spiritual Weight Gain technique and the Fulfilling Catalyst technique are on the same page...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister Bikini, what does the Fulfilling Catalyst do*hic*?\" Pearl asked, holding her belly as it pooched out another inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be frank, it makes the actual body large enough for the spirit to feel comfortable, which normally is only ten or twenty pounds to gain. Which is why you're hiccuping,\" she added, as Pearl hiccuped yet again. Her face was looking pudgier than before, \"And also why you're growing. Because we fattened up your spirit to be about twenty pounds heavier...you have to gain enough weight to satisfy it. There's a guide here for that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl hiccuped a couple more times, with Maya biting her nails out of her nervousness. Finally, with a sigh, Sister Bikini closed the book. \"There is a BIG problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A big problem? How big?\" Maya asked sharply, shifting her gaze towards Pearl. Pearl's breasts, no matter her age, had gone up to C-cups in normal standards. They rested atop a wonderfully shaped belly and thunderous thighs. Bikini scratched the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...big. As it turns out, a spirit the size of the person's body will make the person gain ten or twenty pounds. For every five pounds the spirit gains, the body must...gain...ten...more...\" Maya's eyes went wide again. Pearl started crying, realizing that she was going to be over forty pounds heavier soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mystic Mayaaaaa....I don't wanna be huge!\" the young girl cried, hiccuping more as the tears flowed. Her belly fat flowed out and began to cause small tears in her pinkish robes. At being close to 230 lbs. now, Pearl was now fatter than most kids her age by a large margin. She sobbed into her hands, her face ruddy with tears. \"I'm already so *hic* fat now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya took Sister Bikini by the shoulders and shook her hard. \"Listen...what is the final weight that Pearly will be before her spirit is satisfied?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....it says here...\"</span></div></div>",

Pearl let her and the woman took control. Pearl couldn\u2019t see or do much in the state but felt her body moving. She had a constant flow of food going into her by how her mouth is watering constantly and how full she was feeling. Her belly was pushing out and she felt like she was going to burst before it finally stopped. The spirit reappeared to her and said she\u2019s done and plenty full. Everything went to black before morning rays came and woke her up. Pearl looked at herself and saw her breasts were bigger as well as her belly over them. Not only that but Maya was there rubbing her stuffed belly. Mata told her everything that happened and was amazed she was able to eat so much even though she was possessed.</span></div></div>",

She went to the same near dark place she was at the last time and the spirit took over. Her mouth watered as her mouth filled with many different tastes filled her mouth and the food went down her throat. Pearl then remembered training to see what\u2019s going on when this happens. She did and saw the woman was constantly stuffing herself regardless what she was doing. She ended her stuffing spree at a buffet where she stuffed Pearls stomach to its limits. Maya was with her the whole time and can tell her cousin was seeing what\u2019s going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me help you satisfy yourself plus the woman you\u2019re in.\u201d Maya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands onto Pearls belly and focused.

Athena's mouth immediately dropped open as she saw the vast quantity of food that there was. There were meats piled everywhere as well as mounds of Italian, Mexican, Chinese and Indian foods as well as just about everything with desserts, too! Apollo sighed and sat down, he wasn't hungry, so he decided to make the bill smaller by not getting anything. Besides, he thought as he looked at Athena dash everywhere, they'd already have enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Athena came back from the buffet, with a plate piled high with foods! There were three steaks, an entire pizza, two full two litre bottles of coke, and six bean burritos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo's mouth dropped as he saw the giant plate of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena, are you out of your mind?! Why on earth have you got this much?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena merely smirked in response, Widget as green as Simon would describe <i>her</i> as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a growing girl, Apollo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Athena, if you eat all this, you'll be growing outwards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shaddup, Apollo! You know I've got a hollow leg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo sighed, meekly hoping Mr Wright wouldn't blame him for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena began digging in, starting with the pizza, and taking swigs of coke in-between each slice. She ate at a speed that most people would only dream of. It wasn't long at all before she had finished the entire thing. Athena patted her stomach that felt slightly rounder, but not enough to be noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.... <b>BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo's mouth dropped once again at Athena's massive burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Athena, l-learn some manners..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BURRRPPP</b> Sorry, <b>URP</b>-Apollo, I can't <b>BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPPP</b> Help it, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should stop now....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat suggestion seemed to genuinely surprise Athena as Widget turned yellow, then red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no! This train isn't stopping until the final destination!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Apollo's nervous gulp, Athena began chowing into her steak  as she continued , the sensation of fullness quickly becoming bigger and bigger as her stomach did the same. Eventually, as she finished her final steak, Athena picked up the bottle of coke and chugged it, delivering a mighty belch as she finished. Athena sat back in her chair, her round and soft belly now sticking strongly against her shirt, like she had swallowed a basketball. The extremely bloated girl was drawing a few looks, but she didn't care, as she sat massaging her big round belly. After several minutes of massaging and burping, Athena went back to her food. She picked up each bean burrito one by one, chomping through them like it was nothing before finishing them all and picking up the second coke bottle and chugging it down her, her round belly slowly pushing out further as she downed it. Eventually, Athena slammed the bottle down and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n..... Released a burp so loud that  everyone in the restaurant looked to see the source of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Athena's bottom three shirt buttons, which had been straining for some time, completely burst off, showing her big round soft belly to the world. It was round, like a beachball, with a completely smooth surface and a deep, deep bellybutton. Athena began rubbing her exposed gut as she....</span></div></div>",
