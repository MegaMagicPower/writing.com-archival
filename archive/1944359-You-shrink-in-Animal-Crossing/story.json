You can't make up your mind, though, before Labelle leaves the store, Mable right behind her. They must be heading off to have that tea that Labelle was offering. But Sable... She's still in the store, working at her sewing machine. And that means she is your only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek out from under the table, looking up at the huge brown anthropomorphic hedgehog. The sewing machine she's working at is pretty noisy, and it seems even louder considering your tiny size. You don't like the idea of approaching it, but it seems like the only way to reach Sable. You sigh and hurry along the floor of the Able Sisters shop, headed straight for Sable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog girl doesn't notice you as you approach, and you start to second guess yourself. She's enormous--you could easily get stomped by her if you aren't careful. Luckily, she's seated, so there's little chance of her stepping on you. But still... You eye her pawed feet warily as you approach her, and gather your courage to get her attention. You cup your hands to your mouth and scream her name.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The hedgehog turns off her sewing machine and looks around confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounded like the Mayor,\" she muttered. \"But... Much quieter than usual. Maybe the Mayor's outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call her name again, and her ears twitch. She looks around some more. Her snout twitches as she tries to sniff you out, and then, finally, she happens to look down. Her dark eyes stare down at you, and she remains looking at you for quite a few seconds. You wonder what she's thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I must be imagining things,\" she stammers at last. \"Maybe Mable is right... Maybe I'm actually not getting enough rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call out again, and Sable's eyes widen. \"No... I'm not just imagining it... Did... Did the Mayor actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog stands up from her seat and takes a big step towards you. You shake in fear as the floor shudders with her movement, but you remain still, allowing the giantess to examine you. She gets down on her knees and stares down at you with a look of awe on her freckled face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually shrunk!\" Sable says. \"But... That's... How did that even happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, and the hedgehog puts a paw to her chin, falling into thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just bizarre... Okay, um... Mayor, please hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sable reaches down for you with a white-furred paw. You're suddenly terrified at the thought of being grabbed, but you can't move. The anthropomorphic hedgehog's paw reaches you, its stubby digits curling around you in a tight fist. You squirm instinctively, but get a hold of yourself and stop quickly, allowing Sable to lift you off the floor and up to her face. You stare into her dark eyes as she stares at you inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Sable stands up and goes back to her seat, still holding you in front of her face. She sits back down and lowers you to the desk that her sewing machine is sitting on, and releases you from her tight grasp. You look up at her, glad that she didn't choose to crush you in her fist... but also scared of the fact that you are small enough to be held in a singe one of her paws in the first place. Being this small is frightening, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut will Sable act cruel, and make it even more frightening, or will she be a gentle giantess and seek to help you?</span></div></div>",

Even though all you had to go on was that she suggested tea and relaxation, it seemed like she was the gentle one in the trio of sisters. Sable and Mable began to walk away from the table they were all standing at, while Labelle sat there at the table, drinking her tea. You noticed that Sable was walking towards the door you were in front of, and could possibly step on you. At best, she might notice you, but you trusted Labelle more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Running on blind faith, you made your way across the floor, getting closer to her without anyone noticing you. You reached the bottom of the wooden stool, but you were a bit out of breath. You then looked up to see Labelle's massive form above you. Slowly, you kept raising your head to take it all in.(Keep in mind, liberties will be taken here.)<br>\r\n   Her petite paws covered by light purple flats, her moderately-sized hips and her equally large butt, her skinny waist, and small breasts, followed lastly by her gorgeous face, eye shadow and all.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   However, you were shaken from your thoughts as she said, \"Well, that's enough tea for one day.\" The giantess porcupine then placed her yellow mug on the table, and shifted in her seat. It was clear she was getting up. To where, exactly, you didn't know. But you had to get her attention. Your strength was back, and you were ready to climb. But just where would it be best to get her attention?</span></div></div>",

Pelly was busily sifting through the mail with her white plumaged hands looking for a very special letter. Today was her birthday. In her fantasy, the mail carrier Pete would toss her a sweet card and maybe her most wanted gift: a kiss. But it was a dying dream. Her shift was ending, her sister, Phyllis is set to clock in soon, and Pete out. But maybe when Pete returns from his last run, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have one, last delivery to make...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         Or maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just clap beaks with Phyllis. Pelly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s older sibling was dear to her, but Pete seems to have the sweets with her, but not poor, old Pelly. With a sigh, Pelly resumed sorting mail in the empty post office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0          Unbeknownst to her, she was not alone. You were directly under her seat, half-a-centimeter tall. You quickly recognize the danger of your situation: she had a rolling chair. If you were in the path of the wheels, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be little more than a smudge after the fact. You needed to get away from here, fast. The chair is too slippery to climb, but there is another potential escape route. A butter-yellow pelican foot dangles from above, rife with plenty of handholds. You latch on. Fortunately, its owner doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice. As you climb higher and higher, Pelly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs gently swing. A silky smooth lavender dress is draped over you. With a good leap, you could latch on. Although, if you fail, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re gonna have a nasty fall. So, which will it be? Make the risky jump, or resume climbing Pelly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leg?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather not risk splattering on the ground.<br>\r\n     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0      When you reach Pelly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knee, the obvious hits you. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re under a girl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dress. You look around. Pelly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purple dress is your sky, filtering the little light that bleeds through into shades of lilac. You can see, barely, the towering form of the pelican working diligently, quietly. She isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware of the sneaky, little individual perched atop her knee. She is aware, however, that her bloomers were pushing up uncomfortably against her. Pelly glanced around to make sure she was alone. It was a simple fix, but Pelly wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be caught dead with a wing up her dress, even for something innocent such as this. It was improper, unlady-like. Once her solidarity was confirmed, she casually put her pen down and reached her feathers under her dress.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0          You saw your purple sky part and a ginormous, fluffy, milk-white wing descend from the heavens. Like a snake, it slithered past you, between her legs, and slipped under her puffy underthings. It pushed against the puffy shorts and lifted them up. She was adjusting herself. You could clearly see into her bloomers and you learned an interesting tidbit about Pelly: besides the aforementioned undergarments, she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wear anything. No panties. Nothing to withhold her pussy from taking a momentary breath of fresh air. You watch as her wingtip buried itself inside her undergarments and under her bottom. You hear a scratching noise. She was scratching her taint. Her bloomers billow like a bedsheet in the breeze as the air inside is shuffled about.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0          Although things started rather innocuously, it was quickly turning dirty. Pelly couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop thinking about Pete and felt an aching in her loins. She was thinking of his dreamy eyes, his goofy jokes, his adorable laugh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0          Pelly remembered one time it was raining. Pete barreled into the office soaking wet. He took off his shirt to let it dry for a bit before he went back out. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know she was watching. She did her best to make it look like she had her beak buried in paperwork, but she saw everything. His pearly feathers were glistening, slightly ruffled in the cutest way. Her right leg began to quiver. She always did this when she was nervous --- or horny.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0          Down below, your world was rocking. Your safe spot was no longer safe. You quickly thought of a new refuge. Her chair was an obvious answer, but if she ever decided to adjust her seating, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d likely be crushed. Is there another place to hide?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A dirty thought flashes in your mind. You could hide in her bloomers. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re soft, probably comfortable. Plus...other benefits. Her bloomers are still open, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s practically inviting you in! One hopes that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll withdraw her hand soon, though.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her wing was still in there, doing its thing. You had assumed she was itching an itch, but you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure now. Either way, it likely didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter to you anyhow, considering you just made the choice to slip into a bird-woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undergarments. You arrive at the opening. Her wing was above, moving up and down and cupped against her groin. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty of space for you to enter, and you do. You crawl soldier-style across the cotton fibre floor. Pelly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wing is to your left, still going at it. You doubted that it was a simple itch now. This was confirmed when you reached the front of her underwear. Her feathers were massaging the bottom of her vagina, spiraling in tight little circles. Above, you heard Pelly give a cute little puff. She was enjoying herself. You were enjoying the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0    Pelly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeks glowed a vivid red. Her eyes darted about, looking for any sign that someone was about to enter the post office. There was none, so Pelly continued.<br>\r\nShe thought of Pete. Their eyes locked, breaths in sync, their beaks touching. Her tailfeathers twitched. She could feel Pete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue in her beak. She blurted a tiny squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     Inside, the passion of the normally restrained girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s masturbation was shocking. She plunged two feathers in and out at lightning speed. Sometimes, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pull them out, briefly, slathered in her juices, and give her sex a slap or two before plunging them back in. Her groin shook to-and-fro as she wobbled in her seat. Occasionally, the pelican would lovingly mumble a few words, then squeak as she swallowed her moans. <br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0       You were beginning to worry. Her masturbation was getting a little...vehement. Wild. Her entire lower body thrusted back and forth, bouncing you off the cotton walls and her furiously masturbating hand. Now when she removed her feathers, her sex pulsed and throbbed hungrily. It wanted more. Her slaps were no longer teasing, but powerful smacks. You were just considering leaving when her wing feathers recoiled a bit further this time and caught you when they began their dash back into her sex. You\u00e2\u0080\u0098re slammed face-first into her pussy. Her sex writhes in front of you, sliming you with sticky goop. Her wingfeather retreated, then returned. Pelly was smashing you into her pussy. You feel her fluids bubble against your face as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re smushed deeper into her vagina. She keeps beating her sex, harder and harder. You feel her groin contract around you. This can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         Pelly was lost in her fantasy. Pete was above her, they were on the hardwood floor, naked, sweaty, and alone. Pete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hot breath washed over her, she could feel his sex slamming into hers, an experience she recreated with fervent slaps to her privates. His cute, little tongue hung out of his cute, little bill as he laid his chest upon her\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. He whispered something in her ear.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0          \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0          Pelly came. She sank her feathers as deep as she could. You were wholly crammed into her pussy as the pink tunnel crushed and contracted in a hard, long orgasm. Pelly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feathers came and went as she rode her pleasure for as long as she was able. A river of fluids rushed past you, but did not carry you to freedom. Her violent contractions jammed you further into the villager up until you were jammed up against her cervix before ending in a callous, extended, crushing contraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0       Even after her climax, Pelly still tried to hang onto her dream. Pete was still there, towering over her. But soon, he started to fade. Pelly was back to reality with a messy wing and soiled bloomers. She sighed, stood up, and waddled to the bathroom to clean up and strip her undergarments off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         When she returned, she found Pete hanging up his hat on a rack. She blushed and her mind flustered as she prayed he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wearing any underwear. Then, just as she was passing Pete, she stumbled and fell, landing facedown, tailfeathers in the air. Pete saw everything. Pelly sheepishly turned her head to confirm that, yes, Pete saw everything. Tears began to pool under her eyes as Pete\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You feel like running away, not wanting her to grab you, but you realize that you couldn't possibly escape. So you continue to stand there and watch as the giantess reaches for you. Her pincer-like hoof finally makes it to you, and the two halves close around you. You're squeezed tightly in their clutches, but the hoof is far softer than you had expected, and you're unharmed. Having secured a grip on you, Reese proceeds to lift you off the ground and up to her face, remaining in her kneeling position as she studies you, her mouth now shut and her eyes squinting slightly.

What did you do today before you shrunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you think back to all the things you did this morning. \"I woke up, ate some breakfast, checked the lost and found, ate an apple on the way to work-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An apple?\" Isabelle interrupted. \"That's weird. There aren't any apples in the village. We have a lot of Peaches though!\" She smiled enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah... I found it in the lostand found box.\" You remembered that apples were found in the next town over. \"Wait,\" Isabelle interjected \"You just ate a random apple out of the towns lost and found box? That could have been someones!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle, have you ever seen anyone except me actually USE the box?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Isabelle a wise ass look. She just grinned nervously in response. \"Hey...you don't think that Apple had anything to do with this...do you?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mayor don't be so silly!\" Isabelle dismissed jokingly. \"Apples don't shrink people. It was probably something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there's always magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Isabelle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mayor! I just remembered something! Remember that fountain you funded? It's done now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabelle that not what I'm concerned with right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll really like how it turned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'm happy about the fountain! But that's being superseded by the fact that I'm two inches right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you just see it, it might help you to feel...not so concerned about that?\" Isabelle flashed her trademark nervous smile. You raise your eyebrow at that last remark. Not so concerned about being small? She's acting weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay...'Sigh'...lets go to the fountain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your world rocks and contracts with every step, rubbing you ever so roughly against the secretary's sex, your prison growing more and more damp as time goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your captor is having the time of her life, trying her best to look casual as she makes her way through the town. She lightly bites on her lower lip as she represses her carnal desires, her fingers twitching like mad as she keeps them firmly at her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stroll to Isabelle's home was only a few minuets at most, but for you it felt like hours of hell. Occasionally you could hear your captor stopping to chat with other villagers, managing to hide her obvious strain whilst chatting with someone.

She takes a few moments to settle herself down, eat some food, and change into her Pajamas before reaching back into her underpants and retrieving you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, fresh air! You take in long deep breaths as you look around your environment. Her walls are all covered in a yellow paw-print wallpaper, very similar to the one she gave you on your first day as Mayor. Her furniture is white and frilly, like that from a doll house, and you can see various gifts you've given to her all through out the room. If you were a normal sized guest, it would have been heart warming to see that she liked your gifts. But in this instant, while you were basically her property, it was somewhat disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssabelle watches as you look around the room whilst in between her fingers. \"Hope you like the decor. This is you're new home now!\" She says with a happy giggle, drawing your attention back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Issabelle! Please, go get help! I don't want to be a pet!\" You plead, \"You can't keep me like this! What will the town do without a mayor?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her free hand up to her chin, she seems to legitimately think this through for a moment as a frown appears on her face. It is soon replaced by her wide grin as she answers you. \"Well, I guess I just got a promotion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks at the response, thinking of anything you can to try and change her mind. \"You won't get away with it! The people will ask questions, they'll look for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former secretary giggles a this, playing with your minuet body between her fingers. \"They can look, but they won't find you. I'm the only one who knows you're like this. And in all honesty, who's gonna look for you in my panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing is working. She is determined to keep you as her personal pantie prisoner. Before you can muster up another argument, your captor speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's getting late. It's time for beddy-bye, my little pet! Now, where are you going to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to shout at your secretary, but she ignores you as she looks around the home as she thinks of where to put you.

Her butt is free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0       \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike what you see, mayor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d her cheeks puff as she attempts to stifle a giggle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cteehee, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost as cute as you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d you notice that her tail is wagging faster now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     And then you fall. Past the edge of her skirt, past her whirling tail, and into the soft enclave of her underwear. You tumble down the sloped, cushioned surface until you meet your new roomie: a certain Shih Tzu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fuzzy bum. A giggle from above, and Isabelle releases her grip on her bottomwear, plunging you into darkness.<br>\r\n     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0      It smells like you buried your nose in a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed. The scents of animal hair and sweat freely mingle. You are blind. You feel around in an attempt to understand your surroundings. In the darkness, you sweep the loose hairs that rest in the wrinkled crevices of your prison. Your right hand sinks between two oily cushions of fat and fur. You feel her tail rev up again. Another giggle. You snatch back your hand. You know where you are.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         The great mass besides you shifts as Isabelle adjusts herself. Her fur, muggy with sweat, snatches and ensnares you in its knots and curls. You feel yourself slipping lower, the large, doughy masses above passing over you. If you could see, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see Issy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great yellow ass slowly consume your form. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see the chippy, little animals of all shapes and colors that are printed her panties smiling and waving their goodbyes. Before being replaced by ass hair and cheeks.<br>\r\n         <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tIsabelle had adjusted her posture. Now, she sits upright; merrily working on whatever desk work she had been before. Not that she has to, considering her employer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current predicament. But she enjoys her work. And so, she continues, but... a little more slowly. She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect the mayor returning anytime soon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your naughty secretary exhibits your next torture, stretching it like a rubber band between her fingers before letting it snap against her thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a thin, pink, frilly garter.<br>\r\n\"Let's adjust you a little, my puny pet.

Once you're stuck,  she starts to undo the buttons on isabelle's shirt, pulling it open and tugging down isabelle's bra. Izzy's boobs blast out of both of the slightly undersized clothes,  spreading apart and leaving your position open to Harriet. She leans down between Isabelle's heaving mammaries, licking you up with her tongue. She swirls you around her mouth for a bit, then uses her lips to reapply you right on to isabelle's right nipple. She uses one finger to press your chest into the huge puffy spot, while her other hand works on stripping herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's motions quickly and nimbly pull off her apron, undo the buttons on her shirt before it falls around her feet, and unclasp her already loose bra,  and her upper body reveals itself, too. She presses your pathetic one inch body between Isabelle's and her own nipple, and the two moan feeling your futile struggles between their twin D cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your body start to give out. The compression of these two is too much, and you start to get enveloped in the sensitive flesh. Your entire body fails to struggle, and you unwillingly start to relax, halving in height again, feeling even more soft crushing weight shoving itself mercilessly against your now half - inch body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are plucked out from in between the two compressing nipples by Isabelle, who tugs down Harriet's skirt, revealing a thin g string panty with garters and garterbelts already attached. Harriet had been wearing lingerie this whole time. Izzy holds you by your tiny collar, pulling the front string to the side and pushing her hand against the throbbing, slick cave of the pink poodle. Harriet gasps before returning to her normal composure, putting her own hand over Izzy's, and pushing her fingers, and by extension you, into her awaiting sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink, soft walls of vaginal flesh and Isabelle's thirsty fingers abuse your half inch stature, as the yellow digits of your furry secretary and the greedy, lustful walls of your <i>bitch</i> hair dresser continuously clash against each other, soaking your clothes in feminine odors and flavors, and crushing you between the back of a harsh but real flesh chasm (yes, you were that deep in this dog's pussy) and the pseudo - innocent, playful fingers giving her orgasm. You are forcefully expelled from Harriet's lust pump and straight into the even crueler surface at the feet - paws of your two new merciless goddesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet steps, nay, stomps on you, as the two far above continue massaging and groping at every zone imaginable. Her toes squeeze you between them, and Harriet forces Isabelle to the ground, legs up, all clothes save the lone garter completely destroyed or discarded in the frenzy. Harriet drops your dazed and exhausted little body onto the surface of Isabelle's skyward- facing clitoris. <br>\r\nIf you had seen what was coming next, you would gladly have jumped into Izzy's vagina or onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet leaps up, dropping spread eagle and descends to land directly on top of Isabelle. You are utterly helpless, completely defenseless, and completely worthless in comparison to these scissoring titanesses. You're being annihilated between two hungry, enormous monsters that these two women call genitalia. You feel puny, and feel a bone crack against the immense weight. You give up, and feel the recently familiar sensation of shrinking, smaller and smaller and smaller. You shrink all the way down, to the size of the smallest insect. You aren't even a millimeter tall. Your utterly minute and pathetically micro body is at the mercy neither of these two girls currently have, because they're so caught up in orgasmic effects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely decimated by the sensitive clits, destroyed by the supple labia majora, slaughtered by the labia minora, razed by the sheer mass of the organ, and drowned in their cum. <br>\r\nYou are killed in between the sexes of two horny dogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle later will discover your infinitesimal body as it slips out of her and into her panties as she masturbates later, remembering the experience. She will hold your tiny form, hold it high above her head, and drop it, barely feeling you as you fall onto her tongue and down her throat to become a part of her curvaceous and envy drawing assets. She will call Harriet up on the phone and simply ask,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to shrink more people? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the answer will be \"Yes, we'll shrink them all.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You push yourself up, but you don't get far before a tightness surrounds you from the chest down, enclosing your body in something soft and warm. As you discover upon glancing down, it's Isabelle's paw, formed into a fist around your tiny body.

Oh, or I could just set you down, that would be easier, right? I really don't want to drop you, and I'm not confident I won't hurt you and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout for Isabelle to stop. She does so, and squeaks out a quiet \"Sorry!\" before gently lowering you to the desk and releasing you. You stretch, your body having fallen slightly asleep inside Isabelle's grasp. Looking up at your now-massive secretary, you start to wonder what to do next. Clearly, she is extremely gentle and kind, so you're in no danger staying with her. You're safe for now. But the question is, what do you do now? You should probably try to return to normal, but... It might be fun to stay tiny for a bit. What do you think you should do?</span></div></div>",

Wait, did you hear something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle's ears perk up, her canine side letting her hear something that your human ears can't. Isabelle looks back down at you, and without warning, one of her paws shoots towards you. You're snatched into her fist in an instant, and you instinctively squirm against her (still very gentle) grasp as she lifts you off the table and brings you under it. She scoots her chair forward so that her lap is under the desk, and then she carefully sets you down on her lap, releasing you from her furry fist.

Her paw hovers there beside you, as she contemplates whether or not to show you to Ankha. You start to think she might causally try to keep you hidden, but then, suddenly, Isabelle's paw moves and the palm pushes against you, almost knocking you over. In an instant, the fuzzy and stubby fingers have surrounded you, and you're lifted off of the lap of the canine giantess and out into the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle takes you out from under the desk and places you on the desk. As she releases you, you take your first look at the now-giant Ankha looming above.

This is the Mayor,\" Isabelle explains. \"Somehow, he shrunk. We've been trying to figure out how to return him to normal, but we couldn't think of anything before you came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Ankha as Isabelle speaks.

They could cause trouble, and one bad move could be very bad for the Mayor. So please, keep this a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnkha keeps looking at you hungrily, and puts a paw to her chin, seeming to consider Isabelle's plea. You're a bit afraid by the fact that she didn't agree immediately, as that shows she has a part of her that might actually lead her to harm you. But does that side win out?

Enough to let her hold you. You tell Ankha that, and she grins at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the feline giantess says. \"Hold still, Mayor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches down, her yellow-furred paw coming right at you. The digits curl around you much tighter than Isabelle's grip, and though Ankha's pawpads cushion you, it's still uncomfortably tight in her grasp.

You look around at the decidedly Egyptian decor, complete with miniature sphinxes and pyramids, wondering once again if the rumors of Ankha actually having once been a member of Cleopatra's court in ancient Egypt are true. Her decor, at the very least, suggests a fascination with the culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnkha walks to the back of the main room of her home, towards the golden throne she has sitting there. She sets you down on its cushioned seat and looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayor, stay here for a bit,\" she says. \"Isabelle, help me gather up my books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnkha opens the sarcophagus beside the throne, and though you can't see inside it, it appears that the sarcophagus is actually just a storage container that looks like a sarcophagus, because the cat girl begins taking out books from it, and Isabelle stands beside her, helping her. Soon, they both have armfuls of books, and they stack them up beside Ankha's throne. The feline looks over them, picking one out of the pile and grabbing it. She hugs it to her chest with both arms, and walks over to her throne. She pauses, looking down at you with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in my spot, Mayor,\" she says bluntly. You look around, and shrug. You can't move from the seat of the throne. Its arms are too high up, and the ground too far below. You're stuck there. But Ankha doesn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Hold still,\" she orders you. She turns around, and her thin tail suddenly swings towards you. To your surprise, it hits you and quickly coils around your waist, squeezing you and lifting you up. Having moved you out of the way, Ankha sits down on the throne and moves you around, dropping you onto her lap. It all happens so quickly that you're dazed. She grins down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised to see me use my tail so dexterously?\" she asked. \"Don't be. It is a skill passed down in my family. Though, it is not unique to my family... Some other cats have that skill too. Regardless, it's beside the point. Look at this, Mayor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens the book, angling it so that you can look up from her lap and see what it contains. To your surprise, you see...</span></div></div>",

The images are tough to make out, but you think you can tell what they convey. It looks like a group of anthropomorphic cats, dressed similarly to Ankha... But they're all huge! Small figures that resemble humans stand around their feet, and look like dolls compared to them. Some of the cats are holding humans in their paws, while others are stomping on buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, these images depict giant cats and tiny humans,\" Ankha says. \"Quite similar to our current situation. But in these pictures, the cats have grown huge, while the humans have stayed normal sized. This all relates to a legend about how, at some point in ancient Egypt, cats discovered a type of plant we now call Famous Mushrooms, and grew giant after eating them. They subjugated the humans, but eventually, the humans found out a way to reverse the growth. The cats were returned to their normal sizes, and over time, they were forgiven by the humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closes the book and sets it atop the stack beside her throne, while Isabelle puts a paw to her chin in contemplation. \"That's an interesting legend,\" Isabelle says. \"But... Does that have any connection to the Mayor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnkha nods. \"It might have a connection, actually. The story claims that the cats grew giant by eating Famous Mushrooms. Perhaps if we give one to the Mayor, he will grow back to his normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she speaks, the cat girl begins to absentmindedly pet your head. You're surprised by how good it feels, and you can't help but smile widely as she strokes your head gently. A small part of you is still worried, seeing as you are sitting on the lap of a creature big enough to eat you, her grasping paw literally touching your head... With a single motion, she could grab you and stuff you into her mouth, and you would be powerless to resist her. It's a somewhat scary thought... But the fact that Ankha shows no aggression causes you to enjoy the situation regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good idea,\" Isabelle says in response to Ankha's theory. \"It's lucky that you knew about this legend, Ankha. It gives us a good lead on what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnkha nods. \"Yes. It is lucky...\" She then looks down at you, continuing to pet you, and you look up at her, giving her a smile to show you like what she's doing. She grins down at you, showing her fangs, but they don't scare you. Ankha is friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...is she? Something feels a little off about all this. The attention she's giving you, the knowledge of that legend... It feels like maybe she knows more about this situation than she's letting on. You think that, maybe, perhaps, Ankha has more of a vested interest in this legend of giant cats and tiny humans than she is admitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when Ankha speaks up, she seems to suggest that...</span></div></div>",

I just didn't want anybody to see you, and the only way to hide you was to grab you and move you off the desk. You know how rumors can spread in this town.

However, even though it would be best to keep you hidden, I don't think that would be a very practical option. See, I can't help you... other than carrying you around, if you want, of course. But I don't know how you shrunk, so I can't help you figure out what happened. And I know that none of the books in town hall talk about this kind of thing. So, my plan was to get the help of a villager, a villager who might have books or knowledge that explain what happened to you and how to undo it. Even though that will mean revealing you, and how you shrunk. It might be a bit risky, but I can't think of any other options. So... Unless you have another plan... Are there any villagers you would like to seek out for help to start with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's an open ended question. You stand there on Isabelle's desk and put a hand to your chin, pondering which animal villager in your town would be the safest bet for getting help from.

The line where her vest meets her undershirt gives slightly upon your impact, and your leg slips into it. As Isabelle's breasts bounce from the mild impact, the green fluffy layer tightens, trapping you against her breasts. You are barely able to turn around and look at your surroundings. Thankfully, it's all soft, but any sudden change could cause some disaster. You were right on top of Isabelle's breasts, your top half on her left, your bottom half on her right. You were lying just barely in the give, the valley of her cleavage, just barely present, despite all these clothes. Was she always this busty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSituated atop the mild cliff-side of your secretary's breasts, you get to thinking about a more permanent solution to preventing yourself from falling. <br>\r\nThe first thought you have is to slip yourself deeper between the vest and her undershirt, but you dismiss that idea. If you did that, not only would you be entirely visible in your compromised situation, both to Isabelle and anyone else, but if at any point Isabelle were to slip, you would fall between the vest and shirt entirely, at which point depending on how much time you had to fall, you would either slip all the way down to her lap, where you'd never get found, or worse, be pinned between the two layers of fabric, with the breast pushing and trapping you against a solid cage of green thread. You didn't want to think about whether you would even be able to breathe in that situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other idea, while not much better, at least prevents these two problems. If you tried very hard, you could wrench your leg out from the green vest, and climb up to Isabelle's neck. Since you knew you wouldn't be able to climb up all the way to her face, you would slip down into her undershirt, and hopefully that would tickle enough to grab her attention. Even if it didn't, though, you would still slip down to her underwear. If you were right near her bra, you could easily prevent any further catastrophe and hang out in safety until Isabelle got home. When she finally took off all these clothes, her bra would be exposed, at which point you could get around her body much easier and get her attention. That was the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Isabelle let out a breath, you tugged yourself free of the massive vest, and began frantically climbing. Each hold was tenuous at best, since every time you pushed with any force onto or off of her breast, the flesh underneath would give slightly under your small amount of weight, and soon after the boob would ripple from the aftershock, making the climb quite difficult. <br>\r\nYou eventually reached the neckline, however, climbing over her red ribbon and down her shirt. <br>\r\nThe tumble was tough, as you bumped past a forest of fur  on your way down. Each hair rushed past heavily, blinding you to your final destination. You fell headfirst into her cleavage, getting stuffed forcefully from the momentum until you were stuffed entirely down to your ankles. You tried to squirm, and felt the breasts squeeze against your sides. Luckily you could breathe, but you couldn't see a thing. The bra-covered breasts hugged your sides in a tight embrace. <br>\r\nThe boobs shook and jiggled in response to your movements. It seems Isabelle noticed, or at least felt you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

While she was relieved that you weren't there to notice that she fell asleep on the job, she felt something funny in her bosom. Curiously, she lifted her undershirt to see what was in there. Or... who. To say the least, she was surprised to see a pair of tiny shoes sticking out of her cleavage. In her surprise, she reached in and carefully pulled the intruder out. \"M-Mr. Mayor?!\" She yelped. \"H-how did you get there, and... how are you so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm wondering the same thing, Isabelle!\" You reply. \"Can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can try.\" Isabelle replied. \"This village can't have someone who's two inches tall for a mayor... Okay, I gotta calm down.\" Isabelle takes a deep breath. \"What do you remember before you ended up like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I kinda took a nap in the office, and when I woke up, I was like this.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh no... this is very bad. I don't even have any idea where to start...\" Isabelle panicked. \"Wh-what else do you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I woke up, ate some breakfast, checked the lost and found, and ate an apple on the way to work.\" You continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An apple?\" Isabelle inquired. \"If I'm not mistaken, apples don't grow here. Peaches do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I found it in the lost &amp; found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate a random apple out of the lost &amp; found.\" Isabelle replied flatly. \"That could've been someone's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, have you seen anyone using the lost &amp; found other than me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. \"You think there's any chance the apple had something to do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apples don't shrink people, Mr. Mayor. It must have been something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Magic or something?\" Isabelle shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan in mild frustration. 'Magic' isn't good enough to explain the situation you're in. On another note, you were mildly surprised that Isabelle didn't seem mad at you for ending up between her breasts. But your thoughts were interrupted when she started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you're like this, you're gonna have a really hard time getting around, so I gotta carry you around until we can sort this out.\" Isabelle began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh... you don't need to-\" You try to say, but you're interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda do.\" Isabelle replies. \"And besides, it's not too much effort to do it anyway. Although, my vest pockets are kinda full, and I don't want the other villagers to worry when they see you this small. So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly knew what she was getting at. The only spot she had available was right back where you just were. What say you?</span></div></div>",

I'll keep them in my vest pockets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you take your shoes off, she takes them and puts them into her vest pockets just like she said she would. She then picks you up and carries you close, then pulls out the neckline on her undershirt, and gently lowers you down toward the enormous, warm, and fuzzy valley of yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never thought even in your wildest dreams that your secretary of all people would do something like this. On any normal day, you've always tried to maintain a professional relationship with her. But needless to say, this was <i>not</i> a normal day for you. For starters, you were more than twenty times shorter than you should've been. And now, your own secretary is letting you ride in her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne part tells you that this is a very awkward turn of events. But another is telling you that this is your lucky day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts occur to you shortly before your bare feet meet the warm fluff around her chest. The soft fur seemed to absorb your feet before they feel a warm, snug sensation from either side. Warm buzzes of comfort and satisfaction began to radiate through your body as your legs sank in, followed by your lower torso. This was when Isabelle let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly slid down a bit until your arms held on to the sides. And there you were. Only your head and arms stuck out while her breasts once again hugged your sides in a comfy embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it, Mr. Mayor?\" Isabelle asked, wanting to be careful with you being in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" She replied with glee, giving herself a hug. But you quickly realize that she's not actually doing just that. She's actually trying to give you a hug, but you're so small that this is the only way she can. As she does this, her breasts compress so tightly around you that if you didn't turn, you could've gotten crushed. But now it's much tougher to get a grip to keep yourself from slipping deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is demonstrated when Isabelle releases her hold. As her bosom decompresses, you have nothing to hold onto, so the warm fuzz rushes into your face as your body sinks in completely. You struggle for a moment, but then you feel that it's so comfy in here that you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... oops. Are you okay?\" You faintly hear Isabelle ask. You try to reach up and out of her cleavage to flash a thumbs up. \"Oh, oh alright!\" Isabelle responds soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart nearly stops when you hear the door open. You had to keep quiet and still until this blew over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Ankha.\" Isabelle called. \"What brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Isabelle,\" Ankha says. \"Is the Mayor around? I came up with an idea for a public works project, but I wanted to tell the Mayor about it directly.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm... Um... Well, I'm afraid I don't know where the Mayor is,\" Isabelle says. Then everything falls silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's taking today off.\" Ankha suggests, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Isabelle agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Farewell, Isabelle.\" Ankha said as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye bye!\" Isabelle waved. After the door closed, there was a small period of silence. \"Alright, let's go.\" You suddenly feel everything get heavier for a moment then everything around you begins gently bobbing. With how tightly you were being hugged by the enormous mounds on your sides, there was no chance you were gonna fall. You could really get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isabelle reached her home, you had already fallen asleep. Again, she reaches in and lifts you out. \"Hey, mayor. Wake up.\" She calls to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawn and wake up, finding yourself all snug in her closed paw. \"So, if we're gonna try to find a way to fix this, we should probably ask some villagers what they might know about this. Is there anyone in particular that you can count on in a pinch?\" Isabelle asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Guess nobody was here after all. Good thing, too. Don't want anybody to know that I've been napping.\" You wondered what could have happened that she was able to sleep so soundly. It must have been a lot of paperwork. But that thought quickly left your mind as Isabelle slid her chair back, the movement sending vibrations throughout the wooden floor. She must be getting up, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As she started to get up, time seemed to slow as you were seemingly entranced by her dainty (but large to you) paws. First, her thick legs stretched out, huge paws extending as her big toes wiggled a bit. After that, her toes splayed out along the ground, gaining more area to grip the floor and balance the rest of her massive body. Then, they began to move, one after the other. She was walking in your direction! You heard her mumble to herself, \"Maybe I should get some coffee.

You attempted to dive, but her foot fell too fast and quickly pinned down on your back  with your head between two of her toes. You were thankful that she doesn't wear shoes or sandals as the foot was actually kind of soft and fuzzy. If it wasn't pressing down on you with an enormous amount of weight you might have found this feeling comfortable. But either way, you survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the foot pressed down a little more, forcing the air out of your lungs as it started to push itself off the floor. The sudden rush of wind and the disorienting swings quickly made it obvious that you were sticking with her for her trip to the break room, rather than staying at her office. Each step she took was another ordeal in her thankfully short walk to the small break room you had built for the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally came to a stop and sat down, you breathed a sigh of relief as the weight was lifted off your body. Yet you knew you didn't have time to rest now. You had to free yourself and get her attention before you end up back under her again. Using what energy you still had after the ordeal, you pushed away from the sole your back was clinging to, squirming a little to try to loosen the grip.</span></div></div>",

You really didn't want to hurt Isabelle. Especially not on this day either. You rubbed hard and fast, as if your life depended on it, and in this scenario, that might actually be the case.

She didn't need to worry about time, the ceremony wasn't going to happen for another half an hour. You held onto her finger, hoping she wouldn't trap you inside her.

Suddenly, you let go and plummeted through the air and just as suddenly you landed on something. It was soft and cushioned and felt extremely comfortable.

Before you rested two massive brown mounds of tanuki fur, the likes of which extended high up above and engulfed you in their shadow. They looked so soft and chubby, almost innocent... that is, of course, if you didn't know better. The scent of Tom's previous release still lingered in the air and burned at your nostrils. Never once had it occurred to you that you would be made <i>this</i> familiar with your mortgager's rear end, but here you were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, now was no time to think on the peculiarities of your circumstances. You had to make a choice. Otherwise, you would likely never be found, or worse... After a short amount of deliberation, you decided the best course of action was to sneak your way into the tanuki merchant's buttcrack. Certainly, he might feel you if you were to merely prod at his colossal cheeks. However, you also ran the risk being plastered beneath one, and that was a chance you weren't willing to take. True, this method had its risks as well, but they seemed to you less numerous and fatal. Taking a deep breath of fresh air, you stepped forth and into the canyon between Tom Nook's plump, looming cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was equal parts dark and humid within the space between Tom's rump cheeks. As you made your way forward, you did your best to prod against the fleshy, furry canyon walls and attract the tanuki's attention, but to no avail. His sizable mounds were simply too massive for your attempts to make any difference. You could hear the merchant humming above you, a sound which reverberated around you. Clearly he remained oblivious, and it soon occurred to you that the only choice was to poke at a more sensitive region. You knew exactly what that meant... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow deep within, the warmth was beginning to overwhelm you. You had long since depleted the breath in your lungs, and now were subsisting on the foul, tainted air that surrounded you. You needed to make this quick. There before you rested the source of the deep, pungent scent between the tanuki's cheeks: his tailhole. It was hard to make out in the darkness, but it was just about your size, and quivering a bit. After a short while, you stood directly before it, and coughed a bit on the awful aroma wafting around you. <i>This had better work...</i> you thought, and with a gulp, you pressed your palms against the ridged, tight opening, then pushed a bit. Soon after, you felt the tanuki's cheeks shift as he leaned onto one side. For a brief moment, you were sure he'd felt <i>something</i>, and you awaited discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, how wrong you were. All at once, Tom's sizable tailhole jutted out towards you, and unleashed a hellish, bellowing blast of tanuki gas right in your face! The fetid fart lasted a good three seconds before finally tapering off, after which the merchant merely sighed in relief. For you, however, recovery from Tom's release was hardly so pleasant. You gagged and writhed as the terrible aroma surrounded you and filled your lungs. It seemed your plan was for naught, and you fell to your knees, defeated. However, the world around you began to shift once more, and the colossal furry mounds started shifting again, scooting forward. Had Tom noticed your presence after all?</span></div></div>",

The floor of your new surroundings sways with the slightest movement of Nook's hand as he turns the container to get a good look at you. As you look up to meet his big blue-eyed gaze, you feel embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so small, has he noticed who I am?\" You think to yourself. Almost as if he could read the guilt from your face, a warm smile filled his. \"Time to go home, Mayor?\", he said in a soft hushed tone. Without another word he slipped the cap overtop of your jar and carefully secured you to a band concealed under his apron. Your view shifted from the vast view of the outside world to the close-quarters that you had been previously exploring. It was a bittersweet sight as this time; a glass wall separated you from the large brown tuffs of fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNook took his time moving about Nook's Homes, straightening some papers on his desk before moving out the front door and locking up. It was getting late, but the warm summer air still washed over him. It had been a very hot day and he was glad he decided to forgo his usual suit-and-tie attire for his more airy apron today. Looking down at the slight bulge created by the jar against his leg, he perceived he wasn't the only one happy with his choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jar began its swaying motion again; you found it difficult to stay in one place, sliding from one side of the jar to the next. You weren't able to see much as Nook moved about, but as the light changed and air in the glass became warmer you could tell that Nook had left his shop and was moving down the road. Soon, the lightly paved road of Main Street faded into dirt and you were left waiting for a short while. Taking another few moments to look at the movement of Nook's legs and his--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden motion, you slid hard into the opposite side of the jar. Nook had stopped. You noticed a brown paw slip quickly into the opposite side of the apron and remove a large set of keys, which had been jingling on a band opposite of you. With a click, Nook stepped into darkness, the cooler temperature of wherever you now were created a light layer of condensation on the glass leaving you with very little to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNook gave a breath of relief as the darkened house quickly chilled the sweat that had been forming along his body. It was quiet in here and perfect for a bit of rest and relaxation. He reached for the jar he had been keeping tucked away safely and pulled it out. He had to wipe the fogged glass before he could see his passenger properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass jar shifted again as this time a brown paw gripped the container. Being hoisted upwards, you were forced onto your back as a secondary paw began to wipe away the condensation. Once it had ceased you could very clearly tell where you were. Nook had taken you back to your own home. Your confusion on how he was able to get inside of your house for renovations was quickly solved. Nook, now being able to see you clearly gave another warm smile of reassurance. Still, you weren't sure how you should feel, with a giant Tanuki now in control of both you and your home. </span></div></div>",

Each of his steps covering ground far faster than you could at this size. It is on this table that you take in the enormity of the items in your home. Having paid for a few renovations, your home was larger than the average villager's home, but still quite modest in size. The main floor you used mostly for entertaining guests, but there was also an upper floor, which was used as both a bedroom and home office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom where you stand on the low table, you can see your now gargantuan red couch. You imagine that if you were to have people over at this size, you would want to avoid sitting anywhere you might be overlooked.

Finally, in front of the table is where your old television set is, a few controllers still laying about from when you used them last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention shifts back to Tom as he raises his arms to stretch, the tanuki's slightly pudgy form shifting above his blue apron as he exhales deeply, exhausted from a long day of work, the fading light from the window catching on Tom's body as he turned back to you, a few titanic steps covering the distance between you, the edge of the table only reaching up to Tom's knees. Even with the height advantage of the table you are still an insect in comparison to the now looming tanuki. His kind eyes looking tired as they peer down at you over his protruding belly. His apron fluttering just overhead, if you were to step forward and crane your neck a little bit you might see--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...\" Tom's voice breaks your train of thought. \"...time for bed?\" He asks as he stifles a short yawn. </span></div></div>",

You shake your head and try to clear the ideas out. <i>What if he slept on my bed? It's comfortable right? And it's got space.</i> You think to yourself.

It was big enough to smother you for sure, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after looking up and up and up, you're met by her face, and a sharp twinge of fear moves through you when you see her eyes on you. You freeze in place like a deer in headlights. In another moment, the fear is gone as her eyes move away from you, and its replaced with confusion. Did she not see you? Are you too small to be seen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted as she begins pacing back and forth on the carpeted flooring, the stomp of her paws causing minor quakes from your position. \"The mayor said they'd be here.\" she said to herself, her giant cute face contorting into what could only be described as betrayal. \"Do they not like me? Why would they lie to me? Did they just have somewhere else more important to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate seeing Ankha think of you that way. You liked her. As a friend, at least, although you've always toyed with the idea of being more...but <i>anyway</i>, the point is she was your friend, and you didn't want her to think that you'd just bail on her like that. You considered yelling up to her to let her know where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even consider getting a word in, however, she crosses her arms with a cute little huff, tail wagging behind her. \"Well, they might just be late. I should wait for him before getting mad.\" And with that, she took a powerful stride towards your position, catching you off guard. Looking down on the couch for a moment, she turned around in order to get into a proper sitting position, and your gaze rises to meet the giant anubis ass before you, tail swaying in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always thought her \"mummy wrapping dress\" was pretty short, but from down here she was downright naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was so far in the gutter that it had to be yanked out by a sudden, deafening force. Which is exactly what happened as Ankha sat down on the couch...</span></div></div>",

Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loud and clear!\" Fauna responds, looking around her bathroom a little bit. \"So you're really inside my head right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, unfortunately.\" You lie down on the 'floor' of her control room. \"And I've just spent an entire day trying my best not to get squished while climbing beneath your dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFauna blushed a bit more at that, especially as she took off her dress and got ready for bed. \"W-well, how about I let you out tomorrow morning, and we'll figure things out then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sounds good to me. Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Mr. Mayor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a rather uncomfortable sleep inside Fauna's head, you awaken groggily to the sound of her taking a shower. \"Mmph... Good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Fauna seems surprised to hear you this early. \"Er, you can leave anytime you want, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to heed her advice, and pass through her eardrum once again and travel up her ear canal. This time, she chooses to gently grab you, setting you down atop an empty soap rack as water pours from the shower head. \"Wow,\" she says, blushing, \"you really are small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're so... Well...\" You're too embarrassed to finish that sentence, as you can't help but stare at how the water streamed down Fauna's naked body. The two of you ended up sitting there for quite a while, until Fauna finally regained the courage to speak. \"You know, it's... probably not safe for you to wander around town at, well, this height.\" She put you back in her hands, holding you up to her face again. \"Maybe I could... keep you inside of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, you know,\" she said, \"I could swallow you down, and keep you in my stomach. Or I could... Erm...\" She glanced downwards, and you saw her face turn the deepest shade of red you've ever seen. You blushed too, especially since you were basically being given the chance to live in her most personal of organs - but which entrance were you going to choose?</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for you to reach her stomach, and fortunately, it was more than hospitable. Oddly enough, villager stomachs seemed relatively vestigial, acting more like a dry balloon. You always acted puzzled about how they ate if this was the case, but you ignored that for now as you bounced off the organ's soft floor. The stomach's ceiling curved away from you - relative to your current size, Fauna's belly looked to be around twice the size of your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside, you heard Fauna turn off the shower, and then pat her stomach. \"...How is it in there? Comfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not really,\" you respond. Sure, her stomach was soft enough for you, but the surface was too rubbery. \"Do you think you could give me something as a mattress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mr. Mayor!\" Letting the towel she was draping around herself fall away, Fauna raced to her bedroom and grabbed one of her pillows. Being careful not to bite into it, she managed to stuff it down her throat, causing it to land with a soft thud on the stomach floor. You quickly moved it to one corner of her belly - compared to you, this cushion was as large as a king-sized mattress - and when she swallowed a small cloth to go with it, you draped it over like a blanket. She patted her stomach again, asking \"Does this work for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very.\" You laid down on your soft \"bed,\" looking up at the curved stomach ceiling. \"Although I could use some food, as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more!\" You heard Fauna hurriedly putting on her dress, and felt her whole body shake as she rushed to her kitchen. Opening a cabinet, she grabbed three fruit - an apple, a pear, and an orange - and swallowed each in one gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three landed in a neat pile, and you marveled at the sight; each fruit was at least three times your current height! \"Whoa!\" You say, beginning to push the fruit to another corner, \"Thanks, Fauna! This should be enough to last me for a month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her giggle. \"Hopefully you won't be in there THAT long, or I might start charging rent!\" She moved to open her door, then paused. \"Um, Mr. Mayor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Fauna?\"</span></div></div>",

As you soon begin to gaze upon your surroundings, to your surprise everything seemed completely alien around you. \"Huh?\" you stammer gazing at the odd greenery all about your area. \"What kind of plant is that?\" you murmur, never before seeing the odd green vegetation before you.

Fear, confusion and disbelief stormed about in your mind in a furious fashion as you desperately sought an explanation for such an event.

Perhaps, she might be able to help you with your little problem? Besides, knowing her she'd never harm a fly...or at least that's what you thought based on all the times you've seen her outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, you sshakily begin to walk up towards her huge left paw before taking a deep breath.

Looks like her pointed ears truly are good for listening. With her gazing about, now seemed like the perfect chance to get her attention below. \"SKYE!\" you call out once more as the light blue wolfess's eyes quickly trail downwards before gasping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" she gasps before covering her mouth in sheer surprise. \"Is that- \"</span></div></div>",

You could barely see, the light blinding you as you try to stand up. From what it felt like, you woke up on the carpet, and you just assumed you must of accidentally rolled out of your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Oh how you wished that was the case. It was only a good 4-5 seconds before your eyesight adjusted, and you froze, eyes wider than saucers as you scanned the area. Problem one was; this wasn't your bedroom. Problem two was; this was the rather reclusive and older wolf Wolfgang's home. and Problem three was; everything was gigantic. Or maybe, he was the one that was lacking in size. As you sniffed the air, you immediately pulled back, groaning in disgust. It was the rancid smell of alcohol, which slightly gave you a burning sensation in your nose. Now that you look around, his modern home was pretty poorly taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     From what you could see from your level, there were beer bottles and trash scattered across the corners of the room, what looked like an ashtray with several cigarettes butts rested on the distant coffee table, dusty old paintings that you've heard rumors of being made by the wolf himself, and even some adult magazines with a few wadded up tissues. Finally, your eyes came to the couch, where the snoring wolf rested. He was just as huge as everything else, which incredibly intimidated you. Wolfgang was already relatively scary when you were normal sized, but now? You were locked in the same house with this beast, being only a good 3 inches high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You knew there would be no way out of here, other than through the old wolf. Sighing to yourself, you trekked over to his slumbering body. Fortunately for you, one of his paws had rolled off the couch, it resting on the ground as he laid sprawled out on the couch. His snores nearly shook you, but you needed to get him awake. Carefully grabbing at his fingers, you pull and shake them, but he doesn't even seem to budge. That's when you give them a bite, not hard enough to break the skin, but enough to hopefully wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You managed to succeed, the snoring cutting short as the wolf lazily opened up his eyes, blinking several times. He yawned out, and immediately looked down at the paw you were still pulling on. You could feel his eyes on you, making you shiver in fear and hope, slowly looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Huh? The <i>hell</i>?\" He muttered, his paw quickly wrapping around you to pull you closer to his face. You winced and trembled at the quick change in altitude, as you stared up at him, wondering if this was a good idea. You started to shrink back when those large eyes stared you down, scanning over your form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Hey, you're the <b>mayor</b>, right? The guy that <u><i>just</i></u> got put in charge not that long ago? Why the hell are you so damn small? And why are you in here?\" He spoke, almost accusingly. You wipe your brow, before trying to explain as calmly as possible you have no idea, and that you woke up here, and that you need his help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Wolfgang was fully awake now, standing up from the couch with his free paw in a fist on his hip, while the other held you in place up to his face, obviously thinking out the situation. It felt intimidating, but you had to hope he'd be of help. Holding your breath, you looked up at him, trying to read his expression for an answer.</span></div></div>",

Despite it all towering far, far above you, you could easily recognize the place as Lucky's house. Of course, the furniture you've let him have is around too, the desk and chair, the fridge, and even a bed has replaced his unsettling dingaloids, and that weird Sphinx. Unfortunately though, it looked like the mysterious yet adorable dog was out. You figured your best bet was to get some high ground, so you could survey the area, and hopefully get Lucky's attention when he returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It took a bit of a hike, but you found your way to Lucky's desk, and started to climb up the chair. Shimmying up the metal leg wasn't as difficult as you thought it was. Maybe all that working out you've done with Rowan was starting to pay off? Your thoughts of your tiger friend are interrupted as you reach the top of the seat, and are suddenly startled by the door opening. It was Lucky himself, humming a cute little tune as he waltzed into his house with a bag of groceries close to his belly. You waved and jumped up and down from the seat, but it didn't look like he noticed you. Unfortunately for you, Lucky's always been a bit lightheaded, and oblivious. You've spent plenty of time with your friend Lucky. You're one of the few people to know that he's not actually a mummy, or actually even hurt. He just wears those bandages because of both his addiction to Egyptian stuff, and that he thinks it's \"super cool\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He set the groceries on top of the desk, and opened up the fridge, putting in his new groceries one at a time, till all that was left was a tasty looking sub. You couldn't really see it that well from your position, but you could hear Lucky's stomach groaning in excitement for it. When Lucky closed his fridge with a smile, he immediately turned his attention to the desk. You took your chances to try and jump and wave your arms at him again, but that submarine sandwich was too enticing for the canine. Unfortunately for you though, you were so focused on trying to flag Lucky down from that seat, you didn't even realize when he turned around, his jet black furred bottom was descending towards you quickly. You froze up, staring up at in both shock and almost admiration. It's still cute, even if it's bigger than you and coming dangerously close to crushing you under it.

You then gaze up at Lucky right between his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe obviously wasn't even aware of you right now, his eyes dead ahead on his sandwich. You could even hear him lick his lips as he almost comically started to tie a napkin around his neck like a makeshift bib. You didn't even think people did that, but you guess your friend picked it up from all those cartoons he watches, despite his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and look over your options. There isn't much you can do from your position, except... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare dead ahead, at the slight protruding bulge right in front of you. His bandages were adjusted improperly, carefully covering his cock, but from earlier it seemed to be a little too lose to cover his ass. It felt embarrassing to think about messing with it. You could tell it wasn't huge for average standards, but compared to you? It was way bigger than your body, almost intimidating, yet still cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are just about to approach it, hand outreached till you hear a slap to your side. Lucky had rested a paw on his own thigh, opening up a new opportunity for you. Seeing it, you start to realize that at least you wouldn't have to deal with the initial embarrassment of Lucky discovering you fiddling with his junk, but you can't guarantee your own safety clinging to his hand while he eats, you could end up falling to the desk, or worse, right into Lucky's sandwich if you don't get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to decide, then immediately...</span></div></div>",

After all, she could easily mistake you for a bug at your size, seeing as you are just a few inches tall. So, you stay put and simply watch as Goldie walks by, examining the trees and bushes for bugs to catch. Unfortunately, she seems to be staying in this one area, meaning you'll gave to stay out for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, you would if the scorpion didn't find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear scuttling behind you, and turn to see a huge scorpion. Well, huge is relative considering your size, but even if you were normal sized, the thing would probably still be massive. Most scorpions you have caught before are around six inches long, but this one is several times your length. That means ever you're smaller than you thought, or this is one monster of an arachnid. You consider that perhaps this beast is a female. As female scorpions are bigger than males. You decide to roll with that theory, as you tank it's impossible for a scorpion to be this big and yet be of the more diminutive sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scorpion, its (or her as you presume) dull red armor making the arachnid stand out from the plants around, slowly approaches you, stinger tail curled overhead. You stare at the stinger, noting that at this size it could easily pierce right through you. But then again, you recall, that scorpions around here tend to act docile unless threatened. And this (presumably female) scorpion had yet to attack. If you don't act aggressive, she probably won't attack you. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scorpion approaches you, and comes close enough for her pincers to reach you. You still focus on the tail, though, prepared to try to dodge should the arachnid suddenly attack. Unfortunately that's not what you should be focusing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scorpion's left pincer shoots forward in the blink of an eye, its two halves snapping shut around your waist. You look down in shock, and witness the second pincer clamp around your chest. The two pincers squeeze you painfully, keeping a very tight grip on you. You begin to shout and squirm, struggling in the grasp of the enormous arachnid as she easily lifts you off the ground and brings you to her. You're held so close to her bizarre insectoid face that you're almost touching it. You notice the creature seems to be examining you closely, and you're shocked at the fact that she hasn't stung you yet. Or pinched you into pieces, at least. After all, you are in her grasp, completely powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a weird situation to be sure--ordinarily, you would be the one catching these creatures, but now, you are the one caught in the scorpion's clutches, and she doesn't show any signs of letting you go. In fact, she begins to walk back into the cover of plants, carrying you with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it. You're being taken hostage by a scorpion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop struggling. It's no sure. The scorpion has you, and isn't letting you go. The question is, are you doomed to be in her grasp?</span></div></div>",

You stumble back at the sight, looking into giant brown eyes at least the size of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mayor?\" Goldie stammers.

Maybe I have a book that can help us! Say, let's go to my house! How about right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, Goldie reaches out with her left hand-paw.

It's a bit scary, but only makes you more motivated to return to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoldie smiles gently at you, reminding you that she means you no harm, and goes over to grab her bug net before hurrying towards her house, clutching you closely to her chest. </span></div></div>",

I know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Goldie says, her grip on you loosening slightly as she perceives the threat of Bianca to be passing. \"Now, listen up. I was heading back home to see if any of my books have a solution to the Mayor's little shrinking problem. Do you want to help me solve this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca shrugs. \"I dunno what I could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You own some books, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do fashion magazines count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no, Bianca, they do not. But if you think you have anything at all that can help us return the Mayor to normal... Get it and bring it to my house. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca nods, and runs off through the woods towards her house. Goldie sighs, and brings you up to her face again, returning you to just one hand-paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to your disgust, she licks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue slips from between her lips and presses into your face, coating it in drool as it slides along it. You cough and splutter, shocked that Goldie would do such a thing. You look up at her, but see that her face is very gentle, her eyebrows angled up as a smile appears on her face. Apparently, that was a lick of affection. Still a bit weird coming from an anthropomorphic dog, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Mayor,\" she says. \"I'll get you back to normal. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she hurries down the path, following Bianca back to where the town's houses are gathered.</span></div></div>",

You note how everything looks mostly the same despite your small size, but you attribute that to being held several feet off the ground in the paws of a giantess, which gives you a vantage point similar to your normal height. Goldie eventually makes it back to her house, and fumbles with her keys with the paw not holding you until she finally manages to unlock the door. She steps inside, locking the door behind her and hitting the lights, illuminating the interior of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take in the combination of minimalist and wooden furniture, along with the wooden walls and rug that is the same color combo as her shirt. You haven't been in her house many times before, and at your new size the experience is even more new to you. She walks to the back right corner of the house, setting you atop a bookcase and pulling up a wooden stool and sitting down to get at eye level with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're home,\" she says. \"Out of curiosity, do you like the decor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide it's best to stay on her good side, seeing as she's big enough to squish you like a bug, so you nod. She grins in response, and nods back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it! Anyway, we really ought to get on to business.\" She begins browsing the bookshelf you're standing on, picking out several books and putting them on the bed a few steps away, in the left back corner of the house. You watch her, intrigued by the movements of such a massive creature for a bit, but are snapped out of it when Goldie comes back over and sits before you again. She glances back at the door before looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Bianca will show up,\" she murmurs. \"I guess I should just get started on my reading for now. I'll leave you here, if that's okay with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and she smiles back. \"Great! Just yell if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stands up and heads towards her bed, stopping by the turntable to turn it on and start playing a popular song you don't quite remember the title of before lying down on the bed and grabbing a book, flipping through it quickly. You sit down, looking around Goldie's house again and marveling at the unique perspective you have of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to engross you enough that you don't notice the passage of time. In what seems like no time at all...</span></div></div>",

You watch as she unlocks it and cracks it open a bit, peeking outside. She steps back an instant later, opening the door and saying \"Welcome!\" as the white-furred tigress Bianca steps inside, her arms wrapped around a few books clutched to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca glances around the room before finally spotting you. She grins widely, showing her sharp teeth, which makes you shudder again. Goldie is technically a carnivore too, but she doesn't have as intimidating of a set of teeth as Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoldie goes to her bed and sits down, motioning for Bianca to sit on the stool. The tigress places her books on the bed and sits down, but quickly scoots the chair over to the bookshelf you are atop. Goldie keeps examining the books Bianca brought, and doesn't lay the tigress any attention as she approaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mayor!\" she says, peppy as ever. You simply say hello back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Found out anything about your shrinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope it turns out for you!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really hoping he turns back to normal?\" Goldie asks, somewhat incredulously. \"Weren't you just freaking out about how cute he looked earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was freaking out. But... Like you said, Goldie, he needs our help. And I'll never let a friend down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at that. She sounds sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do my books look any good?\" Bianca asks Goldie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have some interesting variety here,\" the dog replies. \"I'm surprised you have this book on... 'magic mushrooms'. They aren't the kind I'm thinking of, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course not! I mean magic as in literally magic! Like, they can make you look different. They're pretty popular in the fashion world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if any of them can make people rerun to normal size... I remember hearing about Famous Mushrooms having that kind of power... But I think I should read up and see what this book says. We might be on to something here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Goldie lies down again and begins reading, while Bianca sits on the stool with her elbows on her knees and her hand-paws on her chin. Her blue eyes are locked on to you, and you give a shy wave. The attention is a little unsettling given the size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter staring at you for a while...</span></div></div>",

But you decide that Bianca seems kind enough to not hurt you. You nod, and she grins widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Mayor!\" she says happily. \"I'll be gentle. I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, towering over you, and you look up at the white-furred giantess as she reaches for you with a paw. She's retracted her claws, thankfully, but the enormous paw-shaped hand still makes you a little scared. In it, you're completely powerless after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand-paw reaches you, fingers and thumb curling around you from the chest down. You didn't think ahead enough to raise your arms so they could not be pinned, but it's too late now. Bianca's grip tightens as she slowly lifts you off the bookshelf and up to her face. You're brought within inches of it, so it takes up your whole view. You observe the white fur, gray markings, and blue eyes with long lashes, while her own eyes cross slightly to stare at you. After a few seconds of mutual staring, she squeezes you slightly, making you grunt. She smiles at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... You're kinda squishy, Mayor,\" she says, squeezing you again. You begin to squirm in her grasp, not feeling fully comfortable anymore. If she squeezes you too hard... That could be disastrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca doesn't release you, though.

In no time, she reaches her house. It's a small place, but looms over you intimidatingly at your size. The canine giantess holding you crouches and carefully puts you on the ground, freeing both hand-paws to more easily reach into a pocket and withdraw a key, with which she unlocks the door to her house. She then crouches again, reaching down and gently closing her fist around you before standing up and entering her house, locking the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't been in her house often, and take the chance to observe her minimalist and modern wood furnishings.

Remember when I said that I'd heard about Famous Mushrooms making those who ate them grow in size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. She did indeed say something like that when she first found you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've found a book that talks about mushrooms, and it says that there's another mushroom that's like the Famous Mushroom. It goes by several names, but most commonly it's referred to as the Mini Mushroom. It's a small blue mushroom with white spots, and supposedly, it makes you shrink--as the name implies. But it's really uncommon. Apparently, it only grows in a faraway kingdom of mushrooms that I've never heard of before. I was thinking... maybe you ate one of those Mini Mushrooms and shrunk? Do you remember ever seeing one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds up the book, displaying a blue and white cartoony mushroom with two black markings on the stem resembling eyes. It looks vaguely familiar. You shake your head, though. You don't recall eating anything like that before you blacked out and subsequently shrunk. As far as you know, you were just hanging out when you suddenly blacked out and woke up at just a few inches tall. You tell Goldie this, and the canine giantess frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Then, I'm not sure how you shrunk if it's not the Mini Mushroom. None of the other books I read had any useful information in them. The Mini Mushroom was all I could find. But.. . this book does give advice for how to reverse the effects of the mini Mushroom. I think we should try them out just to see if they work. Even if you didn't shrink from a Mini Mushroom, it can't hurt to try these suggestions. That being said, there's only two of them, and the second one doesn't sound good...\"</span></div></div>",

It's your trusty secretary, Isabelle. And her big dark eyes are focused right on you, as her mouth hangs slightly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, she's gone. But then you hear a knock on the door. Goldie sits up in bed, confused as to who is knocking, and gets up to check it out. She opens the door and peeks outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Isabelle! Good to see you,\" she says, still not opening the door fully, \"what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have a spceremony to celebrate the new bridge that was built yesterday,\" Isabelle says. \"But the maybe isn't anywhere, and I wanted to see if he was in anybody's house,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He isn't here,\" Goldie says. You're a bit surprised she just lied, but then remember she's doing it to keep you hidden until you turn back to normal, so you can stay safe. Unfortunately, Isabelle knows better, having seen you with her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Actually... He is,\" Isabelle says. \"I saw him through the window, and I saw... How... How small he was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoldie stumbles back, surprised. She didn't expect Isabelle of all people to spy through people's windows. As she stumbles back, Isabelle steps through the door and walks straight towards you. You stand still as this second canine giantess approaches. She is wearing her summer outfit, with a green vest and white shirt and a blue skirt, plus a red bell ribbon for her hair. The yellow and white furred dog reaches you and crouches, bringing her face close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayor!\" she says with a smile. \"I'm glad to see you're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a real sincerity in her voice, and you can't help but smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I can see you've shrunk somehow... Do you have any idea how? Or how to fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, but Goldie chimes in. \"I've been studying how to help him,\" she says. \"I think I'll have an answer soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... That's good,\" Isabelle says before turning back to you. \"Mayor, just remember... If there is anything I can do to help you, even at your current size... I'll do it. Just ask me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, glad that your secretary is levelheaded enough to not panic over this situation. To be honest, it's different than how she usually reacts to surprises... Its almost like she is not surprised at all. It makes you a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't think about it anymore, as Isabelle bids you both farewell and says she'll postpone the ceremony until you return to normal. Goldie says goodbye, and Isabelle leaves the house. Goldie sighs and goes back to her bed to keep reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she doesn't tell anyone,\" she says. \"I don't want everyone barging in here to stare at you, Mayor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resumes reading, and you resume waiting...</span></div></div>",

Goldie turns around and walks away to give you and Isabelle some privacy, shaking some trees to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Isabelle, and step back in surprise as you see her reaching down to you, her yellow-furred fingers and thumb spread wide. Her paw wraps around you, fist closing around your tiny body... but incredibly gently, you notice. Apparently, Isabelle's grasp is just like her personality. She lifts you up to her face and, after looking at you for a moment, whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayor... you... you don't like being small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment. It's interesting... but you prefer being normal sized. That's why you decided to find Famous Mushrooms, after all. You tell Isabelle that, and you notice that she looks dejected at your response. Only for a moment, though, but that's enough to makes you tell that something is amiss. Why would she not like you returning to normal? Does she know something you don't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly angered, you ask her if she's hiding something. Isabelle remains silent, simply staring at you held in her fist. You begin to get irritated. She might be many times your size and capable of picking you up like a toy, but giving you the silent treatment is just petty. You ask Isabelle why she looked sad, and after a short pause, Isabelle says...</span></div></div>",

I thought making you small would make you happy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she stops herself, clamping her free hand-paw over her mouth as her eyes widen and her cheeks turn red through her fur. You just stare at her. She just made a mistake, admitting something she didn't want to. Based on what she said... the way she phrased it makes it sound like she shrunk you herself! \"I thought making you small would make you happy\"... Is she the one who made you shrink to a few inches tall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, you ask Isabelle this. She seems to be growing panicked herself, and you can hear her panting behind the hand-paw covering her mouth. You realize that if she were a human, she'd be sweating, since sweating is to humans what panting is to dogs. Therefore, something must be distressing her greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeat your question when Isabelle refuses to answer, but after a few seconds, she answers you at last, her panting stopping as she lowers her free hand-paw from in front of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mayor, I admit it! I shrunk you! I read a book that showed tiny humans, and... and it got me thinking... I thought you'd like it if you shrunk too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, a book that shows tiny humans? That sounds like Goldie's book! Apparently, Isabelle found a copy. You can't think about it too long, though, because she keeps talking, eyes watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you shrunk, it would be a new experience for you, and I thought you'd like it. Plus, being so small and helpless would make the villagers help you and grow closer to you. I just... wanted you to enjoy it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabelle resumes panting, fighting back tears as she holds you in front of her face. \"But now... it looks like you hate it. You want to turn back to normal... And... It seems like I've done something wrong, and hurt you. And now I'm worried you hate me, and... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's choked up, and stops talking. You stare in surprise at how emotional she's getting. But to be honest, that's just like Isabelle. She's super friendly, and it makes sense that if she were to learn that she inconvenienced or harmed you by shrinking you, she'll be really upset by it. And to be honest... you have to respect that. The really does care for your safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... is that enough to forgive her?</span></div></div>",

You forgive me? Oh, thank you, Mayor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm slightly, as Isabelle's grip has become surprisingly tight all of a sudden, but she doesn't seem to notice. After a few seconds of holding you tightly, she raises you up to her face, and you see that while she's still blushing, her eyes are not watering anymore. She's happy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you forgive me, Mayor. I'm sorry for shrinking you... I'll make sure to ask you before I do anything like that again.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anxiously, Elmer strode his way over to the mayor's house, dancing and skipping along the way, and trying not to get distracted this time. It was early in the morning, but this was important. The oafish horse had a present to give his best friend and trusty companion. Elmer stopped in front of the Mayor's wooden door, pausing to imagine the shock on the chief's face when he sees the rare furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElmer knocked his hoof against the door. No reply. Elmer shrugged it off. Wouldn't be the first time, Elmer thought, the mayor is a busy man. Elmer turned the doorknob and grinned. The door was unlocked which meant the mayor was home! The brown furred horse open the door and quietly stepped into his friend's house, being careful as to not get his long, ungroomed tail caught in the doorway. Elmer looked around the residence. The lights were dimmed, the mayor's collection of gyroids were turned off, and the man himself was nowhere to be found. This would be the point where any normal horse would turn tail and leave, but not Elmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a piece of furniture that sat on the villager's shelf, which was located next to his exotic bed. The shaved ice machine had caught the absent-minded Elmer's eye. The horse, without a second thought, trotted over to the contraption and picked it up. <br>\r\nMaybe he could ask the mayor if he could have it. Then he could enjoy snow cones for breakfast, morning snack, lunch, after-lunch snack, before-dinner snack, din-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CLANK</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaved ice machine dropped to the ground with a harsh sound, snapping Elmer out of his trance. But, although Elmer didn't know, the sound also woke somebody else from a pleasant dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled awake by an earsplitting crash, you immediately jump to your feet. Looking around, you find that you're surrounded by a plain of fabric. Am I still dreaming, you think to yourself, or have I shrunk?<br>\r\nYour thoughts are cut off by the sounds of footsteps heavily treading through your house. You turn around to see a horse the size of a skyscraper, walking towards the bed with a giant apparatus in its hand. The stallion had brown fur, a gray muzzle, and was wearing a blue sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElmer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately recognize the horse, as he is the villager you spend the most time with. You immediately try to get his attention, in too much of a panic to use rational thought. Elmer was now standing over the bed, but looking at the machine instead of you. You try to jump up and down, but the bedsheets were too soft. You sink into them and fumble over yourself and land face-first in the fabric of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Elmer's tail brush up against the bed and quickly look up to see your now-giant friend, who is not wearing pants, preparing to sit down, his brown furred behind and dark tail descending towards you quickly. You struggle, but are too slow. By the time, you stand up, Elmer's butt already touches down. The soft fabric causes the bed to sink in creating a slope leading to the horse's ass end. Unfortunately, you end up rolling down the decline faster than you can control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHAP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slam into the cheek of Elmer's ass. The flesh was soft yet firm. You slowly get up, leaning against your friend's backside. The horse's tail covered his enormous butt crack, but that didn't mask the smell. You know that Elmer isn't one for personal hygiene (much to the disscontempt of Gala and Annalise) which would explain the horrendous odor. You glance upwards at Elmer, who is still focusing on the shaved ice machine for whatever reason. You couldn't lie. You've always wanted to get close to your friend. Elmer, like most of the other animals, didn't bother to cover up their lower halves and, though you don't like to admit it, you have stolen a glance at Elmer's front and back from time to time. While he wasn't looking, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you can't think about that now! You needed to find a way out of this situation. You could climb Elmer's body up to his shoulders, but while it did seem pretty simple, who knows what go wrong. You could also pound your fists against Elmer's ass in an attempt to get his attention. Though the stench leaking from Elmer's ass crack was becoming worse by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter contemplating, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

A strong scent of leather and oil overwhelms your senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground below you is soft, long strands of fabric stretch out around you. Pushing yourself upwards you try to figure out where you are. The strands of fabric are red, and as you stand you find yourself sink into them slightly. \"Red grass?\" You can't think of anywhere in town that red grass exists. Besides, it was the middle of summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour confusion only continued as you looked up to see massive planks of wood stretching far upwards. Your voice catches in your throat as you realize, \"A t-table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of oiled leather takes hold of your attention again. The scent is familiar, but you can't place it. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the table are several canisters of comically large shoe polish, along with several boxes the size of houses with logos scrawled on the side. They read... \"Kicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour analysis was complete; you were standing in a football field of a carpet at Kicks, the local shoe store. Having solved the first of your mysteries you hear a click from the front door, and as if to remove all doubt, a large black and white skunk steps into the empty store and closes the door behind them. Kicks, owner of the store Kicks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicks was wearing his signature brown hat and brown suspenders, complete with dark brown boots that thumped heavily against the stone floor of the store as he moved to his workbench at the back of the store. You began to call out to him, but soon stopped as you realize that compared to Kicks you were not much larger than an insect. Even if your voice could carry to his ears, the sound of his boots as they came in contact with the ground were so loud and heavy that you have to steady yourself as they pass. You notice that you stand barely taller than the treads of the colossal brown boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kicks comes to stop in front of his workbench, you push yourself out from the large coils of red carpet.

The light had become less harsh, so you imagine it's sometime around midday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vibrations slowed once again by Kicks stopping across the room, you balance yourself on the box once again.

Bouncing on top of the cardboard and yelling as loud as you can, you attempt to get Kicks' attention. You are positive that this time you won't be looked over. And begin smiling as Kicks' glances over to where you are. You stop jumping and yelling for Kicks' attention as a large white paw raises up and looms overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour relief quickly turns to panic. Kicks' paw that you thought was coming to your rescue instead dips under the box you're standing on. The box shifts and shakes as it is lifted upwards, Kicks turning his attention back to the display of shoes on the table. The shift in gravity threatens to throw you off onto the brick floor almost immediately as you drop to your hands and knees to stay atop the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you cling to the box, Kicks slips the empty box under his arm intending to use it for his latest creation at his workbench. You, on the other hand are thrown about as the giant skunk adjusts your perch, still unaware of your plight. Your voice still unable to call his attention. You notice the box beginning to tip as you have trouble stopping yourself from slipping forward. Unable to get a grip on the flat surface, you throw yourself towards the white paw, still gripping the side of the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel weightless as you see an impossibly large drop to the bricked floor below, leaving the cardboard surface. Reaching out, you grab hold of some of the white and black fur on Kicks' arm. Gravity returns to you as your body now dangles precariously from the skunk's arm fur. Luckily for you, it holds, almost thankful for your size at this point. <i>\"But if I was any taller, I wouldn't be in this mess.\"</i>, you grumble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicks has meanwhile moved towards his workbench again. Your stomach drops as you feel your grip on his fur slipping. You can't expect much help from the skunk as you remain unseen. You see the workbench only a few skunk steps away, but each steps shakes you as he moves forward, and you don't know if you can rely on your grip to take you the rest of the way. </span></div></div>",

At a normal scale, you were roughly three feet in the air. At your scale, the fall is much further. Air whooshing around your form, you tumble towards the brick floor. In a panic, you clench your eyes shut as the floor fills your vision. Anticipation of hitting the ground is dispersed as Kicks' panted leg collides with you from the side. Kicks was mid-step while you fell, so as he steps forward it offers you the perch you were looking for. You quickly try to grapple to the large length of brown fabric, but each time you grab hold you slow only a little bit before the speed of your fall pulls you away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last attempt, you grab hold of the brown suspenders and pull yourself inwards, trying to grip to the fabric with your whole body to hopefully stop your descent. Slowly, you slide down the fabric and stop a few inches above Kicks' booted foot. Shivering against the rough material of Kicks' suspenders you let out a sigh of relief as Kicks comes to a stop in front of his workbench. Looking up, you can see Kicks deposit the box you had been on onto the large structure as he continues his work. You are left, unbeknown to the giant skunk, clinging to his pant leg. You consider climbing back up to Kicks' arm, but seeing the length of the climb, you decide you need a better option.

Little by little you let more release from your grip. Peering up, Kicks is still oblivious to your presence, now using his suspenders as a slide. Suddenly, the area around you gets darker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice your mistake almost immediately. Kicks has his suspenders tucked into his large boots. Without realizing, you had begun slipping towards his large booted paw. The lip of the boot is just above you. You reach out to try and pull yourself out, but in doing so you have released your careful grip on the pant leg. Fabric rushes by you as you plunge into a humid darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe musky scent of old leather mixed with the sweat of the active skunk makes it difficult to breathe. As you finish falling down into the boot you hit the top of Kicks' black paw before rolling into a space between him and the boot. You are surprised that the boot is a spacious as it is, again attributing it to your small size. Pushing against the black paw you find that you are able to push against the paw to move a little easier, but the size and weight of the paw prevents you from moving around well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be in his boot when Kicks decides to move around again, you need to think of a way out. Despite your pushing, you are surprised Kicks still hasn't noticed you and your predicament. You imagine that if you get to a more sensitive point of his paw, you might be able to call attention to yourself that way. Again you push against the black paw, remarking at the softness of the fur in this rough space. Thinking that the most sensitive point would undoubtedly be the tips of Kicks' paw. You push yourself against the inside of the boot as you move towards the front of the boot. The scent of the musk becomes much more present as you move deeper into the boot, your head swimming as you struggle into the front of the boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the pressure against you ease off as you reach the front of his paw pads. The paw responds almost immediately to your touch as it begins to shift inside of the boot, pushing against you. You are shoved to the front of the boot as the paw rubs over your form seemingly trying to find out the cause of irritation. Your breath is once again strained as the paw smothers you, easily rolling over and dominating your small frame. Without much to grab onto you find yourself trying to grip onto the paw itself, which works poorly as you are pushed to the base of the boot, squished against the worn insole. Eventually the paw retracts, seemingly satisfied with the inspection of whatever was inside the boot along with it. You think you might be safe to try and climb back out of the boot, but before you can the whole boot begins to shift upwards. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Kicks had arrived this morning, he spent most of his time preparing his store and stock for another busy day. At least he had hoped it would be. The day was passing by with relatively sleepy ease. Suspecting that the summer heat had probably left people either spending the day at home or at the beach, he had decided now would be the time to do some shoemaking while he was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some more sandals, those seem to be selling well,\" Kicks spoke softly to the empty store. \"Or maybe some boots to get ready for the fall season.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe padded along the brick floor, boots tapping quietly against them, moving towards his workbench. Unfinished shoes and boots are scattered along the workspace, on which he promptly and silently got to work on. Kicks had spent most of his life either shinning shoes or making them, so he took a lot of pride in the result he could give to the villagers of the town. His experienced hands finished a pair sporty looking running shoes, and a pair of open-toed sandals before clearing the workbench of any remaining materials. Pleased with his work he moved towards his showroom tables, clearing spaces for the finished footwear before grabbing a box for the first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rounded back to the workbench he gave a little sigh, already a little tired and it was only just midday. The store was still very warm from the summer heat, Kicks beginning to feel some sweat beginning to dampen his paws and seep into the soles of his boots. He tried his best to ignore the sensation of sweat on his paws, but soon found it difficult, as it felt as if the sweat was beginning to pool towards his toes. It made his paws tingle as the sensation moved towards the front of his boot and eventually underneath the paw. Kicks stopped working for a moment to look down at his boot. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary as he peered down at it: no holes and no tears. Yet, as he felt along the inside of the soles, the paw coming into contact with something cool, that moved against him as he dragged it along the base of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicks decided he had better take off the boot to see what was wrong with his boots, having fixed them recently he didn't want to have to make a brand new pair. Bracing himself against the table, he lifted his boot up and pulled it away from his paw, the skunk briefly sniffing at the boot's worn scent before peering inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, while Kicks had been removing the boot, you were being shaken around inside. The sudden removal of the paw from the boot left you with no perch to hold yourself against as you tumbled to the opening of the boot. The opening still up too high to reach, you could only hold yourself against the warm insole of the boot as it was tilted in Kicks' paws. The rush of cool air was a welcome relief from the musky warm scent of the skunk's boot, but you remain in your perilous position as the boot was positioned in front of a pair of large eyes, they are deep purple and as you braced yourself against the sole of the boot, they shift down to meet your gaze. As the large purple orbs focus on your small form, you are unsure, and quite afraid of what you are being perceived as if anything at all. </span></div></div>",

He opened his maw to speak, but his words failed him, nothing coming out as he just stared right at you. You weren't quite sure how to respond yourself, feeling a little awkward sitting in the giant's shoe. Kicks had to take a moment to come back to his senses, slowly realizing now that the mayor themselves have made their way into his boot. Slowly and gently, he brought the shoe to the table in the store, where he steadily tipped the boot over a bit, allowing you to fall out of it and softly land on the wooden table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither you or Kicks seemed to have any words. You could only look up at him, finally being able to just take in his massive size. He was huge compared to you, the best comparison you could come up with was that he was about the height of a skyscraper. For a minute the Skunk grimaced, finally beginning to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What were you doing in my boot? And why are you so-- <i>puny</i>?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really know how to answer those questions, but decided to explain the best you could. Waking up on the carpet, taking a rest on the boxes, trying to climb up him, falling into his boot... You tried not to leave out a single detail. You couldn't really give him a good answer to why you were so small, which only made Kicks more concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know how you help you get back to normal, Chum. You remember anything <i>weird </i>happening to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could really only shake your head, not a single thing coming into mind. The only conclusion you could make is that somehow this happened in your sleep. Kicks sighed a little at that, and you could feel the Skunk's hot breath from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then. Maybe you oughta stick with me? I'm not gonna hurt you, and I don't really like the idea of letting you run around this tiny, mayor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel a little relieved when Kicks mentioned he has no ill intent towards you. It was obvious he didn't want to hurt you before, but somehow just hearing that makes you a bit more comfortable. You give a nod at his words, telling him you would feel a bit better being with him. Kicks returned with a bit of a warm smile, holding out his paw for you to climb up on. You immediately do, and almost right away you nearly lose your balance once the paw moves, causing you to fall to your knees and hold onto Kicks' paw-pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicks' other paw opened up one of his shirt pockets, which he then slowly slides you in, making sure you are kept in a safe place. You could feel his warmth and hear his heart pumping from there, almost feeling kind of soothed and relaxed in the pocket of the skunk. Once you've finally settled in, Kicks buttons the pocket shut, keeping you inside as you have no choice but to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicks begins to move again to..</span></div></div>",

You attempt to stand in the fabric pocket, before trying to release the button, reaching through the slit of cloth and turning the button, finally barely managing to break it free. You peek up from the pocket, getting a perfect view of the now humongous world you used to live in. Kicks was already pushing his way out of the shop, turning the \"OPEN\" sign over to \"CLOSED\", and took a deep breath of fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Skunk made his stride, smiling a little. You could barely be able to see passed his chin, but you could at least tell it was a warm one. You were about to squirm more in the pocket to get a better look around, but a wolf approached the skunk, which made you hide back into the pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Kicks!\" A voice let out. You slowly try to look up, seeing who this new person was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Hey, Lobo. Just closin' up shop right now.\" The Skunk replied, giving the other a short nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? You're closing pretty early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, gotta get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Hey, we good for coffee tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-- Sure. I'll be there 'round the time I'm always, chum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! See you!\" The wolf smiled, waving a paw before heading his way back to town. You couldn't help but lean out a little to watch the other walk away, grasping onto the pocket. Unfortunately, you flip out after leaning to far, but still remain holding onto the pocket. You desperately try to grip onto the cloth, and pull yourself up, but it seems more difficult then it sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to build your strength back up, trying hard to get back into the pocket with your own upper body strength..</span></div></div>",

Eventually you find it, but it feels oddly fluffy. Kinda like fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little man. I see you've finally stopped counting sheep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud voice astonishes you and you look up at the source. You look up to see a gigantic K.K. Slider looming over you. That must mean these furry walls are his fur!<br>\r\nThe giant white dog lowers his hand towards you. As he pinched you between his two soft fingers, you noticed that he wasn't holding his guitar like usual, but instead it was lying on the ground next to his stool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to face K.K. Slider while standing on the palm of his paw.<br>\r\n\" Alright, little man, sit back while I give you the details\".<br>\r\nK.K. Slider's voice was smooth and gentle but his breath was terrible. Although, you had gotten used to that after living in a town of animals.<br>\r\n\"While I was scopin' the venue, I found you lying there. Heck, I almost stepped on you. Then I copped you while the good doctor was catching some z's\".<br>\r\nHe must mean Dr. Shrunk.<br>\r\n\"Point is, I've got a gig comin' up soon and I'm gonna let you decide where I should hide you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where will it be little man?\"</span></div></div>",

That meant there was only one option, though it wasn't very pleasant..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Underneath you..\" you said finally, K.K. kept his cool composure. \"You sure little man? Can't say it'll smell too fresh.\" The dog asked, you already knew he was right. You nodded hesitantly. K.K. lifted his body a little bit and rested you on the chair, you sat in a damp line as you stared up at his sweaty balls and asscrack. \"I'll get you when the concert is done.\" K.K. said and rested back down, leaving you in the smell. You were between his balls and anus, the squishy balls at your feet and the smelly hole just about your head. You were covered in sweat by the time music was heard, though worse was yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumble was heard and the hole flexed and smelly gas drafted over you. It smelt gross!

Leaning your neck back you saw that your guess was correct. Standing before you was a gigantic Digby, waiting around for someone to examine the houses they had for display. It was clearly a slow day and he looked rather bored. The surroundings were most likely quiet enough that he'd be able to hear you i you tried calling up to him and so you shouted his name a few times.<br>\r\nDigby looked surprised when his ears picked up your calls, then confused as he looked around. Finally after calling again he looked down and spotted the tiny Mayor by his feet. He blinked a few times, not exactly believing his eyes at first, but soon he reaches down and picked you up gently. You sat in his open palm in front of his face. Looking back up at him you saw his expression shift from bored and confused to...</span></div></div>",

You only nodded in response still trying to take in the sheer size of him. <br>\r\n\"How did you get like this anyway? Is there anyone out there looking for you that I should take you to?\" Again you were silent for a moment before shaking your head. <br>\r\n\"I just kinda appeared here.\" You finally speak up. Digby did his best to hide his excitement, not that it mattered since you were at his mercy and no one else even knew about this. You were essentially his now. The perfect thing for such a boring day. <br>\r\n\"Well, I can't leave work yet, but since you're here I could take you to one of the houses and write it off as being your guide. I'll even take you to that nice big house that you asked us to preserve in the west lot.\" You simply nodded unknowingly falling deeper into Digby's trap. As the dog boy carried you you saw the house in question, it was a perfect recreation of a massive mansion that a mayor from another town lived in. The HHA made this replica after he visited your town and you liked it so much that you had them preserve it so that it would never be taken down to make room for new houses. For Digby, the perfect place to keep you hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took you inside he placed you on the floor and sat down on a nearby chair, sighing as he relaxed before returning his attention to you.

Digby on the other hand gleefully thought of the many things he could do with the now minuscule mayor. As he returned his focus to you, standing between his feet with a nervous expression, he remembered overhearing his sister mentioning something about having rather suggestive fantasies at work after the new mayor took his position. Who knows, maybe if he eases her into the idea, he could share his new toy with his sister. But that would have to be for another day. Some day when he knows he won\u2019t have to worry about losing his plaything. Digby was snapped back into reality by a straining feeling around his groin. Looking down, he saw an impressive bulge struggling against his pants. He blushes slightly, but then his eyes shifted back to you and a grin started to form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large hill forming in his pants didn\u2019t go unnoticed by you. Nor did his smirk which was enough for you to figure out what was going on. You tried to sprint, but Digby effortlessly stopped that with a fuzzy toe knocking you over and pinning you to the floor. You tried to squirm free, but Digby held you in place with the faintest of effort. His grin grew wider as your struggles made it clear just how much power he held over you. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play a fun little game.\u201d He said in a cheerful tone. His toe let up, but soon you found yourself between his big and second toes, picking you up from the floor. There was a rather powerful musky smell radiating from the foot which assaulted your senses as they held you tightly in place. \u201cSince I saw you looking at my other little friend here.\u201d He patted the bulge as he said this. \u201cI thought it would be a great idea to let you two get better aquatinted.\u201d You felt a frightening chill overtake your entire body as you tried once again to squirm free. Digby giggled at your futile struggles and gently plucked you from the toe. Using his free hand, he unzipped his pants and slowly lowered them, revealing a pair of tight looking briefs with the HHA logo on them. And more importantly you saw the monster, still restrained, but much more free than when the pants were on. \u201cReady for your play date, you two?\u201d He teased as he moved you closer, savoring the feeling of power.</span></div></div>",

It was big, not extremely massive, but it seemed flat on one end and pointy on the other. Wait.. this wasnt a metal tube, it was a nail! Wait, that was impossible! Suddenly a mighty roar rumbled through the air, shaking the ground, looking up you saw a giant blue blur on a... stool? It took you a moment to process it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyrus!\" You exclaimed as another snore rumbled through the air. Based on the fact the blue alpaca was sleeping you guessed he had another long night. Glancing around you didn't see the Pink Partner to Cyrus, Reece. \"Must be too early.\" You noted to yourself as another snore rung through the air. Well, considering there was no other life in the store, the Alpaca was your only chance to get help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Alpacas are clean animals, or they can be if they're cleaned. Based on the smell the foot on the ground gave off told you Cryrus didn't care much for cleaning. With dirt under the nails, and thick jam between his toes that gave an early sign of what was to come. The smell was rancid as you approached the sweat coated foot. You gagged as you got to the toe, it was gross. You sighed and started to climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce into the fur and away from the foot things got better, the fur was greasy but didnt smell too bad. Eventually, you reach a crosssroad as you got to the thighs/knee area. You could climb up his front, but that would get hard as he was leaned over on the bench and that would be a very vertical climb. Climbing his back came with its own issues. For one, you could look like a bug to someone and get crushed. Another was how to get to the back. You could climb around, which would probably be easier, but your arms were begging for a small rest. You could struggle through, or climb through the underside of the alpaca... how do you go about this?</span></div></div>",
