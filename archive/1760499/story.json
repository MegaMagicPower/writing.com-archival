He was taught to listen to pokemon and he knows how to speak to them. Unlike his father though he does like to battle. He made a stronger link than his father did with Zekrom! Grey battled through everyone, his favroite gym leader being Roxie. He admired her and strived to be a gym leader himself, but he was unable to because of his love for multipule types of pokemon. He went along with it and moved on, going to the sinnoh and hoenn regions and battling as well as starting up contests. Now he's here in Ultima and he's ready for more action!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Quriky, often changing. You never know what he'll do next!

New Light City was his destanation for right now, but he already knew what type of gym he'd be taking on next. Poison... He wanted to know if the poison Gym was as good as Roxie. He basically idolized her, thinking of her as a mentor in battle and stratagy. He knew what he was facing in a poison Gym of course. Toxic, venoshock, toxic spikes, the works... But he had a plan. Swoobat. She could stay away from the spikes and deal massive damage with heart stamp and physic. She would also keep the poison at by with attract and a pecha berry as a held item. If she fainted all he had to do was send out Crobat or luxray and simply overpower them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go...\" Grey said as they pulled into the harbor. He stepped off the ship and looked around, a professor was just ahead with a name card. \"Grey Kage\" it read. \"Looks like I'm the only veteran trainer this time around...\" He spoke to himself, aproaching the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You must be Grey Kage then! I'm, the pokemon professor around here!\" She said, holding out a hand. Grey took it and shook lightly, not speaking to her. \"Well it's good to meet you!\" She said as she began to rummage through her bag. \"Now where did that starter set go...\" She pulled out another bag full of items and other goods and passed it to him. \"This is your starter kit, it holds ten extra pokeballs, a badge case, a ribbon case, ten potions and a region map. Grey took the bag and sorted the items into his own bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll probably want to move on to one of the gyms closest to here, which would be Crimson city...\" She said, before turning and walking away. \"Oh! And good luck Grey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey simply sighed as she left and looked over the map. Crimson city was only one route away... But the Abandoned plant wasnt too far off either...

He was passed the items and a white pokeball as well. \"Permier ball, free with every purchse of ten pokeballs.\" The clerk said.

I think we should do some training...\" He said as he looked over the new route. \"There is bound to be some strong pokemon here...\" He nodded and pulled out his pokeball. \"Come on out!

One day he discovered and injured Totodile in the village, he took it home and cared for it, the two became best friends and once the Totodile was back to full health it refused to leave, so Austin caught it and named it Croco.

It was a sneasel and it tried running away at first, but when a tree almost toppled and crushed Jason, the sneasel saved him by creating a pillar of ice to prevent it from falling over any further.

He spent most of the time either doing swordplay or hanging out with the family pokemon.  When he was 4 his parents died for a mysterious reason and he was orphaned.  He was taken in by a family of Dragonite and raised as one if their own.  When he was 10 he left his family of Dragonite to go on a pokemon journey, he discovered early on though that a Dratini from his family of Dragonite had followed him.  As soon as he got to little birch town some trainers saw the Dratini with him and tried to capture it but they did't count on Riki protecting it they where inraged and left.  Once Riki got to the lab he asked for a starter but they where out of them so, he asked if Dratini would count.  They said yes and caught Dratini in a pokeball and gave it to Riki.  Soon after Riki beat the Junior League in just a couple of days(yeah he is that talented).  After that he beat the advanced league in just a week and a half.  The elite four and the campion where so impressed that they requested that he became the dragon type gym leader in Chi Village he excepted the offer and made some adjustments to the gym.<br>\r\nRiki's gym pokemon: Dragonite, Garchomp, Salmance, Haxsarus, Hydregien, and Flygon<br>\r\nRiki's Main pokemon: Hurricane the Dragonite, Fin the Garchomp, Drake the Salamance, Axe the Haxsarus, Orochi the Hydregien, Meteor the Flygon, and Saburu the Lucario<br>\r\nRiki's Sub pokemon: none<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo do you want to go with Riki?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Riki's pokemon are extremely powerful and hard to beat that is why he is the youngest gym leader in Ultima so far and by far the most powerful his power is equal to that of all of the elite four and the champion combined so consider yourself lucky if you beat him so far he has had an unstoppable winning streak)</span></div></div>",

The resounding sound of a duo of soft claps proceeds with a very eager man rolling up close to the girl in his wheelie chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe explains, \"Yes a surprise! A surprise I have cookin' up just for you, Ms. Plum.\" He rolls himself in his chair back to his computer desk to resume typing at his keyboard with Avelyn still as clueless as ever. The teenage girl was seated on a smaller stool with a large tub in front of her, filled with warm water and foaming bubbles from the bath she was giving to a Pokemon. A rather annoyed Nuzleaf is sitting in the middle of it with lowered eyelids and brows, grumbling to himself as Avelyn proceeds to rub a washcloth over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks, \"Well...what for? My birthday already happened long ago this year and I haven't done any exceptional work for you as of late, Professor Palm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor himself swirls his chair around from his desk to face the girl with shoulders shrugged and his hands in the air, \"Ms. Plum, why do suggest that there has to be some reason for it? Can I not just be generous to you?\" He says with a comical look on his face. Professor Palm himself was comical in a way, being expressive and quirky. The Pokemon researcher was definitely one of the younger ones to come by, being in just his late twenties and a lanky figure. A tall man with pale caucasian skin, his curly hair was poofed out in a thick fro that looked like a bleach blonde cotton ball was growing out from his head. Adventurous light blue eyes through circular glasses stare at the girl with a clear goal of passing off what he said more of an excuse than a reason. The professor himself could've been confused for a beach bum if it wasn't for his title or labcoat. A hawaiian shirt is buttoned together underneath his open white coat, exposing his cargo shorts (sometimes even straight up swim trunks) and weaved flip flops. His long sleeves are rolled up on his arms to accumulate with the warm weather he typically enjoyed, making anyone wonder why he even bothered with the labcoat. Perhaps its just so people take him and his research more literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvelyn fixes her hair and grumbles, \"Sir, you always have a reason when doing something for someone else. And generosity isn't one of them. And I keep telling you to just call me Avel-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghhk. You wound me, Ms. Plum.\" He interrupts while clutching his chest to fake some pain before returning to his casual nature with a finger wagging, \"Buuuut you're not far from the truth. Which makes you all the more perfect research assistant. And no need to be humble, Ms. Plum. All the work you've done here has been exceptional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nuzleaf grunts as he's forced to have water rubbed over his head, \"Does giving baths count as 'exceptional research' then?\" Avelyn smiles at that and answers, \"Sadly to him, yes it does.\" Avelyn had the natural gift to understand Pokemon, a trademark inheritance than ran through her family line. And with it she's helped Professor Palm in numerous ways with it, even helping him along with other research assistants of his who have the gift to develop a prototype in people and Pokemon being able to communicate with each other. The Professor had many assistances, but they're scattered all across Ultima, with Avelyn being the only one in the small living community known as Little Birch Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor himself turns himself around from hearing the Nuzleaf and the girl talking, \"Oh? And what's he saying now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvelyn confesses, \"He uhhh...is curious if this counts as important research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden slam on the desk cause her hair to bristle with Prof. Palm smiling excitedly, \"Of course it is!\" He spins himself in the chair back to his computer and resumes typing, \"I'm curious at what temperatures of water Grass-type Pokemon enjoy or benefit from the most. Do they prefer something relaxing and hot like we do like a jacuzzi or shower? Or perhaps something more natural like cold rain or cool river water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nuzleaf raises a brow with gritting teeth, \"What's the point of forcing me to sit through this like some kid? Why the bubbles?! Why not just ask?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalm pauses in typing and asks as he stares at his screen, \"What's he saying now over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He says he likes warm water the most.\" Avelyn replies to the professor with the Nuzleaf flashing a look back at her. She whispers to him, \"I mean you do, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really care what temperature it is, as long as it ain't frigid or molten hot like any common living thing.\" He huffs with crossed arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProf. Palm sputters a chorus of keyboard keys being mashed in with an accelerating joy burning him. \"Interesting. Interesting! This changes some of my suspicions then. See? Even with these little discoveries, we become a step closer in understanding Pokemon, and they to us. Soon there won't be much difference in us and them at all.\" He continues to work on his report as Avelyn pulls the Nuzleaf out of the metal round tub to set him on the floor, preparing a small towel to dry him off in. He however quickly snatches it from Avelyn, giving her a glare, and proceeding to dry himself. The girl grins and stands up from her stool, drying her own hands and arms off in a separate towel as Prof. Palm prints his report out and stacks it to an already large tower of papers by his desk that dared to be teetered over by the lightest touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still haven't told me what this surprise is, Professor.\" Avelyn asks as Palm's Nuzleaf is busy swaying his hips while shaking the grinding towel behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise then!\" The researcher says while kicking away from his desk, letting his wheelie chair take far away to the end of the room by a door, stepping out of it. \"Now then, you've been my assistant for several years now, not as long as some of my others, but you're already a favorite pick of mine~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvelyn didn't know how to take the flattery and rolls her head, \"Where ya goin' with this, Prof.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalm doesn't cease to keep the mystery going and continues, \"Plus you've stayed here in Little Birch for most of your life instead of other trainers who venture across the vast biomes of Ultima.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...By my own decision.\" Avelyn retorts back with crossed arms. She wasn't that all interested in gym leaders or becoming the Pokemon League Champion like every other trainer out there, more or less because it was a title that meant much to her and her goals were more about learning and befriending Pokemon than forcing them to fight each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalm opens the door, \"Now, you've never owned a Pokemon yourself, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You've met Puff, our Hoppip back at home.\" The girl retorts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor rolls his eyes, \"That's more or less your father's Pokemon, Ms. Plum. I'm talking about a Pokemon you've connected with you and you alone that traveled every step with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I mean I've chatted and befriended plenty of other people's Pokemon, with the occasional wild one but...\" She says, rubbing her arm. Now that she thought about it, she's never had any Pokemon to call her own, but that wasn't really ever a problem. She's taken care of so many other people's Pokemon along with helping study others that the professor went out to get or interact with, all of them felt like they were hers in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProf. Palm shakes his head, \"Those aren't what I'm talking about.\" The Nuzleaf is finished drying himself off, with Palm noticing him. \"C'mere Wally!\" The Grass-type twitches its sprout leaf atop his head before looking over at the man. Approaching Palm, he's scooped up in the professor's arm and tucked to Palm's side, having his leaf tugged at in a rather ticklish manner. He grunts and sneers before eventually laughing some as the professor pinches and tickles his sensitive leaf. \"See. Pokemon and people have a rather unique bond with one another. But a trainer and their Pokemon...that's something completely different. Something even better and far grander, I can't begin on how to explain it to you.\" Looking to Avelyn, he smiles. \"And that's why I'm going to have you find that out for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestures Avelyn inside where the discovers a desk table with a pokeball resting on it. The girl shakes her head with a hand on her head, \"<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">Oh don't do this</font>...\" She mutters with the professor snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on and take it. That's your new Pokemon. It's your job to help him learn and grow, and from that experience, you'll learn and grow as well! He was a hard one to find, and not many other trainers can get there hands on one, so take it as a good reward for all the hard work you've done for me.\" He continues to say with Avelyn already at the table, picking the ball up into her hands. She had no clue what was inside it, or if she would even accept such a thing. But without wasting anymore time, she decides to at least see this new Pokemon that'll act as her starter...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the Ultima Region. Wile it may seem like your typical island region, many Pokemon Trainers from all over come to take on it\u2019s massive Pokemon League. The Ultima Pokemon League is said to be the largest and most challenging league in the world. However this is also home to the elite division of Team Rocket. Do you have what it takes to become a Pokemon master?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story you can take a role of a new Trainer starting his Pokemon journey in Ultima taking on the Junior League (8 Gym\u2019s, elite four, and champion.), a veteran Trainer coming to the island to take on the Advance League (17 Gym\u2019s, elite four, and Champion.), or some other type of character in Ultima (Gym Leader, Team Rocket member, Pokemon Ranger, Etc.). You can also take part in other Pokemon events like Pokemon Contests and the Pokatholon. Some of the basic towns and locations are (Note: Gyms can be done in any order)<br>\r\nLittle Birch Town (Pokemon lab, starting point of Junior League)<br>\r\nNew Light City (Main Harbor, starting point of Advance League)<br>\r\nCrimson City (Fire Gym)<br>\r\nSapphire Lake<br>\r\nCyan Town (Water Gym)<br>\r\nEmerald Forest <br>\r\nIvory Town (Grass Gym)<br>\r\nDandelion City (Electric Gym, Pokemon theater)<br>\r\nSkyline City (*Normal Gym, Pokemon contest hall)<br>\r\nRuby Park<br>\r\nSand valley town (Ground Gym)<br>\r\nRock head Caverns (Rock gym)<br>\r\nIron City (*Steel Gym)<br>\r\nAurora Village (*Ice Gym)<br>\r\nValor City (*Fighting Gym, Sports coliseum)<br>\r\nWisdom resort (Psychic Gym)<br>\r\nLunar City (*Dark Gym)<br>\r\nAbandon plant (Poison Gym)<br>\r\nViolet Manor (*Ghost Gym)<br>\r\nWindmill Village (*Flying Gym)<br>\r\nMantis Village (*Bug Gym)<br>\r\nChi Village (*Dragon Gym)<br>\r\nVictory road<br>\r\nScarlet Tower (Elite four and Champion HQ)<br>\r\n(*Gyms not visited in Junior League) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story there are Pokemon from all five generations in this region so you can find any Pokemon here. The starters can be any starter from any game. You can use any type of Pokemon Battle in this story (Single, Double, Triple, and Rotation.)  Pokemon in this story can talk ether by use of a Mini translator, Telepathy, or the natural ability to understand Pokemon. Also in this story Pokemon aren\u2019t limited to just four so any move a Pokemon can learn it can use, plus you can make your own original moves. Also your character may hold more then the standard 6 Pokemon with the Advance License (Max of 14 Pokemon) However League Battles only allow the maximum of 6 to be used in one battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can take your story in any direction you want, But I do have a few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: When you make a character leave an option to make a new character.<br>\r\n2: Feel free to add new locations, but make sure that they fit the world of Pokemon.<br>\r\n3: No sexual content what so ever.<br>\r\n4: No Vore<br>\r\n5: I will allow mild swearing, but if the chapter goes to far it will be removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add and have fun. ^_^</td>",
