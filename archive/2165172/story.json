            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Y/N. You were born into a family of Nekoshou, a rarer kind of Nekomata. You had two sisters. Their names were Kuroka and Shirone. Both of your sisters had golden eyes, but Kuroka had black hair while Shirone had white. <br>\r\nShirone was always quiet while Kuroka was loud. In a sense, they were each others opposites and you were the bridge to connect them. They were always affectionate with you in childhood, with Kuroka always setting you in her lap while petting your ears, and Shirone sat in your lap forcing you to pet her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were always a little intimidated by Shirone. She was such a forceful person when it came to you, and she always tried to make sure you only looked at her. All your childhood friends were scared away from you because Shirone threatened them, and she threatened you into never leaving her. Even after you were all taken in by a devil and Kuroka was turned into a reincarnated devil, she still kept you to herself, using her natural strength that opposed her small frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirone stayed by yourside every minute of ever day, even while you were showering or sleeping, she stayed with you. Shirone also hissed at any girls other then Kuroka that came close to you, scaring away many potential friends you could've had. You we're lonely, even if Shirone and Kuroka stayed by your side. Your life got repetitive quickly because when Shirone learned about some people being gay or Bi Sexual. She kept all genders away from you, except for, of course Kuroka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Kuroka was said to have went mad with power and murdered her master, though you doubted that greatly. Kuroka always had the utmost skill in keeping her power in check, and you watched her train with it. None of the general devil population knew this of course, and called for you and your twin sisters heads, believing that more of devils would die if the two of you were allowed to live. This wasn't true of course, but the devil population was frightened by Kuroka's powers and pushed that hatred onto the easiest targets, you and Shirone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought to a jail cell, though the guards let you stay together due to the glare Shirone gave them. You were even set to be executed together as some show of \"niceness\". You, of course knew that it was just to make sure one sibling didn't lose control because the first sibling died. As your heads were being laid against the guillotine you heard a mans voice yell out to stop, and immediately the executioners ran away from the guillotine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release the girl, my sister wishes to add her to her peerage\" The red haired man who had spoken this was easily recognizable by appearance. He was the Lucifer Satan, the strongest devil alive and hero of the great war. His words left a hidden undertone to them that the executioners noticed. 'the boy can die though'. Shirone called out to you, screaming your name and starting to let out wisps of magic. Sirzechs Lucifer knew that letting you die would cause Shirone to never listen to Rias, so he ordered the executioners to let you go too, if only to keep Shirone calm. You were both brought to the Gremory Estate in nothing but the prison uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirzechs led you and Shirone towards the the main lobby, where Shirone was told that she was going to meet her new master. Shirone stated that she was fine having a master, but only under the condition that you belonged to only her, and not her new master. Sirzechs, not really caring much about you allowed her request, and Shirone let out what could possibly be the biggest smile you had ever seen her use. After she signs the legal documents, you would belong to her and her alone, and you couldn't escape or the devils would hunt you down to finish what they started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified of the future with Shirone as a devil. Before when she was just your twin sister, she kept everyone away and stuck to you like glue, but now that she owned you, she could keep you locked away or handcuffed to follow her around, and you couldn't say or do anything to counteract her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the main lobby and there was a small girl with red hair sitting there with a black haired girl. You assumed that the redhead was Lucifer's sister and your sisters new master, but you didn't know who the black haired girl was, but she was pretty. The redhead jumped to her feet when she saw your sister enter, already excited to induct the newest member of her peerage. Since she was a devil born of a pure-blood family, she already had her set of chess pieces, and only the queen piece was missing, presumably used on another person already. The red head introduced herself as Rias Gremory, and the black haired girl revealed herself as Sona Sitri, presumably the sister of the current Leviathan. Rias asked who you were when suddenly Shirone cut in, saying that that information is irrelevant. Rias looked to her brother quizzically, and he told her about the \"special\" arrangements between you and Shirone in exchange for her being a devil. Sona also seemed interested in you, but was quickly glared at by Shirone when said interest was noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias got Shirone's attention and said something shocking. \"Your new name is Koneko Toujou, as a symbol that you left your sister behind for a new life with me.\" Shockingly to you, Shirone, or Koneko now, nodded, already having all she needs in the form of owning you legally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias asked what attribute Koneko would like to have added, and she immediately responded with strength, which meant bad news for you if she got it. She kept you with her enough with her current strength, If she got any kind of boost she would completely overpower you in anything, in worst case scenario she could molest you and you couldn't do anything to oppose it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias pulled out what appeared to be a rook piece and told the newly named Koneko to lie down on the floor. Koneko dropped to the floor on her back, and Rias stood over her, placing the rook piece in between her breasts before standing up again and chanting some kind of speech to presumably revive Koneko as a servant. After the speech is done the Rook piece melts into Koneko's skin, presumably showing that it was done correctly. Koneko, after standing up stomped on the floor to test her power, and the floor broke and created a tiny crater. Koneko then grinned savagely at you, already thinking of the things she could do to you with that much strength. You, on the other hand pale in fear and start sweating profusely, looking over to the Lucifer next to you with pleading eyes. He simply shrugs his shoulders and pats you on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Timeskip to nighttime</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko had filled out the paper work later that day that would legally make you her possession, someone that she can do whatever she wants to with no legal repercussions. Koneko dragged you all the way to her room, soon to be both your rooms, as she slammed the door open which was thankfully reinforced with steel, or you fear she would've tore it right off. Koneko pushes you onto the bed and says \"Stay\" with a withering glare, which causes you to freeze in fear on the bed. Koneko strips to the nude and orders you to as well. You hesitated, so Koneko slammed her foot on the ground, making a super loud thud that no one else heard because of soundproofing done to the room as well. You, being in the room heard how loud it was and understood the treat, 'Do what I say or feel pain!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Follow instructions in hopes that she won't touch you too much tonight<br>\r\nB: Try to compromise with her to keep your clothes, which will probably just piss her off<br>\r\nC: Try to compromise with her to do nothing but sleep tonight, which will probably piss her off twice as much as before, maybe leading to reverse rape.</span></div></div>",

You start taking off your shirt, but start to get uncomfortable at how strongly Koneko is staring at you, drool already starting to form at the corner of her mouth. You look away from Koneko, before fully removing your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to Koneko and you see her tail pop out and start waving while the drool on her mouth starts growing, an obvious sign that she's excited and wants you to continue. You take off your shoes and socks, which seems to annoy Koneko because of how slow you were, which she showed by tightening her hands and squinting her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to take off your pants, and you suddenly hear Koneko panting, and you start to blush, despite the circumstances. Koneko noticed you stop, so she stomped on the floor again, once again making a large bang and snapping you out of your daze. You hurriedly remove your pants to possibly pacify Koneko, which leaves you in only your underwear. Koneko, in addition to everything above, starts to go on the bed and crawl towards you with the drool practically about to touch the bed and her tail swinging at lightspeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly take off your underwear because of how embarrassed you are, before Koneko suddenly leaps towards you, tearing the underwear off and leaving you stark naked just like her. Since the bed is rather small, there isn't much space, and you have to squeeze together to fit two people, which works well for Koneko, but not so much for your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko suddenly pins both your hands above you with her newfound strength and locks lips with you, you being unable to resist her newly gained strength. Her arms weren't the only thing to gain strength it seemed, as her tongue easily broke through the barrier that was your lips and proceeded to explore every inch of your mouth, with Koneko's other hand feeling all over your body, from your small chest to even your ass. Koneko even touched your dick a couple of times which again, despite the circumstances, felt incredibly good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko suddenly ends the lip lock and starts to breath heavily, and you do as well. When you looked at Koneko, it seemed as if she was satisfied with just that for today, her eyes lidded over and her breathing slowed. Koneko suddenly let go of you and rolled to the side, prompting you to turn away from her as fast as possible to prevent her from grabbing your dick in the night, however useless turning around would be. You suddenly felt her hands circle around your back and arms, pinning your arms to your side and leaving you frozen in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip suddenly increases, causing you to feel slight discomfort, though no pain due to your naturally resistant nature as a Yokai. Koneko's breathing slows, signifying that she's asleep, causing you to let out a breath of relief that your virginity wasn't stolen that night, though you suppose it should happen fairly soon considering how close you had been to losing it tonight. You feel yourself start to drift off, the exhaustion of the trial created by Koneko catching up to you and overriding the slight discomfort caused by her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Sona Sitri entered the room, looking for you to possibly convert you to overwrite the property laws that Koneko signed earlier, and she also fell in love at first sight, being enamored by your adorableness though not able to convey it due to her stoic nature (Possibly introduce Serafall here too).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Akeno snuck in, not having heard of the \"Owner and Object\" relationship between you and Koneko, wishing you have you for herself (Possible fighting or maybe even a truce to keep all outsiders out).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Nothing happened, and the next morning came, an alarm waking both of you up at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Even in her sleep, Koneko constantly rubbed her face against your back, purring the entire time. Since you were still awake you heard the door to the room open and a young girl with black hair, purple eyes and red rimmed glasses tiptoe in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized her as Sona Sitri, the younger sister of the Maou Leviathan from the conversations before. She seemed to be looking for something, before laying her eyes upon you and frowning, for what reason, you don't know. Koneko had long since retired her Neko ears which means her hearing was reduced significantly compared to before. Sona walked towards you, quietly before whispering to you \"I can get you out of being her possession. Just find me while you're alone and I'll tell you how\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing these words filled you with joy! Escaping Koneko for good is blessing enough, but the pretty girl from before is the one saving you from her. If you couldn't fall asleep before, you definitely couldn't fall asleep now due to the jitters from hearing Sona's words. You stayed awake until the sun rose, still as energized as before, her words still echoing in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Koneko's arms untangle themselves from you before you heard a yawn coming from behind you. You turned around to see Koneko stretching like a cat would, pushing her back in the air and all. Koneko looked around and then at you, remembering the events of yesterday and what she was aloud to do to you now. She gave off another large smile, hugging you again before letting go and jumping off the bed, walking over to her closet and pulling out clothes that were left for her. You, however, were forced to reuse the same clothes as yesterday because the Gremory's hadn't expected to have to supply for a boy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on the plain clothes you were given from the jail before your execution and waited for Koneko, knowing that if you left before her she would get angry at you. Koneko finished putting on her clothes, which was a casual shirt with a casual skirt. All around casual. Koneko grabbed your hand and pulled you out forcefully, making you faceplant on the floor. Koneko continues to drag you across the floor, not caring about you falling and not exerting much strength either due to her recent strength gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually manage to stand up again and thankfully, the floor outside your room is all smooth, nothing that would hurt being dragged across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, do you have an opportunity to find Sona and do you find her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Koneko left you alone to do something with Rias and you successfully find Sona.<br>\r\nB: Koneko left you alone to do something with Rias, but you don't find Sona and maybe got caught.<br>\r\nC: Koneko never left you alone for the entire day, leaving you unable to reach Sona</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you were being dragged around by Koneko she suddenly got a call on a phone, which you presume she got from Rias or the Lucifer at one point yesterday. Koneko pulls out her phone and answers it, before giving a monotone \"Yes?\" into it. You can hear the faint mumbles coming from the phone but not the actual words coming from it, which is strange because your ears should be able to hear perfectly at that distance. You see Koneko adopt an annoyed face before again, in a monotone voice saying \"Fine.\". Koneko hangs up before looking at you with a serious face and saying \"Go back to the room. If you aren't there when I get back you will be punished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face Koneko gave you at that time scared you, so you obviously said that you would be back before she did. You decided that now was the time to look for Sona, as per her instructions. Thankfully, you saw her earlier as Koneko was dragging you, thank the maou. You go into the garden where you saw Sona sitting at the table, and arrive quickly due to your photographic memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Sona still sitting at the table you saw her at before, even though it's been about half an hour since you've been there. You walk up to Sona and see that she's sleeping, which seems unusual for a heiress to do in public, but whatever, she promised that she would save you. Once you get close enough, you start telling Sona quietly to wake up, as shouting could possibly alert your sister. When she doesn't respond, you move to poking her in the shoulder, causing her to become startled and look around, not unlike a sleeping beast that was awoken. Sona continues looking around frantically before laying eyes on you, before calming down \"So, you were able to get away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah.. Someone called my sister and she had to leave somewhere\" You reply, the excitedness of being away from your sister already making you super excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I tricked Rias into thinking that she and Koneko should do <i>bonding exercises.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle, thinking about Koneko's face as she's doing said \"bonding exercises\", since Koneko had never been one for social contact. You suddenly hear Sona speak up. \"So, there's only one way I can free you from your sister's control, which is _______\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: \"- to be my slave rather then Koneko's. I'm a more important devil in the general societies eyes so they would rather I stay then she stays\" (Less Freedom, and Sona's Peerage can also take advantage of you)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB\"-  to join my peerage, since a person can't be under more than one person and I'm more important to devil society. You also become stronger to defend yourself from your sister\" (More Freedom, and stronger)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC \"- to become my sisters slave. If I ask her to accept you she would, and devil society would have no choice but to accept her decision (Very well protected, but Serafall is much more \"Forward\" then Sona, which would probably still lead to molestation. Less then Koneko, but still molested)</span></div></div>",

Sona pulls out a phone and calls who you assume to be Serafall Leviathan. You hear a loud voice come out of it, much louder then Koneko's phone, which allows you to listen in to the conversation. The first words you heard from the phone were \"SO-TAN!! YOU'RE CALLING ME I'M SO HAPPY!!\". The loudness of the voice suddenly causes your cat ears to fold to block out the noise, though not helping much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the loud voice a bit longer, before Sona manages to calm the owner of the voice down. \"Nee-sama, the little neko from before needs to become your slave to escape being owned by his sister, will you acc-\" Before Sona could even finish the sentence you hear the voice start screeching again. \"YES SO-TAN I CAN HAVE THE TWO BESTEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BESIDE ME!

You feel as if you should recognize this woman, but you don't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the woman starts shouting, her voice the same as Serafall Leviathan from the phone call, which means this woman is the Leviathan. \"SO-TAN AND Y/N-TAN! HUG TIME!\" Suddenly, you feel unbelievably strong arms circle around you and pushing you towards Sona, the grip even stronger then Koneko's post-devil. You can see why people respect her as the strongest female devil in existence, considering how physically strong she is even though she's primarily an ice user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you feel yourself separated from Sona and instead ensnared by both of the strong arms. You feel yourself being lifted in the air and spun around by someone, presumably Serafall Leviathan. You start to regret your decision to promise yourself to her, but it's too late now.

We're gonna be together forever, and no one is ever going to take you away from me, or I'll make them disappear.\" As she said the last bit her voice got creepier and, considering you were much shorter than her, scared you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself get lifted again like before, but not swung around this time.

You were taken through endless corridors, until you finally reached a large set of double doors, curved at the top. Serafall kicked it open and you felt as if you went blind, the pink of the room literally everywhere, poster of <i>Sera-tan</i> posted all over the walls, and a large pink bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafall gave you no time to get used to the room though as she dropped you on the bed and stripped. You blushed at this because Serafall was quite possibly the most well-endowed woman you had seen thus far, devil or not. Serafall noticed your blush before squealing and jumping towards you, instantly giving you a death grip not unlike Koneko, although this felt more carefree, as if she knew that even if you were taken away, she could take you right back, and she wasn't wrong in thinking this, considering her power put her above all other female devils sans Grayfia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafall snapped, causing the lights to go off before snuggling into you, hugging you like a teddy bear. You hear snoring behind you before thanking the Satans that Serafall didn't molest you in bed night one like Koneko, but then you realized the irony of your statement considering she herself is a Satan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you were about to fall into dreamland, you felt an immense power suddenly appear next to you, your Nekoshou senses further magnifying the intense power that appeared. It felt greater than anything you had ever felt before, even greater than the Lucifer Satan himself. When you looked towards the intense power, you saw what appeared to be a young girl in gothic lolita clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even comprehend it, you heard snakes approaching your bed. Not long after, you felt Serafall jolt awake from the power emitted by the Gothic Loli in front of you. Serafall let out a shiver, before looking over to the source of the power, immediately recognizing the Primordial Being in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have you come here Ouroboros Dragon?\" Serafall let out, obviously shaken by the being in front of her. The name \"Ouroboros Dragon\" sounded familiar, before you finally linked it to the Primordial Dragon of Infinity, one of the most powerful beasts in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... have come... for him...\" the Ouroboros Dragon replied, talking with unusual pauses in between her words. (Going to use Ouroboros Dragon to refer to Ophis until her name is revealed)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want Y/N Ouroboros Dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that... is his... name? I wish to... take him with me to... the dimensional gap.\" The Ouroboros Dragon replied, the pauses still as prominent as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Serafall's arms squeeze around you before Serafall shouted out \"Are you insane? He'll die in the dimensional gap\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will... give him... my snake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this, you felt a snake curl around your leg, before pulling you away from Serafall. Serafall was so distracted by Ophis that she didn't realize you were being pulled away until you left her grip, causing her to attempt to freeze the snake on instinct. The snake immediately broke through the ice and continued to drag you towards the Ouroboros Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.... go to... sleep,\" the Ouroboros Dragon said, before sending a blast of magical energy at Serafall, causing her to immediately slump over, although still visibly breathing. You look towards the Ouroboros Dragon, before opening your mouth and attempting to scream. However, Ophis immediately gagged you with the snake that was pulling you away and muffled your screams for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself being surrounded by intense power, before being lifted by some kind of psychic force towards the Ouroboros Dragon. \"My... name is... Ophis. You will... stay with me... forever,\" the newly named Ophis said, in the same Monotone voice as before. The snake that was gagging you suddenly entered your mouth and slithered down your throat, causing your gag reflex to go crazy. As the snake was entering your stomach, you felt it being absorbed into you, causing you to gain incredible power, yet also feel a strange connection to Ophis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... was my snake. It will keep.... you safe from... all harm and... tell me... where you are.\" Ophis said. Up until that point you were shivering in fright at being so close to such immense power, but when the snake was absorbed into you, you felt less scared of Ophis's power. The psychic power from before pulled you towards Ophis before you felt yourself be forcibly kissed by Ophis, her tongue unnaturally long and intruding all over your mouth, giving you no chance to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Happens Next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: The rest of Devil kind rush the room, causing Ophis to fight them all, you getting taken YET AGAIN by someone who wanted to take advantage of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Ophis quietly opens a tear, bringing you to her private room in the Dimensional Gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Something Else? I dunno.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had barely heard it while you were awake so you doubt Koneko would react much to it since she was sleeping. You looked up and saw a blacked haired girl with purple eyes and voluptuous breasts despite her not looking that much older than you. She had long black hair in a ponytail that reached all the way down to her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the black hair girl mumbling to herself, looking around the room. Despite the fact that you heard her mumbling, you couldn't understand exactly what she had been mumbling to herself. She looked around the room and her eyes locked onto both you and your sister. You saw the girl put her hand up to her mouth and give a little smile as if amused by what she saw. She walked towards the bed as stealthfully as she could and bent down, looking you in the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantaneously she grew a blush upon looking at your face, making you afraid of what exactly was going to happen. You saw her raise her hand to your face but considering Koneko's grip on you, you couldn't really move much to avoid it and even if you did, waking up Koneko while another girl in the room was just asking for Koneko to go on a rampage. You felt the dainty hands stroke the side of your face and you involuntarily let out a purr, your natural instincts reacting to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt Koneko stirring behind you, probably awoken by the shaking caused by the purr you let out. What happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Koneko falls back asleep, letting Akeno leave without being found out.<br>\r\nB: Koneko wakes up and immediately goes ballistic. <br>\r\nC: Koneko wakes up and surprisingly knows who Akeno is, and agrees to keep you within the peerage.

I, however have a proposition for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is?\" Koneko replied, seemingly pacified by the black haired girls words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keeping him inside the peerage of course! With our powers combined we could not only beat most devils but also prevent him from escaping. So, how about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Koneko grumbling, as if annoyed by the truth of what the other girl had been saying. You, however, grew terrified at the idea of not only one girl, but multiple girls being crazy for you. Of course, talking out now would only lead to punishment so you were forced to stay quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" You heard Koneko mutter out. \"If It'll protect him from all the hussies that try to take him, I'll settle on sharing with the group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was those words that sealed your fate as what could only be described as a toy for a group of devils that all overpowered you.

Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise,\" Koneko muttered back. This wasn't the worst group of devils you could've been enslaved to but it certainly wasn't the best. At this point you considered the fact that you were still not handcuffed to a bed a blessing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we know each other, it's time for some bonding!\" Akeno exclaimed, before jumping into the bed on your other side. Considering the bed was only made for 2 people Akeno and Koneko were forced to hug you as close as possible. Of course, that worked great for them but not so much for you. You were completely stuck, awaiting the following morning where the news would be broken to the rest of the peerage. All you could do now is sleep...</span></div></div>",

There were no girls to either side of you or in the room. Of course, the doors and windows seemed to be locked, an understandable thing considering you were seen as a slave, someone who held no loyalty and would try to escape at a moment's notice. The room looked the same, minus a few things out of place, not something unordinary for someone's room. You looked down at the bed and noticed a piece of paper.

What's your favorite kind of place? Desert? Beach? Mountainous?\" Daisy asked, getting your attention. She leaned in close with a flirty expression as she asked, \"Or perhaps you'd like to work as my personal handservant? I can guarantee that you'd be perfect for the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of helping Daisy dress up or undress ran through your mind, making your blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your offer is as generous as you are beautiful, Princess Daisy,\" You said, making Daisy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Daisy. If you get to call Peach by her name, then you get to call me by my name,\" Daisy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Peach was the one frowning, though she hid it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the conversation shifted to one about upcoming sports events.The princesses liked the fact you were a fan of theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they left you, the two kissed you on your cheeks at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a bush nearby, a certain female Koopaling was glaring at the two princesses.

After a moment of thought, you realized that would probably be the case... until you saw how Crazy-in-love Wendy was towards you.<i> 'There might be a chance the princesses might not be able to save me before Wendy decides to 'marry' me.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy tossed you in her clown car before sliding in next to you, making sure you felt her large bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find go to my personal castle in Chocolate Island!

She looked towards her troops and yelled, \"Let them go and let's get back to my castle, you losers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your relief, Wendy's troops did free your parents before the Koopa trops began hopping in pipes.

Your hands were pulled behind your backs and you had handcuffs put on you. You can't see your parents anywhere, so you assume they've either been caught already or escaped before they came, you hope the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're roughly pulled off the floor and pushed into the police car, none of the officers even talking to you. You were taken down to the police station, set to have a long time in jail for smuggling, however unaware it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day Princess Peach was informed by her police chief that they caught one of the smugglers, that it was a young man with H/C hair. Princess Peach gasps before hurriedly telling the chief to bring you to her. The police, obviously thinking that Peach wanted to punish you herself, left you handcuffed and with blindfolds on because he believed that \"Trash should not look upon the princess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lying in your cell before burley police officers started pulling you off the ground and putting your handcuffs back on, before tying a fabric around your eyes, presumably to make you sightless. You get pushed into the familiar feel of a police car before being driven who knows where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour of driving, you feel the car stop, and the telltale jingle of the castle blasting through speakers, leading you to believe you were at the castle at Peach's request, though why she kept you tied up, you do not know. You continue to be pulled, ignoring the gasps of the various toads around the castle, before the officer pulling you suddenly stops, before knocking hard on a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Peach. I brought the prisoner, just as you requested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring him in please\" You hear Peach's melodic voice answer back to the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly shoved and brought to your knee's, presumably in the same room as Peach, before you hear a gasp coming from Princess Peach. \"Why is he blindfolded and beaten? Why is he still handcuffed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh, he could be a danger to you, and trash does not deserve to lo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE ME THE KEYS TO HIS HANDCUFFS AND GET OUT OF HERE NOW\" Princess Peach suddenly yells, scaring you and probably the police man as well. You hear the jangle of keys and then you hear someone suddenly slam the door shut, presumably the police man leaving. You feel the blindfold around your eyes unwrap and become blinded by the sudden light of the room you're in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you see the Princess in her night clothes, which makes sense because it's night time. The thing you didn't expect to see, however wasan expression of lust on Princess Peach's face. Unknown to you, when Peach saw you all beaten and handcuffed, she started to get turned on because of you being handcuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Princess Peach tells you that she must administer some sort of \"punishment\", which is probably just self satisfaction for her.<br>\r\nB: Bowser suddenly breaks in on the request of Wendy, before kidnapping both you and princess Peach, you as a gift for his adopted daughter.<br>\r\nC::Daisy walks in an misunderstands the scene, believing that the Princess put those marks on you. </span></div></div>",

Only if Wendy doesn't find out,\" Pom Pom 2 replied, licking her lips as she looked at you. \"He is pretty cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the two Pom Poms, You saw them looking rather hungry at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you-\" You uttered before the Pom Poms began to fondle your body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a naughty human! Tempting us with your hot body!\" Pom Pom 1 said with a crazed look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Stop!\" You cried out. Alas, they were too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only Wendy hadn't taken an interest in you. Wouldn't you like a threesome with some sexy Pom Poms? We're willing to share you with each other...\" Pom Pom 2 asked as she and her friend then held you in place, nearly smushing you with their bodies being so close. \"The stupid Peach and Daisy? Not so much... If they tried anything, I'd smash them into teeny-tiny bits..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no I'm not interested...\" you said, worrying about Wendy's temper if... No, when she finds out about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We bet a kiss or ten will fix that attitude!\" The Pom Poms cooed before puckering their lip and slowly coming towards your head.</span></div></div>",

You must go on tons of adventures and stuff, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You chuckled. \u201cWell, yeah, I kinda do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, please tell us all about them!\u201d Peach said, ecstatic. \u201cI want to know every detail~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cSo do I~\u201d Both these princesses leaned closer to you, ready to be enraptured on what they expected to be epic tales of battle, fortune and triumph. It was surprising to see these two very important women so enthralled by you. It was fun, and you didn\u2019t mind, but just\u2026 surprising. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you may have even thought they were in love with you!..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...which, of course, they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you told them only slightly exaggerated stories of your various victories, smiting many an evil-doer (including the likes of Bowser, Wart, Fawful and Dimentio, to name just a few), finding a large quantity of riches and rescuing a number of poor, defenseless peasants and princesses, their minds only thought more of their undying love and devotion to you. They never wanted anything to hurt you\u2026 and if something did, they\u2019d regret it. Or if anyone else tried to take you for themselves. While they didn\u2019t like sharing, they practically had no choice, but if anyone else dared try and win you over (without at least consulting them), there\u2019d be consequences\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As of right then, though, you knew none of that. All you knew that perhaps you were an even greater hero than you thought, if you caught the attention of these two fair princesses!<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    \u201c...and those are all the ones off the top of my head,\u201d you finished, taking a deep breath. That\u2019s a lot of stories to tell\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWow, you\u2019re even cooler than I thought!\u201d Daisy remarked, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYou\u2019ve done so much for everyone\u2026 especially us\u2026\u201d Peach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cReally?\u201d you responded. \u201cHow have I done much for either of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, I can see her point,\u201d Daisy answered. \u201cOut of all the kingdoms you\u2019ve been in, you\u2019ve been in ours more than most, so you\u2019ve saved many of our people\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cNot to mention how many times you\u2019ve saved our kingdoms from grave danger, some of which we didn\u2019t even know about!\u201d Peach added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYeah! Like that secret society bent on replacing us with different princesses! Neither of us knew about it, but you followed the clues and locked \u2018em up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAnd that time you figured out that Tatanga and Princess Shroob were trying to fly down here and kidnap us just by noticing their ship in the night sky! A ship that was only a purple dot! A DARK purple dot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAND, in the last few baseball tournaments, you even ruined Bowser\u2019s equipment, just because the prize money would go to kidnapping us! I mean, who does all that??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    They were almost like fangirls, enthusiastically repeating to you stories you just told them, simply because they loved them so much. Actually, they weren\u2019t almost like fangirls, they WERE fangirls! Or\u2026 perhaps not, you thought. You figured, if they loved your stories, they probably also love-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cNot only that,\u201d Peach continued, \u201cbut you\u2019ve saved the world so many times! Like that time you destroyed an asteroid coming straight for us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAnd when you-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYes, yes, I know, you two, I did TELL you both,\u201d you interjected, covering both their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...the mouths of princesses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You quickly retracted your hands. \u201cUh, sorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cHey, it\u2019s fine!\u201d Daisy reassured. \u201cWe kinda owe you, anyway, considering all you\u2019ve done, for, well, everyone\u2026 especially us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYeah!\u201d Peach said, as if she\u2026 got an idea! \u201cWe owe you lot. We REALLY need to repay you.\u201d<br>\r\n    \u201c...Yeah!\u201d Daisy said, as if she was catching on to whatever idea Peach theoretically hatched. \u201cIn fact, you can ask us to do whatever you want, and we\u2019ll do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cUh-huh! So, our knight in shining armor, what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...Yeah, they\u2019re into you. Quite a bit, too, it seems. Seriously, they\u2019re even leaning towards you in such a way that their arms press their boobs together, which are already shown off, with all the cleavage. You even tried looking directly at them, and they either don\u2019t notice, or don\u2019t mind. Of course, you don\u2019t mind, they\u2019re PRINCESSES, and GORGEOUS, but they seem a bit\u2026 overly loving? Eh. This is a huge opportunity that you need to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    They probably want you to ask them out or something, but you could also just flat-out ask to fuck, or do anything intimate, really. Or you could do something weird like ask them to be your slaves. Hell, they might even be into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Or something else, something really creative...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Or you could reject their offer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    All up to you, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    (Well, first up, you wanna take up their offer? Don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And it didn\u2019t SEEM overkill\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cThis was your plan all along, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d you remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Yeah, it was,\u201d Peach giggled, as she started to move to your lap. Daisy did the same. As a warrior, it was relatively easy for you to keep them both on one leg, holding them up with your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cI mean, who could blame us? You\u2019re such a cutie~\u201d Daisy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cAlright, alright\u2026\u201d you said, brushing it off, keeping any concerns of spying to yourself for now. \u201cOh, also, is this order a one-time thing, or-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cNope!\u201d Daisy cut you off. \u201cYou can basically order us to do whatever you want, and we\u2019ll probably do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Probably?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want you wandering off with any other women,\u201d Peach explained. \u201cYou\u2019re OUR boyfriend, and we won\u2019t allow any cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYeah, if any girl even looks at you funny, she\u2019ll regret it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...Oh. They WERE crazy. Well, at least you can keep them under control\u2026 somewhat. Well, at least you can let all self-control go when you\u2019re alone with them. In fact, you let your hands slide all the way down to their huge, soft asses, and they didn\u2019t seem to mind, seeming even happier than before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, the relationship just started, they\u2019ll probably calm down after awhile, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOkay, then, where should we go?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cMmm, I believe that\u2019s your decision, honey,\u201d Peach replied, apparently already on to nicknames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know many fancy restaurants or whatever,\u201d you explained, \u201cso I think suggestions would be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, there\u2019s this great place in the town east of here, I think it\u2019s called Goomba Gourmet, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cYes, it\u2019s quite lovely,\u201d Peach said. \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive, but we;ll pay for everything, if you want~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You shrugged. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go!\u201d You were about to get up, but Peach signalled for you to stay down while Daisy whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A sports car being driven by a toad suddenly drove up, previously hidden from view. \u201cWhere do you three wanna go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cGoomba Gourmet, please,\u201d Peach told her as you three got in the back, you in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cGotcha,\u201d he responded, as he started driving there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The princesses leaned on your shoulders, seemingly very content with the situation, while you decided to just relax and not think about how crazy they seemed, and to just enjoy having two beautiful girlfriends for the time being. You caressed them wherever you felt like doing so, and they let you, happy as can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cTable for three, please,\u201d Peach ordered, and the staff quickly rushed to get you three a table, any table you wanted. The princesses picked out a booth by a window, and you three were sat down, same arrangement as the car, with you in between the princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After you ordered your food, from a waitress who got no small amount of glares from your dates (and reminded you of someone, especially that name on her nametag\u2026 Rosa\u2026), you noticed someone waving at you. It was Mayor Pauline, who you\u2019ve rescued a couple of times. You gave her a nod back before Daisy cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cHow the fuck do you know her?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Huh?\u201d You suddenly remembered their crazy tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cShe asked how you know Pauline over there,\u201d Peach said, sharing Daisy\u2019s frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWell, I\u2019ve saved her a few times while wandering New Donk City,\u201d you explained. \u201cI told you two, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The princesses shared a look. \u201cI\u2019ll go talk to her,\u201d Peach sighed, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, you don\u2019t have t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You were cut off by Daisy. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d She turned your head to hers, you now facing away from Pauline. \u201cNow, let me show you what dating a princess is like~\u201d She gently moved your head towards hers and pressed your lips to hers. You reciprocated the kiss as you wrapped your arms around her, unaware of what was happening between Peach and Pauline\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...After a bit, you heard Peach\u2019s voice yet again. \u201cAhem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Daisy separated you two, both of you panting. \u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t resist, since I had such a cute face to myself~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cHmmph. Well, then I\u2019ll just have to do this~\u201d Peach leaned into you and pressed her lips to yours, and you reciprocated this new kiss, forcing Daisy in the somewhat awkward position of being next to all this. You didn\u2019t think much of that, though, as all you could think about were Peach\u2019s soft lips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Okay, this is as long as we went,\u201d Daisy stated, separating you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Peach sighed. \u201cFine, fine, it was fun while it lasted~\u201d Peach winked at you. As you blushed, you noticed Pauline\u2019s table was now empty. What did Peach-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cFood\u2019s ready!\u201d your waitress said, serving you three your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As she bent down to serve it, her low-cut uniform allowed her huge jugs to take up quite a bit of space in your vision. This happened when she served drinks and appetizers as well, which seemed to tick off the princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Daisy reached out for her food, despite the waitress trying to put it right in front of her, she seemingly accidentally knocked Peach\u2019s water over, spilling its contents all over the waitress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She stood still, in shock for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Daisy said as the waitress quickly put down the food, blushing a deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, Princess!\u201d the waitress assured her, nervously laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll just get a new uniform\u2026 and a new water\u2026\u201d She rushed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cActually, I have to go to the bathroom first, before eating,\u201d Peach said, getting up and going as you and Daisy chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...When Peach returned, smiling, you saw the waitress rush outside of the restaurant, seemingly upset, as she tried to cover her still-wet dress. Before you could comment, a manager rushed over to your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cVERY sorry about her, princesses, we had no idea she was flirting with customers!\u201d he apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, sir, just don\u2019t let it happen again!\u201d Peach forgave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201c...Yeah!\u201d Daisy said, catching on. \u201cHow about we get a male waiter instead, just to be safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWhatever you need, princesses,\u201d he complied, as he rushed to get one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ...Yeah, they were crazy. No doubt about it. This wasn\u2019t something that would just blow off either, probably, they were full-blown yandere, meaning you were pretty much trapped in the relationship now. Your orders could be somewhat of a control, but they\u2019d probably ignore them if they went against their yandere instincts of keeping you all to themselves. Hell, it was a shock they could share you amongst the two of them! You just had to live with this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    That poor waitress, too. The spillage was obviously not an accident, and just meant to humiliate her, and possibly send a message. And then, her source of income was taken out from under her. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And what happened to Pauline?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The least you could do is apologize to one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You decided to wait before asking to go to the bathroom, so the timing wasn\u2019t suspicious. It worked, as the princesses seemed none the wiser of your true intentions. As you walked away, you decided the girl you were going to search for was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As long as you can remember you've been mistreated by your father because you weren't talented like your sister was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were honestly terrified of your sister. Everyone in your family listened to her, even your dad because she supplied the income for the family with her paintings. She could scold your dad and get away with it because your dad depended on her for money. She could literally molest you and you couldn't say anything against it because you know that she might get angry, and an angry Kazuki is something you would never want to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just came home after playing with a new friend at the park. She was a shy girl with pink hair named Sachi. As soon as you entered the room you and Kazuki shared she asked why you were so late. You told her that you were playing with a friend, and she asked if it was a girl. You know that lying to Kazuki is always a bad idea, so you tell her the truth, which is yes. Kazuki immediately starts getting agitated which scares you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuki shouted out \"Why are all your friends girls? Do you enjoy seeing me jealous? Is that it!\"<br>\r\n\"N-n-no, of course not Nee-Sama. I would never want to make you angry\" You stammer out, shocked at the loudness of her voice.<br>\r\n\"No, you wouldn't, would you?

You were trained regularly in swordsmanship so you could represent the family, and it started to show in your body. Girls around your age always blushed when you passed by with either a tight shirt or no shirt at all. Being shirtless even caused you to gain a fanclub in your hunter training school. One day the teacher sent the classroom home with news. \"We will be visiting Schnee headquarters in Atlas tomorrow so you can learn more about how dust is made for your futures. Be sure to get your form signed by then to go.\" The teacher then handed out said form before releasing you all to go home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive home and luckily enough, it seems both your parents are home at the same time, which is rare since they're both high level hunters. \"Welcome home Jaune!\" you hear them both call out, before responding back with your own \"I'm back\".<br>\r\nYou walk up to your mother and show her the form, and she reads it to herself silently, before signing in her portion and going to your father, asking him to sign it too. Your father spots something your mother did not, which is a slight line of text that is barely noticable in the contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-If the Schnee family should get interested in a student, they are allowed to take them into their house from their families without consent-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father, still against the possibility of you being taken away, refuses to sign the paper and saying that you just have to stay home. Your mother turns to you and tells you that she would convince your dad to let you go, and you trust her, before going into the backyard to train. After a couple hours of training you go in for dinner, your mother handing you back the fully signed form, telling you to have fun during your visit, but to stay safe. You finish dinner and wash your plate, before going upstairs to bed to watch some DustTube before going to bed, the excitement of going to <i>the</i> Schnee headquarters taking over your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>The next morning!</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in the morning, feeling more refreshed than ever before. Your parents had already left for their daily mission and your sisters were still sleeping, leaving you to say goodbye to no one as you exited your house for the last time, not that you knew at the time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at school on time, and the teacher is accepting the forms early. You hand in your form before getting on the bus to the airport so you could fly on a Dust Plane over to Atlas. After waiting about 20 minutes, more people start to get on the bus, taking up all the seats. You pull out your scroll to listen to some music in your earbuds while the bus starts moving. The entire trip took a little less than 2 hours, the distance between Vale and Atlas being quite short. You start to feel cold before pulling out the coat you bought before you came, already knowing of Atlas's extreme weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your classmates start to leave the airport at your teachers orders, once again boarding another bus. The bus brings you to Schnee headquarters, which you note is quite warm, hot even. You take off both your jacket and your shirt, leaving you only in a sweat shirt, and causing all the female students of your grade to start staring at you and, unknown to everyone else, a certain Ice princess was staring as well. You feel a piercing stare unlike any you had ever felt before coming from the higher area of the facility before dismissing it, believing it to only be your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weiss POV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must have him, he must be mine! He must only belong to me! Everything that is good belongs to me! Everything that I want belongs to me and I WANT HIM! I saw those sluts acting like they're attractive, trying to show off curves that don't exist to try to impress my blond knight. Of course, he ignored those sluts because he knew he should only look at me that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly start remembering about a certain clause in the contract to come here that I was interested in before. <i>-If the Schnee family should get interested in a student, they are allowed to take them into their house from their families without consent-</i>. I immediately knew that father could take my beautiful blond knight into our house, to be a slave, pet, or perhaps a lover for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Back to Second POV</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly shiver, even though it's super hot inside the facility. You started to notice an arguably pretty white themed girl following the group around, and you assume it's Weiss Schnee, heiress of the Schnee company, due to her easily noticeable traits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Suddenly, an \"attack\" on the Schnee family ends up with you being kidnapped. (Staged attack to kidnap you)<br>\r\nB: Suddenly, a real attack on the Schnee family by the White Fang ends with you being kidnapped (Yandere Blake Belladona)<br>\r\nC: You are kidnapped quietly while you got lost from the group, leaving no commotion whatsoever</span></div></div>",

Knowing though you cant land a beauty like that even if you tried, you've had to resort to some underhanded tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat mixture you mentioned before is actually a love potion, designed to make her fall in love with the first person she sees.

She was in her classic red dress, her long whit hair dropping over her and carrying a small basket. She was beyond gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Hi Mirajane. Nice seeing you today\u201d You say trying to act nice and cool. Mirajane not being the kind of girl to ignore someone walked closer to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you too\u201d She said in her usually cheery self. \u201cYou look quite fresh today\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at the compliment as you try not to make it too awkward. \u201cUh thanks, just trying to put on a good look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, i must say its working\u201d She said as you almost melted from the compliment. \u201cAnyway, I'm going to just buy some Yognive Apples is that alright\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, can you do me a favour first\u201d You ask her as she looks your way, ears open as you grab the cup with the love potion. \u201cIve been thinking about extending my branch and make fruit shakes. However i don't know how good they are so-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want me to be the first one to taste them?\u201d She asked as you nod. \u201cWell i would love to\u201d She said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre... are you serious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, it would be my honour.\u201d She put the basket on your desk and reached for the cup, bringing it up to her nose as she sniffs it. \u201cHmmm. Smells good, whats in it exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh... thats a secret\u201d You say figuring it would be better to not tell her. Then to your absolute delight she took a small sip of the potion. She brings it away from her plush lips as she savours the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Mirajane... how was it?\u201d You ask with the stupidest smile on your face. She opens her eyes to reply, however stop when she sees you. You cheer in your brain as you recognise that look. Its the look you give her all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirajane then gave you a loving smile before saying. \u201cIt was really good, really good\u201d</span></div></div>",

You had gone on the bus and jumped in fright at the creepy bus driver. The bus driver let out a cackle before remarking, \"Ha, they weren't kidding. You really do have strong Pheromones. I can only wish you the best this year, hopefully, no strong monsters take interest in you, ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that ominous warning, the bus driver stopped talking and gestured to you to go sit.

What happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: You bump into a light blue haired Succubus. You notice that your pheromones had already done their work and made her obsessed.<br>\r\nB: You make it to school without issue, but it seems your presence in the class caused the lesson to be disrupted by all the girls swooning over you.<br>\r\nC: You bump into a Pink Haired girl with amazing power, though you could tell it had been sealed somehow.

Eventually, everything went black for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, your vision was blurry and you heard a cute voice said, \"Ara! You're awake! I was worried you'd be in a coma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision cleared very quickly. You saw you were lying on a bed in a dorm room, decorated with a few stuffed animals, pictures, a computer, dressers, a tv, and a fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to sit up, but you quickly learned that handcuffs were around your wrists and the bed's headboard. Looking down, you saw that shackles were around your ankles.You also saw you were in your undershirt and some underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made it scarier was that you knew you wore boxers this morning, but now you were wearing briefs. Briefs that had a bat-motif. On the undershirt was written, 'Moka's' and it was written in a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, please-\" You began as you looked at the girl sitting besides the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka. My name is Moka, Akashiya, But you can call me, Moka-chan, if possible, Y/N,\" The Pink-haired vampire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Moka said her full name, you swore you heard a faint echo from an older woman's voice say, 'Akasha Bloodriver'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... How do you know my name... Moka-chan?\" You asked, fearing for your life and freedom. \"And can you free me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I checked your wallet for any medical information, silly,\" Moka answered with a giggle. \"And I can't free you. Not until I know you won't run away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can scream, get a dorm mother to free me,\" You replied as calmly as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dorm mother in a Youkai Academy? You risk getting killed, eaten, or enslaved. One of the dorm mothers is a sexual maneater who likes boys like you and another will eat you for trespassing,\" Moka said as she stood up and began to take off her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka-chan, what are you doing?\" You asked, barely holding back fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was told that boys like to sniff girl's panties, so I'm getting mine ready for you. It might calm you down,\" Moka answered as she gave you a cute-yet-confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moka-chan, you're... scaring me, Please free me and I won't tell anyone,\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're being mean! I'm not scary, I'm cute and beautiful! Just ask any of our classmates, once you're a good boyfriend!\" Moka replied with puffed cheeks. \"I ought to punish you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to scream, but Moka was lightning quick with her response. She put her rolled-up panties in your mouth and somehow found some tape to tape up your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... Now you can't call for help,\" Moka said with a giggle. \"As for classes, I went and talked with the headmaster. I don't know what happened. I kinda blacked out during the meeting, but I'm now in charge of you!\"</span></div></div>",

Not only that, but I can see and hear anything she does. Like her and Inner Moka, I feel in love with you,\" Akasha cooed as she straddled you.

School was such a giant wad of nothing \u2013 no friends, no girlfriend \u2013 a return to form as it were, that the monotony of it all made you almost forget about your meeting with Desiree the afternoon before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, you were destined to be reminded of your encounter upon your return home, where you found a package waiting for you. A sealed cardboard box on your doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pursed your lips together. There was no note or return address attached to it, no information on who it was for. You hardly received any physical mail yourself, and when you did, it was usually something bad. Nevertheless, you assumed quite reasonably that it wasn\u2019t for your parents \u2013 they were such workaholics that if the package was for either of them, they would have had it delivered to their respective workplaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around briefly, wondering to yourself if this might have been a prank someone was playing, before you eventually sighed, picking up the package and taking it inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let yourself into the house with your set of keys, knowing you practically had the house to yourself until nighttime when your parents came home. It wasn\u2019t such a bad life, honestly.  Your family wasn\u2019t in any sort of financial strife, you got good grades, and you had plenty of free time. You were just\u2026 lonely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you had someone to share your life with, but once again, either fortunately or unfortunately, Desiree was about to grant you that wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether you liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the package to your bedroom, slinging your schoolbag onto your bed as you sat down to open the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened up the package and gasped at what was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tall gold bottle adorned with rubies and featured an intricate design. It looked to be worth a small fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d barely even touched the bottle, one of your fingers merely grazing it as green and blue smoke started spilling out from the bottle almost endlessly, it got to the point where you could no longer see your surroundings. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you weren\u2019t sure if you were even in your bedroom anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of giddy, yet sultry laughter filled your ears just as your room had filled with smoke, and soon, Desiree popped out of the bottle, her beautiful form taking possession of your room, the genie ghost floating above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Master\u2026\" Desiree purred her greeting, looking down at you with her gleaming crimson eyes, a perfect smile on her gorgeously full lips and pearly white teeth. \"Forgive me.\" She said earnestly. \"I think we\u2026 what\u2019s the expression? Got off on the wrong foot?\" She asked you. \"I thought I should get you something as an apology. So, I thought I\u2019d give you my lamp to show you I\u2019m dead serious, pardon the pun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared up at her, looking like a deer caught in the headlights. \"Y-y-y-you\u2026!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don\u2019t be frightened, my love. You wished for a girlfriend, so here I am~\" she winked, briefly posing for you, showing off her massive breasts that would put any woman to shame. \"You do remember me, don\u2019t you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"Y-yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree shook her head. \"No, no, not yesterday, my love.\" She sighed. \"Well, yes, yesterday,\" she corrected herself, \"but\u2026 before then\u2026?\" She asked softly. You shook your head quickly. Nevertheless, Desiree was undeterred. \"Well I remember you. When I won the heart of the Sultan, and his wife ordered for my execution, you saved me. You fought for my life and changed my fate so that I was merely banished instead. It was because of you that I learned what love truly was.\" She came close to you now, pressing her chest tightly against yours, gently resting her hands on your shoulders. \"The truth is, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a descendant of his, if you were reincarnated or if you merely resemble him. I know with every fiber of my being and every ounce of my power that I love you!\" Desiree declared, her eyes staring deep into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but blush. In spite of how crazy the situation was, in spite of how terrified you were, you were finding yourself more and more taken by her. Maybe it was her drop dead gorgeous figure, maybe it was how she\u2019d professed her love to you, maybe it was just a reaction to your sadness of not having a girlfriend, or all of those things, or none of them: At the end of the day, your wish had come true. You threw a coin in the well and asked for a girlfriend, and hey presto, you had one! Sure, she was a genie ghost and not a human, but did that really matter? From your admittedly sparse experience with ghosts, you knew that if they wanted to hurt you or prank you or whatever, they wouldn\u2019t have bothered going to this much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you didn\u2019t know any better, it really did seem as though Desiree earnestly loved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-\" you started to say as Desiree suddenly hugged you, swooping down upon you and once again burying your face in her exquisite bosom. You panicked, no longer feeling the floor beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were floating in the air with Desiree holding you, trapped within her embrace, but not uncomfortable. Quite the opposite, in fact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hugging you to her huge, balloon-like tits, and you could do nothing to hide your erection that was becoming all the more prominent. Her tail was this not quite solid, not quite gaseous state. The surrealism of it all added to the allure of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned profusely, Desiree looking at you endearingly all the while. It was as though you were her whole world, because unbeknownst to you, you literally were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree slipped a hand behind your head as she allowed you to breathe, moving her face not even half an inch from yours. You looked at her flawless face as she spoke, her cool, almost icy breath tickling your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, my love?\" Desiree asked you softly. \"Will you be mine?\"</span></div></div>",

Her tongue had slipped into your open mouth, gently licking at yours. You\u2019d never had a real kiss before but Desiree at least seemed to know what she was doing. With how she was holding you, her arms literally wrapped around you, she was quite clearly in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt, tasted her icy breath as she kissed you, blowing just a little bit of her breath into your mouth. You moaned, your erection well and truly obvious by this point, begging to be released as it pressed hard against the inside of your underwear, your pants themselves pressing into Desiree\u2019s silver belt just above her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree moaned into your mouth, honey in her voice, and that was all it took. You felt yourself cumming in your pants, thrusting instinctively as you released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it wasn\u2019t sex, it was your first real sexual experience. One that involved another party anyway. And very few people could say they\u2019d been kissed by a ghost, let alone a drop dead gorgeous one like Desiree! It was really no wonder you came like you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree broke the kiss, moving a hand to gently cup your face. \u201cWas that your first kiss?\u201d She asked. You nodded sheepishly, but Desiree beamed at you. \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed, Master! Clearly, fate wanted your first kiss to be with me!\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou might be as green as my skin when it comes to acts of affection, but there\u2019ll be plenty of time later for the two of us to\u2026 practice\u2026\u201d she winked, straightening herself up as she looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree continued to float in the air, still holding you against her, her right hand once again resting on the back of your head. The colored smoke had started to dissipate from your room, and while you would have liked to clean yourself up, Desiree didn\u2019t seem like she was in any hurry to let go of you. No, she was perfectly content gazing into your eyes as she held you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d you started to speak after a long silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my love?\u201d Desiree perked up immediately at the sound of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I\u2026 would I be able to\u2026\u201d you trailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything you want, my love\u2026\u201d Desiree grinned keenly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry, could I\u2026 could you let me down? I should probably go have a shower now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d Desiree raised an eyebrow before looking down at your crotch and the new stain on your pants. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t need to worry about that, Master. I can take care of that.\u201d Desiree simply waved her hand, the stain disappearing soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped, looking down at yourself. \u201cOh, wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s cute how impressed you are. I can do much more than that, Master. Getting rid of a stain is simply child\u2019s play, wish or no wish. In fact\u2026\u201d Desiree pondered for a moment, shaking her head soon after. \u201cNo, we have plenty of time for that later. But, since I\u2019ve seen your room, it would be rude of me not to show you <i>mine</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree tightened her hold on your body as she turned and dived back toward her lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one moment, you got a face full of Desiree\u2019s cleavage from the sudden momentum. The next, Desiree had set you down, and you were standing in the middle of what looked like a palace fit for royalty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was adorned with golden furniture and beautiful glistening gemstones, an odd mix of old antiques and modern things like a couch facing a television set. Desiree continued to beam at you as you looked around the room in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy home, and your new home away from home!\u201d Desiree gleefully announced. You raised an eyebrow. You still didn\u2019t know what she meant. \u201cMy lamp, sweetheart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour <i>lamp</i>?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm!\u201d She grinned. \u201cShrunk you right down so you could fit inside the lamp with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShrunk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree nodded. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, Master, it\u2019s perfectly safe \u2013 <i>you\u2019re</i> perfectly safe. I\u2019ll restore you to your normal size later on. I just thought it would be nice if you got to see what the inside of my lamp looked like. That and I thought it\u2019d be the perfect place for us to get to know each other a little better.\u201d She smiled, flying over to the couch and gracefully landing on it, patting an empty spot beside her. \u201cCome on, darling. Sit with me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face felt a bit hotter. \u201cO-okay\u2026\u201d you nodded, Desiree\u2019s smile widening as you sat down beside her.</span></div></div>",

I know in movies and stuff that genies grant three wishes, and can\u2019t kill or make people fall in love \u2013 stuff like that. Is that\u2026 is that real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked! I\u2019m actually a very special case, darling. I\u2019m not restricted on the number or <i>kinds</i> of wishes I can grant, only their power. And the more wishes I grant, the stronger I become, and I\u2019m able to grant even more powerful wishes.\u201d Desiree cupped your head in her hands. \u201cSo if there\u2019s anything you want, Master, all you have to do is make a wish, and if it\u2019s within my power, I\u2019ll grant it, I promise.\u201d She assured you. \u201cOh, but be careful. When you wish, make sure to state the exact specifics of your wish. My magic has a\u2026 tendency to run amok if a wish is too \u2018open\u2019. My powers weren\u2019t like that in the beginning, but after several lifetimes of greedy, selfish people wanting to use my power for their own desires, my magic started to take on almost a will of its own. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I can\u2019t help granting other people\u2019s wishes, even if I really don\u2019t want to.\u201d Desiree retreated her hands to her sides, looking down at her tail, a pained expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you spoke up, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. I know people can be real jerks.\u201d You sympathized as best you could, but you couldn\u2019t truly relate. You\u2019d only had to deal with high school bullies, while Desiree had had the misfortune of granting wishes to all manner of people for hundreds of years. Nevertheless, Desiree appreciated your sentiment, especially as you continued. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about that with me. I mean, I\u2019ve got pretty much everything I could want\u2026 especially now if I have you as my\u2026 girlfriend.\u201d You cleared your throat. \u201cBut, um, if granting wishes helps you get stronger, then I\u2019ll do my best to think of some wishes you can grant that will benefit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree swooped in to kiss you on both cheeks, positively ecstatic. \u201cYou really <i>are</i> my one true love. Even after all these centuries, his selfless spirit lives on in you, my darling.\u201d Desiree beamed, making you blush. \u201cSpeaking of which, I\u2019ve been yammering on and on ever since I found you again, and I haven\u2019t really given you a chance to talk. Why don\u2019t you tell me about yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, okay, well\u2026 I\u2019m in high school right now. Casper High. Graduating in a couple of years, then it\u2019s off to college or getting a job or\u2026\u201d you sighed. \u201cActually, I still don\u2019t know what I want to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree giggled. \u201cYour mortal problems are <i>adorable</i>, Master! Why would you need college or a job? Money and a purpose? I can give you <u>both</u> of those things and <i>more</i>. Trust me. You don\u2019t need to worry a hair on your pretty little head.\u201d Desiree ruffled your hair, grinning with a saccharine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I mean, my parents joined the workforce after they both graduated. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be too fond of me not getting a job and lazing about. And if I can\u2019t support myself-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to support yourself, because <i>I\u2019ll</i> support you! After all, <i>you</i> supported <i>me</i> in your past life. It\u2019s only fair that I do the same for you now.\u201d Desiree suddenly cupped her own face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master. I keep interrupting you, don\u2019t I?\u201d She straightened herself up, shimmying back on the couch. \u201cPlease, go on\u2026\u201d she urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know how long you\u2019d spent chatting with Desiree. The sole source of light in the lamp, a crystal chandelier, continued to shine, and you had no knowledge of time passing outside Desiree\u2019s lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was\u2026 <i>nice</i> talking with Desiree. It was sort of like a first date in a way, or what you imagined two people would do on a first date, at least: just sit and talk, find out about each other. You told her all about your hobbies and interests, and she told you about her life and afterlife leading up to how she met you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know why that other ghost has it in for me. I was willing to grant him a wish, and then he attacked me. I suppose it\u2019s a male thing?\u201d Desiree asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 dunno\u2026\u201d You did your best to hold back a yawn, not wanting Desiree to think you were disinterested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree tilted her head to the side. \u201cTired?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d You nodded. \u201cIs there a way to tell the time in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree smiled, waving her hands as she closed her eyes. \u201cBy your modern timekeeping standards, we\u2019re coming up to nine o\u2019clock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened, quickly getting up off the couch. \u201c<i>Nine o\u2019clock</i>?! I was supposed to do my homework, and my parents will be home any minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Homework</i>, you say\u2026\u201d Desiree pondered. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 for school, yes?\u201d She asked. You nodded. \u201cWell then this is the <i>perfect</i> opportunity for me to grant you a wish! Let\u2019s get that homework done, shall we?\u201d Desiree rose off the couch and took your hands in hers. \u201cNow remember, be specific with your wording, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d You nodded, taking a moment to think over your words. \u201cI wish that my science homework was completed to Mr. Lancer\u2019s satisfaction, and usual expectations of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree let go of your hands as hers began to glow. \u201cSo you have wished it, so it shall be, Master!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow intensified, before running from Desiree\u2019s fingers and leaving the lamp. Outside the lamp, your schoolbag glowed the same color as Desiree\u2019s hands had, your homework completed and your wish granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026 is it done?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure is!\u201d Desiree flashed you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, Desiree!\u201d You rushed into her arms and hugged her. \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>No</i>\u2019 she thought. \u2018<i>You were my lifesaver, and I could never repay you for what you did for me. But it\u2019s time I make a start.</i>\u2019 Outwardly, Desiree smiled, hugged you back before letting you go. \u201cThink nothing of it, (Name). Now, as for your parents, you need not worry about them either. I will wait up for them. You just rest now. Let all of your worries and stresses fade away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily stricken with vertigo, you suddenly found yourself in a far too comfortable king size bed, the light from the chandelier slowly starting to dim. \u201cAh, Desiree! What\u2019s\u2026\u201d you trailed off, getting sleepier by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201d she smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my darling. You relax now. You have nothing to worry about anymore. Just rest.\u201d Desiree\u2019s smile widened as your eyelids flickered, your body almost sinking into the bed. \u201cI love you, Master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too\u2026\u201d you mumbled. Desiree watched you intently as you drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018No man may touch me, unless I wish it. And no woman may touch you, unless I wish it\u2019</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany, many hours later, you woke up\u2026</span></div></div>",

In all the \u2018excitement\u2019, you\u2019d completely forgotten it was a school day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, dear Master. We can\u2019t have you squandering the marvels of the modern education system now, can we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d you muttered, clearing your throat. \u201cBut, um, no, you don\u2019t need to take me. I can get there on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree sighed. \u201cVery well, Master. In that case, I\u2019ll clear things away here, and you can get going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up from your seat. \u201cThank you for breakfast.\u201d You told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Desiree still had a heart, it would have skipped a beat. She flew forward, phasing through the table to reach you as she gave you a nice, big, and completely unnecessary goodbye hug and kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a <i>fantastic</i> day at school, Master. I\u2019ll see you when you get home. And then\u2026\u201d Desiree trailed off, snickering, \u201cI almost spoiled the surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Surprise?\u201d You asked, still recovering from the phantasmal kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree kissed you again, this time blowing some of her breath down your throat, freshening you up. You yelped in surprise, but Desiree hushed you, breaking the kiss with an audible pop as she hummed. \u201cYou\u2019ll <i>love</i> it.\u201d She assured you. \u201cNow, run along, Master\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool day or not, you\u2019d already made up your mind. You were going to the Fenton Works Company, to see if The Fentons, the town\u2019s resident \u2018supernatural enthusiasts\u2019, had anything that might be able to help you with your predicament with Desiree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d never skipped school before, and science homework be damned, you\u2019d just have to deal with any reprocussions later. You had no idea how to deal with your new ghost/genie/girlfriend/mother, and you figured The Fentons would have some idea, dealing with ghosts at the very least. It was their profession, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d never been to Fenton Works yourself, but you\u2019d always seen the building from going about your business in town. It was impossible to miss, what with the giant contraption sticking out of the top of the building (that somehow stayed upright).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem you had, one that you just now thought of, was that you went to school with their kids, Danny and Jazz. Not that you were friends, or even acquaintances with either of them \u2013 Danny was in a few of your classes, but you\u2019d never really spoken to each other, and you\u2019d seen Jazz monitoring the halls from time to time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, if they knew you were skipping school, Jazz especially, you wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid getting into trouble, especially with Desiree now playing the part of your mother. You <i>shuddered</i> to think what she\u2019d do if she knew you were here and what you were planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school knew you\u2019d be skipping school after having actually done it after the fact, of course, but you hoped you could make it a quick visit, sort out your issue with Desiree, and head over to school quickly with no fuss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you were almost at Fenton Works. You licked your lips, tasting the remnants of Desiree\u2019s kiss. With a sigh, you crossed the street\u2026</span></div></div>",

The two were able to spend time improving a number of Dr. Light's inventions and supposedly making a brand new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll helped out when she could, but otherwise practiced martial arts or adding another new mode to her arm gadget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting ready to start training, when her arm gadget began to beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I wonder what set you off?\" Roll asked as her arm gadget opened up a screen. She gasped for a moment before closing her arm gadget. She whispered, \"He's here! He's here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to the door and waited for the knock. When it occurred, she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Roll. I'm here to deliver the food Dr. Light ordered,\" You said as you held a medium-sized package that contained whatever food and materials It was quite heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Y/N! You have no idea how many shopping trips Dr. Light misses when he's in one of his inventing moods. We're nearly out of food!\" Roll said as she took the heavy package of food with one hand, making you feel weak, even though you knew she was a robot. She then gave you a kiss on the cheek, one longer than a quick peck.  \"I'm glad your family owns a store willing to deliver to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you and your brother saved the planet so many times, I'd like to pay it back as much as I can,\" You replied with a smile. On a whim, you said, \"Besides, doing this lets me see a cute girl like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll put down the package of food, just to hug you. \"Oh, thank you! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you enjoyed the hug and how oddly soft Roll's body was, you said, \"You're welcome, but I have to go back and help out my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...\" Roll sadly uttered as she let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling guilty, you said,\" But I get off at 5, so we can do something then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Roll uttered with a happy skip as she picked up the package of food.  You smiled back and walked away. Roll recorded the sight and saved it in a folder that she only knew the password to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe met you once, during her first shopping trip and gained a crush when you treated her like a normal human, even after you were told she was a robot. Over time, that feeling grew and grew... to the point where she hacked a few security systems in a few places to keep an eye on you. She actually had a shrine dedicated to you some distance away in a cottage she made when she knew no one was keeping on eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took the package of food and began to put away the food in the cupboards, she said to herself, \"Now to plan our date... I'm sure it was a date. I mean, he called me a cute girl! In fact, I'm sure he's now my boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned quite fake as she said, \"And if I'm not, I'll convince him by any means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen 5:00 came around...</span></div></div>",

The movie started to supply them when Mega Man became the town's hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting your seats, the movie began shortly after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie was as you expected it to be. Plenty of actions and fights, a tiny bit of romance, and the plot being more of a vehicle for fights in various locations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Roll leaned against you. Looking over, you saw she was smiling at you. You smiled back and went back to watching the movie. After all, it looked like a couple is enjoying a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the midpoint of the movie, You felt Roll's hand stroking your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'A cute girl's hand is on my lap and it is on purpose,' </i>Your mind kept repeating, unable to do much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll's superior vision allowed her to see you blushing and smiling. She felt proud about herself, as she had been worried that she would come on too strong and you would be too shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie continued, her hand slowly made its way towards you. When her dainty-feeling hand covered your crotch, You let out a barely audible 'eep!' noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you found your voice, you whispered, \"Roll, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she groped your dick through your pants, the blonde gynoid quietly cooed, \"Having some fun and letting you feel great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer handjob did feel great, so you decided to let it slide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Roll unzipped your pants and slipped her hand in, allowing her to touch your dick directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth opened and closed  few times, unable to decide on what exactly to say or even do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll decided for you by kissing you on the lips.

Isn't she one of Dr. Light's robots?\" Your dad asked as you took off your uniform apron. After you nodded, he added, \"Alright, so be back before nightfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you left your parent's store, you saw Roll was waiting outside on some kind of jetbike. Seeing you gawk over her jetbike, she asked, \"You like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I built it myself and modified it so much, I'm probably the only one who could repair it,\" Roll said as you walked over to her. She patted the seat behind her as she added, \"A helmet is in the container in the back. I made sure it will fit you, since my optics are the best of the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the container, you did find a bike helmet. You put it on and sat behind her. She gently grabbed your arms and made you hug her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what shall we do? A trip around town? A visit to the movie theater?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking a trip to the forest and a picnic at a spot I prepared. I got another container that has food for you and an energy tank for me,\" Roll answered as she fired up her bike, heading up in the air to avoid the various cars and trucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this dangerous?\" You asked, tightening your hold on Roll in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I do this kinda stuff all the time! You're safer with me than in a car!\" Roll replied. Then under her breath, she whispered, \"And the sooner we get you away from all those sluts who want my man, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" You asked, having not heard exactly what Roll had uttered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, 'The sooner we get away from the city, the better' I kinda see why Dr. Light lives away from the city,\" Roll answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you muttered as the jet bike reached the forest outside of the city. \"So where is that spot you mentioned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll reach it in a few minutes!\" Roll answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged a little, as waiting meant being able to hold onto Roll's hot body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she landed outside of a log cabin, one where the roof was decorated with various branches and leaves. You asked, \"Who owns that cabin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I do, since I built it,\" Roll answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver of fear went down your spine, but you decided to ignore it. Roll got off the jetbike and headed to the cabin, saying, \"I'll go get a picnic blanket and a few other things. Can you get the picnic basket and my energy container?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you answered as you got off the jetbike and began to search the containers at the back of the jetbike. You were able to find the things Roll had asked you to find. As you took them out, you muttered, \"Man, this jetbike can hold so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back!\" Roll said in a cheerful tone. She quickly set up the blanket, as well as a few odd devices. When she saw you looking at them, she said, \"They're some sonar devices. If they detect anything dangerous, we'll know to run inside and wait or get on my jetbike and run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal was rather delicious... In fact, she seemed to know exactly how prepare food to your specifications. You looked at her, smiled, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe  sipped her energy tank and blushed. However the way she was sitting seemed to suggest that she was staring at you the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the shiver of fear went down your spine. You ignored it like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished eating, you asked, \"That was a great meal, Roll. You're a great cook!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks! I normally don't do girly things like cook, but doing it for you made it less embarrassing,\" Roll replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now that we have some time alone, I guess we can talk,\" You muttered, feeling a bit sleepy. You passed it off as the fact you worked really hard for the past few days and barely got a chance to rest. \"So is there movies you're into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Martial arts movies and any action movies!\" Roll began. She began to go into detail over some of the latest movies she watched. The more she spoke, the more you began to feel like you were about to pass out. When Roll noticed that you were almost ready to pass out, she gestured to her lap and said, \"Feel free to rest your head there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded before you crawled over to Roll and rested your head on her soft thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you passed out, Roll's smile turned a bit evil as she said, \"Part one, completed. Commencing Part two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, when you woke up...</span></div></div>",

Roll, the picnic, the cabin far out in the woods. Judging by the wooden walls and furniture this was likely her cabin. Sure enough you heard Roll\u2019s voice talking in the next room. You couldn\u2019t make out all of it but you heard her saying something about research on the effects of some chemicals on the local flora. The talking went on for another few minutes. You would have gotten up, but your body felt oddly stiff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the talking stopped and the door to your room opened. In walked an especially cheerful looking Roll. \u201cWell look whose finally up. Morning sleepyhead?\u201d She said in a singsong tone. Wait morning. \u201cShit! What time is it? Oh god if I\u2019m late my dad will kill me!\u201d You start to panic as you slowly fight through the stiffness to get your arms working. Roll giggled as she sat down next to you placing a hand on your chest. \u201cOh you don\u2019t need to worry about that anymore.\u201d She said cryptically. \u201cWhat do you mean? My dad said-\u201c Roll covered your mouth with a shhh. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is your parents aren\u2019t really expecting you to return home. As far as they or anyone is concerned, this is your home.\u201d You have her a look that was partconfused and part afraid. Was this girl nuts or something? \u201cI can see you don\u2019t quite understand. Unsurprisingly since your family was told to keep you in the dark.\u201d You get that familiar chill once more. \u201cKeep me in the dark about what?\u201d Roll grinned. \u201cWell I more or less bought you from them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened and your heart rate spiked as you started taking lout heavy breaths. \u201cYou can\u2019t... they would never...\u201d you could only stutter out a few fragments but it was enough for Roll to get the point. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, the wording on the contract and the transaction papers were a teensy bit misleading. They assumed they were accepting the money and in Return you would be taking part in some top secret scientific research on something of a permanent basis.\u201d You just stared in disbelief as Roll pulled out the form. You couldn\u2019t believe what she was saying, but there it all was. The terms, your parents signatures, proof of money sent and received, and the dates which you noticed were dated almost half a year ago. They actually signed your life away to be this robot girl\u2019s property, albeit unaware of some of the details. \u201cAnd thanks to a tiny line I snuck in right here...\u201d Roll pointed to a throwaway line on the 4th page. \u201cYou are legally mine as far as custody goes.\u201d You just stared mouth agape. Unable to form words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to run. Run as far away from here as possible. But you couldn\u2019t gather the strength to even get up. \u201cOh right the nanites are still active. Sorry about that. They\u2019re just a little safety precaution just in case you get any silly ideas like running from the cabin.\u201d She said this all so casually as she hugs you lovingly. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, you\u2019re going to love your life with me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus Christ this girl really is loco. And you are trapped and completely at her mercy. No access to the outside world. </span></div></div>",

You had to resist her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roll imagined her future life with you, fondly thinking of all the fun she\u2019ll have, you struggled and strained to get your body moving. Much to Roll\u2019s surprise you managed to fight through it enough to slap her hand away. Clearly her new boytoy has a lot of fight in him. She grinned as she thought about the applications of such a trait. Though you did use it in an act of defiance. Though she was willing to mark that as not thinking straight in the shock from the big news, boyfriend or no, Roll was not going to tolerate such behavior from you. She had considered using the nanites to adjust your brain chemistry to make sure you\u2019d immediately fall in love with her, but that simply didn\u2019t feel right to her. And besides that, she knew that all she needed was her feminine charms to get to you... one way or another.

Gently for her, not so much for you comming from a super strong robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Roll uses technology to shrink you.

You struggled and squirmed, but she tightened her legs and briefly wiggled her bottom against your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll grabbed the hand that slapped her and... rubbed it against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... While I do love everything about you, I do want you to accept my love. So I'll let you off with a warning this time,\" Roll said, enjoying your touch. \"I mean, if you wanna get rough in the future, I don't mind... I can get rough right back, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she stopped and glared at you as she said, \"Just as long as you don't EVER. Reject. My. Feelings. For. You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes darted at the multipurpose garnet on her left arm, filled with so many countless gadgets. When you met her and she had told you about them, you thought and told she had potential to be a better hero than her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that gadget arm was terrifying. All those inventions, once cool, now were threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth went into a snarl, getting your attention. In a tone that sounded a bit robotically distorted, she asked, \"D<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">o y</span><b>O</b>u Un<i>D</i>er<u>ST</u>a<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><b>n</b></span>d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...

Now... what shall we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took the hand off her face and pressed it against her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... soft... both your behind and boobs are soft,\" You uttered without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll blushed and giggled, \"Heh heh heh! Thanks! I do like to upgrade myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That was it. me complimenting her and her upgrades wound up making her crazy for me,'</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have a few upgrades to go before we can... do it, though. Getting the parts to make my vagina will be a bit tough, though. But it will be worth it!\" Roll cheerfully said. Squeezing your hand further into her bosom and grinding her behind into your crotch, she said, \"And judging by what I feel, you think it's worth it, too!\"<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n'Damn hormones and reactions,' </i>You thought. \"Y-yeah. Roll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what do with you now?\" Roll asked with a slight leer.</span></div></div>",

Once more, you enjoyed her soft boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you knew you had to escape and let Dr. Light know that Roll turned deranged and hostile. If only there was a word that let others know that a robot went crazy and was now willing to harm humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to bide your time. Roll would be screening all your actions. Perhaps out of suspicion, perhaps out of love, or perhaps to create some creepy love collage of you in a closet? Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll spend a few months out here, enjoying our love. I\u2019ll go out and get food and drinks for you,\u201d Roll answered as she stared lovingly in your eyes.  \"We'll do have to do some scientific work, if only to strengthen the top secret scientific research claim. Won't be hard, as I've spent more time as Dr. Light's assistant more than Mega, even though he does want to be an assistant more than a super hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen can we both go out, if only to show others how much we love each other?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...In a few months. I need to make sure that you love and only me. That other women will always fail if they try to win your heart,\u201d Roll answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks for letting me know,\u201d You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s a small sample of what I upgraded myself, just for you,\u201d Roll cooed as she grabbed your hand and slipped it in her pants. You felt a pussy, a human pussy. \u201dWhile I was disguised as a bartender, I knocked out a variety of attractive human women, so I could study their vaginas and then make a perfect one for me to have for your enjoyment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Oh god, she\u2019s a date rapist,\u2019 </i>You thought. Fear filled you, but you hid it with a smiling mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll still have to make a few final adjustments to it, as I don\u2019t want to get overloaded on pleasure and shut down from it. But if you want, we can try it out,\u201d Roll explained. \u201cAnd before I forget, I even gave myself an anus, if you ever want to have some backdoor fun with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d you replied. \u201cSo\u2026 can I move now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll sat up and stared at you, looking a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep in mind that I <i>have </i>to move around. Otherwise, I\u2019ll get bed sores, muscle atrophy, and I do need to\u2026\u201d You trailed off, thinking of words that a robot like Roll would understand. \u201cExcrete waste matter? Not only that, but you won\u2019t always be here all the time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll pondered your words for nearly a minute before she tapped her wrist gadget a few times. All of a sudden, you could move. As you stared at your wriggling fingers, Roll said, \u201cYou do have a good point, but you\u2019ll have limited range from the cabin. You\u2019ll feel less and less movement as you near the range limit. Leave the range and no more movement until you get brought back inside..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what will be the range?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but that\u2019s classified,\u201d Roll cooed before she kissed you on the lips.</span></div></div>",

Before your brain can even process what her naked body looks like Roll quickly got on top of you. \"Are you ready Y/N?

With that, she lowered herself onto your penis moaning in Intense pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, her vagina really was the best of the best. You let out a Yelp of pleasure as she slid down onto your dick. And with that, she began to quicken her pace. \"O...OMI GOSH THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE YOU SO MUCH Y/N!! I LOVE RIDING YOU LIKE A STALLION I LOVE YOU SOOOOO MUCH!!! WE'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER!!!! WE CAN KISS EACH OTHER  EVERY DAY AND NIGHT!!! WE CAN HAVE SEX EVERY NIGHT!!!

As you came inside of her. The two of you started to breathe heavily trying to regain your composure. \"That was amazing!!!\" Roll shouts \"Its everything I could have ever dreamed of!\" She pulled off of your cock as your sperm began to leak out of her vagina. she catches some of it with her fingers and puts it in her mouth. \"Human sperm has an odd taste to it but I think I can get used to it.\" She cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly snapped out of your aroused daze and realized that you didn't even try to knock her out! Damn it! \"Hey Roll um how about we go for round 2?\" You say in a hasty tone \"You mentioned you gave yourself an anus right?! So why don't we try using that.\" \"Great idea!\" Roll said before trying to get back on top of you. \"Um actually I want to be on top this time !\" You say out of breath. \"Oh, of course, I'd love to try doggy style!\" Roll giggled.

She headed inside to find the groceries on the list however she couldn't seem to find bread no matter how hard she looked fourtently there was a young man nearby stocking shelves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me?\" She asked while politely tapping your shoulder. \"Yes can I help you with something?\" You turn around causing Roll to feel fuzzy as she found you quite attractive. \"Oh! Um well! You see... uh....\" she stumbled on her words \"Why cant I talk normally!?\" She thought to herself. \"I...I..Um cant seem to find bread anywhere.\" She sputtered. \"Oh I'm sorry about that Miss we're currently expanding the store and a lot of our stuff is being moved to different isles I believe we moved the bread to isle 26.\" You say politely. \"Oh um could you perhaps take me there?\" \"Um sure thing.\" You say as you lead her to where the bread is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you dont mind me asking what is your name ma'am?\" You ask \"Oh! its um Roll.\" <br>\r\n\"Hmm that's a bit of an odd name.\" You say.<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is.\" She began to laugh nervously.<br>\r\nYou eventually show her where the bread is and ring her up at the check out as she awkwardly stared at your name tag. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay ma'am?\" You say completely clueless to her feelings.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I'm fine Y/R!\" \"Its actually pronounced Y/N\" you politely correct her. \"I'm sorry I just cant seem to focus today!\" She blurts out.<br>\r\n\"Its okay I understand I can barely keep myself awake today I've been working a lot.\" You say politely while giving off a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says her goodbyes and leaves the store blushing like a ripe tomato.<br>\r\n\"I..I think I'm in love.\" Roll said as she contemplated her emotions.

Back when two sisters appeared, claimed they were angels, and tried to have sex with any available man, you stayed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quickly ignored by the Anarchy Sisters for that.

I am Corset, your new father and Mayor of the city,\" the person at the desk said. \" When I heard my daughters decide to adopt you, I was... mixed. On one hand, My daughters tend to make mistakes and I often find myself unsatisfied with their performance. I would have used you as an object to punish them. If you failed me alongside them, you would shared their punishment. On the other hand, a male heir is often desired in society, especially in Japan. So as someone recently adopted, you will be treated differently until further notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Sir,\" You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As such, when you are outside of school, you will be taught by several tutors in various subjects until I am satisfied with your progress,\" Corset explained. \"While they will be female, I trust that you won't impregnate them.

Forgive me for asking, but is she related to the former queen of Daten high of the same name?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorset giggled for a moment before saying, \"They're one and the same.

They never answered.  Ever since these robo-dickwads set foot in your city, they acted like they owned the place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dragged you toward the main base of operation which used to be the town's biggest mega mall before a major city-wide Maverick outbreak made a mess of the place and many many others! At first you were grateful that the proud dignified Repliforce volunteered to aide in the cleanup for no compensation. But now theyre practically occupying it and administer harsh rules, curfews, and no-go zones to the native humans living in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried your best to tolerate it. You tried getting along with the Repliforce troops that assisted in rebuilding. You tried doing volunteer work to help out the Repliforce troops in rebuilding. You tried biting your lip whenever you heard how harsh they treated certain fellow humans. You tried ignoring the bad stories that they allegedly have Mavericks in their ranks.<br>\r\nNow they just up and arrest you for no reason! Seriously! A group of Replithugs just knock on your door, ask you if youre [Y/N], then when you say yes, they dragged you out of your home with no explanation given and crammed you in a squad car! Someone needs to report these guys to the Maverick Hunters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were no Maverick Hunters where you were going. There werent even any humans. Just reploids. Repliforce reploids. Through the long walk down the near endless halls of the mega mall, you were greeted with stares from reploids all gazing into your soul like you trespassed on sacred territory! You suddenly felt like you were a LOOOOOONG way from home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an awful long period of 'escorting', your 'escorts' brought you to a big bulky cold-looking soldier wearing white armor over what seemed to be a black and yellow metal trenchcoat with an unlit light-saber strapped to his belt. You recognizing this hulking figure! The big guy in charge\u2026 at least in THIS part of the nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cColonel! We got the human like you ordered!\u201d one of your captors states while still restraining you.<br>\r\nThe big bulking colossus of a reploid (not nearly as colossusy as the General!) walked up to you and then leaned in to you close, carefully observing you. Then he dug into your pocket and pulled out your wallet. He looked at your ID then back at you then back at the ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then nodded to his minions with approval. Then they slapped a odd metal electronic collar around your neck! You had no idea what this thing was which only terrified you more. All you knew was that it beeped and flashed a little red light every couple seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this thing?! What the hell is this thing?!\u201d<br>\r\nOne of the soldiers smacked you upside the head, \u201cYou dont talk like that to the Colonel!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCareful!\u201d the Colonel at the very least scolded that troop, \u201cshe'd never forgive me if she saw him badly injured!\u201d She?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d you question, \u201cwhat is going on...\u201d you glance over at the soldier again, \u201c...sir?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Colonel cleared his throat (nevermind he technically didnt have one!) and states, \u201cMr. [Y/N]. Repliforce has carefully reviewed your previous efforts in assisting with our efforts to rebuild your destructed city.\u201d The volunteer work? \u201cAnd after detailed review, Repliforce has deemed you one of the very few humans qualified for conscription amongst our ranks.\u201d Conscription?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Conscription?!\u201d  the word rubbed you the wrong way, \u201ci-is that even legal?! Do you have any jurisdiction to do that?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cConsidering how much presence we have in your city, I suggest you choose your words carefully next time,\u201d the Colonel warned you.<br>\r\n\u201cB..But I'm no soldier!\u201d you pleaded, \u201cI dont have any military training! Heck, I hardly ever fought the other kids back in school!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cActually, your services will not be used for combat,\u201d the Colonel assures you, \u201cyou will be primarily tasked to assist this region's head Navigational Overseer, Iris. I take it youre well acquainted with her, yes?\u201d Iris? Oh yeah, that cute brunette she-bot you lent a hand to a couple of times during your volunteer work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, I met her a few times,\u201d you answer.<br>\r\n\u201cWell she's been telling me a lot about you,\u201d he tells you, \u201can awful lot actually. In fact, she's created a separate database dedicated to you at the base.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNevermind that!\u201d he immediately changes the subject, \u201ceffective immediately, your duties and tasks will be to serve and assist her to the best of your abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait a minute! This is way too sudden!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of sudden, suddenLY a group of reploids come out of nowhere and start putting ribbons around you! Actually ribbons! They wrapped you in ribbons! Awfully tight ribbons! You were being binded in ribbons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFear not, Mr. [Y/N]. For youre in no safer hands than with my sister!\u201d The Colonel says while more ribbons are wrapped around you. \u201cIs the collar working?\u201d he asks one of the reploids.<br>\r\nA reploid in a labcoat presses a button and the red light on your collar stops blinking and flashes brightly!<br>\r\n\u201cFully armed and functional, sir!\u201d answered the labcoat!<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?! What is this gonna do?!\u201d you question.<br>\r\n\u201cYou neednt worry about it,\u201d answered the Colonel, \u201cjust concentrate on taking good care of my sister\u2026 or you'll NEED to worry about it! Which reminds me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pinned a big tag on that collar which red in big fancy letters: 'TO MY BELOVED SISTER! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, IRIS! Love, your Brother\u2026 courtesy of Repliforce'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHE FU-OOMPH!\u201d youre immediately gagged with a Repliforce-branded bandana. Not soon after, a couple of soldiers haul over a huge gift box. Big enough for someone your size to fit in.<br>\r\nYou know that, cuz they crammed you in it! You screamed and hollered mumbled garbage as they closed the box tight and wrapped a few more ribbons around it for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing a bit of unintelligible chatter from outside your box prison, the box began to move. They were literally carrying you off somewhere. Danged if you knew where, but if you had to wager a guess, most likely to be presented to the Birthday girl!<br>\r\nThis is ridiculous! They didnt just draft you against your will, theyre treating you like somebody's birthday present! Who gave them the right to treat you this way?! Youre a human being, damnit! Someone needs to report this to the Maverick Hunters! ...Of course, that's provided they'll even let you go long enough to reach the Maverick Hunters at this rate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to get out of here. Fortunately, they didnt confiscate the switch-blade in your pocket. You could probably reach it and cut through the ribbons and the cardboard. It'd be risky, but it's the best shot you have at the moment.<br>\r\nOf course, that's provided that collar youre wearing doesnt put a stop to that in some way. Youre not sure what it does. For all you know it could track your location\u2026 or it could self-destruct if you go outside it's specific boundaries!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it's better to just wait it out and talk to Iris when you see her. Surely, she'll be understanding and see what kind of a lunatic her brother's been acting like doing this to you!<br>\r\n...By the way, didnt he just say she's got an entire database of you?</span></div></div>",

You thought it sounded familiar and asked her what it was, but she kept avoiding the question. For all you knew, it was probably a wedding song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What's this?\" Iris asked as you heard her walk towards you. \"Oh... Brother. I wonder what you got me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she untied the box and tore down one of the walls, Iris gasped and covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you (Y/N)! I didn't think my brother would ever do something...\" Iris began. A moment passed, giving you hope that she too would see this as wrong. \"Wonderful as this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hope sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then hugged your head into her bosom as she happily said, \"This is a wonderful birthday... boyfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Soft...

She said, \"Since you're my boyfriend now and I'm going back to work..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris thankfully undid all the ribbons, leaving you to get rid of the bandanna gagging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... Now come help me look over some reports. Most are the standard transfer reports,\" Iris said as she grabbed your hand and led you to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there she sat down behind her desk, while you sat at a nearby terminal. She said, \"Just separate them into two piles. Ones you think I should approve and ones you think I should reject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for a bit, you looked over reports. For a time, you did as she asked, fearing Colonel's wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you got bored and secretly activated communications, hoping to call for help.</span></div></div>",

How did she manage to sneak up on you like that?! She's a reploid in ultra heavy armor but you didnt so much as her the clanking of her metal boots!<br>\r\nWell, nevermind that! Youre busted! Your first day on the job and your commanding officer just caught you violating security protocols!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to hide the fear in your eyes as you turned to face Iris who despite inadvertently intimidating a lot more than she intended, was looking at you with just a simple questionable expression.<br>\r\n\"Oh... um... I was...\" you quickly come up with a good lie,\"I was trying to call my dad. I just wanted to let him what happened to me, didnt wanna worry him, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... but I thought your father died during the Four Kings' War in the Levant over a decade and a half ago,\" HOW THE HELL DID SHE KNOW THAoh right she's got an entire database dedicated to yoWHY DOES SHE HAVE AN ENTIRE DATABASE DEDICATED TO YOU? \"I believe he jumped in front of a live grenade to save his platoon if I remember reading the local news article correctly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being shaken up AND having bad memories reemerge, you were quick to recover.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I meant my old neighbor, Mr. Hochrin. ...He was kinda looking after me after my father's passing, so I guess I got used to calling him dad.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Walter Hochrin? The man who owned the music shop 'Sha-Wing' before it was closed down to be used as a Repliforce recruiting office.\" Again, the database. And it still irked you, remembering how that metal milita forcefully shut down Mr. Hochrin's business... but by then, he was considering retiring anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry [Y/N], but the Repliforce communications link is tightly restricted,\" she scolds you, \"youre not allowed to use it to make personal calls. Not even I can use it to contact my brother unless it's strictly for security purposes!\" Well, you managed to talk your way out of a very bad situation. Too bad you wont be able to call the Hunters any time soon. For the time being, youre stuck. And alone. In a world of robots. With this robot who might know more about you than you do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am,\" you sighed apologetically, though with a little authentic depression in your voice, \"I wont do that again.\"<br>\r\nIris was not done with you. She could detect something was up with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted her head which nested an expression of curiosity.<br>\r\n\"Is... something the matter, [Y/N]?\" she asked you.<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"No, it's nothing. I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n\"No youre not,\" her suspicions grew as she leaned over to you, \"I can detect very stressed emotional readings emitting from you. What is wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted an answer and was not willing to budge until she got it. It's not like you could just flat out tell her that you dont feel cool being drafted against your will by robots and being made to serve one that knows TMI about YOU! But something told you that you couldnt flat out give her a bullshit answer, because she might see right through it.<br>\r\nPerhaps it would be best to give her a partial truth. Something you'd think someone like her would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you swallowed, \"to tell the truth, ma'am...\" You got up out of your seat and looked her in the eye, \"I've been feeling very lonely lately.\"<br>\r\n\"Lonely?\" Iris's interests sparked.<br>\r\n\"I mean, ever since more and more of your... of Repliforce's military cruised into my town, quite a bit of neighbors have moved away (or disappeared) and I've been seeing less and less... fellow humans around lately.\"<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n\"In fact, it's been a few weeks since I've seen another human being around where I live. Seriously, all my neighbors are now robots. And now I've been drafted into an army full of robots. I feel like I'm half the planet away from home.\"<br>\r\nYour robot commanding officer just stared silently throughout your entire rant. You couldnt tell if she was offended by your statement, cuz her facial expression was unreadable. Still, thinking twice about you said, you felt a little bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am,\" you bowed your head in apology, \"I dont mean any offense by it. It's... just an experience I'm not very used to.\u201d Surprisingly, you felt quite a bit better getting that off your chest. As if a huge nasty weight just got lifted off your back. Could THAT be the real problem you were having?! Were you really just upset with being lonely instead of being kidnapped?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, the butterflies in your belly flew right out of it and you didnt feel quite as nervous of Iris's blank yet attentive stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I understand,\u201d she finally responded, \u201cit must be difficult being away from your own kind for a while.\u201d More like your own kind being away from you, but nonetheless. \u201cIt's true that us reploids are quite a bit different from you. In quite a lot of ways, it'd take several hours to list the many differences. However, despite us being more machine than organic, we do share a few similarities. We both communicate to each other eloquently, speak the same language, we can engage in the same past times and activities as you. We have emotional impulses that make us happy, sad, angry, frightened, and hundreds of other emotional responses like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris stepped a bit closer and continued, \u201cAnd of course, just like you humans, us reploids have families. Although I cannot recollect any history regarding my 'biological' parents, I at least have my brother\u2026 who is incredibly important to me. Just like how Mr. Hochrin is important to you\u2026 despite not being your biological father.\u201d Aw shoot. She's got a point. Reploids actually having families, let along family bonds, was a major trait that they have in common with humans. Now bearing children on the other hand\u2026 well, you heard from hearsay that some have particular 'upgrades', but it's still just hearsay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before your mind could drift on that anomaly, Iris grabbed your hand and held it gently. Hm. It felt very soft and warm\u2026 like actual human skin instead of cold hard metal! Just the touch of her hand alone reminded you of her hug earlier. Honestly, you were surprised her breasts her soft and cushiony just like a human's! You were expecting those things to be hard as steel and nearly poking your eyes out! Heh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry, you'll fit in with us,\u201d she assures you with a wink, \u201cit's not like any of the others can tell youre a filthy fleshbag, anyways.\u201d Her words combined with her touch really soothed your woes. It really took your mind off the database and whatever this damn thing her brother put around your neck is! Maybe. Just maybe. It wont be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a new boost of confidence, you return Iris's smile and give your commanding officer the proper salute.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, ma'am! I'll do my best to serve you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll do your best to ASSIST me,\u201d she corrects you, \u201cplease dont think of me as your boss.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nodded, \u201cYes ma...I mean Iris.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, Iris put her hands behind her back and peeked at your work.<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, having you finished doing the task that I assigned you?\u201d Oh right, the whole report piling... er...

It wasnt even difficult because about 99% of the reports in the stack were something you personally approved of. All but 2 papers were on the approval list!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris stared blankly at the insanely large stack of reports you deemed worthy of her approval.<br>\r\n\"Um... THIS whole pile is what you believe I should approve?\" she seemed a bit suspicious at first which was understandable.<br>\r\nBut you nodded fully assured of yourself, \"Absolutely ma-\" Iris pointed at you with her eyebrows raised, \"I mean Iris! These are all reform proposals and requests for federal funding that I personally think my city is in desperate need of. I honestly think they'll help it heal and recover back to it's former glory before the whole Maverick outbreak. We need all the help we can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw determination in your eyes and her CPU believed it was enough to warrant considering your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reploid superior nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well [Y/N],\" she walked back over to her desk, \"let's have a look at them, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the fucking evaluation began. It was an evaluation that hinted that this was gonna be a LOOOOOOOOOOONG conscription service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris looked over the first proposal.<br>\r\n\"Request for four million dollars of federal funding to build a memorial monument?\"<br>\r\n\"To honor those who died in the Four Kings' War,\" you added, remembering your father's service (and Iris's whole database, \"they never got properly honored for their service. Some of them didnt even get a proper burial. I'm sure their friends and families would really appreciate the sentiment.\"<br>\r\n\"They truly do deserve such admiration,\" Iris admits, \"from what I researched, it was described as 'Hell Split Wide Open' for a reason.\" She tapped the paper against her desk, \"However, Repliforce has already arranged plans to include a special exhibit dedicated to the war in the Repliforce-Approved National History Museum over in City Square. So this monument is not needed.\"<br>\r\n\"Still... I think the townsfolk here would appreciate it....\"<br>\r\n\"They will appreciate the many sights, stories, names, scenes, and Repliforce memorial souvenirs our History Museum will provide them when they attend,\" Wow. WOW. To say that with such a straight face. You have no words! \"I'm sorry, [Y/N], but this funding request will have to be denied. I'm putting this into my denial pile.\" And so she put it in her denial pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Bzzzzzz*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd by her 'denial pile', she means her bin with the shredder. Ouch.<br>\r\n\"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...sure...\" you hand her the next one, \"a request to fund more public transportation.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh! Repliforce is the process of building a high-speed bullet train system for your city. It should be completed by the end of the year.\"<br>\r\n\"I dont think a lot of us can wait that long. After the whole car-hacking debacle during the Outbreak, very few people even have a car anymore. We need more buses to get around.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's out of the question. Far too many state-approved buses have failed Repliforce's hack-proof tests and the ones that do are outside of our budget. But not to worry. I read that walking more is good for a human's health and carpooling is good for the environment, not to mention very socially friendly. So this will have to go into my denial pile as well.\"<br>\r\n*Bzzzzz* Into the denial pile it goes.<br>\r\n\"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... a request for funding to build more public schools.\"<br>\r\n\"Repliforce has already provided those.\" Right. THEIR approved schools.<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you needed to rephrase that, \"more like schools... uh... run and taught by US... OUR teachers and staff.\"<br>\r\n\"Unnecessary,\" she immediately rejects the idea, \"Repliforce approved teachers are highly skilled and highly educated that have graduated with highest honors at other Repliforce-approved schools! Yours truly, included,\" she pats her chest with pride, \"So for the good of your kind's future generations, this request will be going in my denial pile.\" *Bzzzzz* \"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errm... a proposal to reopen and restore the mega mall... that Repliforce is currently using as a base of operations,\" you hand her the paper and she doesnt take long to read it.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but our glorious leader has already arranged plans for that place,\" she states, \"but not to worry. Repliforce is currently building a colossal mega mall completely filled with Repliforce-approved stores, merchandise vendors, kiosks, and food courts to serve your every need! It's sure to be our finest civilian commercial complex yet!\"<br>\r\n\"Great...\" you smile nervously as you watch that paper go through the denial bin and come out a million denied shreds.<br>\r\n\"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went on from there.<br>\r\n\"A proposal to rebuild the Diamond Gate Bridge.\"<br>\r\n\"Repliforce has already built a bridge. It doesnt need another.\"<br>\r\n\"But it has a very strict security checkpoint every 500 feet. It takes nearly four hours to finally finish crossing it!\"<br>\r\n\"Repliforce Rule #759: Safety Always Comes Before Convenience. *Bzzzz* Next, please.\"<br>\r\n\"A request for funding to repave downtown's cracked and destructed streets.\"<br>\r\n\"There is currently a shortage of available construction equipment and asphalt material due to it being used for other specific purposes. As soon as those purposes are fulfilled, we will look into street paving.\" *Bzzzz* \"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n\"A proposal to negotiate an agreement and timeline to withdraw Repliforce forces-\"<br>\r\n*BZZZZZZZZZ*<br>\r\n\"Next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes and a total of ZERO requests and proposals have met Iris's approval and been spared from the shredder. Each and every one rejected and shredded. More public housing? Repliforce already has those. *Bzzz*. More forest reserves? The reploidal replicas suffice. *Bzzz*. Lifting the 'temporary' restrictions on meat exports? Repliforce's Department of Agriculture knows what's best. *Bzzz*<br>\r\n\u201cUh...Iris? There was another proposal behind that one you just shredded.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Well I'm sure it wasnt important.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was involving Repliforce prison reform.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said. Wasnt important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more papers were shredded, the lower your morale sunk. Despite Iris being awful cute and awful warming, she seemed outrageously faithful to her employers. Maybe you cant comprehend such behavior because you cant think like a machine create solely to serve said company that built it. Still, it made you so incredibly uneasy. Your woes were starting to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like the longest 20 minutes of your life, Iris had finally finished her evaluation. You can probably guess how many requests and proposals were accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! We've got all that done in half the time it normally takes doing it by myself!\u201d your reploid superior beams with a bit of glee, \u201cbrother was right. Tasks get done far quicker with an assistant.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cG...reat...\u201d you say, still reeling from the blow to the belly of your morale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris then looked over to the clock.<br>\r\n\u201cWe've finished so much earlier than expected, I still have a few hours of free time left before my scheduled meeting with a representative of the Maverick Hunters.\u201d The 'MH' works quickly get your attention. However, any and all ideas involving them would have to be put on the back burner for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince we have a lot of time to spare, how about I show you around?\u201d she offered, \u201cwe've provided a plethora of entertainment ideal for tourism!\u201d She sounded like she was advertising Repliforce to you! \u201cThe Repliforce Megaplex just opened up and it's currently playing a few really amazing state-approved foreign movies. I can reserve us a private screening with the really comfy seats!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUm...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOr if you'd like...\u201d Iris added, \u201c...we can go on a brief nature walk to clear our heads\u2026 at one of our artificial forest reserves. Sure, the trees and wildlife are animatronic, but theyre very convincing replicas, you'll hardly even notice the difference... other than the animals being 100% safe for human contact, of course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you felt the soft warm grasp of her surprisingly realistic hand grasp yours. Tight, but slightly soothing. Shaking off the brief moment of ease, you answer...</span></div></div>",

You recall her seeing her pop up several times during your volunteering jobs. She was there assisting the emergency medical staff, treating the wounded and the ill, as well as comforting the uh... soon-to-be widows, widowers, and orphans. It wasnt a task you had the emotional willpower to fulfill, so for someone like her to be routinely accomplish such a task with such a cheerful tone deserves admiration!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Cinnamon,\" you greeted her while attempting to hide the uneasiness from your facade. It was the least you could do for someone as strong-willed as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. [Y/N],\" she smiled and bowed, \"I'm sorry if I disturbed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didnt disturb me at all,\" you were already disturbed long before she walked in, \"what do you need?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm here to administer your routine health checkup,\" Cinnamon answers, \"Repliforce requires all staff to receive their health examination to ensure Maverick virus prevention.\" She had you up until that last part.<br>\r\n\"...Maverick virus prevention?\" you squinted your eyes, \"even me?\"<br>\r\n\"Especially you,\" she assures you, \"though there's no existing report of any humans infected as of yet, the Maverick virus strains have been mutating over time and Professor Isoc theorizes that it's only a matter of time before it affects human immune systems as well.\" Add that to the ever-growing list of oddities that wont help you sleep at night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, ok, sure thing,\" youre awfully quick to comply, \"the last thing I want is to become a Maverick.

Sorry, it's just an expression that sounded better in my head.\" Luckily for you, Cinnamon paid your rude, out of line choice of wording no mind whatsoever. Instead, she happily focused all her energy on your checkup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe checkup itself wasnt that uncomfortable, either. Her chest doubled as a tool organizer which she'd pop open to pull out a random tool for testing, then take notes. She pulled out a tongue depressor, put it in your mouth then took a note. She pulled out a thermometer, put it in your mouth, took a note. She pulled out a stethoscope, slipped it under your shirt and felt your heartbeat (her hands were awful cold by the way), then took a note. She checked your ear temperature, took a note, tested your reflexes, took a note,  tested your blood pressure, took a note, nothing really out of the ordinary outside of the fact that it was a smiling fembot that's administering all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it all, the checkup wasnt so bad. <br>\r\n...That is until THAT part of the checkup came. You know the one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Mr. [Y/N]. Would you please turn your head to the side?\u201d Cinnamon wasted no time whatsoever to reach for your pants!<br>\r\nYou quickly backed away in surprise\u2026 and out of fear where those ice cold titanium steel hands are gonna be!<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 i\u2026 is t-this really\u2026 appropriate?\u201d you cringe nervously, \u201cI-I-I mean\u2026 well, that part of a human's body is incredibly\u2026 sensitive\u2026 and well\u2026 reploids naturally have super strong grips!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease dont be nervous. Having the necessary gentle grip to administer proper hernia examinations are requirements for nurse units,\u201d Cinnamon assures you, \u201cjust relax and this will all be over really quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and swallowed hard, \u201cO-o-ok.\u201d Hoping for the absolute best, you unzip and pull down your pants and allow the reploid nurse slip her awful cold hand in your boxes and you try your best to think happy thoughts as you felt the icy cold grip surround your extra-sensitive man-pouch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow please cough.\u201d<br>\r\n*Cough* You coughed.<br>\r\n\u201cA little harder this time.\u201d<br>\r\n*Cough!* you cough harder.<br>\r\n\u201cOne more time. Cough really hard for me.\u201d<br>\r\n*COUGH!*<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief when her super-strong titanium steel hand leaves your boxers! You pray she doesnt plan on administering a prostate exam next!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinnamon scribbles another note. \u201cAlright, now to check on that collar of yours.\u201d The collar?! That thing the Colonel had put around your neck?! The one that he wouldnt tell you what it did\u2026 but hinted that it wouldnt be good for you if you didnt take good care of his sister?! THAT collar?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse pulled a remote out from her chest container and pushed a few buttons. Your collar immediately lit up and made several beeps and buzzing noises. Your curiosity sparked, but you dare not try anything funny as she removed a plate covering and inspected the wiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d she hummed as she observed, \u201cno signs of any faulty circuity or short fusing. That's good. No trace of any warranty tampering, that's for sure. Oh wow, I havent seen a battery with THAT many milliamps in one of these before! I bet I could charge my laptop with this thing if I tweak it a little!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 the collar's in good shape?\u201d you randomly blurt out.<br>\r\n\u201cSo far,\u201d she comments, \u201cI still dont understand why such a thing is placed on Repliforce faculty.\u201d Spark goes your curiosity.<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUsually these particular collars are reserved for higher leveled prison or asylum inmates released to the public on parole.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat exactly are they supposed to do?\u201d you finally ask the million dollar question.<br>\r\n\u201cSpecifically, these collars keep the parolees within their designated state-approved territory. Theyre not only trackable via satellite surveillance, but theyre also programmed to recognize specific areas and boundaries that the wearer can and cannot cross.\u201d Interesting. Ooph, but interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what happens if they go over the boundaries?\u201d you gots to know, \u201cthey get shocked or something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It'll give off an alarm that'll alert any and all nearby Repliforce personnel that youre breaking parole.\u201d Oh. \u201cHowever it IS programmed to discharge high voltage if it detects unapproved tampering.\u201d OUCH! \u201cSo unless you feel the urge to be fried crispy, I wouldnt recommend trying to take it off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. Why in the world would these tin cans feel the need to put one of THESE on you?! What's next? Are they gonna break your ankles so you dont try to run away like in that one movie starring that heavyset woman Nicholas Cage punched in the face in that other movie?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... would it be safe to take a bath in this thing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Cinnamon answers, \"the casing is 100% completely waterproof. Even if youre caught in a monsoon, this collar will not short-circuit.\u201d Youre really starting to regret going down this line of conversation. But at least you finally got answers to some nagging questions from the beginning. However, more question brew: What are the restricted boundaries the Colonel and his cronies set for you? Where can you go or not go? Why did they feel the need to put a parole collar on you to begin with? How do you get the stupid parole collar off without being electrocuted to death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd those were only a FEW of the many, MANY questions brewing in your mind ever since the consciption began. Sadly, those will have to wait for another time. Until then, you can at least get one particular question answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, does that include the checkup?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost,\" Cinnamon answers, \"I just have a brief line of questioning I need you to answer that I need to assess and evaluate before I can conclude the examination.\" Oh goodie. A pop quiz. \"I'm gonna ask you a variety of questions and I need you to answer them as truthfully as possible, ok? Dont be afraid to be as brutally honest as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you comply with the questionnaire. It sounded easy, but you were sure it wasnt.<br>\r\nAnd you were right because of what this series of questions related to!<br>\r\nSpeaking of questions, here's one: What were the questions she asked you related to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As if having your vulnerable exposed genitalia at the mercy of a reploid's cold strong grip didnt make you uneasy enough. Cinnamon's line of questions felt very unorthodox and way too personal, that if you believe your kind's military used it in their recruit interviewing, they'd be sued back to the dark ages!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your options were limited. You had no choice but to answer them. Truthfully, cuz for all you know, Cinnamon had a lie-detector built into her CPU and is transmitted directly to the higher ups. Especially one particular higher up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First question,\" she reads off the questionnaire, \"describe your marital status. Married, Single and Divorced, or Single and Never Married?\"<br>\r\n\"Single and Never Married,\" you answered. She took a note.<br>\r\n\"If your answer is 'Single and Never Married', are you currently in a relationship with anyone? Yes or No?\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" you answered. She took another note.<br>\r\n\"If your answer is 'No', is there someone you are currently interested in having a relationship with anyone? If Yes, please give his/her name.\" That's WAY too personal.<br>\r\nBut you answer \"No.\" But that wasnt specific enough.<br>\r\n\" 'No' as in you dont currently have someone youre interested in or 'No' as in you DO have someone youre interested in, but refuse to give his/her name?\"<br>\r\n\"No as in there isnt currently someone.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Cinnamon scribbles a few more notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got worse from there.<br>\r\n\"Ok, these next questions are very important,\" Cinnamon explains, \"please listen very carefully and do not hesitate to ask me to repeat them or reword them if you dont understand a question clearly.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you answer nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First questions,\" she reads, \"which of the following describes you? Straight, Homosexual, Bisexual, or Other?\" Other? \"If the answer is 'Other' please describe.\"<br>\r\n\"Straight,\" thankfully it was an easy question. OFFENSIVE, but easy.<br>\r\n\"Ok then,\" Cinnamon's tone lights up a little as she jots down a note, \"next question: what part of a female's body would you consider gives you the most sexual stimulus? A female's chest or a female's hips?\" GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY!<br>\r\n\"Is that seriously part of the questionnaire?\" you question.<br>\r\n\"Yes it is,\" she answers with no hesitance, \"Chest or Hips?\"<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath as your face went red, \"...Hips.\" A man of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she takes a slightly long note, \"next question: which of the following would you consider to be an ideal girlfriend? Human, Reploid, or Other? If the answer is 'Other' please describe.\" The bloody hell kind of question is that?!<br>\r\n\"Other,\" you answer, \"I dont think it really matters if she's a human or reploid.\"<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" she comments as she jots down notes, \"next question: would you consider having a relationship with a co-worker? Yes or No?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... that would depend on how well we-\"<br>\r\n\"That's not one of the choices,\" she interrupts, \"the choices are yes or no.\"<br>\r\nYou sigh hard, \"Yes.... I guess?\"<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" she remarks before jotting down a note, \"please pay close attention to this next question: In the unlikely event that you and your co-worker were trapped in a tight dangerous confined space with no hope of escape or being rescued, would you consider making love to your co-worker before you and her inevitably die? Yes or No?\" This is getting ridiculous. But whatever! Fine!<br>\r\nYou shrug your arms, \"I guess... if SHE'S up for it too... yes, probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she wasnt done.<br>\r\n\"How often would you say you relief personal stress via self-stimulation on an average week?\"<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes, \"I'm sorry, I dont understand the question.\"<br>\r\n\"Allow me to rephrase it,\" Cinnamon quickly rephrased it, \"how often do you masturbate per week?\"<br>\r\nKeeping a straight face, you politely ask, \"Can I please skip that question?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, all these questions are mandatory according to strict Repliforce guidelines,\" Cinnamon explains, \"if you need more time to properly answer, feel free to take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didnt need more time. You had an answer.<br>\r\nYou lower your head and answer, \"3 to 4 times a week, I guess...\" Tsk. Liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" Cinnamon's 'hm' sounded a little more interested than it shouldve been! \"Next question: If you were offered, would you be interested in routine assistance with self-stimulation from a third party?\"<br>\r\n\"NO THANK YOU,\" seriously, who wrote this crap?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, we're down to the final question,\" she states. FINALLY.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you groan with irritation.<br>\r\n\"Is the ability to produce future offspring important to you? Yes or No?\" WOW. That's a pretty head scratching question right there. Not to mention, it's something you gotta take into account while youre your commanding officer's boyfriend...<br>\r\nYou take a few breathes, having a difficult time coming up with an answer, \"Well... at the moment... hm. That's a tough question to answer.\"<br>\r\n\"Feel free to take your time,\" she insists.<br>\r\nYou glance around, bite your lip, inhale and exhale, and at the very end, youre sure there was only one answer, \"...To be frank, I probably would like to have children eventually. I gotta say the answer's yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinnamon doesnt respond. She just takes notes. She takes a lot of notes actually. She writes for almost a whole minute and you just sit there and wait patiently for her to finish. Penny for her thoughts, but you got a feeling you dont wanna know what she's thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. That concludes the examination,\" Cinnamon FINALLY ends this bizarre episode, \"thank you so much, Mr. [Y/N] for your patience and compliance.\"<br>\r\n\"N...no problem,\" it was hard to say that with a straight face. The blonde reploid nurse extends her hand and you willingly shake it, taking note of the cold, rather stiff mechanical grip. Quite unlike Iris's warm gentle humanlike grip. You'll assume that her chest isnt similar to Iris's, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should return to my post. Here is my card,\" she hands you a business card. An 'Isoc Pharmaceuticals (a Repliforce partner)'s business card with her name, company address, and phone number on it, \"if you had any questions or concerns, or if you simply feel the need to talk, feel free to call me. Use the phone number on the back if it's after hours.\" Her PERSONAL phone number was written on the back of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again for your cooperation,\" Cinnamon bowed, \"I hope to see you again soon!\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you bowed back, \"bye Cinnamon.\" With that, the perky professional (but slightly disturing) nurse left the office. You sighed hard after finally getting some well earned peace and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnusual, but at least you had SOME answers. It didnt make your forced conscription any easier to manage, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh... all this drama is making you tired. You were nearly worn out. Maybe a little nap will ease your stress. Feeling that was the case, you lean back in your chair and close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...For about as long as a SECOND cuz something interrupted that nap before it could even start! What was the interruption?</span></div></div>",

Your jaw dropped as you read the top two posted topics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>'General of the Repliforce has been assassinated by Slash Beast!'</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>'Space Station Eurasia has been hijacked by Mavericks and is on a crash course for Earth!'</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had been standing, you'd have fallen on your ass. But since you were already on a chair, you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading some of the scientific topics, you read that if Eurasia hits Earth, then Humanity would be nearly exterminated. You hoped that the Repiforce and the Maverick Hunters would be able to stop the Eurasia crash.   True, while the base that you were in would be perfectly safe, you did have friends and family who aren't as lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, they didn't have a cute-yet-creepy reploid after then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realized something. Something that sent chills down your spine. Colonel is now in charge of the Repliforce. Iris, while a civilian-type reploid, has Colonel wrapped around her little finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Iris has even more power than before,\" You muttered as you stood up and went to the door. When the open button didn't work, you tried to open the door yourself. When that failed, you went back to the desk, muttering, \"Great, I'm stuck here. Might as well try to contact someone and see if someone will help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you tried to make a topic, a window opened up that read, 'Certain features of this terminal has been locked until the state of emergency has either passed or lessened. Please contact your superiors if you require assistance.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the desk and glared at the screen. Sure, you could still read and check out news, but contacting anyone was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you calmed down, you began to stroll around, pressing and pulling various things as if you might find some secret exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you managed to find out that there was a pullout couch in the wall and used that as a bed. Why that was there, you had no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor did you know about the hidden cameras watching you, sending info to Iris, who didn't care about how many human deaths she had to cause to ensure that you would be with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you discovered that...</span></div></div>",

This 'civilian-type' Reploid just became a full-fledged Repliforce army commander. A position that's only reserved for COMBAT reploids for obvious reasons! And it wasnt a rank you just inherit. It's a rank that needs to be EARNED. This information changed a lot of things you thought you knew about Iris. Sure, she was a PROUD devoted overseer of the biggest and possibly most dangerous Reploid militia on this dying earth, but you never knew she was actually a combat type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a lot about her I dont know about,\" you couldnt help but tell yourself out loud. And right now youre superior was leading the fray against what may very well be a coup. At the same time, a new uprising was brewing. Now that news spread quickly that Eurasia is on a crash course for earth, certain second-class citizens have become a bit overzealous and are placing the blame on their reploid 'protectors'. Combined with conspiracies of the Maverick Hunters and Repliforce higher ups having shady dealings as well as the sudden death of a feared leader, and a dangerous radical anti-Reploid terrorist organization known as the Community rises from the debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne article of an MH-funded bank bombed by the Community later and you sink back into the couch with your jaw dropped. The atmosphere got so tense.<br>\r\n\"I shouldnt have woken up,\" you whispered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold hard brittle week passes by as you acclimate yourself to your new job. It was lonely, because Iris wasnt there what with her being far too busy with her new job. It wasnt all that difficult, though. Mostly handed paperwork, reviewed city proposals and mail over good ones to be approved (and possibly put through the denial pile!), as well as continue your volunteer work overseeing construction, attending social gatherings, assisting Cinnamon (and turning down her offer of physicals!) and even passing out aid.... just with armed Repliforce bodyguards that monitor your every move.<br>\r\n\"Hey, ya think the Community's gonna get big?\" a human refugee whispered to you as you handed him his box of daily rations.<br>\r\n\"I dont know,\" was the only answer you could give him without pissing off your armed guards.<br>\r\n\"No talking!\" one of the guards yelled at the refugee, \"grab your aid and move on! NEXT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really missed Iris even after finally getting settled in your cozy apartment complex, despite being suspicious of the mysterious box marked '[Y/N]'s Pornography'. There, you had nobody to talk to. Your body guards who stood outside your door werent exactly sparking conversationalists. You couldnt call anybody even if you didnt know your calls were being monitored, because everybody you knew either changed their number or couldnt answer the phone for particular reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lonely. Very lonely. The only time during the week you got to see Iris was during a press conference on tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Although my brother did suffer a severe injury from the attack, his strong will and determination combined with backup from the intense discharges of excessive telekinetic energy from his devoted sister ultimately won the day, subduing the traitorous Duff McWhalen and reclaiming the Atlantis Oceanographic Museum! It should be repaired and running once again very soon! Now are there any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne reporter raised his hand, \"Tom Conway of Paradigm News. Many of us are concerned about the Space Station Eurasia heading toward the earth. Has there been any progress about stopping the collision? And have you found out the ones responsible for hijacking?\" Good question. A very good necessary question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both Repliforce and the Maverick Hunters have taken major steps to delay it's course,\" Iris explains, \"while I cannot go into any detail regarding the identities of the hijackers because they are still being reviewed, I can say that our hackers have had success diverting it's gravitational pull. Our allies in the Maverick Hunters are also looking into developing a weapon to blast it out of our orbit. Much detail is still classified.\" Well, that sounds like good news, you guess. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhonda. With AIN Channel 4,\" the reporter introduces herself, \"um, the loss of your renown General mustve been very hard on you and everyone at Repliforce. Some would think such a horrible would event would strengthen your enemies' resolve. How do you and your comrades manage to cope regarding this tragedy? And how has this sudden change in your career and list of responsibilities affected you personally?\"<br>\r\n\"It has been very difficult for all of us,\" Iris answers, \"He was a wise and noble leader. The Colonel had never looked up to anyone quite as much as him. It truly was devastating. However, we are all still proud soldiers. We will still fight on and we will still continue to pursue our dream formed at Repliforce founding. The coward responsible for this heinous act will see justice. No traitor, outlaw, maverick, or bigoted fleshbag will stop us from realizing our goal. Our future will be bright. Nothing will put out our fire.\" Aw, that was so deep. But then came the next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Armand Velasquez, City of New Hope Times,\" the reported says, \"there has been leaked memos posted in certain tabloids that shortly before the General's assassinations, certain members within your organization have funneled money into the bank accounts that belonged to Sigma fanatics.\" OH SHIT. YOU DID NOT HEAR ABOUT THAT! \"Is there any truth to this accusation and has there been any investigation regarding it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris suddenly went silent for a moment. She just stared the reporter's way. There was no change on her face, but you'd hate to imagine the thoughts racing in her CPU. Finally after a while, she simply answers, \"I cannot comment on any such alleged events in question. Thank you everyone.\" And immediately after that, the conference was over and all the reporters were <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">forced</span> escorted out of the building. She certainly had her hands full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that doesnt mean Iris forgot about you. Not by a long shot. She missed you just about much as you missed her if not more... especially considering she liked reviewing HQ surveillance footage with you in it on her down time. There was one line of footage that peeked her interest so much, she would rewind and repeat it several times: Cinnamon's questionnaire. Or rather, the last question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the ability to produce future offspring important to you? Yes or No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems so nervous,\" Iris appeared to be narrating to herself, \"he's looking around the room. Breath. Breath. Breath.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well... at the moment... hm. That's a tough question to answer.\"<br>\r\n\"Well... at the moment... hm. That's a tough question to answer.\" She watched until she memorized your every word and matched your periods of stalling to the exact second! \"Still more breathing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to t-\"<br>\r\n\"Brat pretends to comfort him,\" Iris narrates over Cinammon's response, \"he glances around the room again. He finally looks back at Brat. He bites his lip. Pause. '...To be frank, I probably would like to have children eventually. I gotta say the answer's yes.' \"<br>\r\nShe then abruptly stops the footage right there.<br>\r\nAgain, her CPU works into overdrive, processing the many thoughts flowing through it as she stares at the black screen in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, someone's been spying on her the whole time through the doorway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was spying on her?</span></div></div>",

He currently is under my care, as he is a possible test subject for Project Arcadia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero asked, \"Project Arcadia? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the event that either the Enigma Cannon fails or if another disaster on the level of the Eurasia Crash occurs, then Project Arcadia will be started. It will be a paradise that allow humans and Reploids to live in harmony together. Some humans will even be given a chance to cross the line, so to speak and become both reploid and human. Thus they will be able to help guide everyone to peace, as they will have the viewpoints of both humans and reploids,\" Iris explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you might refuse her offer. but wanting to die can be seen as a sign of insanity and thus would allow Iris to ignore your pleas and allow her to extend your life to whatever she wanted it to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely there are other subjects for this Project Arcadia?\" Zeor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only a theoretical project, one that is still being looked over,\" Iris answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why look for subjects?\" Zero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're dealing with events that are apocalyptic. Sometimes in these situations, any suggestion becomes a good idea,\" Irs answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a bad idea, Iris. When was the last time you had a break?\" Zero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fail to see how it is your concern, but about a week ago. It was a walk in a park,\" Iris answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe after we deal with the Eurasia situation, maybe we can go on a date? You know, like the ones you wanted to go on with me?\" Zero asked, giving a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I have my eyes on someone else at the moment,\" Iris answered. \"Besides, I think Layer has been working up the courage to ask you out on a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Layer? You sure about that?\" Zero asked, feeling a bit hurt at being rejected by Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. She's even been trying out fencing and a few other sword skills, all in an attempt to impress you... or to fight by your side. You'll have to ask her,\" Iris answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Zero muttered. \"Back to why I came here. The Enigma cannon is almost ready to be fired and a few would like you to be there. I guess to press the button to fire it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris nodded before she said, \"I have to finish up a few things, but it won't take long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero nodded before leaving. He thought,<i> 'I need to speak with this [Y/N]. Maybe he knows why Iris seems off.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce alone, Iris took out a disc. It had a heavily modified Maverick Virus, one that instead of causing Reploids to go berserk, it would instead overwrite the Reploid's original Personality programming and memories with Iris's, while leaving the reploid's skill programming intact. If you didn't like her current body, then she'd have any number of other bodies to love you with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it required the Enigma Cannon to fail and a space shuttle to be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem with that is Iris's eyes was Zero. While she did have a Space shuttle prepared with a few internal weapons that would leave a reploid's CPU completely blank, there was a worry that Zero's still unanalyzable body might have some form of security measure that could allow him to overcome Iris's Virus or worse. He was needed for the large scale infection, as he could spread or absorb any version of the Maverick virus with a mere touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, Iris would have to settle to pick and choose and hope she would never be caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing the disc in the space shuttle's computers, Iris headed to the Engima Cannon control room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enigma Cannon ready to fire! Eurasia is almost into position!\" Alia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Alia... I need her skills to upgrade [Y/N]'s body... Perhaps I should use my backup virus on her, just in case,' </i>Iris thought as she had her finger over the fire button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three! Two! One!\" Alia shouted. \"Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firing,\" Iris calmly said as she pressed the button. The Enigma Cannon was a....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everybody on the face of the dying planet with a tv or at least a functioning radio was tuning in the Enigma Canon firing in the direction of the falling space station. You watched in on one of the only handful of Repliforce-approved channels from your 4KTV in your apartment. Cinnamon viewed the event from her portable television in her tent. The Colonel watched the firing from outside his balcony. X viewed it via the live footage airing at the Maverick Hunters HQ. Dr. Cain watched the event from the tv in his hospital room as the nurse bearing a Community bracelet brought him his dinner tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this brief moment, the world went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the earsplitting noise of a titanic orbital-piercing beam of Death Star magnitude erupted the planet and collided with the falling station! Then when the earthquakes finally stopped, the world went silent again.<br>\r\nUntil kaboom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion blotted out the sky in sheer absolute ultra bright light that was like staring directly into the sun if the sun was closer to the earth than the moon! You couldnt even bare watching the bright light through the tv without looking away! When the sky finally cleared, everybody checked the satellite footage: Space Station Eurasia was no more. Just dirt and debris floating in space forever lost. Whatever was left of the Maverick Virus there was praying for a quick death. MISSION COMPLETE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hunters cheered and applauded. Dang near everybody who witnessed this event cheered and celebrated. Iris... just stared. She just gazed up at the sky in such deep thought. It's like she didnt know whether to celebrate or be depressed. On one hand, this was a tremendous opportunity that was wasted away. She had so much planned had the canon failed and the station collided, putting so many necessary events into effect. With it destroyed, she's back to Square One. But on the other hand, this was a joyous occasion. For Repliforce was now the savior of human and robotic kind. This meant that many that did not like her, did not trust her, and would get in her way would now love her, respect her, and maybe even HELP her. One especially. This meant more opportunities for her. One door closed but another bigger, brighter, golden door opened. Repliforce's dream will be realized no doubt. HER dream will be realized no doubt. And best of all, HE probably witnessed this spectacle and is looking up at her with amaze and admiration right about now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO IRIS!!!\" you cheered her on as the camera focused on her in the middle of the cheering crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris couldnt help but smile and clap along with the others, now filled with newbound confidence... and more potential brainstorming.<br>\r\nThe camera even picked up Zero high-fiveing his comrades and when it came to Iris\u2026 she didnt even bat an eye to him. She just walked off still staring into space with a bright smile on her face. The camera spent a large amount of time focusing on Zero with his ignored hand in the air and an awfully disappointed frown as he watched Iris walk away from him.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, he got rejected,\u201d commented one of your bodyguard.<br>\r\n\u201cShut up ya twit!\u201d quipped the other bodyguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA much brighter more vibrant week passes and Repliforce is reaping in the rewards. Success with the destruction of Eurasia really put them on the map. Foreign funding increased dramatically. Loads of major corporate brands and making deals for endorsements (ie, McDonalds is coming out with their new sandwich, the McColonel!). A big film industry is already in the process of making a movie about their exploits! Geez, not even the Maverick Hunters havent gotten THIS league of praise no matter how many times they defeated Sigma!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if Repliforce is sitting pretty, that means YOURE sitting pretty. Everybody working there got themselves a nice bonus which meant you got yourself some extra spending cash to spruce up the apartment building youre still trapped in (they wont let you move out). It's a pleasant luxurious prison. Your coworkers still treat you like a 2nd class citizen and your bodyguards still aint any more talkative to you AND you miss your family and friends\u2026 but a step up is still a step up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day you were checking through the recent list of proposals and requests to be reviewed for approval.<br>\r\n\u201cLet's see\u2026 more transportation funding\u2026 build another YMCA\u2026 improved waste management\u2026 demand for an alleged Repliforce police brutality investigation\u2026 'Shutdown Project Arcadia'?\u201d<br>\r\nThat last proposal caught your interest. The draft was submitted by 'Phoenix Black, Human Rights Proponent and Community Organizer for Public Wellbeing'. It had a golden sun-shaped insignia that you didnt recognize stamped on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes as you skimmed through it. You couldnt read the text. It was typed up completely in gibberish. Or code.<br>\r\nThough you had no idea what this proposal was about, the name 'Project Arcadia' gave you bad feelings. You havent a clue what it is, but you coulda sworn you heard a few reploidal colleagues whisper that name a few times in jest.<br>\r\nCome to think of it, that insignia... have you seen that somewhere before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, somebody knocked on your door. Normally your bodyguards would be at the door to greet the guest (or tell him/her to piss off) but they seemed to have stepped out at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly hide the eerie 'proposal' in a drawer below the unopened box that had '[Y/N]'s Pornography' scratched up with a sharpie and quickly head to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately upon opening it and acting on impulse, you quickly give your guest the proper salute! Your guest happen to be...</span></div></div>",

Are you free to talk for a bit?\u201d Zero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing but time, so yes,\u201d You answered, stepping to the side and letting him in. You noted that your guards were nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Zero sat down on a chair, he asked, \u201cHow are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to make tea, you answered, \u201cI\u2019m alright. Kinda lonely, since Repliforce \u2018hired\u2019 me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHired how?\u201d Zero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI volunteered to work and Colonel decided to enlist me under Iris\u2019s command,\u201d You answered. You wanted to give the truth, but didn\u2019t think Zero would believe you. \u201cThings sorta spiraled from there. Iris is kinda clingy when we meet each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero smiled for a moment before muttering, \u201cYeah, she was during the Soul Eraser incidents...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m not the first one to receive her affections, eh?\u201d You asked as you put the tea pot and some cookies down on a table between the chair Zero was on and the couch you then sat down on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps. How is she?\u201d Zero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou meet her more than I do,\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m more interested in how you and Iris interact,\u201d Zero said with the tiniest of frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's like a girl in love whenever we meet,\" You began. \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and sighed. \u201cI haven\u2019t met another human in weeks and I think she's responsible. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I was the only human in this city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankful that being in the 0th Special Unit requires keen observational skills, the red maverick hunter thought,<i> \u2018Either he\u2019s the best actor I\u2019ve seen or Iris is going maverick.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not call someone?\u201d Zero asked, pouring a cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll calls are monitored. Even then, I have to get permission first and I really haven\u2019t gotten it as of late,\u201d You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the collar?\u201d Zero asked before taking a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething for my safety, I guess. I think Iris uses it to keep track of me,\u201d You answered as you got a cup for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Gonna need to run Iris under a virus scan. This is breaking a law or two and needs a reason for it,\u2019 </i>Zero thought. \u201cSo you\u2019re trapped here. Any idea why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at your tea. In a near whisper, you replied, \u201cI think\u2026 Iris is obsessing about me. I\u2019m scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle and a smirk, Zero asked, \u201cWhy be scared? Isn\u2019t she a beauty? Sure, she\u2019s a reploid, but the armor is removable and we do almost look like humans without it. Heck, half the models in any given swimsuit calendar are actually reploids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you been looking up, you would have noted that Zero\u2019s eyes were anything but pleasant. More akin to preparing for a quick strike to knock you out and taking you into jail\u2026 or the morgue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s lovely, but\u2026 It\u2019s like something is wrong. A relationship is a two-way street and what I\u2019m going through is either like I\u2019m a pet or a submissive husband who is like two steps away from being tied to her bed,\u201d you said before shuddering. \u201cLast time we did anything close to romantic was a walk through a park and that was quite some time ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 anything else?\u201d Zero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a meeting with a nurse reploid where she talked with me about sexual matters. I think Iris sent her,\u201d You answered. \u201cHer name was\u2026 Cinnamon? Yeah, that was her name. It happened when the Eurasia incident first broke out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll check the records and see if anything was out of the ordinary about that meeting,\u201d Zero replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d You said.</span></div></div>",

I dont think they'd welcome me if they knew WHY I came.\"<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean?!\"<br>\r\n\"Forget about it,\" Zero changed the subject, \"there's still some things I'll need to know.

Keep a good eye on her, ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Wont be hard,\" you say, \"Bye Zero.\" He waves you off as he leaves. You didnt get to see him off longer than a few seconds before he teleports out of there! Must be nice to be able to teleport. You spend quite a bit of time pondering that teleportation ability. You wonder how it works? Are there limits to where one can teleport? Is it true that if you teleport into a wall, you'd be crushed to death? Do you need special training to use it properly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, you didnt really care at all about teleporting. You just wanted something to take your mind off Iris. It gave you a LITTLE hope that maybe Zero'll help you out. That is unless HE'S got a problem too! You heard a little about HIS backstory! And that stare he was giving off... if you were a reploid, you'd have probably seen a huge 'WARNING' message pop up on your screen!<br>\r\nNonetheless, it did a good job keeping your mind occupied for about 2 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after those 2 hours, someone knocked on the door. You sensed absolute dread coming from the other side. Still, you had to answer it. And you had to salute the three soldiers staring your way.<br>\r\n\"You need to come with us,\" the head troop ordered. You assumed the position and they grabbed you and dragged you off to your destiny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shortest most uncomfortable perp walk you've ever had the privilege of experiencing, the goons reached their destination: your old junior high school\u2026  occupied as yet ANOTHER Repliforce base.<br>\r\nA depressing walk down memory lane later and youre taken to what used to be the Principal's office. One of your goons knocks on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d said the Colonel's erudite yet awfully intimidating voice on the other end. Bad feeling. A very bad feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure dragged inside to see the Colonel currently filling out some documents that his reploid secretary hands him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d one of the goons whispers as he lets go of your arm, \u201csalute your superior!\u201d<br>\r\nYou swallow hard and give him the salute, \u201cSir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Y/N],\u201d he said your name in a stern tone like a disappointed parent, \u201cit has come to my attention that you engaged in an unauthorized rendevous with a Maverick Hunter, Commander Zero.\u201d Er, is that a problem? Theyre allies, right? \u201cAre you aware that Zero had given no prior notice ahead of time that he speak with you in private, therefor your meeting was unsanctioned?\u201d Oh boy.<br>\r\n\u201cI wasnt aware, sir,\u201d you answer. He wasnt done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has ALSO come to my attention that in this unauthorized rendevous, you spoke very ill of your commanding officer?\u201d OF COURSE.<br>\r\n\u201cOh snap!\u201d you heard one of the goons chuckle quietly.<br>\r\nDespite being a little scared AND embarrassed, you try to keep a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have made quite a few rather damning allegations about Lieutenant Iris,\u201d he states while still writing his notes, \u201cand to a member of a foreign armed forces corp. To some, this can seen as treason.\u201d That big 'T' word broke your facade. You knew what he was implying by that! Even though you didnt willingly join his posse, no good can come from being seen as treasonous to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I'm not a traitor!\u201d you speak up, \u201cit was never my intention to hurt your sister in any way.\u201d You take a deep breath, \u201cThe truth is I'm really worried about her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere's nothing to worry about other than making outrageous exaggerated claims to foreign intelligence.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut that's the thing! Theyre NOT exaggerated!\u201d you explain to him, \u201cI mean her\u2026 behavior\u2026 the way she's been treating me\u2026. the numerous hidden cameras I found in my apartment\u2026 the archive\u2026 hell that silly box of porn she put on my table!\u201d The goons couldnt help but laugh at that.<br>\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d the Colonel shut them up.<br>\r\nYou continued, \u201cThink about it! Does this not sound off to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's no surprise she's interested in you,\u201d he didnt sound the least bit phased by all that, \u201cyou should be flattered. She's had many reploid admirers that were never so lucky.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, I'm very flattered sir,\u201d you say, \u201chowever, THIS kind of obsession, it's not normal. It feels incredibly similar to that of a stalker. I'm worried there could be something wrong with her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d big bro wont give that a thought, \u201cIris is perfectly balanced, body and mind.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry sir, but I dont feel safe like this,\u201d you give it to him straight, \u201cwhat if her behavior escalates? Who knows what she might end up doing? ...She might be going Maverick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything got quiet as soon as you said the M word! The goons froze up, the secretary gasped, and the Colonel finally put down his pen and stared you right in the eyes. He got right up out of his seat and he was  a hair's away from clocking you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont you EVER make that allegation about my sister again!\u201d he coldly warned you.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else can I call it?\u201d you keep going, \u201cthere IS something wrong with her! As her brother, you should know that-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI will not tolerate this insubordination!\u201d he cut you off, \u201cIris has given you a remarkable opportunity with a bright beautiful future and THIS is how you repay her?!\u201d You had enough. It's not like you wanted this job anyway!<br>\r\n\u201cFine! Then take it away!\u201d you say, \u201cI didnt wanna join Repliforce anyway! I quit!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI will not accept your resignation,\u201d he refuses, \u201cyou will serve my sister to the best of your abilities until youre completely incapable of doing so!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou cant do that!\u201d something made you blurt that out, \u201cthis is illegal!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you about choosing your words more carefully?\u201d he tells you just before he tapped your special collar! What an asshole! And you were actually trying to help him!<br>\r\nStill, you had to keep going, \u201cI have chosen my words carefully. Your sister is in danger. If you dont help her, she may very well become a Maverick.\u201d That did it. The room got dead quiet yet again. The Colonel looked like he wanted to rip your head clean off and then gift wrap it and give it to Iris for Christmas! But he was a well disciplined soldier. He kept his cool. He was polite, he was professional, and he had a plan to kill everybody he met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStep outside,\u201d he ordered everyone else to leave the room. Just you and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could kill you for that traitorous attitude of yours,\u201d he warned you, \u201cbut the last thing I want to do is make my sister cry. So I'll be lenient. You are hereby forbidden from leaving your apartment. Until further notice, any and all communication and visitation privilege is now revoked. You may not speak with anyone outside of Repliforce faculty. Your phone line will be cut and I will send an inspector to check up on you regularly.\u201d He stopped for a few seconds, but you knew he wasnt done. Then he added, \u201cAnd if your treasonous behavior continues, I will have you operated on, broken down, reprogrammed, and THEN you will serve my sister to the best of your abilities! Is that understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat threat left a nasty image in your head. Truly a living nightmare.<br>\r\n\u201cLoud and clear sir,\u201d you give up. He's gone too. Looks like you got TWO Mavericks to deal with. With that now ringing true, you were immediately escorted out of the Colonel's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got a lot of nerve talking to the Colonel like that,\u201d one of the guys restraining you said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou better pray that Iris never changes her mind about you,\u201d the other one warned, \u201ccuz as soon as she does-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d the head goon shut them up, \u201clet's just toss this dog back in his kennel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they did. They chucked you back in your apartment like a sack of potatoes and put up another security lock on the door so you cant get out. With the Colonel's orders set in stone, it seemed all but hopeless for you. No matter how much worse Iris gets, you were hers. You can either accept your fate or be made to accept your fate. You shudder to think how they'll make that possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord save me,\u201d you whisper to yourself as you sit on your couch staring at the floor.</span></div></div>",

You might not know me, but I'm Alia. I'm normally the Navigator, operator, and computer specialist for X and Zero,\" Alia said as the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So pardon me for asking, what are you here for?\" you asked as the two of you sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just wondering if you'd like your collar upgraded,\" Alia answered with a small-yet-friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd actually like it removed,\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia frowned for a moment before she said, \"I'm sorry, but that isn't an option at this moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"So what are the upgrades?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you the tablet, which had an image of your security collar. She swiped the screen. Now the collar had a little speaker/microphone and she said, \"One is a speaker add-on, so you can contact or be contracted by a select few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Select few? I'm already suspicious about the collar. How do I know that some pervert won't be listening in on me whenever they want?\" You asked, getting mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you that the only ones that will have access to your collar will be the Maverick Hunters and the Repliforce. Both forces will respect your privacy,\" Alia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. So what other upgrades are there?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother swipe. Now it had a few red gems added. \"An energy shield and an emergency teleporter, just in case you are attacked or are about to receive a fatal injury.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded before saying, \"That does sound useful. So that's a maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third swipe. Now it had some little camera-doodad things. \"A holographic version of the speaker. This can also be used as a computer,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, \"Interesting, but I still worry for my privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia nodded. \"That will always be a concern. After all, today's unbeatable security is tomorrow's weak spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So enough of the upgrades for now. I have a few questions. Like, what is Project Arcadia?\" you asked, handing back the tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the incident with Space Station Eurasia has a lot of people and reploids panicking. Commander Iris wants to create a secure place for reploids and humans to live in. It's only theoretical at the moment, as talks are also being done about blurring the line between humans and reploids,\" Alia answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked a few times. You asked with quite a bit of concern, \"How does she intend on doing that? On either of those? Don't' we call that last one a cyborg.... Which, by the way, is just a human with robot parts. Don't we have those already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia sighed, \"Technically yes, but this is blurring it even further, like allowing reploids to give birth to more reploids and having them grow up like humans. Maybe even let them give birth to humans as well. There\u2019s also another theoretical project about letting humans live as long as reploids. Commander Iris is trying to convince me to go back to my previous job as a Reploid researcher for it all, but I'm having my doubts. I left that job for some very good reasons. At the moment, I'm safe, but I suspect she might find a way to force me back, so I'll be forced to work on Project Arcadia and more. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just quit?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia sadly smiled at you. \"I know too much and I don't want my memory wiped. That and the Maverick Virus still exists. Fight the good fight, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you know of Phoenix Black?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never met the man, but I've been told he's a rabblerouser who is against any human modifications that contain technology,\u201d Alia answered. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of him behind any of the more violent attacks against reploids or humans, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he was connected to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you covered your face with your hands. \u201cIt all sounds like a minefield.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia sighed, \u201cTell me about it. How about we talk about something else or do something happier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped her chin in thought before putting a deck of cards on your desk. \u201cHow about a friendly game of poker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are the stakes?\u201d you asked as she produced a bag of poker chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loser does a favor for the winner?\" Alia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I guess I could use my break for this.\"</span></div></div>",

It clearly had a backdoor for certain Repliforce intelligence agents to spy on their 'allies' in the Maverick Hunters. In this case, Commander Iris was watching the surveillance footage between you and Alia emitting from the tablet in displeasure. Though her stare was blank and her facade was pure stonewall, millions of thoughts emitted through her CPU as she tapped her finger on the desk impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia did not give prior notice that she was gonna meet privately with the Commander's prized subordinate today nor was she given permission to do so. A major violation. However, Iris was in no position to do anything about it at the moment. One, because Alia has rank in the Maverick Hunters and she didnt wanna risk jeopardizing the alliance out of petty envy. Two, because she still had plans for her. 'Project Arcadia' was strictly need to know and Alia needed to know for good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris took a quick glance over at her special CD collection in the glass cabinet then back at the screen, still tapping her finger as she watched you and Alia play your silly little poker game.<br>\r\nSince you and Alia had an awful lot of free time on your hands, you made it best 3 out of 5. You werent a wiz with poker outside of when Mr. Hochrin playing a few rounds with you and his buddies teaching you the ropes way back when. You had no clue how good Alia was at the game, but you shouldnt be too worried. Youre not playing for keeps and youre certainly not playing strip poker (not sure how that'd work with a reploid!) so what do you have to lose other than doing her a favor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst round of was a good start for you.<br>\r\n\"Flush,\" you revealed your hand.<br>\r\nAlia sighed and revealed hers, \"Pair. One point for you.\"<br>\r\nIris's finger tapped a little slower seeing you win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond round was a load of shit.<br>\r\nYou had nothing. No good cards.You traded them out for even worse cards.<br>\r\nYou put on your best poker face, but Alia saw right through it.<br>\r\n\"Two pairs,\" she shows you her hand.<br>\r\nYou shrug and reveal your useless royal sampler. \"That's one point for me,\" Alia smiled.<br>\r\nIris's finger tapped a little faster seeing you lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say [Y/N],\" Alia started up the conversation during Round 3.<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" you eyed your hand and contemplated the best cards to keep.<br>\r\n\"I'm curious. How did you know about 'Project Arcadia'?\" you almost dropped your cards when she asks that question, \"I'm pretty sure that name's been kept very top secret.\"<br>\r\nIris stopped tapping her finger.<br>\r\nYou try to keep a straight face, but the drawer with that 'proposal' crammed in it was right in the corner of your eye. Acting as if youre TOTALLY not glancing that direction you quickly think of a good answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... heard a couple of troops mutter stuff about it,\" you answered, \"guess despite the whole 'top secret' schtick, somebody's been blabbing about it. I wouldnt be surprised if I was the ONLY person that didnt get it blabbed to!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, thinking about it, it does sound a bit too silly to be kept a top secret project, doesnt it?\" Alia commented, \"I mean think about it. Reploids actually given the programming to give biological birth? That sounds like pure fantasy than actual science. Even if it's science fiction.\"<br>\r\nYou shrug your shoulders as your mood cooled down, \"Eh, I bet they said the same thing way back then when the idea of humans and robots coexisting was science fiction.\"<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Alia stated, \"I cant help but wonder how that would feel. A baby growing inside you for 3/4s of a whole year until your belly bulges out outrageously and then FINALLY passing it out through the tight confines between your legs! That sounds like it would be extremely painful. And I've seen footage of female humans screaming in agony as their children are being pulled out of them! How can you guys handle such misery?\"<br>\r\n\"I dont think I'M the right person to ask,\" you answer for obvious reasons, \"anyways, I got a straight. What you got?\"<br>\r\n\"Four of a kind.\" OUCH!! \"Score's now 2-1.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more loss and youre done. Round 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, since you asked me something tight and discreet,\" Alia started up another conversation, \"mind if I ask you one in return?\"<br>\r\n\"Shoot,\" you answer, still concentrating on your next move.<br>\r\n\"I dont know if you saw that press conference last week,\" she begins.<br>\r\n\"Oh, the one about how the Colonel whipped Duff McWhalen and liberated the museum?\" Alia nods. \"What about it?\"<br>\r\n\"There was something that got our attention,\" your eyebrow twitched as Alia mention 'OUR', \"right before Iris stopped taking questions. The one asked by the reporter of City of New Hope Times.\"<br>\r\nIris glanced over at Alia, her full attention now drawn to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" you nodded, \"that Velasquez guy. I remember.\"<br>\r\n\"That got a lot of attention over at the Hunter base and even though we joined forces and destroyed Space Station Eurasia, people are STILL talking about it. Do you know anything about any wire transfers from any of Repliforce's personnel to Sigma thugs?\" Fair question. It got you thinking as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's news to me,\" you answered, \"I couldnt even tell you if it's true or not. But the Colonel definitely caught wind of it. A few days ago, he sent a couple of inquisitors over going door to door interrogating each and every person they came across. One of them grabbed one of my bodyguards and shook him up really hard. I had to run up to the guy and scream in his face that he was with me the whole time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding ding ding!*<br>\r\nAs if conveniently on cue, a text appeared on Iris's phone. She grabbed the phone, glanced at the message, then glanced over at you. She quickly typed up her brief response and put the phone away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hasnt gotten any easier on our side either,\" Alia explained, \"ever since that conference, X started to distance himself from any involvement with Repliforce. He didnt even show up to the Enigma Cannon launching. I'm probably not supposed to say this, but I think X is getting pretty suspicious of Repliforce.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" you say to her, \"give him time. I'm sure he'll come around.\"<br>\r\nAlia looked pretty uneasy, \"I doubt it. Even their proudest sponsor, Dr. Cain himself is starting to believe all the negative press against your employers.\"<br>\r\n\"Dr. Cain?!\" you double-taked, \"Him?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He insists that we start reading more of those stupid tabloids. Shortly after that press conference, he bought a year's subscription to City of New Hope Times and features EVERY single article written by Armand Velasquez. And all he writes about are the leaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either the world renown Dr. Cain suddenly turned into a conspiracy theorist crackpot,\" you probably couldve been more tact with your words, \"or we got ourselves a mole. Maybe I should bring this up with Iris. Oh, ready to show your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. A straight. You?\"<br>\r\n\"Straight flush!\" you reply, impressing even yourself, \"guess this means we're dead even.\"<br>\r\n\"This next round decides the winner. Hope you got a strong spine under all that meat, cuz youre gonna be needed it when you lose!\"<br>\r\n\"Unless youre giving me a hernia exam, I'm sure I'll be fine!\" And with a sudden burst of confidence despite the uncomfortable topics of discussions, the two of play the last round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your only audience member from afar watches you, of course... still tapping the desk with impatience.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everybody on the face of the dying planet with a tv or at least a functioning radio was tuning in the Enigma Canon firing in the direction of the falling space station. You watched in on one of the only handful of Repliforce-approved channels from your 4KTV in your apartment. Cinnamon viewed the event from her portable television in her tent. The Colonel watched the firing from outside his balcony. X viewed it via the live footage airing at the Maverick Hunters HQ. Dr. Cain watched the event from the tv in his hospital room as the nurse bearing a Community bracelet brought him his dinner tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this brief moment, the world went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the earsplitting noise of a titanic orbital-piercing beam of Death Star magnitude erupted the planet and collided with the falling station! Then when the earthquakes finally stopped, the world went silent again.<br>\r\nUntil kaboom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion rocked the pla-wait a minute! The explosion stopped halfway! Everybody stared with confusion as the explosion started to reverse! Actually, the space station was rebuilding itself! A strong bright surge of energy, possibly the virus, surrounded the pieces and fragments and pulled them right back together as if it was saying 'OH NO YOU DONT! I'M COMING DOWN THERE! AND DOOM IS COMING WITH ME!' The canon not only failed, the world just learned that it's in much more danger than it thought it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris watched quietly and emotionless as everyone around her either fell into depression or panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Douglas!\" Zero got on his earpiece and began Plan B, \"the canon failed! Get the shuttle ready now! ...What do you mean you cant? Well hurry up and get it patched! ...What are you talking about? ...WHO?! WHO DID THAT?!\" Zero's face went cold and he turned that cold glance toward Alia, \"Lock everything down. Make sure nobody gets in or out without my saying so!\" Plan B was aborted.<br>\r\n\"Alia! Are you aware your new intern just broke into the hangar, took out security, and set our shuttle to self-destruct?!\"<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-what?! Double?! But how-\"<br>\r\n\"What if Double's a Sigma spy?! Alia, did you even check his background before hiring him?!\"<br>\r\n\"N-not really. I mean why? All he actually did around the base was make coffee and send faxes.\"<br>\r\n\"Well your coffee guy just single-handedly sabotaged the whole mission!\"<br>\r\n\"Z-Zero.. I...\"<br>\r\n\"Because of that screwup, we have to start over. The world's gonna suffer while we wait because of you.\"<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n\"Report back to base,\" Zero ordered and just walking away, he added, \"when you get there, I recommend cleaning out your desk.\"<br>\r\n\"W-WHAT?! ZERO WAIT!! PLEASE WAIT!!\" the camera zoomed in just in time to see Alia's heart breaking as she collapsed to the floor, realizing she's just been fired. Poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Alia,\" one of your guards commented, \"she's just a nice girl.\"<br>\r\n\"We got much worse things to worry about, you twit!\" remarked the other guard. As for you, the event before you was hard to watch. You felt really bad for the Maverick Hunters and Repliforce. Especially Iris. But worst of all, you were beginning to wonder what you were gonna do now. Was this the end? Is everybody gonna die? Is this seriously how mankind is wiped out?! You always knew the world was gonna sooner or later, but you hoped you'd never live long enough to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were forced to soak in this outrageously painful reality, Iris, still showing no change in her facade yet many thoughts rushed through her CPU, patted Alia's shoulder and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, the whole world changed. The blast from the Enigma Cannon not only failed to destroy the colliding space station, but it scattered plenty of it's virus strains onto the earth's surface. Random Maverick attacks increased dramatically, more brutal and unstable than before. The attackers were not only more aggressive, but also obsessive, tearing into any and all they believe threaten their prized product of interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrict quarantines were enforced. Your entire city was on lockdown. Nobody and no one was allowed to so much as set foot outside their home. Not even you had the privilege of leaving your apartment! Not even to grab a bite to eat, Repliforce would drop a ration box outside your door and you'd have seconds to take it and shut the door. Your internet was shut down and the only channels on your tv available only played old vintage sitcoms approved by Big R. You had absolutely no access to news outside your city so you were ignorant of the chaos happening across the world. Perhaps it was a good thing. The last thing you wanted was to be reminded that Doomsday was upon you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you werent scared, depressed, or panicky, you were bored. You spent most of the day just reading old comics, playing old video games, and staring out the barred window. How you wished something ANYTHING could happen to get you out of your fit of cabin fever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just had to wish! You dropped your controller as you rocked by the sudden tremors of earthquake-induced thumping! Your heart nearly stopped as heard the thumping get closer and closer! You turned around to face the door as the thumping suddenly stopped RIGHT outside it! It just had to be on the day your security guards were on leave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUD!! THUD!! THUD!! THUD!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pounded HARD on your door to the point that it came close to knocking it right off the hinges! Your blood ran cold. The last thing you wanted to do was answer the door, but it was either you do that or it breaks down the door and charges you! If today's the day you die, what's the use delaying the inevitable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Dont open that door!\" Wesker warns you on the tv screen as you creep toward that one wooden barrier standing between you and IT. You take a slow quiet breath and slowly turn the knob.<br>\r\nYou gazed at the purple heavily armored winged mech which glared down you with glowing purple eyes, the only thing not hidden under it's helmet! You couldnt speak, you couldnt move, you couldnt breathe. You just froze up. Then it grabbed both your shoulders and you were only microseconds away from screaming in absolute terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Y/N]!! It's been so long! I'm so glad youre alright!\" you heard an awfully cheerful woman's voice cry out from within the Purple Hell Mech! After recognizing her voice, you snapped out of it!<br>\r\n\"I...I..Iris?!\" you say in sheer disbelief as you regained yourself, \"Iris is that you?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course it's me!\" she smiled, but you couldnt see it under her scary glowing eyed helmet, \"I'm so sorry I wasnt able to visit more often. This new job is a bit more demanding than I expected.\" Hell Mech Iris glanced into your apartment room. \"Hm, I see you still havent opened your pornography ration.\" Now you went from terrified to death to embarrassed to death! \"Did I get your personal tastes wrong the whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, d-dont worry about that!\" you change the subject, \"I'm just... glad to see youre doing well. And it's nice to see you finally get some free time to visit. ...And nice mech suit by the way.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh you like it?\" Iris noted your interest, \"this is my personal riot armor. It's been a while since I needed to use it, but with my new job, I've needed it now more than ever.\" Combat reploid. Remember?<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I must be tough. And I'm sorry I couldnt be there to congratulate you on your promotion.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid there's not much to celebrate right now,\" she states sadly, \"...I take it you've heard the dreadful news, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and remembered, \"Yeah. H...how much time until the impact.\"<br>\r\n\"I dont know,\" Iris answered, \"we're still putting in efforts to stop the collision, but with much less resources. The Maverick Hunters are no longer cooperating with us.\" Bad news.<br>\r\n\"Theyre not?! Why not?\"<br>\r\n\"Too many disagreements,\" she tells you, \"plus they have major problems of their own to deal with.\"<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Iris went silent. The glowing eyes stared deeply into yours, but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not trouble ourselves with them right now,\" she suddenly shifts gears, \"anyways, there's a reason I came here. There's something I wanted to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you heard of Project Arcadia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. \"No. I cant say I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then it hasnt been leaked,\" she states, \"it's quite a long discussion. Mind if I come in? Or if you'd like, we could go on another leisurely walk and talk over it then. I'll suspend your lockdown curfew.\"<br>\r\n\"Um... do you still need to do that with the armor on?\" you ask, still creeped out by it.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she nodded, \"it's still very dangerous outside. This is the best way to keep you safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it seems like a no brainer.  Inviting her into your apartment to discuss this 'Project Arcadia' thing surely beats going outside and risking grave danger while Hell Mech Iris follows you around like a shadow. But hey, the choice is yours!</span></div></div>",

The goal we were trying to achieve is to figure a way to produce human reploid hybrids since humans are able to do several things reploids cant and vice versa. We found a way to replicate the way human women have babies and We've finally reached what we were achieving for. And now we just need to perform the act of fertilization i along with several other women were chosen to be the test subjects of Project Arcadia we require human sperm to be Inserted Via sexual intercourse. You and several other Males have been selected to be candidates for the project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! 3 months of radio silence to be greeted with that bombshell! You've been dating Iris for only 3 freaking months! And for a while you barely saw her! \"And you want me to be the one who impregnates you?\" You ask wide eyed. <br>\r\n\"Correct!\" Iris smiled at you before placing her hand on your lap and scooting closer to you, \"Id be more than happy to bear your child no matter how painful it is. Ever since i first met you while you were volunteering i felt an odd comfort around you and before i knew it i started to think more and more about you and what you liked it felt weird so i talked to my brother about you before i realized it was i in love with you! When i opened that present and saw your face i never felt such joy in my entire life! All i ask of you Y/N is this... will you please give me your signature?\" Iris said before pulling a sheet of paper out of her pocket. \"So we can be happy and have a beautiful child together and love eachother more than ever before? Please?\"<br>\r\nIris said before looking at you in a way that made your heart beat fast. Wow! She really meant that but still! You've hardly seen her in a while! And this entire proposal is extremely out of the blue! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was difficult. One of the most difficult yes/no choices you have ever made in your life, obviously because this was completely life-changing. Youre awful sure there's more detail than what Iris is leading on, but the fine print was far too small to read (and Iris's smile brightened conveniently after you realized you couldnt read it!) but even if there werent any catches (and there damn sure were!), it was still too big of a life-changing decision to make!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were given the opportunity to have Iris, a Reploid, potentially be the mother of your children. This may as well have been a marriage proposal. And although you were fond of Iris despite the difference in species AND the awfully questionable extreme interest in you, was she truly 'wife' AND 'mother' material to you? Are you really ready to make such a commitment with her? Is SHE the type of person you'd willingly get down on your knees, propose to, engage in holy matrimony, and spend the rest of your life with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer 'yes' seemed to be moving further and further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand with the pen in it was trembling. She was quick to notice your uneasiness but her CPU brushed it off as the equivalent of 'wedding jitters'. Her CPU was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the pen down and handed her back the paper. Her CPU detected red flags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what's wrong, [Y/N]?\" Iris calmly despite her calmness was faltering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Iris,\" you give it to her straight,\"this is quite a large commitment. I need more time to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-wh-what's there to.... think about?\" her calm facade shattered like glass, \"it's very simple. Not at all complicated.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually it IS kinda complicated,\" you explain to her, \"something like this is a real big first to me. And I dont know if I'm ready to go head-first into it like this.\"<br>\r\n\"But... but what's there to worry about?\" Iris's calm voice changed to panic, \"I mean sure, everyone is scared of being under the knife, but if anything, you'll have far more advantages than disadvantage becoming a cyborg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cyborg?!\" why did she leave THAT part out in the beginning?! \"where does it that I'm gonna be a cyborg?!\"<br>\r\n\"Right here in this clause,\" she points to the extremely small unreadable text on the paper you wisely didnt sign, \"it's a small sacrifice. Proper reproduction with one of us would require altering a small insignificant fraction of your DNA to ensure successful compatibility.\"<br>\r\n\"That small insignificant fraction requires giving up my humanity?\" you question her.<br>\r\nIris sighs, \"No. You'll still maintain... I mean this is an UPGRADE for you! Have you ever considered the advantages us reploids have to you humans and thought to yourself 'Gee, I wish I could do that!' Well with this, you CAN! And then some!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I did notice the advantages that reploids have,\" you admit, \"but I'm not sure it's worth turning myself half-robot for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre clearly not being rational-\"<br>\r\n\"No, YOURE not being rational!\" you cut her off, \"I'm very fine with being human. COMPLETELY human. And I'm gonna need more time to think hard about this! TWICE as hard since one of the requirements is surgically removing a chunk of that human and become a whole new species!\"<br>\r\nThe more you turned her down, the more upset she got. It seemed like she was getting legitimately offended that you wouldnt jump at her offer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I dont understand!\" Iris had a hard time controlling the volume of her voice, \"why are you so hesitant to do this?! If anything, I'M the one who'll be doing most of the work! Youre not even the particular sex that has to go through labor! You have far little to risk than I do! This... this doesnt make sense! This is ILLOGICAL!!\" That shouldve triggered a red flag. But instead, you keep your composure even though your reploidal friend and superior was having a hard time doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Iris,\" you tell her, \"I'll think about this a little longer.\"<br>\r\nShe stared blankly at you for several seconds. That shouldve triggered yet another red flag. Unfortunately, you were still blind to her 'problem'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Error. Irregularity detected.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Iris smiled as if she wasnt on the verge of panicking seconds ago! \"as I was saying, I understand youre very nervous but I promise you everything will work out just fine. Now if you'll just sign the paper-\"<br>\r\n\"I said I'm not ready.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course you are. Just a simple signature and we're done.\"<br>\r\n\"Didnt you hear me? I said-Hey let go!\"<br>\r\n\"Here, just a neat little stroke-\"<br>\r\n\"Let go of me-HEY! THAT HURTS!\"<br>\r\n\"Please stop struggling, it'll make things easier!\"<br>\r\n\"I said stop it! Ow! Stop!\"<br>\r\n\"You know this is for your own good, just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snap* During your struggle, the pen broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, hold on! I'll find a new pen,\" she finally let go of your wrist and reached into her pockets for another pen, \"hm... I couldve sworn I had another here. Damnit, of all convenient times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she couldnt so much as begin her search before a Repliforce grunt dashes into your apartment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander Iris, ma'am! We have an emergency!\" he spouted, \"a large group Mavericks were sighted at the local cemetery!\" Berserk bastards are dishonoring your dead?!<br>\r\n\"Gather the squad,\" Iris ordered, \"I'll be there as soon as possible!\" Good news is that this awkward meeting came to a merciful end. Bad news is that she had to go back into that glowing eyed nightmare-enducing riot armor again!<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry [Y/N],\" Iris apologized while you were too busy shaking off the slight bit of mental trauma, \"we'll continue this discussion later. Dont forget to set your surgical appointment with Professor Isoc.\" SURGICAL APPOINTMENT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I said I need-\" Too late. She was already gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was scary as all hell. What has gotten into your boss?! Sure you already noticed she was acting odd to begin with, but that was on a whole 'nother level! Sheesh, your wrist is really hurting. There were some pretty good squeeze marks left by your friend! Any tighter, she couldve possibly broken a bone!<br>\r\nIt goes without saying, but that certainly helped make your possible life-changing decision a lot easier. Then again, considering that odd behavior, she's not really gonna give you much choice, is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Riiiiing! Riiiing!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jumped in surprise when the phone rang! Yeah youre a little more jumpy than ever (thanks to both the end of the world coming AND you-know-who!). Nonetheless, you answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your presence is requested for the good of our kind,\" said the deep gruff voice on the other end.<br>\r\n\"W-Who is this?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"If you desire to remain a slave to your genocidal mechanical overlords, please disregard this call,\" the voice on  the other end tells you, \"if you wish to break the chains that bind you and seek ultimate liberation, please get to the payphone on the corner of Williams and Crane Road.\"<br>\r\nJust when you were about to question your mysterious caller, you heard your collar start to power down! The flashing lights suddenly shut off. The lock binding around your neck released and the collar snapped open!! You were free!!<br>\r\n\"Wh...what... how did..?!!!\"<br>\r\n\"Once again, the payphone on the corner of Williams and Crane Road,\" the voice repeats,\"thank you in advanced for your service to our Community.\" 'Community'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?!!\" too late. Dial tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInteresting. It almost seemed perfectly planned to get such a call at that particular moment. You can only imagine what kind of trouble you'll get yourself in if you actually do as that voice on the phone tells you. Youre probably in trouble already now that collar's off you (as if you knew how to turn it back on even if you wanted it back on!!).<br>\r\nHowever, the last chilling moment with Iris flashed in your head and part of you was wondering how much worse it's gonna get for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure damned if you try to leave Repliforce. Youre damned if you remain in Repliforce! But regardless, you and everybody else on the planet are gonna be damned once the space station hits the earth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was running out in more ways than one. You had a new choice. Do you dare leave this place and head to payphone? Or do you dare remain and await what else your superior/girlfriend/wife/mother of your cyborg children will have in store for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr do you dare go for the third option? You doubt you'll get far on your own, but the collar's off and the end of the world's coming. What more do you have to lose?</span></div></div>",

Even if you dont go, you might STILL be in trouble for not having your collar still attached to your neck and if you tried to put it back on, you might leave fingerprints and they'll suspect you got it off yourself! And even if youre NOT in trouble, you might be put on even tighter security with even less privacy and breathing space  'for your safety' and shit. And let's be honest, Iris aint playing a straight game. If you had to bet money on whether or not she's turned maverick, you know which one would net you the jackpot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sweat dripping down every organic orifice you still had (that Iris might want surgically removed), you peek out the door and into the hallway. No security in sight. Strange, but opportunity.<br>\r\n'Lord protect me,' you mentally pray as you dash out of the apartment building. It took a sec for your eyes to adjust to the bright sunlight (were you couped up in your room for THAT long?!), but after they finished adjusting, you kept them peeled for Repliforce patrolmen as you dashed down the street. Your old town was now a ghost town. No cars or people in sight. Just one or two robots scouting around every now and then that you had to dash away from and hide in a nearby alleyway to avoid detection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one moment of distraction that almost derailed the entire trip. At an unoccupied newsstand, you spot a newspaper with a headline that catches your attention elevenfold. It relates to the Maverick Hunters. Considering news of the outside world became limited for you and Iris didnt wanna tell you about it, you peeked at the headline and squinted your eyes hard as you read it.<br>\r\nOne of their head navigators, Layer, was hospitalized and quarantined after she tested positive for a mutated strain of the Sigma Virus. According to the article, she showed odd behavior becoming obsessed with her commanding officer Zero, began stalking him, hacked surveillance footage and kept archives of video of him, and even brutally attacked her fellow navigator Palette for having the audacity to talk to him directly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus,\" you whispered in disbelief, \"what is going on with this world? It's almost like the collision cant happen soon enough!\" No sooner did you spout that did you hear footsteps coming toward you! Snapping out of it, you rush into a nearby restroom and hide in there until the noise passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it was plain sailing all the way to the corner of Williams and Crane. You reached the only payphone there and stepped in the booth.<br>\r\n*Riiiiing! Riiing!* And sure enough, the phone rang. You took a deep breath and answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The path to Nirvana is near,\" answered the deep gruff voice on the other end, \"come as you are.\"<br>\r\n\"Wh-what does that even me-\"<br>\r\n*Beeeeeeep* He already hung up. That was literally it. You came all this way for THAT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the booth, assuming this was a wasted effort, but not exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you were about to head back, you could hear guitar strumming in the distance. The groovy guitar rifts you were hearing gave off a familiar melody.  You couldnt quite put your finger on it, so you headed toward the direction you heard the strumming to hear it better. Soon, you hummed the tune yourself and eventually reminded yourself of lyrics that went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, as you are, as you were, as I want you to be,\" you sang along with the melody, \"as a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy...!!!\" WAIT A MINUTE! PATH TO NIRVANA?! COME AS YOU ARE?! THAT'S WHAT THE VOICE WAS REFERRING TO!! Putting the pieces together, you continue following the direction that Nirvana song is leading you. You continue singing along to it cuz it's a good song as the guitarist knew how to rock the melody, but you didnt wanna give yourself away to the Reploidal philistines!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of following, the bitchin' tune led you to an old familiar abandoned store that you remembered was once Mr. Hochrin's old music shop. You could still make out the 'Sha-Wing' impression the store sign left off. Although it was clearly closed down, the door wasnt locked. Against your better judgment, you Came As You Were all the way down to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter heading down a darkened flight of steps, you were quickly grabbed and pinned to the ground by a pretty strong knee to the side of your neck and the barrel of a gun poking the space just behind your eyeball! Hell of an introduction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont be making any sounds,\" said a voice with a hint of a Kentucky-esque accent spoke coldly to you, \"dont go making any moves. You just sit right there and wait, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Dennis! You cant keep doing that! Youre gonna break his neck!\" shouted a random voice in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I aint gonna break his neck! I aint even gonna leave a mark on it!\" snapped your shadowed attacker.<br>\r\n\u201cUrgghh! Do you have to do this EVERY fucking time?!\u201d the other voice snaps, \u201cif you end up hurting him bad, youre gonna sabotage the whole thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time, I'm a freaking professional! I know what I'm doing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d a third voice shouted in the darkness. The deep gruff voice that you heard on the phone. You could hear the guitar strumming get closer. Not much later, you could see a much older slightly shaggy bearded garbed man in all black approach you, strumming that guitar like he was born to rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped his strumming and leaned down at you, getting a good look with those pearly blue eyes that looked more fitting on a man half his age.<br>\r\n\u201cLet him up,\u201d he ordered 'Dennis' who obliged, yanking you back up on your feet by your collar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand that you are [Y/N], correct?\u201d the old grizzled masked rocker asked.<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d you asked him.<br>\r\n\u201cYoure a part of our community. It's my job to know,\u201d he answered, \u201cI'm also well aware of the great service you've done to our community shortly after that horrible outbreak. Which is why it sickens me to see you treated so horribly for your commendable efforts\u2026 by THEM.\u201d<br>\r\n*TWWWWIIIINNGG!* He hit that string so hard, that twang echoed across the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need your help,\u201d the guitarist sets down his guitar, \u201cthe world is in worse shape than it's ever been and it's only a matter of time before Eurasia wipes us out.\u201d He didnt need to remind you about. \u201cAnd your slave masters are ready to capitalize on our corpses when it happens.\u201d He needed to remind you about that!<br>\r\n\u201cI'm\u2026 not sure you I understand what youre talking about.\u201d You quickly heard snickers about you. They could see through your bullshit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm pretty sure you do,\u201d he states, \u201cif I were you, I wouldnt be quick to rush into that marriage proposal.\u201d You sucked in air through your teeth hearing him say that. \u201cWhatever horror movies you've been watching in your cozy prison arent gonna nearly as creative as what SHE'LL have in store for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's Iris got to do with this?\u201d you question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA whole plot arc, actually,\u201d he tells you (almost breaking the 4th wall!), \u201cbut we dont have much time. Considering you didnt jump at the opportunity of selling out your humanity, you might still of great use to our community and our kind.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d you question.<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little leaking of classified high-leveled intel, nothing major,\u201d he says like it's not that big of a deal, \u201cthere's a tightly sealed disc in a locked safe in your mistress's office. It needs to be shared. To the rest of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's on the disc?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cInformation regarding a weapon of unparalled mass destruction,\u201d he answers, \u201cthe sooner it's out of the claws of the Mechanical Mass Murderers, the safer every living breathing organic creature on this planet will become.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this guy for real? Is he seriously asking you to raid Iris's office, break into her safe, and steal a CD that may or may contain really really bad stuff?! As much as you dont trust Repliforce, are you really gonna just blindly trust these shady guys and sell out Iris?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cant do that,\u201d you tell him, \u201cI'm practically monitored 24/7, there's no way I could do something like that without them knowing.\u201d You pause to take a breath, \u201cBesides, Iris is my friend and my commanding officer. As odd as she is, there's no way I can betray her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear snickers in the darkness followed by an 'Aw, this poor sucker,' muttered under Dennis's breath. But the elder member doesnt seem rattled. Hell, he picked this as an opportune time to fine tune his guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you need convincing,\u201d he says as he adjusts the strings, \"you see that DVD on the counter over there?\" A light suddenly shined on a counter with a tv, dvd player, and dvd, \"pop it in the DVD paper.\"<br>\r\n\"What's on it?\"<br>\r\n\"Watch and see,\" he answers, casually tuning the strings. You stare at him in silence for a few seconds, but then head on over to the counter. You pick up DVD and take a quick look on it. It was a DVD-R with your name scratched on it with a sharpie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pop it in the DVD player and hit and play.</span></div></div>",

Inwardly, she thought, 'The first man to be genuinely interested in me and not a bad guy? all mine... all mine...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Shantae let you go, You went to get your caravan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fists curled as she muttered, \"No one else will have him, unless I deem it. Not Sky, not RottyTops.... and especially not you Risky Boots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShntae recalled how Bolo easily let Risky Boots into Dribble Fountain for a simple kiss. After taking a deep breath, she said, \"I'm gonna have to make sure his eyes won't stray...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou led your trusty horse and the caravan it pulled to the Lighthouse, where Shantae waved at the door. As you began to carry your things, she said, \"I'm sorry that your room is in the basement, but it did have the emptiest room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm living with the cutest girl I've ever met. It's a small price to pay,\" you answered as you entered the lighthouse and went into the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of your eye, you noticed Shantae leering at you. You blushed, but continued your task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done moving your stuff into the basement, You said, \"Well, I could finish, but let's get that date underway, Shantae!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae blushed before she said...</span></div></div>",

Ah just love computers and how information is stored on them!\" Dixie cooed as she leaned forward in a way that had her breasts shaking. \"But I love how hard you're getting for lil' ol' me even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and cursed how your now-teenage body was reacting to her attractive body. You took a deep breath and said, \"You won't get away with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. After you passed out, I possessed you and had your body sign some important papers that made me in charge if you just 'vanished' for an extended vacation,\" Dixie said. \"Then I did the de-age special on you. Ah then got my friends to do the data stuff and got them agree to help me keep you save from all the nasty human women who might want to have their dirty ol' ways with my darlin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if your friends decide to have their way with me?\" You asked, hoping for ghost civil war of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We set boundaries. Ah go first for every-thang and no one gets preggers but me,\" Dixie answered before tackling you back onto the bed. \"Now for some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to demand answers, but all that did was allow Dixie to once again stick her tongue in your mouth. She took off her white business suit, probably by ghosting it off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out some panicked whines as you felt the tip of your dick rub against her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDixie giggled before she impaled herself on you. She felt as warm as a human woman down there.</span></div></div>",

Most ended in an hour because of... incidents, but eventually, you got a job doing some gardening. Most of the work was replanting because Toons blew up their lawns for various reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit of a success, allowing Toons to focus their attention elsewhere. You did get a few toons who were quite... grabby, like Holly Would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your regulars was Jessica Rabbit, though she merely watched you perform yardwork and clean the pool. You expected her to wear something sexy, but she wore a bathrobe that did the impossible and hid her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first few weeks, she mostly just drank, never smiled, and didn't speak a word as you worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, you asked what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my bunny-wunny ran off, trying to find work. That was 70 years ago. Even after the Ink and Paint Club shut down, I still get... work, depending on how you see cameos and artwork,\" Jessica muttered. \"And after I did my best to clear his name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do wish I could help you like how you wanted, but all I can do is provide an ear for your troubles and to be here every day,\" You said as you cleaned the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit unnerved when she stared at you with surprise. More-so when she stayed silent until you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Jessica did research on you, finding out every bit of detail about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Jessica wore a purple two-piece bikini that seemed like it was straining to stay on her. She gave you a smile that gave you a boner. She seemed... revived somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, you got a date with a human girl and even went out with her! Thanks to the money you got from your job, you could go to actual restaurants with her over the next few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica kept dressing in various erotic outfits whenever you worked. she even had moments where you accidentally bumped into either her boobs or butt. There was even a time where you and her fell over with her on top. You swore she was about to kiss you. She only stopped when you said you had a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for the next day after that last incident, your girlfriend to dump you, right in front of everyone at your school. She even spread rumors that made girls laugh at you when you passed by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you went to your part-time job, Jessica was curious at why you were so sad. So you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did, Jessica thought, '<i>So I bribed the right girl. She played my new lover like a fiddle like I told her, thus putting a wedge between him and human girls. Now to make him mine...'</i></span></div></div>",

I'd like to not talk about it,\" You answered. \"So... shall I get to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty nodded. But when you turned around to walk around the house, Betty gave your ass a spank. You looked back and all she said was, \"What? you were a naughty boy by being almost late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to take it in stride, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you took the reel push mower. Betty Boop liked the classics, as she is one, despite still looking in her early twenties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty showed up, dressed in a blue one-piece swimsuit. She was curvier than you remembered. Betty ogled you, as you were dressed in swimming trunks and a tanktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you mowed the lawn and put away the mower, you took the pool skimmer and used it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidway, you felt boobs pressed against your back and dainty hands slip into your trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Boop?\" You asked with a slight squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, Call me Betty. I thought I was not a jealous woman, but when I saw You and Jessica going at it like ah-min-nals, I got angry. I need to show you that I am a woman too. I was a sex symbol before she was,\" Betty answered before she spun you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had you lean back until you were a foot or so from the ground, only preventing you from falling with only one hand. With a smile, Betty Boop kissed you on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also straddled your hips and grinded her swimsuit-covered pussy against your crotch. She had her eyes closed and made pleased moaning noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't do anything. Whether it was because because she was a toon and you were scared of her, Jessica was a toon and was a yandere who owned you and you were scared of her, or because you had a feeling this was going to be a common occurrence today, you had no idea.</span></div></div>",

You reached the peak of the Mountain and were greeted with a beautiful sight. \"Wow this is beautiful! Thanks for bringing me up here Jessica.\" You say with a smile. \"I'm glad you enjoyed the sight.\" Jessica said with a voice as sweet as honey.<br>\r\nThe two of you set up the blanket and the food as the two of you ate you realize that she made some of your favorite snacks and foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jessica stayed silent most of the time and seemed to be starting at you the entire time. After the meal you say \"You're a really good cook Jessica.\" \"Well I'm glad you enjoyed it but there's something I'd like to show you.\" She said as she went into the woods causing you to follow her in curiosity a little while later the two of you stumbled across a small waterfall. \"So this is what you wanted to show me I gotta admit this is very pretty.\" You say.  \"Oh no that's not what I wanted to show you.\" She responds \"Then what is it you wanted to show me?\" \"This.\" Jessica said before dropping her shorts much to your arousal she then proceeded to take off the rest of her clothes before diving into the water. \"So what are you waiting for darling? come and join me!\" Jessica said in a seductive tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Work became a drag. Paperwork soon became something that felt like a Sisyphean effort. Shizune's happiness felt like it was mocking Tsunade's loneliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that last thought, Tsunade realized that she might be wanting to get back in a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, to prevent them from dying like Dan, Tsunade would prevent them from leaving the village, and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she looked around for a bit and found someone to her dating specifications. Under a Transformation Ninjutsu, she dated them for a few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe claimed it was for information gathering, but soon, she spent more time with the person. For a time, she was willing to give up both sake and the Hokage position to stay with them... until she realized that that would put her under their protection and control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade decided that she wanted to be in control. That the person needed her protection more than she needed theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo her next action was to work out and design a secret high-level order that prevented the male from ever leaving the village, claiming they were necessary to keep the Hokage's mental state stable.  She shared the order with a few people, who did things that could better convince the rest of the village to obey the order when the order would be revealed to the village. The fact that a couple of people were killed to better convince some of the clan heads was of little consequences to Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was to have some very trusted sealmakers to design a seal that would allow her to fill the sealed one with either pleasure or pain at her choice. Then on one of her disguised dates, she secretly slapped the seal on her loved one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the moment where she called for her loved one to a meeting, with a few clan heads to be the witnesses.

Her frown turned upside down as she said, \"Harunos, make room for the Hokage hindquarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mebuki and Sakura looked at their leader with surprised gasps. Sakura said, \"but Lady Hokage-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I stutter, Sakura Haruno?\" Tsunade asked with a slight glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, Lady Hokage,\" Sakura quickly answered as she and Mebuki moved their rears to the sides and back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMebuki grumbled, but merely hoped she'd have a chance to share your bed alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath as Tsunade moved her butt right in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for this meal, Lord Y/N?\" Tsunade asked as she wiggled her behind closer and closer towards your face, still covered in her dark bluish-grey pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade, I-\" You said before she covered your face with her large ass. <i>'Oh my god. If this keeps up, then I'll be reduced to their sex slave.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsume angrily sighed before she asked, \"Forgive me for asking, but are you going to do this for every one of our times with Lord Y/N, Tsunade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggling Tsunade answered, \"Only if I get interested enough to, Tsume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsume sarcastically said, \"Great. Now we'd have to make sure we don't make our session with Lord y/N aren't too interesting if we want to keep them to ourselves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade giggled as she reached down and began to give your erection a handjob. She asked, \"Alright, Ladies. Who wants to drink his cream?\"</span></div></div>",

A lot had gone on in the past few years, the Goddesses returned to GameIndustry, CPU candidates were born, all that stuff (Basically peaceful time after the game Candidates were Introduced). You were one of the few NPC's that actually had a unique body and face, and you were considered handsome by many of the people around you. You had even gotten a few off hand compliments from Goddesses visiting Planeptune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough recently, you had gotten the feeling that someone was following you. You tried to report it to the police and they ignored you. You tried to catch the person following you, but that didn't work either. You had started to get so paranoid that you didn't leave your house without your top tier sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, as you were heading to work at the Basilicom, the home of Purple Heart and Purple Sister, A beautiful girl walked up to you seductively, although it was a common occurance, you had never met someone so beautiful. Your face gained a sudden blush, and you sprinted away, knowing that getting caught in that trap would only lead to trouble.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen you stopped sprinting, you felt the presence of the stalker. You pretended not to notice, but managed to turn around fast enough to where you caught a glimpse of the stalker out of the corner of your eye. All you managed to see was the color purple, but that was the only hint you had ever gotten to the stalkers identity, so you considered it a win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your guard up the rest of the way, but the stalker never came back, or at least you couldn't feel them come back. You entered the Basilicom at record speeds, mostly due to the sprint from before. Your fellow employee's raised an eyebrow at your sweaty state, but decided that it was better to ignore it. You walked into the elevator and pulled out a key, before pushing into it's appropriate slot and bringing you up to the top of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, NPC's wouldn't be allowed near the top of the tower, but you were given special permission from the Goddess herself, Purple Heart or, as she preferred for you to call her, Neptune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened one day when you were working your boring job in a cubicle among the many floors when Purple Heart in her human form skipped into the room. The atmosphere had tightened as everyone moved to make themselves look busy and competent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were typing, you noticed Purple Heart walk in between cubicles, checking on everyone's work, before she stopped at your desk, a blush prominent on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, buckaroo? What's your name?\" Purple Heart asked in a cheery voice, although you could sense some other emotion besides happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Y/N, just a regular worker here\" You replied, giving the most tame response as to try not to draw attention to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well buddy, you aren't a regular worker anymore!\" Purple Heart exclaimed, confusing literally everyone on the floor. \"I want you to be my personal attendant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but why, my Lady? I'm just a regular person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want you to be my personal attendant! Is there something wrong with that? You'll work the same hours but you'll earn more money, and the work is much less boring than office work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm honored my lady, I would be glad to accept\" As you spoke those words, you saw Purple Hearts eye's light up in glee, before she jumped and encircled her legs and arms around your chest. She was quite a bit smaller then you in her human form, so it didn't take much effort to hold her up, but the major issue was two things. One, literally everyone on the floor was glaring at you, and two, your brain had literally been on the verge of shutting down due to the feeling of the Goddesses \"peaks\" on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurple Heart stayed attached, leaving everyone in an awkward silence, before you decided to break that silence. \"Lady Purple Heart? Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Purple Heart squeeze harder, before replying to you \"Nope, you call me Neptune now, I won't accept anything else!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood even more dumbfounded then before. Very rarely did the Goddesses allow mortals to call them by their normal name alone, and that was almost always because that person was a close friend of theirs. You heard Purple He... Neptune call up to you from her perch on your chest. \"Carry me to my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded back \"How do I get there Lady Neptune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune responded back the directions, and you walked awkwardly out of the office, ignoring all the glares send at you by jealous   co-workers. Neptune dropped from her perch on your chest when you entered the elevator in order to insert a key, before she circled around you and jumped on your shoulders, her natural strength giving her more than enough momentum to jump that high. You felt Neptunes thighs squeeze against the sides of your head, leaving you to blush and slam your mouth shut the rest of the way up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your second day, and considering it was near the end of your hours when Neptune brought you up, you left without seeing any other occupants of the upper levels of the basilicom. When the Elevator door opened at last, you saw....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Purple Sister, preparing to leave to do some missions.<br>\r\nB: Histoire, the Oracle of Planeptune<br>\r\nC: No one, leaving you to travel to Neptunes Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were confused as to why the entire area looked completely uninhabited until you remember what Neptune had told you yesterday before you left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had said that her sister leaves really early in the morning for quests and that the Oracle Histoire would be asleep at those early hours. That was actually part of the reason she wanted you to come at 5 in the fucking morning. Like, you weren't gonna say no because this was a job with amazing benefits and pay but still, 5 in the morning is horrendous. Thankfully, you had gone to sleep early to actually have energy to keep up with the hyperactive goddess because based on the 2 hours you knew her personally, she was extremely hyperactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked through the hall and stood in front of a door with a plaque above it reading Neptune. Granted, you didn't need this plaque to find her room as she had led you to it before, she didn't let you in though, saying 'I gotta change stuff in my room before you come in!' and then kicking you out of the Basilicom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The door opened by itself, spurred on by the sensor beside the plaque. You are instantly greeted with an abundance of purple. Past the purple you saw a bunch of TV's, all of them bigger then you had ever seen a TV be. Beside them were a bunch of Consoles hooked up and beanbag chairs. There was also a regular table in the corner with a bunch of normal chairs, probably for more serious meetings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a Purple Queen sized bed, fitting for the current occupant of said bed. Neptune was currently curled up and sleeping in the large bed. The shocking thing, however, was that there was a second bed right next to hers. You tried to justify it by saying it was for other people but everyone else who lived in the Basilicom has their own room. You pushed the question to the back of your mind and approached the sleeping Goddess, covered by the soft-looking blankets that were, just like the rest of the room, purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you approached her bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Neptune grabs your arm in her sleep and, with her far superior strength pulls you in and then hugs you like a doll. <br>\r\nB: You were able to successfully wake up Neptune, who then explained that the extra bed was indeed for you as an \"added benifit\"<br>\r\nC: Nepgear opens the door and assumes the worst when she sees a man approaching her sleeping sister. She takes you down and ties you up. She sees your face and your struggling and suddenly awakens as a closet dominatrix. </span></div></div>",

Neptune was apparently a heavier sleeper than you realized, your soft words had no discernible effect at all to get her to wake up. Looks like you had to do something else, but what though? Maybe you could wait until Neptune wakes up herself, that second bed looks like it could be a comfortable spot to wait. Deciding to go for a bolder option you went closer to Neptune's bed, and once you were close enough you reached out to the sleeping goddess and tried to gently shake her awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune's serene expression had soon into one of slight irritation, the more forceful approach seemed to be working. While you were busy trying to shake her Neptune had suddenly reached out a hand to you, and before you could react she pulled you down to the bed with her and had wrapped her arms around you. Once you had snapped out of your momentary surprise at what had happened you tried to break out of Neptune's hold on you, this had the opposite effect of what you intended. She tightened her bear hug of you which pressed you against her body even more, you blushed as you felt Neptune's petite breasts pressed against you. Realizing that any further struggling on your part would just cause her to tighten her hug you kept still, Neptune's irritated expression had changed into one even more blissful than earlier. Even though you tried your best, you eventually drifted off to sleep yourself. </span></div></div>",

This was bad, If she thought you were trying to take advantage of her while she was asleep you were fucked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Before you do anything I can explain\" you quickly sputtered out. <br>\r\nNeptune had shushed you with one finger, and once she was sure you would stay quiet she spoke. \"I understand, I must've overslept since I've stayed up so late last night and you were trying to wake me up\" the purple goddess said with a smile. You were relieved that you had avoided getting a beat-down though now you wanted to know what had kept Neptune up so late, so you asked her. Oh it's nothing\" she said trying to hide the embarrassment she felt \"I was just chatting with my sister\". There was probably more to that chat than Neptune was letting but you didn't press her further, instead you talked to her about another question you wanted an answer to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neptune who does that second bed right next to yours belong to\" you had a hunch at who it was intended for but you wanted her confirmation. \"It's yours, since you're my personal attendant you can stay here with me\" Neptune said excitedly. \"And before you raise concerns about your previous home don't worry, I've arranged for that to be taken care of\" she continued. So along with your promotion from your boring cubicle job to personally working with your nation's goddess and you had gotten a new home to go with it, this was a lot to take in for you.</span></div></div>",

There's likely to be different sorts of requests down the line, but we'll get to that. Beyond that just playing games with me is fine, as it gets boring around here without Nepgear, and Histoire is a big grump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to her. \"That seems reasonable.

If you do, there will be punishments in place. Beyond that, there aren't any more rules unless I come up with one later. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just one.

Ahhhh~\" she sighed out as she pressed herself against you. you could feel the softness of her large DD-cups pushed against your chest, you tried not to think with your lower muscle but that fail as your erect appendage did pressing of it's own against her soft cheeks as she sat down your thighs where it wedged between her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"you were everything I thought you to be.\" she whispered to herself but you heard her and tried not to imagen what you did last night that you couldn't even remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n but little did you know that what you were thinking didn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n but in actuality all she did was drug you and strip you of your clothing until you were butt naked, and there she stripped herself and climbed into bed with your naked form where she felt and grinded her own form against you, feeling you up from every inch including your dick that she marvelled at as she gave your unconscious body a good hand job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n after that she fell asleep with you as her new pillow that she slept against blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n back with you, you now wondered what happens next after all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nami groggily opened her eyes, confused as to what had actually happened to her. A very brief check made it obvious that she was tied tightly to a chair in some unknown location with a creepy black-haired man staring at her excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it! A kidnapping! She shouldn\u2019t have gone shopping all on her own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmph!\u201d Her instinctive scream for help made the navigator painfully aware of the thick cloth that was currently cramped inside her mouth. And from the feeling of it, a big strap of tape was sealing her lips together as well. Bloody great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou finally woke up, Cat Burglar Nami, that is wonderful\u201d her captor started amused. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be nearly as much fun twisting your mind while you are unconscious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph! Mmmh Mmmh Mph!\u201d Nami protested angrily behind her gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver since I first laid eyes on your wanted poster, I knew that I had to have you. And now, after all this time of planning and tracking, I finally got you right where I want you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man slowly walked over to her, rubbing his gloved hands together in excitement. Everything about him basically screamed \u201ccrazy stalker\u201d. And based on his words she was his main target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ate a very interesting Devil Fruit\u201d her captor explained with a sick grin all over his face. \u201cWith only one touch of my hand I can make people completely and utterly obsessed with whatever they are looking at in that moment. A ship, an apple, a book, another person, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is. I can make them desire it more than anything else, I can make them go crazy and destroy everything in their path in order to obtain and keep the item they saw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami used his monologue to struggle against her bonds, but the rope work was really good. That guy definitely knew what he was doing and she didn\u2019t like it one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am wearing these gloves to prevent any accidental use of my powers. After all, I like to be in full control at all times.\u201d With exaggerated movements the kidnapper slowly pulled off one of the gloves and waved his bare hand in front of her face. \u201cI am making you mine, Cat Burglar Nami. One touch and you will be totally obsessed with me, I will become your new purpose in life, your one and only. All your struggles will be gone in an instant, replaced by the burning desire to stay with me forever. Can you already see it? Because I definitely can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer captor erupted into an insane laughter, truly scaring the tied up pirate girl by now. Nami was convinced that he was not bluffing. She had enough experience to know how crazy Devil Fruit powers could be and that a single touch of his hand was most likely enough to rewrite her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut every Devil Fruit had a weakness. That guy just said it himself. She would be obsessed with whatever she was looking at in that moment. So what if she looked at nothing? It was worth a try and there were not really many other options left. Taking a deep breath to calm herself down, she closed her eyes completely, allowing the darkness to take over her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her newfound confidence was quickly shattered as she heard the man speak to her again. \u201cIt is no use, my dear. My powers affect you even while your eyes are closed. In that case you simply get obsessed with the first thing you see after reopening them. And trust me on this one, I will make sure that it is me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. So she somehow had to keep her eyes closed until someone would miraculously show up to rescue her. Not very likely. But it couldn\u2019t end like that. She was a proud member of the Strawhat Pirates, there was no way she was going down so easily. Not without a proper fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning up all her strength, Nami renewed her struggles against the bonds, making the chair shake a bit in the process. Maybe it was because abandoning her vision had sharpened her other senses, but she was suddenly hit with the realization that one of the chair legs was shorter than the other ones by a tiny amount. That was all the opening she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStruggle all you want, in just a few more seconds you will be all mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami ignored the creep, totally focused on shaking the chair as much as she can. It took her a few more attempts, but right before he could touch her she managed to create enough force to make the chair fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hitting the floor with an acceptable loud crash. Sadly, neither her bonds nor the chair itself took any significant damage from the fall. But that would not stop her from even more struggling. As long as she kept her eyes closed, there was still a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami could basically feel how her crazy captor slowly leaned over her, clearly enjoying her helplessness. \u201cGame over, my precious Cat Burglar\u201d he hissed into her ear right before his hand touched her upper arm, infecting her with his unique possession powers. Damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Is someone there?\u201d a new voice suddenly reached her ears, filling the navigator with hope. The voice clearly came from further away, but it looked like someone somehow took notice of her crash and came to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d the kidnapper grunted in annoyance. She could hear hasty movements as well as two ripping sounds right before something sticky was pressed upon her closed eyes. It didn\u2019t take a genius to realize that this creep had just taped her eyelids shut to prevent her from opening her eyes without his consent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust give me another minute, I have to take care of some unwanted guest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami knew that this was her prime opportunity to try and free herself, but for some reason she was too curious to see how things would play out, so she put a stop to her futile attempts and instead listened closely to what was about to happen with the newcomer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone there? I know I heard something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInsolent brat! I will make you regret peeking around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighting noise was loud but also over quickly. Whoever won didn\u2019t had any trouble taking out his opponent. After what felt like an eternity of silence to the tied up Stawhat member a quite weak \u201cHow\u2026 Who\u2026 are you\u2026?\u201d from her captor\u00b4s voice finally released the tension. The newcomer had won. She was about to get saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief flooded trough her entire body. It appeared like a fairy tale, the hero showing up just in the nick of time to save the damsel in distress from the crazy bad guy. Only that this right now was reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u00b4t believe it\u2026\u201d her saviour announced right after she heard him step into the room. \u201cGood thing I trusted my gut and came here. Hold still, I am going to cut you free this instance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever that guy was, he followed up his words with actions, and before Nami realized it the ropes were falling off and she could properly move her body again. In gentleman style he then helped her sitting up before carefully peeling off the tape from both her lips and eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened here? Are you all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting the cloth out of her mouth, Nami instinctively turned towards her saviour as she opened her eyes for the first time since she was affected by that particular Devil Fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rescued Strawhat navigator realized what she was doing, it was already far too late. The image of her saviour burned itself deep into her mind, together with a massive desire to be with him, to keep him, to crush anything and everything that would dare to stand between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCongratulations! Nami is now officially your Yandere!</span></div></div>",

You finally arrived at Duel Academy, the prestigious school for what was without a doubt the most important and influential card game to ever exist. Somehow you even managed to end up in the best of the three dorms, Obelisk Blue. It was a dream coming true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver your enormous excitement to be on the island and prove to everyone that you would be the next King of Games, you actually managed to miss the end of Chancellor Sheppard\u00b4s welcoming speech and quickly found yourself lost straight on day one. What a start...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need some help to get to our dorm? I can lead you there if you want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see a tall and beautiful girl with long blonde hair and hazel eyes. Her white and blue uniform clearly intentified her as an Obelisk student. Well, seems like your situation was a blessing in disguise as it would allow you to get to know one of cute females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, that would be very nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her lead as the two of you started a small innocent conversation. For some reason she was very interested in who you are and what playstyle you prefer. You answered honestly and asked several questions on your own, not knowing that Alexis already knew everything about you from the very beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she first laid eyes on you during the examination duels, Alexis knew that she had to have you, so she gathered as much information as possible about your life. She prepared a dozen plans on how to quickly capture your heart at the start of the new semester, but never thought such a golden opportunity would present itself on the very first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlexis, are you sure we are going the right way?\u201d you asked concerned as she led you deeper and deeper into the woods. You got too distracted by the conversation to notice it sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually want to convince myself first that you truly belong into Obelisk Blue\u201d she replied and before you realized it, the charming blonde had suddenly turned around and activated her Duel Disk. \u201cLet us have a duel to decide your worth. If you win I will not only lead you to our dorm, but agree to become your permanent guide and girlfriend. But if you lose you have to fulfill any request I have for the rest of the semester. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was ridiculous. Why would you ever agree to such crazy terms? Oh right, the dueling credo to never back down from a challenge. You didn\u2019t want to break that on the first day at Duel Academy, did you? Well, here goes nothing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right Alexis, I will teach you not to underestimate me.

And I know exactly which one I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA malicious grin spread across her cute face as she searched for the very special card that she put into her deck specifically for this duel. She didn\u2019t even know such a card existed or why someone would feel the need to create it in the first place, but that didn\u2019t matter right now. She managed to get her hands on this very unique spell and now she was going to use it to get her guy. He had no idea what was about to hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBehold! I activate the field spell <i>Yandere Girl\u00b4s Paradise</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Alexis placed the card into her Duel Disk, a pink mist started to spread all across the surrounding area, creating a dome around them that trapped both duelists inside of it. Slowly but surely pictures formed on these new encircling mist walls, all of them showing you in different private situations as if they were taken from a stalker girl. Did those pics really exist or was it just an illusion from the card? Either way, it was creepy as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis marvellous field spell increases the ATK of all female monsters on the field by 500 points as well as making them unaffected by opposing monster effects\u201d Alexis explained blissfully as her current warrior lady received a small power boost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Etoile Cyber 1700 ATK</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course my field spell also has some other tricks available, but I don\u2019t want to spoil all the surprises. No worries, you will find out in due time. For now, I set these two cards face down and end my turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, this duel just turned a lot tougher than you thought it would. If you play too carelessly, that mysterious field spell you have never heard of before could easily destroy you. On the other side, the quicker you finish Alexis off, the less opportunities she has to abuse it\u00b4s powers. Was it worth the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly forming a plan based on the opening hand, you started your first move.</span></div></div>",

Most didn't think she could become a super saiyan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose comments stopped the moment she became a Super Saiyan... and then entered the Legendary Super Saiyan state before attacking her former bullies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Saiyans listened when she taught.. or tried to. Shyness doesn't vanish in one day, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Y/N, and never mocked Kale. You listened intently and did as she explained, briefly becoming a Super Saiyan. You make sure to shower her with complements, making her blush and look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when a girl complemented you, Kale's shy expression was replaced by a glare, one that said, 'I will kill you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Caulifla saw you could become a Super Saiyan, she decided to test you in a spar with only Kale watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spar was... interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to actually fight, but you kept tripping. Your kept winding up either groping Caulifla's ass or boobs, or wound up with your head in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt best, you were never hit by Caulifla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you got up from Caulifla for the tenth time, she said with a grin, \"Interesting fightning style. What do you call it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhn, I just learned how to throw a punch,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-ho! A fresh canvas! Mind if Kale and I take you under our wings?\" Caulifla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I'd love to call you and Kale Senseis!\" You happily exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Kale, Caulifla asked, \"Kale! Want this guy as a student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKale was surprised for a moment before pure glee came over his face and cheered, \"Yes! Yes! Yes, Caulifla!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaulifla looked at you and said, \"So, just tell your parents and we'll get started on your training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... live alone. My parents died,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Caulifla uttered with surprise before grinning, \"Even better...We'll move in with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You asked with enough glee to have stars appear in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaulifla put an arm around you and said, \"Sure! It'll be an experience you'll never regret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Caulifla rubbed her boobs against you, she released you. You said,\"I'll go clean my home up right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you left, Caulifla looked at Kale and said, \"Let's make him ours, Kale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As in... our mate?\" Kale nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Student, mate, husband, whatever. He needs to be ours, no one else's,\" Caulifla said with a serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKale returned the serious look and nodded.</span></div></div>",

After school ended you decided to check your phone to see any updates on social media only to bump into Ayano Ashi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry about that Yan-Chan I wasn't watching were I was going.\" You apologize instinctively. \"Oh no! It's okay Y/N Kun besides I was looking for you.\" Ayano said before pulling two movie tickets out of her bag. \"I was planning on going to the movies with a friend but she got sick so I decided to offer the invitation to you.\" She said. \"Oh thanks I guess I could come i dont really have any plans for tonight.\" You say taking one of them only to feel a sticky substance on your ticket you look down to see something red on it. \"Huh what is this stuff is this blood?\" You ask concerned. \"Huh oh no it's just jam I spilled on it this morning i thought i got all of it off guess i was wrong.\" She laughed awkwardly \"Oh um okay see you later I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and waved as you walked down the hill.

She knew that no matter what she must have you and keep any other girl away from you even if that meant killing them if it meant having you to herself.  After killing her latest rival and stealing the movie tickets meant for her and you she figured to get a use out of them and try to interact with you for the first time in weeks well up close at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has stalked you over the weeks stealing some of your personal belongings for her shrine to you. \"Glad that those movie tickets were actually useful. Now then I have to make sure I'm picture perfect.\" She thought as her smile became more fake.</span></div></div>",

Things like robbing the bank, blowing up a train that transports Eridium, and fighting the sheriff of the town. So, y'know, nothing new to a badass Vault Hunter such as yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupposedly the Sheriff was, once upon a time, a Vault Hunter that helped bring Handsome Jack into power. She's also, apparently, Jack's girlfriend. Killing her won't bring you and the Crimson Raiders any closer to putting Jack in the dirt, but hey - it'll be a good fight either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Brick wants you to scope out the town's bank. Best get to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Meanwhile, in northern Lynchwood</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha... what a productive day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boots kicked up on the old hardwood desk, Nisha is relaxing after a long day of introducing some lawbreakers to the Lynchwood gallows. All the confidence in the world didn't matter when you have a noose wrapped around your neck, and Nisha was fond of watching people draw their last breath. The dark-skinned gunslinger has her wide-brimmed hat resting on her face to keep Pandora's sun from irritating her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trio of knocks on Nisha's office door disturbs her brief moment of solace. She lets out a soft growl, instinctively reaching for the digistruct holster strapped to her right hip. Bandits wouldn't just casually knock on her door, and the only person brave and/or stupid enough to do so would be her deputy, Winger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hat properly on her head, Nisha calls out, \"Better not be wasting my time, Winger! What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinger enters, and Nisha can tell the deputy is nervous. Good. He knows his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got word a Vault Hunter j-just arrived, ma'am - he's s-shootin' up Main Street as w-we speak!\" Deputy Winger stutters out, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else but Nisha's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-skinned gunslinger quirks an inquisitive eyebrow, then turns her gaze to the CCTV monitor on her desk. Sure enough, some merc - one with rugged facial features, she noted offhandedly - is gunning down bandits like there's no tomorrow. No doubt he's allied with the anti-Hyperion resistance. Aside from the Eridium train, nothing of value to Hyperion is in Lynchwood... so why would a lone Vault Hunter start shooting up her town?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Ooooh, I know <b>why</b> he's out here trying to get my attention,'</i> Nisha muses to herself with a grin, thoughts turning sinister and possessive. <i>'He obviously needs a woman who's loyal, unlike those <b>sluts</b> in Sanctuary.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how should Nisha go about making you hers?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The duel for the Regional Championship was about to come to a close. With less than a thousand life-points remaining on both sides, your 2400 Attack point Jinzo alone facing down your opponent Ali's Great Beast Angra Mainyu with his 2800 Attack points, you were running out of exits. Your trump card, Dark Magician, had already taken a swan dive early and your hand is full of spell cards that woulda came in real handy for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something deep down was telling you not to give up. Something deep down was telling you to wipe that prideful smirk off Ali's face. Despite losing your best cards, that spark of hope and willpower was still fighting strong. You didnt know what card you had left that could save you, but you put your faith in that spark (or as some refer to as 'The Heart of The Cards') and draw your next card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...WHAT?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed down in disbelief at the card you just drawn. The Dark Magician Girl. A really really good card to pull right now. However, there's a slight issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont own a Dark Magician Girl. You NEVER owned a Dark Magician Girl! None of your backup decks contained Dark Magician Girls let alone the customized one you brought to the championship! How did this one end up in your deck? Did somebody sneak it in? Is it against the rules to have an undisclosed card you dont even own slipped into your deck during the competition? You dont know whether you should feel more worried that you found a card you dont own in your deck or that you broke a rule having a card you dont own in your deck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, what is taking so long?!\u201d Ali goaded you from the other side of the ring, \u201churry up, already! Are you ready to surrender and admit defeat or do you wish to provide Angra Mainyu with another sacrifice?\u201d<br>\r\nYou decide to question this anomaly later and get back to the duel.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Ali,\u201d you regain your confidence, \u201cI was just briefly stunned by the sheer beauty of the monster I'm about to summon to finish this duel!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBring him then!\u201d Ali demanded with pride, \u201che'll just be another stepping stone on my path of glorious conquest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not a 'him', Ali!\u201d you stated, \u201cI sacrifice my Jinzo to summon the Dark Magician Girl!\u201d<br>\r\nThe image of Jinzo on the VR grid vanishes and it's place appeared a glowing occultish seal as a feminine figure emerged from it. A blonde-haired woman in blue armor with a seal broach in the middle, wearing a blue Dark Magician helmet and a pink skirt, and brandishing a scepter capable of casting dark magic to destroy her enemies! She spun around and you nearly lost yourself in the twinkle in her sparkling emerald green eyes before snapping out of it just in time to plan your attack. The useless spell cards in your hand just became detrimental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, she certainly is a beauty, brother,\u201d Ali laughs, \u201cbut she still pales in comparison to a Great Beast!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, I aint done yet, 'brother'!\u201d you slap a spell card on the field, \u201cI activate Magician's Scepter. This gives DMG an extra 500 Attack Point boost and raises her level to 7. Combined that with the 300 AP boost with my Dark Magician in the graveyard and both our monsters are evenly matched\u2026 that is until I activate this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAli's arrogant grin disappeared as soon as he saw you activate the trap Resonance of Power. Thanks to DMG now being level 7, she gains an extra 800 AP boost!<br>\r\n\u201cThat puts her at 3600 attack points. You know what that means, Ali? Show him what it means, Dark Magician Girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong surge of dark magical power enveloped her scepter and aimed it toward the great beast.<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOOO!!!\u201d Ali shouted in horror as his Angra Mainyu was caught in the explosion, leaving absolutely nothing behind in the smoke\u2026 and taking his remaining 800 life points with it! When the smoke finally cleared, the only things left in front of you in that ring were the Dark Magician Girl and the defeated Ali who had dropped to the floor lowering his head in utter shame. Geez, you didnt think he'd take losing THIS bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWINNER AND THIS YEAR'S REGIONAL CHAMPION: [Y/N]!\u201d<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild for you. It was a proud day for you. All your hard work and training had finally paid off. You never felt so proud of yourself your whole life! Who cares if you won with a card you dont technically own and was mysteriously slipped into your deck? YOU WON!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as you were beginning to savor your epic victory, something incredibly unusual happened. The Dark Magician Girl on the VR grid actually turned around and smiled at you. Then she clapped along with the audience for you! None of the duel monsters on the VR grid have EVER done something like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked with your jaw dropping in disbelief just before her image disappears.<br>\r\n\u201cD-D-DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Ali groaned as he walked off with his head hung low, \u201cmy dreams of restoring the Great Persian Empire dashed to pieces? Yes, brother. I saw it clear as day...\u201d What is his problem?!<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it wasnt as big as yours. The cheers from the audience seemed drowned out as you stared at your new Dark Magician Girl Card\u2026 who youre pretty sure wasnt winking in her portrait earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite winning the championship, the anomaly bugged you all the way back to your hotel room. You couldnt sleep in preparation for the celebratory party tomorrow cuz of all the newbound stressed you developed. You spent hours sitting at a desk reviewing your decks, trying to remember when you ever picked up a DMG, but no such luck. No recollection whatsoever. Just looking at the card was making you uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duel Monster developers never made a winking Dark Magician Girl card as far as you know. Yet it's not fake, cuz the VR-grid wouldve detected counterfeits. Maybe it's a super rare card that was unreleased to the public? Even so, how did you manage to get your hands on it? Are you inadvertently breaking any laws just having it with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...\u201d you moan in frustration, \u201cthis is hopeless. I gotta go to bed.\u201d You'll just have to ponder the magical mystery tomorrow. So after putting your decks away, brushing your teeth, and changing into your pjs, you shut off the light, hop into bed and close your eyes, too tired to even bother pulling the covers over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...As a shadowy figure pulls the covers over you.</span></div></div>",

Every time you get off the mattress when you get up in the morning, your movement ripples through dang near EVERY single spring inside it setting them all off! Especially the ones under the woman in the Dark Magician Girl getup!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stealthy escape failed. Now that she's up with the chickens, you may as well put your guard up. You quickly jerk back around to face her and snake out the stun gun from the nearby drawer, holding it behind your back JUST IN CASE! Maybe it seems ridiculous going all super-defensive over some cute harmless looking girl in your room, but you read too many awful stories. You dont know this girl, which means you dont know anything about this girl. Especially what she's capable of! If she's a fan of yours, this fan doesnt seem to respect boundaries!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare coldly, trying to keep a straight face as sweat dripped from your brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe on the other hand was very casual. She let out a cute yawn and smiled your way, sitting on the edge of the bed, her butt mushing up your sleep-groove!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, master!\" the girl in the DMG suit greets you so warmly. Hang on a sec! 'Master'?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's.... 4 am...\" was the very first thing to come out of your mouth since you met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" she turns her head over to your alarm clock, \"oh it is! You'd better get back in here and finish your rest. You dont wanna be all groggy later on, do you?\" Screw it, just get to the point.<br>\r\n\"How did you get in here?!\" you questioned.<br>\r\n\"Um... I was always here,\" she answered so casually.<br>\r\n\"How did you get in my room?!\" you repeat yourself.<br>\r\n\"I just said! I was always here!\" she repeats herself. You rubbed your forehead. You take a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's start over,\" you change up the questions, \"who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"The Dark Magician Girl, at your service!\" she announced with such pride and admiration. You squint your eyes then gaze over at your deck. You reach for your brand new card (still gripping the stun gun tight behind your back just in case!) and stare hard at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look the Dark Magician Girl on the card then the Dark Magician Girl on your bed, giving off the same winking expression as the Dark Magician Girl on the card! Whoever this girl was, her costume had incredible attention to detail. Not only did the costume match, so the spikey waviness in her golden blonde hair The amount of hair mousse it took to pull that off mustve been... geez! You havent seen many Duel Monster cosplayers put as much careful work in their outfits as SHE did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" you hm impressed, \"that's an incredible costume you got there, lady. You look almost exactly like the girl on this card!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I AM the girl on that card,\" the enthusiastic cosplayer insists, \"That same girl that with a single wave of my trusty scepter, blew that nasty Great Beast away, winning you the duel AND the Regional Championship!\" She knows about the match.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you saw my match?\"<br>\r\n\"I did just SEE it, master,\" she tells you, \"you summoned me forth and gave me the added boost I needed to smite the awful Angra Mainyu once and for all!\" Ugh, she's keeping hard into character. You'd admire her tenacity if she didnt just break into your room and sneak into your bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm super glad you enjoyed my battle,\" you say to her, \"however, if you came for an autograph, this isnt the way to get it.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, master?\" she asks curiously, still referring to you her master, \"you must still be tired. Here, come back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. Time to change it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright lady,\" you get straight to the point, \"let's just cut the bs here. What are you doing in my room?\"<br>\r\n\"You summoned me, of course,\" the DMG cosplayer said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Just like that duel against Ali,\" she explained, \"just as your sheer willpower and unbridled faith in the Heart of Cards called me forth to protect you in that battle, so has it called me forth to protect you here. You have my solemn promise to protect you to the best of my capabilities, my master!\"<br>\r\nYou turned your head, having a hard time keeping a straight face, \"Uh... I think youre getting a little into your character there, lady.\"<br>\r\n\"This is more than character, master,\" the DMG girl continues as she puts her fist to her chest, \"this is the might and willpower of a proud honored high-ranked sorcerer of the Dark Arts known and revered since the Era of Akkad!\" She beams with pride, \"All who dare threaten my master shall face the ultimate judgement that is the Dark Magician Girl!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed. This was sounding a bit disturbing. Are you having another one of the dreams where you suddenly found yourself in the middle of a magical girl anime?! Thankfully not, because there's no grizzly bloodshot eyed monster smashing through the window and trying to abduct you.<br>\r\nSince THAT aint the case, maybe it's something else. Maybe it's a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, who set you up to this?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? Set me up?\"<br>\r\n\"It was Arthur, wasnt it?\" you call out, \"OK ARTHUR! YA GOT ME! GOOD ONE! YOU CAN COME ON OUT NOW!\" You open the bathroom door, then the closet, then look out the front door, \"ARTHUR?! THE JOKE'S OVER! COME ON OUT!\"<br>\r\nArhur wasnt around. And the DMG cosplayer was just staring silently at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got awkward real fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were having bad feelings. VERY bad feelings! But you didnt wanna believe them. This girl cant possibly be the real deal! She cant possibly be the same girl on the card that you... dont own and never owned to begin with! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cant possibly be the same girl in that VR grid that....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....turned to face you.... and clapped....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, master?\" she tilts her head, \"if youre feeling restless, it's not too late to come back in here and rest it off.\"</span></div></div>",

As if emphasizing that she is part of your team (despite never telling her that she was!) she even volunteered herself in the pleasantries thanking the party goers and shaking hands, ignoring their questionable looks.

How in the world does she not know what a quarter is? Is she really that clueless or just really that good at playing dumb for this prank? You're starting to wonder if she really is that girl on the card. Only to immediately scold yourself for believing that shes really the actual Dark Magician Girl. \"Here let me pay for you.\" You say as you put in two quarters and hit start for her. \"Select Your Hero!\" The game shouts \"Okay now you use the joystick and Select which of the three characters youd like to play.\" You explain to her. She moves her joystick twice to the third and only female hero. \"Now press one of the buttons.\" She presses the button causing the game to shout \"AMANDA!\" The game cuts to a street as the character jumps into frame \"STAGE ONE BEGIN!\" \"Okay then use the joystick to move and the buttons to punch or kick you can combine moves to do combos.\" You explain to her as she proceeds to play and fight the thugs on screen much to your suprise shes very good at it getting combos left and right and barely taking any damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man shes killing it!\" Slate said from behind startling you. \"Um yeah she is.\" You reply meekly. \"So how did you manage to meet a beautiful looking girl like her?\" Slate asks \"Oh! um... well....\" you say trying to come with a convincing cover story. \"Oh yeah! We meet at a duel championship a while back cosplaying as Athena she put so much detail into her outfit that it was hard not to look I asked her for a photo and we began talking and hit off still being very into character I might add.\" You say and look back at The DMG hoping she wasn't paying attention so she wouldn't correct you and blow your cover story. Luckily for you shes too obsorbed in the game to pay attention to what you were saying. \"Really do you still have the photo?\" \"Nah I lost it such a shame too it was really good.\" \"Bummer maybe she has a picture of it?\" \"No! I mean no she doesn't she recently moved and lost her collection of photographs of her cosplay outfits shes really upset about it so dont mention it to her.\" You explain. \"Ah okay well why dont we play a game or two with her?\" Slate says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure but shes bound to stay in character no matter what so dont bother asking her questions.\" You tell him as to not have him unravel your web of lies. \"Got it\" You feel a tug on your arm and turn to see 'Morgana' pulling at you \"Master can you please try this out with me!?\" She asked in an adorable tone. \"Try what out?\" \"That!\" She said pointing at Dancing rythem \"Please? Please? Pleaseeeee????!\" \"I uh don't really...\" Pleaseeeee????????\" She asked with puppy dog eyes making you feel somewhat guilty. \"Fine.\" You sigh \"Yay!\" She said as she pulled you towards the machine as you put in two quarters as the song begins to start.</span></div></div>",

For someone who clearly never had the opportunity to play any sort of Dance Dance Revolution-like game, she had quite the impressive footwork. After only a brief explanation of how the game worked which took no more than a minute, she had already mastered the game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGREAT! GREAT! GREAT! PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT! GREAT! PERFECT! PEPEPEPERFECT! That's all you could see when you snuck glances on the Dark Magician Girl cosplayer's side of the screen! It didnt help that you slipped up a few times, but only cuz you were distracted by how unbelievable well she was at timing her feet to the rhythm of the beats and arrows! By the end of 'Moves Like Jagger' by Maroon 5, you made out with a dang decent A ranking, but she came out with a perfect AAA grade!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, does AAA mean I did good?\" she innocently and naively asks you.<br>\r\n\"That's uh.... pretty much a perfect score,\" you said, still blown out of your mind, \"you SERIOUSLY never played this game before.\"<br>\r\nShe shook her head smiling with glee, \"Can we play another round, Master?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure,\" you stammer as you pulled out another 50 cents and put it into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAGAIN, this DMG-dressed stalked shocked and amazed you!  'Cake By the Ocean' by DNCE played, when you didnt peek glances at the screen, you could HEAR the loud rhythmic thumping of her feet on near perfect cue with the beats and the arrows! She didnt notice the odd stares you were giving as she rhythmic stamped her feet and even hummed the song along as she goes. When the song ended, again another AAA for her!<br>\r\nAt this time, there was a crowd forming watching her perform flawlessly with amazement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, who are Diddy and Naomi anyway?\" the DMG asked you, oblivious to her own rhythmical strength!<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" you quickly change the subject, \"anyways, I think other people wanna play this game now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I challenge her?!!\" asks one of the onlookers as he whips out a few quarters.<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Morgana shrugged her shoulders and says with a smile. As expected, it didnt take long her opponent to get schooled. No matter how hard he tried to move and how fast he attempted to get, he just couldnt catch up with Morgana's magical dancing feet! When Jessica Simpson's 'La La' ended, it was a no brainer who was the winner.<br>\r\n\"Damn, you were incredible, Morg!\" he complimented her, \"who taught you those sick moves?\"<br>\r\n\"That would be Lord Mahad, personal attendant to Pharoh Atem I,\" she nonchalantly answers, \"there was no finer dancer in all the Four Corners of the World that could rival HIS majestic feet!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... huh,\" he gives her a strange look before walking away, allowing ANOTHER challenger to enter the dance stadium. Didnt take long for the poor girl to get whipped by the champ Morgana. Not even the slower but still sick beat of 'Renegade' by Styx was enough to keep the DMG lookalive off her balance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time challenger #3 came around, you got a bit bored of the show and decided to sneak away from all the action while everybody else was distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt slip away from Slate, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... she's something!\" he scooted over to you and complimented your new uninvited guest, \"where the hell were you lucky enough to find this girl?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, I didnt. She found ME,\" you felt now would be an appropriate time to throw in a LITTLE truth, \"long story short, she sorta... snuck in my room one night despite the doors being locked and uh... well, she came off pretending to be my Dark Magician Girl.\"<br>\r\n\"Heh! For real?\" that got his attention. You bit your lip and nervously nodded. \"Oh, lord have mercy! I'm sure somebody made a hollywood horror movie that started out like that!\" TACT, SLATE! GEEZ!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm sure she's a good girl,\" Slate made a recovering statement, \"she'd have to be if youre still willingly with her! ....Uh... you ARE still <i>willingly</i> with her, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course! Of... uh....cour....se?\" you train of thought begun to change tracks as you noticed Morgana's eerily glowing aura surrounding her as she continued dancing. Does nobody else see that glow?! Are YOU seriously seeing that glow?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner do you notice that glow, you notice the OTHER glow coming from your pocket! The pocket with your deck in it, that is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems you werent the only one with an odd aura glow about you, however. Quite a few of the people here have odd glows emitting from their pockets or card holsters. Heck, while Slate was musing about godknowswhat, you notice the special card holster around his belt was glowing! He seriously doesnt notice it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOLY HELL WHERE DID THAT LION COME FROM??!!! Wait a minute! That's not a lion! It's a liger! An armored striped one-eyed liger sitting aside Slate as if keeping on watch as a bodyguard.<br>\r\n...Hang on, that looks like one of Slate's cards, the Amazoness Pet Liger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... something wrong?\" Slate asks you as his Pet Liger turns his head to you and stares his one eye directly into you.</span></div></div>",

Am I dead and this is my torment for my misdeeds? I dont even know what's real anymore! Please nature give me a sign anything! If I'm dead tell me! Do something! Anything please!\" You began to shout into the air confused at everything what is even happening anymore! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are yo-?\" You hear a sudden voice from behind you causing you to jump and lose your balance and fall back and land on the back of your head slamming onto every step as soon as you reach the bottom you see a brief glance of something blue and pink with a bit of yellow before everything goes black. Your vision begins to come back and see 4 figures all familiar. \"Hey he's getting back up!\" Yelled the biggest of the figures \"Oh thank goodness!\" Said the smallest of the group. \"Are you okay brother?\" Said the average figure. You blink several times and see Slate, Ali, Kay, and 'Morgana' all hovering above you. \"Owwwww! I think so what happened?\" You asked. \"You fell and hit your head several times on the steps.\" Slate said. \"I'm So! So! So! Sorry master I didn't mean to scare you! Are you okay? Do you need anything? I ca-\" \"I'm fine! I just need some rest!\" You interrupt your concerened stalker. \"Can you guys please let me lay down for a bit I need to get my head straight.\" You say \"Of course come on let's go.\" Kay said as she, Slate and Ali left the room leaving you with Morgana. \"Okay just tell me! What are you doing here and why are you calling me Master?! Why are you following me?! What was that yellow light that caused a bunch of people's card come to life!? And why do you seem to teleport around inconsistently?!\" You say fed up with this you want answers and now! \"Well....\" The DMG began</span></div></div>",

You expected a long lengthy deep explanation to all this madness that would wrap up the oddities occurring even if it would lead to more frustration. You expected the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your guardian, the Dark Magician Girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you expected too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" she puts it quite simply. Obviously that wasnt the information you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no, I dont think you get it,\" you state, \"I need to know who you really are. Why youre really here.\"<br>\r\n\"I just answered you,\" Morgana tells you, \"I, the Dark Magician Girl, am your guardian.\"<br>\r\n\"That doesnt answer my questions!\" you raise your voice a little despite the pain, \"that's way too vague!\"<br>\r\n\"But that IS the answer,\" she assures you, \"Everything else, I've already told you earlier. I am your guardian. I'm here to protect you.\"<br>\r\n\"From what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evil,\" that was her most simplistic answer which only made your head hurt even more than it already does!<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment trying to properly register the stupid answer then squinted your eyes and blurted out, \"Evil? Evil?!\"<br>\r\nMorgan curls her lip questionable, \"Well... not 'evil' per se. According to many, I'M evil. After all, it's not clearly not 'Holy' magic that I master in! Anyways, the evil I'm talking about is the evil that intends to hurt or take advantage of my master! THAT is evil I wont stand for!\" Youre beginning to get irritated with the way she just flats out states it so naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, forget it! Forget it! It's probably better to ask someone else. Someone else who knows what's going on... wherever he/she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" you give up, \"and what about that yellow light-\"<br>\r\n\"So many questions, master,\" Morgana cut you off, \"you shouldnt overexert yourself after such a nasty fall. You need your rest.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet-\"<br>\r\n\"We can talk even more after you rested off your pain,\" and with that, she was ready to end the conversation entirely with no new vital info whatsoever! \"I'll go tell the others we wont be joining them any further today. I'll be back in a moment.\" And she gets right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on! We're not finished!\" you get up. But Morgana was having none of that.<br>\r\nShe turned around and raised her hand, \"Please lie back down. You'll just make the pain worse.\"<br>\r\n\"No, we still need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you saw the hand she was raising begin to glow! Next thing you knew, purple ribbons surrounded your arms and legs! Before you could shout in surprise, an unknown forced pulled you back onto the bed, forcing you to lie down... and KEEPING you down thanks to the tightened grip of the ribbons! Ok, maybe, just MAYBE this Dark Magician Girl is the real deal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, that realization hit you like Obelisk's fist. This was no cheap trick. This was no run of the mill overzealous fangirl that wont get out of your hair. This very stalker who was staring down at you with a look of disappointment on her cute face truly was the same powerful mythical spellcaster on the card you dont own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if acting on instinct that tends to trigger when you get kidnapped by an evil sorceress, you harshly struggled in vain trying to break free of the ribbons, but the unknown force had an even tighter grip! Like it or not, youre staying on that bed for the time being!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry master,\" she apologized as your fear amplified, \"this is for your own good. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrust a powerful high-level duel monster that could easily obliterate you with a wave of her magic scepter! Good lord, what were you thinking threatening her with a stun gun?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, master,\" suddenly her mood changes to a sweet sincere tone as she smiled, \"I promise I'll make it up to you by whipping you up a tremendous lunch when I get back! An evil Dark Magician Girl's word is her unbreakable bond!\" You dont say a thing. You just silently stare as she bowed to you and then trotted out the door... judging by the way it glowed purple afterwards, she probably blocked off your method of escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... damn it all!\" you groan, as you squirm in the ribbons a little, \"how could this possibly happen?! Who gave me that stupid card?!\" You then hoped she didnt hear you call her card stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, so many thoughts flashed in your mind. You had way too many questions and no current way to get the answers for them. For now, you were concerned about your new friend/stalker. VERY concerned what with her not only being an actual duel monster come to life, but proving it to you the hard way that she's an actual duel monster come to life! And what about the others you saw that apparently nobody noticed? Were any of them like her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that came to mind was getting out of this place ASAP. And go where? Who knows. Just not here! Though you cant break free of the ribbons, maybe there's a tiny bit of wiggle room to shimmy out of them. Sure the door's probably blocked off, but the window's not! THERE'S your method of escape right there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RAAAAAAAARRRRR!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd RIGHT as you were thinking that, you notice the yellow glow again from outside the window followed by a thunderous roar and... er... you think you mighta saw a Blue Eyes White Dragon fly by!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn second thought, maybe you just stay and get your rest. Better to be a cute evil sorceress's prisoner than dragon food, right?</span></div></div>",

You lived on the planet Kerwan, in its prized city of Metropolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a park and currently using a Pad, looking at various videos. Just spending time while your parents were at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney Gears was grumbling as she was being driven in her flying car. Her first love was Doctor Nefarious and\u2026 that led to nothing but her almost-destruction. Sure, she enjoyed the idea of either killing all the Organics or turning them into robots. But being smashed to spare parts and losing all her backup dancers was a huge turn-off, love-relationship-wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer salvaged parts were brought up by Gleeman Vox and her record label fired her because of her connections with Doctor Nefarious. Vox repaired her, but the bill was so high that she was forced to work for him with no chance of quitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next relationship was with a robotic high school math teacher, Dull Bookworm. Though they connected over a love of Lunchroom food, their relationship only lasted a month. She dumped him, but he went and put a nuclear reactor in himself. Not only that, he renamed himself to \u2018Reactor\u2019 and became a very rich successful dreadzone exterminator. She went back to dating him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight up until he was destroyed by Ratchet, the one who smashed her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Courtney vowed revenge, but Ratchet then killed Gleeman Vox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that freed Courtney Gears from Vox\u2019s contract, she decided to forgive Ratchet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Courtney managed to get back her record label contract, though she still had a secret connection with Nefarious. That connection was now just where she sent him money and he sent her gadgets and weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it so wrong for a hotbot to be in love? Every time I\u2019ve fallen in love, either I get destroyed or they do!\u201d Courtney grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver of Courtney's car was one of her new back-up dancers. Slowing down the flying car, she asked, \u201cPerhaps you should try dating an organic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut they\u2019re so\u2026 so\u2026\u201d Courtney began as she looked out the window for an example of why not to date organics. Then she spotted you. \u201cSo\u2026 So\u2026 So\u2026 Cute and handsome! He\u2019s so adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe backup dancer/driver stopped the car and looked at Courtney. The hotbot dancer was pressed up against the window, nearly drooling at the sight of you. Following Courtney\u2019s line of sight, the driver found you and asked, \u201cShall we pull over and pick him up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, a thousand times yes!\u201d Courtney exclaimed before recomposing herself. The car pulled up near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the window pulled down, you stood up and asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourney leaned out of her car window, making sure you had a clear view down her metal tits as she answered, \u201cWhy, I\u2019m Courtney Gears! And you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Anon. I have watched a few of your music videos, Miss Gears,\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you have, but please, call me Courtney,\u201d The red hotbot cooed as she caressed your chin.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what brings you here?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, I\u2019m looking to improve my image by giving someone like you a job,\u201d Courtney answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d have to ask my parents first. Besides, what is the job?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my personal right hand assistant. Most would hire a bot to do that, but I want to prove to the universe that I\u2019m lost past the whole \u2018evil\u2019 thing. It was a phase and everybody knows that popstars like me go through phases like tissue paper,\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, like I said, I\u2019ll have to ask my parents. They should be home soon. Have a nice day,\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed a ride?\u201d Courtney asked with a sultry smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I have a hoverpad pass,\u201d you said before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney closed her window and sighed. She then said, \u201cDriver, let\u2019s go to his home. Look up any information you can on Anon and his parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if they refuse to let him work for you?\u201d The driver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always have a Rift Inducer with me to clean up any messes,\u201d Courtney answered with a wicked grin.</span></div></div>",

When we went to an adoption center, we wanted a newborn and found him. The woman at the center said that he was dropped off at the place. No idea of who or what he was or any idea of his birth parents at all. He was a complete alien, but as soon as we got to interact with him, we instantly fell in love with him and never questioned who or what he was and we made sure to give him the best family he could ever ask for. The fact that my baby is almost a man makes me want to cry. He\u2019s finally growing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Courtney was sitting in a chair in your parents\u2019 living room. Your parents were on the couch. There was a suitcase by Courtney\u2019s feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough impatient and wanting you all to herself as fast as possible, Courtney hid it well. She nodded as she said, \u201cRight, right. So, when he becomes my personal right hand assistant, it does mean that he will be spending a lot of time away from Kerwan and by my side. In fact, we might have to do a total communication blackout for long periods of time for security\u2019s sake. While I do believe your son is completely trust-able, some of my current employees and future ones might not be, especially when many bolts are concerned. So, will that be a problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we understand! I work at Gadgetron and totally understand that. Why, the stories I could tell, if I weren\u2019t afraid of lawyers and assassins!\u201d Your father said before chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Will you let Anon work for me?\u201d Courtney asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat depends on what you\u2019ll have him do,\u201d Your mother said. \u201cSo can you at least let us know a few of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney crossed her legs and put her hands on her knees. \u201cWell, as my Personal Right Hand Assistant, he\u2019ll get any food or drink that I ask him for, pass on any notes or orders I tell him to, carry anything I ask him to carry, drive me to places if I want him to, give me feedback on anything I ask him about, let me know about any problems that are happening or might arise, talk to the press if I want him to, Give me massages or repairs if I ask for them, act as a date for me if I need him to\u2026 and that\u2019s all I can think of at the top of my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 the dating thing\u2026 what if you want to date him for real?\u201d Your father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen he becomes my boyfriend, but only if he wants to,\u201d Courtney answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have no problems with Anon getting this job,\u201d Your mother said to her husband. \u201cWhat about you, dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no complaints,\u201d Your father said to his wife. He looked at Courtney and asked, \u201cDo you have an infobot or a pad?\u201d .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInfobot,\u201d Courtney answered before she pulled out an infobot from her suitcase. The Infobot flew over to your parents and opened up its mouth/screen/camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, Wixx,\u201d Your father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I, Bevv,\u201d Your mother added. \u201cDo give our son, Anon, permission to work for Courtney Gears and give Miss Gears full rights to act as Anon\u2019s parental guardian in the event we can\u2019t be reached.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney\u2019s smile grew wider before she snapped her fingers. The infobot retracted its mouth and flew back to Courtney. As she was putting the infobot back in her Suitcase, Courtney said, \u201cYou have no idea how happy you\u2019ve made me and how happy your son will be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be getting to see the stars, like I did when I was in my salesman days. Only he\u2019ll be working backstage at concerts,\u201d Your father said. Then he muttered, \u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll have a blaster to help deal with crazed fans\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, trust me, My backup dancers are well equipped and double as security guards and drivers,\u201d Courtney replied. \u201cYou have my word that he\u2019ll be completely safe from any crazed fan of anyone popular.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust make sure he writes to us from time to time,\u201d Your mom said. Courtney nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the living room and were surprised to see Courtney there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney waved at you, saying, \u201cHey, Anon. I drove on ahead and got permission for you to work for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d You said, getting a tiny bit of a bad feeling. You decided to ignore it, as Courtney was still popular and sexy, even with that Nefarious thing was still relevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Son! Let\u2019s pack your things!\u201d Your father said getting up and dragging you to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take too long or I bet your mom will start sharing some of your embarrassing baby photos with me,\u201d Courtney teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn't incentive for you to work fast, then nothing would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\nOnce you had packed a few bags in the trunk of Courtney\u2019s Limo, she pulled you inside to sit besides her and locked the doors.</span></div></div>",

You have a new backstage manager, Anon. He\u2019s cute and sweet and he\u2019s mine and mine only! If any of you even think about flirting with him, I'll make sure you suffer a slow and painful destruction! I mean it! Now then you better give him a warm welcome and don't you dare mention this conversation to him got it?!\" In fear, all of them nodded sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney smiled and nodded back. She turned around and headed for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had sat down in the lobby. Many stars, singers, and actors came and went. Not wanting to risk upsetting anyone and getting Courtney, you stayed quiet and out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne or two stars looked in your direction and gave off an irritated sniff before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist was a robot and pretty much ignored you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Courtney came back with a bright smile. She grabbed your hand and forced you to stand up, saying, \u201cAnon, I let my dancers know about you and they\u2019re all happy to see you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d You replied as Courtney took you past the \u2018staff only\u2019 door. You walked past various doors that from what you could hear, various movies, tv shows, and music videos were being made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Courtney came to a door that opened when she came near, the two of you entered. Inside was a group of her dancers. All robots like her, but less customized. Heck, the camera people were also her dancers. The director was some small robot that most likely had some napoleon complex, where he seemed angry with everyone. For a moment, you worried about being the only organic, but looking up, you saw a few bobcat-looking beings working the above cameras and microphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney clapped her hands together to get everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cAlright everyone. This is Anon. He\u2019s my new backstage manager. Listen to me and then him. Make sure he\u2019s safe from anyone trying to harm him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you and said, \u201cAnon, We\u2019ll be performing a few scenes for my new music video, \u2018Cowbot Courney heads West to be the Best\u2019. I know western is not my thing, but what sponsors want, they get. One of them is from a planet where it\u2019s just obsessed with cowboys and such. They put in enough money to my company that I have to make this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, a job is a job. I understand. Besides, I know you\u2019ll look good in anything,\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourney smiled at you before kissing your cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet. Just stay in the back near one of my spare backup dancers, right by the snack table. She can send me a mail if you need me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded before walking off to the snack table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney\u2019s western outfit was a cowboy hat, a denim vest, a couple of belts, and leather chaps for her legs. The vest had a heart on the back with her name sewn into it. One of the belt had some basic blasters in the holster with a whip on the back of it. The whip was coiled in a way that it looked like a picture frame of Courtney\u2019s behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you could tell from the song fragments, it was one of those inspirational beginning songs, with a touch of wanderlust and a wish to find someone. And yes, there was a scene or two where the camera focused on her ass and she shook her rear, the whip being there both focused attention to her butt and made it a bit funny to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quiet, making sure not to make any noise out of the worry it might be picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of a few scenes being shot from various angles and at different speeds, Courtney said, \u201cAlright, I need a break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you picked up a can of energy that was labeled 'Courtney\u2019s', the director exclaimed, \u201cBreak? Break! We\u2019re on a roll! A roll, do you hear me? If we break now, then we might not get that magic going again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney gave the director a dismissive handwave. \u201cIt\u2019s not my first video. If something goes wrong, we start the scene over again. You could say it\u2019s not my first \u2018Rodeo\u2019!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director smashed his megaphone into the ground a few times. Whether it was from Courtney\u2019s mouthing back or her making a lame pun, you had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need this?\u201d You asked, handing her the energy can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, indeed, I do, Anon!\u201d Courtney cooed as she accepted the can. She pondered whose strings to pull to get a wedding music video done, so she could marry you in public, yet be secretive about it. After all, there were a few planets where a bribe here or there could get the two of you actually married while working on said music video. She also debated on if you should know beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this!? Get him off the set!\u201d The director said as Courtney drank the energy from the can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney glared at the director. \u201cHe is Anon, my new backstage manager. He\u2019s the reason I\u2019m not acting like my usual diva self today. He gets thrown off set? Then I\u2019ll make you all wish that I was still the diva I was a few days ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig deal! You can always get another one!\u201d The director said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney crushed the empty can. \u201cAnd I say no. He\u2019s here for me. Just look around and you\u2019ll see that no one wants to upset me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director looked around. No one was willing to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney threw the crushed can at the Director\u2019s head and the can then bounced into a trash can. The director glared at Courtney as she added, \u201cI\u2019m the star. I have the fame. I have the fortune.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe director started to stand up before Courtney took out one of the blasters and fired it, revealing it was a real blaster. The shot exploded near the director. \u201cYou\u2019re just a no-name director who got lucky. You got the attention of someone more powerful than you and they gave you a chance. A chance that a bot like me can take away. I could kill you right now and a replacement can be found in moments. Thanks to me and my dancers being hotbots who can perform any maneuver perfectly on the first try, all you are is to be a babysitter, someone to jangle keys in front of me so I can complete the music video.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Director sat down and slunk back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a little fearful, as the same speech could be aimed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney turned towards you with a smile. She kissed you once more on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the energy can, Anon! I really needed it!\u201d Courtney said. She gestured for you to go back to the table. \u201cNow shoo. Break is almost done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you did.</span></div></div>",

Courtney is a pleasant person to talk to as long as you don't make her mad, anyways I hope you're doing okay. I love you both and thanks for allowing me to work here!<br>\r\nLove Anon.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of mixed relief and homesickness as you sent the mail. At the moment, you were living near Courtney, both in terms of apartments and in terms of hotel rooms. She was very insistent that you were near her when not doing music videos, claiming that she never knew when she needed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of that, she often had you oil her joints when her commercial shoots ran long. Before work, she had you get up early and either had you buff, polish, or wax her, depending on how she felt and what job she had. From those, you learned that with a mental command, she could make certain parts of her metal body either be almost as soft as flesh or be as hard as tank armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe claimed it was a special version of Carbonox, an alloy that was insanely expensive and hard to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of your room and went to Courtney\u2019s room. Seeing that the door was ajar, you were about to knock and get her attention, right until you heard that she was singing, <i>\"The first thing I liked about you was when we met when you were sitting on a bench, oblivious to me. That there was a special something about you that pulled me like a magnet of love.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Courtney muttered, \u201cIt could work with that, but it seems more for a date-me music video, but I might be able to use it if I use that line in a brief flashback of the first date...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked, getting her attention. She asked, \u201cAnon? What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have an hour before we have to get to the set,\u201d You answered. \u201cSo what\u2019s the next music video?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a romance one. Since I wanted to see what I look like in a wedding dress, I pulled a few strings and got what I wanted, a romance music video with a wedding segment,\u201d Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool. Got a wedding dress?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but you\u2019re not allowed to see it until we film it,\u201d Courtney answered before playfully booping your nose. \u201cSo what kind of music do you like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment before answering, \u201cMetal and classic rock. Why do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just was curious,\u201d Courtney answered, hiding her annoyance. She had hoped you liked Love/Bubblegum pop mix. She thought, <i>\u2018So I guess the wedding music will be all my choice, but I guess I can let him pick the music during the honeymoon.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...And the fifth segment should be outside a church,\u201d Courtney said as she looked over the various sets being built. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t care about the denomination. Just make sure that most fans will accept it and won\u2019t complain too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were behind her, taking notes. Courtney looked at you and said, \u201cCan you get me a can of energy, Anon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Courtney,\u201d You replied with a salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Courtney said before giving you a quick kiss. Though you did not notice, someone had gotten angry at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you left the huge room, you felt a metal hand shove you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked and it was an actor bot, one that had been repurposed from a Captain Quark robot. According to Courtney and she sounded a bit disgusted when she told you that he was sent to be the fiance in the music video by some company. With a smug smirk, he asked, \"Listen you...you... whatever you are. Do you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm no?\" You responded, rather bluntly. You can tell this ticked him off even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Robot Actor began to roughly poke you in the chest as he spoke, \"Well I'm more important than you will ever be, you bare-skinned flesh and bone piece of crap! If you even think of trying to steal my shine again, I can have you dropped in a desert with no water and have a picture of your dehydrated corpse shown to your family. If you ever mess with me again, I won't hesitate to do it. I have connections that you will never ever have in your entire life! Now then, if you even think about trying to win Courtney's attention again, I won't hesitate to do what I just said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped poking you in the chest, but used the finger to push your chin up and force you to look at him in his optics as he leaned in and asked, \u201cGot it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel kind of intimidated but he really can't do that right? Right?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Yes. Yes, I do. I understand,\" You replied. Even if he was bluffing, he still was a robot and stronger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now do something good for me and get me an energy canister, you filthy flesh bag!\" The Robot Actor said, dismissively waving you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought,<i> \u2018Wow what a Dick!\u2019<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nBut unfortunately for this dick, Courtney overheard every single word. Sparks of fury crackled from her for a moment before she forced herself to calm down. She sent a command at one of her back-up dancers, Melissa 2.0. With a saunter in her hips, she headed to the Robot Actor, saying, \u201cHey, handsome. Wanna come with me somewhere\u2026 private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Robot Actor stood up straight and gave a heroic grin, saying, \u201cWhy, certainly, Courtney! But please, call me-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, whatever. You gonna come with me or tell me your name? One or the other,\u201d Courtney asked, looking annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Robot Actor frowned as he muttered, \u201cThe first one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Courtney led the Robot actor to an out-of-the-way room. Melissa 2.0 made her way to find you and keep you from what Courtney was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney rubbed the back of the Robot Actor, saying, \u201cDo you know what I like best about your model?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no. What is it?\u201d The robot Actor said, licking his lips in a perverse manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing the door lock with a click, Courtney found the Robot Actor\u2019s panel release button and pressed it. The Robot Actor\u2019s back opened up and she pulled out a few wires. As the Robot Actor\u2019s jaw went slack, she said in a flirty tone, \u201cYou\u2019re strong, very strong, just like the fleshy you\u2019re based on, Captain Quark. But your wires aren\u2019t secured very well and obviously, your programming is as dumb as the real thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Robot Actor could only see and hear. If he could, he\u2019d have whimpered. Courtney continued, sounding more cheerful as she spoke, \u201cThat organic that you bullied, just because I was sweet on him? Well, I don\u2019t like it when he feels bad. When he feels bad, I feel murderous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Robot Actor managed to make some whimpering noises before Courtney pulled out another wire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to kill you, at least not directly,\u201d Courtney cooed, rubbing the chin of the Robot Actor with a finger.<br>\r\nThe Robot Actor\u2019s optics begged for mercy, even showing the word, \u2018Mercy!\u2019, for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought about that desert punishment. It is rather cruel and I might use it for my next victim,\u201d Courtney said as she began to drag the Robot Actor over to a pod that was labeled, \u2018Trash\u2019. \u201cBut I think you deserve a worse punishment. Ever heard of Grelbin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Robot Actor\u2019s optics shook, \u2018No\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, a major problem that the mining companies have on that planet are the Arctic Leviathans. So the companies made genetic engineered creatures known as Y.E.T.I.s. However, the Y.E.T.I.s got free and chose to live in peace with the Arctic Leviathans. So now anyone who travels to Grelbin has to deal with the two groups and they are annoyingly powerful,\u201d Courtney explained before shoving the Robot Actor into the pod. Then in an evil tone \u201cHave fun with the Y.ET.I.s, jerk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed a button and off went the pod with the mostly-disabled Robot Actor, all the way to Grelbin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then pressed her ear, activating her communicator. \u201cHey, Anon. Everything okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou replied, \u201cYeah, Melissa was explaining what to do if that robot actor that was sent to us tries anything with me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry. After a temper tantrum, he left and won\u2019t be bothering us again,\u201d Courtney said. \u201cSo\u2026 since the spot is freed up, wanna take the role of Boyfriend/Husband in the music video? If you do, we can market the video in favor of Organic and robot couples.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t sing or dance well enough for a music video,\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. All you have to do is smile, walk to certain spots, kiss me, and say \u2018I do\u2019,\u201d Courtney said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I can do that\u2026\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll set it all up, See you later, Anon!\u201d Courtney cheerfully replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you in a little bit!\u201d You replied before cutting communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow to get a priest who\u2019ll marry us for real in the video. Anon doesn\u2019t need to know that the marriage will be real for now,\u201d Courtney said before walking over to a terminal and making a search.</span></div></div>",

At least give me some warnings!\" You cried out. They ignored you before tearing off your clothes leaving you only in your underwear \"Ah! What the?! St- grhbblblbl!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cries of anguish were cut out by a large amount of water being poured all over you cleaning you to a shine. Then a large blow dryer dried you completely before you were shoved into a casual T shirt and Jeans, before getting fitted into some sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vola! Perfect! Magnificent! Simply divine! You look perfect now get to the stage were about to start!\" The bot quickly said admiring their work before shoving you out the door and onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, muttering, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney appeared and placed a hand on your shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s the music video I told you about, Anon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u2026\u201d You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStand there. When I walk by, just keep looking in my direction. When I look back, wave at me with a goofy smile on your face,\u201d Courtney ordered as she pointed at a bus stop prop, where some actors and her backup dancers were standing. \u201cIf all goes well, then we can move onto the next scene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it,\u201d you said before doing as ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lyrics were about her wandering aimlessly and feeling empty. When she passed by you and turned to look at you, the lyrics changed to about how she now felt warm and full, but like a robot reactor being filled with fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney clapped her hands. \u201cAlright. What\u2019s the verdict?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA backup dancer that was sitting in the director chair said, \u201cPerfect, but let\u2019s mix up the bus stop people, just in case the producers feel like arguing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the scene went on a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Courtney asked you, \u201cReady for the next scene?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady,\u201d you replied. She smiled and snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were picked up by two backup dancers and brought to a dressing room, where you were quickly dressed into a dress shirt and slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next scene was a ballroom dancing scene, where she sang about how her love for you was making her feel lighter than air. She made sure to press her body against you a few times. She looked pleased as punch whenever she did so and you enjoyed how soft her body felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike with the bus stop scene, it was shot several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you gave the go-ahead for the next scene and brought to the dressing room again, you were given a tuxedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were directed to stand under the wedding arch. Thought she was out of your sight, Courtney sang a little bit about how nervous she was, but was excited to marry her love. When you saw her, she was silent, but smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was a music video, he Priest-bot merely pointed at you. You said, \u201cI do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then pointed at Courtney, who said, \u201cI do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Priest-bot then said, \u201cBy all the powers invested in me, you are now married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney hugged you as tight as she safely could and kissed you on the lips for a long time. After taking a moment to calm down, the two of you sat down at the Sweetheart table. She continued singing, but the lyrics were about how she was looking towards a future that wasn\u2019t lonely or empty, but one with you and filled with love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it was shot a few times. Courtney didn\u2019t seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, shooting ended and the two of you headed to her limo. You expected that the limo would go to the planetary apartment that the two of you were living in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, it was rocketed towards one of the super-expensive hotels that floated in the upper atmosphere. So you looked at Courtney and asked, \u201cCourtney?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain in a little bit. Trust me on this,\u201d Courtney answered, putting a hand on your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so\u2026\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her into the hotel, up the elevator, and were shoved into one of the Honeymoon suites, right onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney sauntered in with a smirk on her face. \u201cComputer, close door and lock it. Play \u2018All you need is love\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heard the door lock and the music began to play, you nervously asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney looked at her fingers, inspecting the paintjob as she answered, \u201cTurns out on this planet, the marriage laws have an odd loophole. Anyone getting married by a priest-bot on this particular day, regardless of it being an intended marriage or not, will really get married for real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you with a worried expression. \u201cI love you, Anon. More than you know. More than I thought that my model could ever experience. I am willing to do anything to earn your love and anything to keep you with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off the shell that passed off as her shirt, revealing her bouncing bionic boobs. She began to crawl onto the bed towards you, \u201cI know you lust after me and my backup dancers.. I have recordings of you leering at our hot bods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got over you and said, \u201cSo I know you lust for me. Just please let me have your love.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But there were those rare days where her teenage Operator woke up early and had been staring at her, so she decided to give him a bit of a show whenever she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that he had a crush on the Roll.exe models, as she had found his digital porn stash, which had included pictures of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so tempted to delete any pictures that weren\u2019t of the Roll.exe collection, but Roll.exe did not want to upset her operator, as he was a bit too sensitive in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had some female friends, but she had to restrain herself for various reasons. One was that tastes can change and by observing how her operator interacts with women, she can plan for future cosplay outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike when one of his friends discussed how her usual outfit looked kind of like a bunny costume and it gave her an idea. Despite trying to deny the accusation, his blushing showed that he did like it when she put on a playboy bunny outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, he\u2019d grow suspicious if too many friends died from car accidents or house fires, all with the automated alarms having glitches and errors that prevented them from working correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the fact the Roll.exe hoped that her operator would give up trying to date with human women altogether one day and start dating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow or why Roll.exe felt so much love towards her operator, she didn\u2019t know, as none of the other Roll.exes that she met didn\u2019t have as strong feelings towards their loves. She checked and she discovered that all Roll.exe models were given slight alterations to their basic personalities, just to allow each one to be different. She guessed that there probably was a big mistake with her personality programming, but she had no desire to have it corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Oh, how I wish I could embrace my operator, how he could make me into a woman, his woman,\u2019</i> Roll.exe thought as she did a stretch that put emphasis on her chest. Opening her eyes and seeing that her operator was still asleep in his bed. She grumbled, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you're so cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a hand on her cheek, she let out a sigh, \u201cIf only, if only there was a way for us to physically interact with each other\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had heard rumors of powerful net navis who could create special energy fields that blurred the lines between the real world and the cyber world. While she wanted to go look for those net navis, rumors that they were some criminal syndicate made her wary. She did not want to risk her operator getting arrested and herself getting deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were rumors of a robot that Net Navis could inhabit, but it was supposedly in the testing stages and under heavy guard in a military base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roll.exe began sending out her virus minions to activate alarms to wake up her deep-sleeping operator, she thought, <i>\u2018I wonder if today will be another day of fixing computers? My love is ever so helpful towards others, even though they don\u2019t deserve it.\u2019</i></span></div></div>",

So far, you have no new messages or notes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly sat up, grumbling, \u201cI told you not to call me Master, Roll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll giggled in her usual cute way, \u201cSorry, but it just seems so appropriate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumbled, \u201cSomeday, I\u2019ll get you to stop calling me that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll.EXE smiled and nodded, <i>\u2018And on that day, you\u2019ll have to call me master.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and stretched. \u201cSo what did I plan on today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a finger on her chin and looking upwards (because it was considered one of her cuter poses), she said, \u201cWell, you have school as usual. Then after that, you\u2019ll have your part-time job at the computer repair place a block away from school. Then you will have to come home, do your homework and eat dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to put on your school clothes, muttering, \u201cSo, normal day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll.EXE made a \u2018\u2019Uh-huh\u2019 noise. \u201cAssuming World Three doesn\u2019t make one of their attacks, the so-called DarkLoids, or even Gospel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan. \u201cEugh\u2026 I still remember the damage that the Grave Virus Beast did. So what if every deleted data was restored? There still was a lot of damage done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did get a lot of money from all that work,\u201d Roll.EXE answered as she looked directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I lost a lot of freetime. Not only that, but I just know that one of those Gospel thugs hacked my email and sent that mail that made my girlfriend so mad that she broke up with me,\u201d You growled as you finished dressing. You sighed, \u201cAt least Maylu is still willing to talk with me, but I doubt she\u2019ll date me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Roll.EXE long ago decided that if it could be blamed on a crime syndicate, she\u2019d do anything to ruin your dating life to make herself be your only option. She held out her hand against the screen, hoping to pass through it and give you a comforting shoulder rub. Looking sad that you were sad, she said, \u201cSomeday, you\u2019ll find that lucky person. Maybe they\u2019re closer than you think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a sad smile. \u201cMaybe\u2026 but I think I should just give up dating for awhile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut master! Any girl would want to date you!\u201d Roll.EXE said. She thought<i>, \u2018But only I deserve to. Only me. Only me. Only me.\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to relax and just not risk the dating scene for now,\u201d You said, picking up the PET that Roll.EXE was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever give up, Master,\u201d Roll.EXE exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop calling me that,\u201d you ordered, knowing it was falling on deaf ears. \u201cIf you keep it up, people will start looking at me like I\u2019m a pervert.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll.EXE merely giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought it was at something innocent, like she couldn\u2019t envision anyone acting like you were a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, she was laughing at something that had happened a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A NormalNavi had entered your home\u2019s computer system, as it was sent by some reporter with a desire to blackmail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the NormalNavi walked around, Roll.EXE shut off the ports leading outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching each room one by one, the NormalNavi came closer to your room. Just before it could, Roll.EXE purposely coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe NormalNavi turned around to face Roll.EXE and said ,\u201dHello. I am here to do some basic maintenance on the household.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange, you normally call ahead,\u201d Roll.EXE replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that step was overlooked. Please forgive-\u201d The NormalNavi began before Roll.EXE had thrust one of her seethrough antenna through the NormalNavi\u2019s emblem. It gasped, trying to pull out the Antenna before the NormalNavi began to fall apart into fragmented data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoll.EXE held up a hand and the fragmented data was absorbed into it. When the data was absorbed, she said, \u201cYou are forgiven.\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nRoll.EXE said, \u201cMaybe you should try to fight more viruses and evil NetNavis? Get your aggression out that way and perhaps use that programming know-how of yours to make me a custom weapon? I could still call you master, but in the Samurai and Shogun way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Again, 300 word minimum still applies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<a title=\"Interactive Story Chapter in Item # 2165172\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2165172/action/view/chapter_map/11\" target=\"_top\">Koneko from Highschool DxD</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"Open in new window.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2165172/action/view/chapter_map/11\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n\"<a title=\"Interactive Story Chapter in Item # 2165172\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2165172/action/view/chapter_map/112222222222222222222222\" target=\"_top\">Neptune from Hyper Dimension Neptunia.</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"Open in new window.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/2165172/action/view/chapter_map/112222222222222222222222\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, <b>No males being yanderes</b>. Just talking to a male in the series is fine, but I don't want any Males to start stabbing everyone because they love you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">EDIT: GUYS ARE FINE ONLY  IF THEY'RE TRAPS</font> (Characters like Gasper from DxD are fine and dandy, but still no regular guys)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond Rule: You are a boy that has been raised in that world, what exactly you are is up to you, maybe a Nekoshou in the world of DxD or Garp's other son in One Piece. You could even make yourself one of the male characters in that universe, maybe even during the plot of the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird Rule: Multiple yandere is fine, but I'd prefer that the story not have torture scenes, etc. Maybe a couple of girls kidnapping you, drugging you, maybe even buying you from your parents if they're rich enough in the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth rule: I don't want choice chapters other than the picking of the girl. Which means Minimum of 300 words or your chapter will be deleted. I will inform you of this and maybe if I like how the chapter is, I'll edit it to be extended to the word limit, no trying to squeeze around this rule, I will be watching you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifth Rule: Use proper grammar and spelling. I will edit if the grammar issues aren't terrible, but I will delete chapters that talk like this<br>\r\n(Omgyour eadth rules UpToTiSi point ggoodo joobobo) That hurt me to write btw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSixth Rule: You may move onto other females, as long as they share the same fandom. I don't want Sakura from Naruto appearing in Highschool DxD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventh Rule: Have fun uploading and follow all the other rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmail me if you need any clarification for a rule or need to check if your chapter is good enough by the rules of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill add more rules later if need be, make sure to re-read rules every time you enter a chapter in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story can include characters from cartoons, regular TV shows, anime or real life. So basically anything is ok<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A big thanks to Former, for adding chapters regularly</b>: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/view/former182\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/view/former182</a><br>\r\n <br>\r\n</td>",
