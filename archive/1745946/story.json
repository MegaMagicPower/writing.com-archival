However this metabolism has had all it can take, it can no longer prevent her from gaining weight, she was now just as vulnerable to weight gain as her friends, or any other girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story starts with Yui waking up one morning, much earlier than usual, her sister, Ui, wasn\u2019t even awake yet. As much as Yui tried to get back to sleep, there was one persistent thing that kept the guitarist awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui arose from bed and lazily made her way into the kitchen, and decided to make herself some jam on toast. She devoured the meal quickly; she was satisfied, for now anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far too early to make her way to school, so she decided to kill time by watching tv, sadly, at these early hours there was barely anything to watch, but she would have to make do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, Yui was absorbed in watching TV, when suddenly she was phased out by her grumbling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wah?

She was still kind of tired, so she didn\u2019t really want to do any work for preparing breakfast, and she knew that it would be selfish of her to wake her sister up and ask her to make her breakfast. After a few moments, the solution to this moral dilemma was over; she remembered that she had one of Mugis\u2019 cakes left over in her fridge. This should keep her tired until lunch time in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled mischievously as she ran to the fridge, her mouth watering as she awaited to taste the rich, sweet, deliciousness that the cake held under its equally as sweet icing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui got the cake out and immediately started to cut it up into slices, she didn\u2019t intend to have any leftovers, despite the fact that the cake was slightly bigger than she intently remembered, \u2018oh well, more tasty, cakey goodness for me then!\u2019 she thought to herself as she started to devour the slices she had cut out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Yui know (not that she would care if she was told, for that matter) that the cake she was eating had quite the high calorie count, quite higher than most other cakes, so with each slice that the brown haired guitarist ate, her stomach would soon turn each slice into fat, and then add a slight layer of extra softness onto her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of her breakfast, Yui was stuffed, she rubbed her tummy and gently cooed out from the sensation, it was nice, satisfying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mnn~ that was nice\" She thought to herself contently.</span></div></div>",

For her that seemed to be the most logical reason for why her sister would wake up so early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui shook her head. \"Nothing like that, Ui-chan! I just decided to eat earlier today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Ui to stop in her tracks. \"Oh...\" If Yui wasn't in a sweet-induced stupor she might have noticed concerned tone in Ui's voice. She turned to her sister and tried to give a bright smile. \"Well, I could still prepare a smaller breakfast for you if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui waved her off. \"I think I'm full. I might have ate too much this morning,\" she responded with a smile as she patted her tummy to emphasize how much she already put away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I was going to make pancakes today!\" There was a hint of desperation in Ui. \"And I was sure you were looki-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Ui's comments was cut off due to the loud growl emitting from Yui's belly. \"I might still be a bit hungry after all!\" Yui said with a sheepish laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling relieved, Ui ran to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYui looked at the tall stack of pancakes in awe. \"Umm... Ui-chan? Are you sure this isn't too much for the two of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have overdid it just a bit!\" Ui giggled, admitting to herself that it was done on purpose. The notion that her older sister had woken up early to eat something that wasn't made by her AND ate as much as she implied terrified the girl. It could have been the start of Yui not eating her cooking altogether! And so Ui put her heart and soul into this breakfast, making far more than normal so her sister would be convinced to never think about avoiding her meals again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Yui's plate were three pancakes covered with a healthy amount of syrup and topped with butter. With her first bite she was hooked. Yui inhaled her portion of the fluffy treat and immediately picked up more from the stack. It was a testament to Ui's cooking skill that, despite all that she ate earlier, Yui kept digging in until there were no more pancakes left to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... I'm really stuffed!\" Yui burped lightly and rubbed her drum-tight belly. \"But Ui-chan's food really is the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUi smiled, happy that her plan was a total success.</span></div></div>",

The young drummer sat up lazily and rubbed her eyes in the vain hope that he vision would become much less hazy. Ritsu looked around her room and saw various empty tins of caffeinated drinks, and empty packages of snacks she had the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Did I really eat that much?\u2019</i> she thought to herself before yawning, she should definitely clean it up before she goes to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lazily throwing the remains of her gaming induced binge from the night before in the bin, it was time for breakfast. But sadly her parents weren\u2019t present to cool her food, and right now she really wasn\u2019t in the mood to prepare anything herself. However, she girl soon had a eureka moment as she remembered that she had some left over pizza in the fridge, and as we all know, pizza is the breakfast of kings! And after a few moments in the oven, moments that caused the drummers mouth to water due to the delicious smell that was now circulating in the kitchen, the pizza was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018This is going to be the best breakfast ever!\u2019</i> Ritsu thought as she eagerly dug into eating the pizza. It was delicious! She couldn't get enough, it was simply delicious, she wolfed down each slice as quickly as she could, enjoying each slice before the last. Within a few moments, what was left of the pizza was nothing more than a few crumbs. Ritsu rubbed her stomach contently, burping lightly as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, if you keep that up you\u2019ll fat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Ritsu turned around to see her little brother, Satoshi, his attempt to tease her didn't phase her at all, unlike the girls in the Light Music Club (Except for Yui, obviously), she didn\u2019t really care much about her weight, so what if she got a tad softer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was up late last night, I need the energy to make it through today!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext time you decide to have a videogame marathon, try to keep the volume down, ok?\u201d Satoshi mumbled out as he went to rummage around the cupboards for a coffee mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, sorry about that! Anyways, I should go get ready for school now\u201d she told her brother, realizing that he was already in his uniform already.

In her mind she was going over the events that led to Mio's current state of mind. And it was all going so well until that happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That' referring to when their lead singer, relieved after performing well in front of their schoolmates, turned around to face the rest of the group for some unknown reason. At that moment she somehow tripped on the wire connected to her guitar and fell onto her knees which caused her dress to ride up. The most devastating aspect was that it also caused her panties to be flashed in front of everyone. It would have been more of a surprise to Ritsu if a very similar incident hadn't happened to Mio the previous year!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow is it that always seems to happen to Mio-chan?! Ritsu thought while taking a quick glance at her childhood friend to see that her mood hasn't yet changed. At this rate all we'll be known for is having a lead singer who always falls down at the most inappropriate of moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu imagined Mio falling down after future concerts, always flashing her striped panties, or maybe even ones with a teddy bear design on it. There had to be a way to get around that, but what if it was inevitable? What if by some unknown law Mio had to always fall down in such a manner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mio-chan's panties were more unique that would add a very different spin to the attention from that. Ritsu closed her eyes in deep thought as she tried to come up with something unique for Mio to wear - specifically one that she wouldn't reject right away! How about panties with some sort of text on them? Ritsu shook her head as she laughed at her own image of Mio's panties being covered in very small print. There's no way that would work unless the text was large enough to be easily readable by everyone in the audience and for that to happen her panties would have to be huge--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" she shouted as she leapt off the sofa, loud enough to grab the attention of all her bandmates including Mio. \"Ah, sorry about that!\" Ritsu laughed it off and immediately sat back down, not wanting to give away what she just came up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's so simple! If Mio-chan became really fat with a huge ass, not only would our band be noticed for that but her panties will be large enough for any sort of sign! Ritsu nodded to herself. We could get really creative with the design and text as well! Have her dress up in really tight clothes that are bound to snap and tear in certain areas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was just one small kink to her entire plan. Mio-chan would kill me if I ever suggested to her to intentionally gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu sighed as she nibbled on her small forkful of cake. And it was such a good plan! It's just too bad Mio can't be convinced to agree with it. She stared at what remained of her slice of cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless...</span></div></div>",

'What the... ohhhhh!' Pinching her eyes closed, she shook her head in an attempt to get adjusted to the lack of light. After reopening them she realized that she was in her beachside villa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, right! We're having our summer training camp here.' She turned her head to the left and right. 'But why am I resting this late at night in the living room?' Getting up from the couch she noticed one of her bandmates lying on the floor near it. 'Just what happened here?!' As Mugi got on her feet she felt something akin to a wave crashing against her head. \"Aaah! What was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mmm... my belly's okay as a drum... but something sounds off!\" Ritsu slapped her round gut a few more times. \"Maybe a rounder, tighter stomach would work better...\" She turned around, sporting a predatory smile. \"You'll do!\" And then the girl leapt.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head once more, Mugi tried to remember where that was from. 'Was that just some strange dream? Why can I only remember that and nothing else?' As she was thinking this through Mugi took a few steps and only then did she notice the heavy, strange feeling from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glimpse below was more than enough to stun her. Where there was once a relatively flat stomach now instead sported a stuffed and bloated belly that slightly peaked out of her pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi had to cover her mouth to stifle a scream. \"How?!\" she said, her question coming out in a muffled tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes shut, hoping that this was all just some strange dream. But instead of waking up from her bed, more images started to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nobody's giving any food to Mio-chan,\" the girl said in a soft, lyrical tone while slowly strumming the strings of Yui's guitar in an imitation of a street corner blues singer. \"Nobody's giving any food to Mio-chan, Gitah! Will you give me some of what you have?\" As she continued her lament a hand suddenly shoved a brownie into her mouth. \"Thank you!\" she mumbled out while chewing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the images fading from her vision once more, Mugi's mouth and eyes began to slowly widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"These brownies are delicious, Mugi-chan!\" Yui said excitedly as she scarfed down her third piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio held out a small cup. \"More, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought you were against us drinking any sake!\" Ritsu teased her friend, slapping her in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl looked down, cheeks ablaze due to a mixture of embarrassment and warm sake. \"It tastes real good,\" she whispered. \"And can I have some more brownies and cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi smiled happily as she handed her friend some extra-large portions.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMugi now could recall what happened earlier in the day. She held a big party with just her bandmates and it was something she had planned for weeks. It was meant to be a special occasion, one that would be memorable for all of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finest sake she could get her hands on were of course a must as were the usual array of delectable treats. But Mugi knew that there had to be more for it to be an experience they could never forget. And so she checked online for suggestions on what bands do to have fun. Most of the responses she got mentioned 'Brownies', ones with an especially hard-to-get ingredient. Mugi was certain right away that it was the perfect choice for the party!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\" Mugi sighed softly as she surveyed the wrecked living room, \"I guess it got out of hand. At least nothing else truly embarrassing happ-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And in this corner we have our very own host and bringer of sweets, Kotobuki Tsumugi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRitsu's theatrics slowly became nothing more than background noise for Mugi. Down on all fours, she was but a few feet from the prize - a large chocolate fudge cake with strawberries on top. All that stood from that entire cake getting into her stomach was the girl on the opposite end - Yui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa was by the other girl's side, giving her words of encouragement and tips on how to win the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Mio was by herself, holding an impromptu concert in front of a group of chocolate rabbits. As Mio was strumming away Mugi could overhear the girl asking the rabbits to 'ask Alice' something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alice? I didn't know we had another member. Oh, I hope she didn't miss this party!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mugi lunged to the cake she was able to see from the corner of her eyes that Mio's concert had ended as the girl was now devouring her audience all the while wailing, \"Feed your head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good idea!' Mugi thought as her mouth took the first of many bites of the cake.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have just went with sake,\" Mugi said with a facepalm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how round it has gotten Mugi felt her stomach growl. With a shrug she set off to the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

I look forward to seeing what sort of creative scenarios you can come up with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, a few rules:<br>\r\n1. Please try to put some effort in your entries. One or two sentences don't contribute much during the middle of a story.<br>\r\n2. Proper grammar and spelling.<br>\r\n3. When it comes to weight gain, try to keep the pace as realistic as possible<br>\r\n4. No scat.<br>\r\n5. No killing off or severely injuring the main characters! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, I hope you have fun!</td>",
