            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dick Thompson is the eldest child of the Thompson household. Despite only being 21 years old, he could only be described as the Affluent Progeny of his family\u2019s massive multinational corporation. The Thompson family is famous for creating high-end technology, from computers, phones and other gadgets, to which most of the planet\u2019s population uses and enjoys. His intellect in both the business and engineering aspects of the company has given his family enough popularity to be known around the globe. Except, that is only one of the two reasons as to the Thompson family\u2019s popularity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rays of the sun passed through a small window, giving light to the otherwise dimly-lit room. Much to the discomfort of the room\u2019s occupant, the sun shone directly towards his bed, specifically his face. Wanting to continue his slumber, Dick simply covered his entire body in his blanket. The sound of the doorknob being turned made him aware of someone's presence. But this was just a small victory against his menace that is early morning, as another obstacle would oppose his continued sleep, and this obstacle would prove decisive to him waking up early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furniture within his bedroom began to shake as an earthquake suddenly made itself known, yet Dick instead sunk deeper into his sheets, prompting to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the earthquake grew in magnitude, which caused most of the occupant\u2019s things to fall over. It then came to a sudden stop. A gigantic shadow loomed over half of Dick\u2019s bedroom, darkening the previously bright room. Knowing full-well what this shadow is, he made himself smaller by positioning his body to a fetal pose. Dick also tightened his hold of the blanket, he knows this was meaningless to fight against this shadow but what choice did he have? Comply? As if.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDick, Hey Dick, Wake Up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud yet feminine voice told him, the sound echoed throughout the room. Said voice would normally bring worry or fear to the average person but growing up with this loud noise for 14 years have made it a normal occurrence for him. Dick's only response to the voice was a quiet grumble. The object casting the shadow faintly sighed, the hot air collided with Dick's blanket-covered form, making him sweat a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily Thompson, the youngest child of the Thompson household, woke early in the morning as she normally does. After a few routine morning stretches, Emily decided to look at herself. Standing atop her pink dresser was a mirror, Emily stared at her reflection. Her pale mauve-colored hair easily reached her shoulders and slightly curved outwards, though some curved inwards as well. Bangs also covered her forehead. Emily noted nothing out of the ordinary in regards to her face, her hazel eyes, her clear skin, nothing exceptionally looked different. If it were another person, she would look like a beautiful 14 years old, but Emily is not a girl you call would call normal, far from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other reason to stay in her bedroom, Emily went out the door and into a room. Said room was only slightly smaller than her bedroom and was well-decorated, aside from that, nothing really special apart from the chair and table on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her towards the table and was able to whiff the smell of breakfast. Atop the porcelain plate was a mountain of pancakes and to her right was a glass tower filled with what appears to be orange juice, Emily licked her lips in anticipation of indulging such meals. But aside from the plate filled with mountainous amounts of food, she noticed was a small person, small to her at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Good morning Gerard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person standing atop the platform was an old man, grey hair adorned his head. The man's face showed signs of his old age, he wears the typical butler uniform of the Victorian era and he wears it with pride. The old man cheerfully returned the gigantic girl's greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you as well, Young Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled at the servant, she was about to start eating when she noticed someone missing from the table, particularly the miniature table atop hers. The girl asked the butler to her brother's absence, as he was aware of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that Young Master has yet to wake up. If you wish, I shall go and fetch him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need Gerard, I'd do it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chair was pushed back as she rose from it. Emily's footsteps were barely audible to her but for the butler, it felt like an earthquake. Seeing his services no longer required in the dining room, Gerard decided to do his other duties and leave the siblings to their own business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Emily was able to reach the door of his older brother. She turned the doorknob and entered the similarly small room, which looked the same as the dining room. It had a similar platform on the side of the room, which only reached just below her chest. Said platform was decorated in several furniture, a dresser, desk, computers, everyday regular furniture, and a bed. Almost every room of their mansion was designed in a way for Emily to interact and enter, this was planned by her parents to let her live 'normal life'. The bulge atop the sheets appears to be his older brother trying to escape the first stage of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily couldn\u2019t help but sigh at Dick\u2019s laziness. \u2018He may be genius but he\u2019s really lazy\u2019, she couldn\u2019t help but think of her big brother\u2019s flaw. In just a few steps, she was now atop her sibling\u2019s bed, her shadow loomed over Dick\u2019s sleeping form. But even with her telling Dick to wake up, he did not. \u2018How typical\u2019 Emily thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDick wake up, its morning already.\u201d Emily\u2019s long finger poked at the bed, making it shake and its occupant to shift his position. Since her brother did not wish to comply, perhaps she needs a bit more force to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. You left me with no choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick felt the blanket covering his body to be taken off. Instinctively, however, he grabbed the sheet and so was also lifted upwards. The sudden change in height had easily taken whatever drowsiness he felt out his system.  He continued to hang from his blanket as his body ascended, possibly to meet his younger sister\u2019s eyes. But much to Dick's horror, he's grip was slowly loosening. And then, his strength couldn't take it anymore and let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGravity instantly took effect, making his body fall. Dick saw his life flash before his eyes, as the floor was slowly getting closer. As he falls Dick lets out a blood-curdling scream. In his final moments, he closes his eyes, waiting for his body to collide with the hard floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, he didn\u2019t\u2026Literal milliseconds after he lets go of his blanket, Emily lifted her hand to catch the Affluent Progeny. Even with her palm acting as a safety net, Dick continued to scream as if his life depended on it, at least he thinks it does. It took him an entire minute to even process that he isn't dead yet. And when he did, Dick scowled at his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that necessary?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well~ You didn't want to wake up so~ I decided to just pick you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick, of course, had every right to get mad, but he knows Emily didn't really intend to cause any harm. But knowing if he shrugged it off, she may make it a habit, which may cause an accident if she weren't careful. So Dick prompted to lecture her about suddenly picking people up. In Emily's part, though it may have been an immature act, she saw it as the fastest way to wake him up. As Dick talked to her about what might have happened if she wasn't quick enough, her face drained of all its color, finally realizing the peril she had impulsively placed her brother on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, I just didn't think it through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the apologetic look on her face, made Dick smile. His younger sister has always been pampered and spoiled their parents and everyone else, even he was guilty of this, as such his sister developed a childish and naive mentality uncharacterized of her age. Even with all that, Dick knew that she was a good kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you understand. Anyways, just wait for me at the dining room, I'll just clean myself up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded before leaving him to his devices. Hearing the door close from behind him, he began to do his morning stretches. Dick tried to find appropriate casual wear, so he just settled with a t-shirt. Facing his personal mirror, he combed his light brown hair making it more presentable, he checked every inch of his face to make sure nothing was out of the ordinary. And seeing no abnormalities, he opened the door behind him and went into the long hallway, which was heavily decorated with portraits of all kinds. As he walked, servants greeted him with a smile, a smile he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Young Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to all of you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the sheer number of the estate's housekeepers, he perfectly remembered each of their names. Continuing to greet different servants as he went along, and finally, the progeny stopped before two giants doors, giant to him and the rest of humanity at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick entered the dining room and quickly locked his gaze onto his gigantic little sister. As soon as Emily saw the tiny figure that is her brother, she began to munch on the mountain of pancakes prepared for her earlier this morning. Dick still hasn't figured out how the chefs could make such large amounts of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his seat near the end of the long table, the one closest to Emily. Dick remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...If I was correct, you told we had something to do today, isn't that right Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at her brother confused, then the gears in her mind turned and she remembered what Dick was referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! You promised that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you promise her that you two would do?</span></div></div>",

Hannibal </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Mary Adamant Hannibal, a teenage girl at age sixteen, with brown hair that goes down to my shoulders, and stand at five feet and six inches. I've got a personality that's laid back, but also likes to have some fun. Guess that's why I got into video games at a young age. But enough about me, let's talk about my big predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts almost Thanksgiving. The holiday where families get together every year and talk about there lives to each other, maybe play a few games, and have a big dinner to end off the day. Well, if you family is \"normal\". Not mine. Not mine at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, my family isn't totally insane, there just more \"unique\" relatives, with high-end jobs, so they never really have a lot of free time. Not that my entire blood line is loaded with coins and dollar bills as far as the eye can see, just enough to live good lives, and my parents were no exception. My mother is a chef at a nice town restaurant and cooks at home to, like all the time, so we don't eat out that often. And my father is a sculptor, and not an ordinary sculptor. Once he starts his project, he finds random objects and materials until he creates, \"A Masterpiece!\" <br>\r\n... <br>\r\nOkay, he might be a little weird, but he means well, and is still a good dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, with introductions out of the way, this is how my story goes...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright, here is our first kaiju girl to pick from for our story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Reiko Samaki<br>\r\nKaiju Name: Reikozilla<br>\r\nAge: 13<br>\r\nHeight: 180ft<br>\r\nAppearance: Gorgeous brownish medium length hair with some braces holding them. Nice looking pale skin and green eyes, along with decent C-Cup breasts and a really cute butt to back it up. Nice balance on her body. Wears usually bikinis and also bras and panties made for her size, mostly pink ones. She is a human kaiju, so no animal parts here, but she does have powers.<br>\r\nPersonality: She is really a nice and gentle soul who is always kind and likes to help people with her newfound powers and size. She is however a total kaiju monster nut, and loves to roar and stomp around the city like Godzilla and act like him, though she is always careful not to crush anything. She doesn\u2019t mind people kinda perverting on her as she expects this given her size and limited cloth options.<br>\r\nPowers: She is able to roar like a kaiju. She is also able to breath underwater so she can go for long swims underneath the ocean. She can fire laser beams from her eyes and an even stronger variant from her mouth. Also she is impervious to many weapons.<br>\r\nBio story: Her mom was pregnant with her when she was working at a unknown testing facility in the fictional city of Shinka, Japan (fictional city bigger than Tokyo). They were currently working on some sort of kaiju DNA that would enable people to grow into huge beings in order to be used for the military. Many tests have failed and resulted in numerous deaths, but then one day a explosion happen in the facility due to a faulty machinery that was holding kaiju DNA, and it got all over the mom. Nothing happened to hear and a few months later she gave birth to her girl Reiko. Then in the next few years, everyone would find out that Reiko was infected with the kaiju DNA, and would grow to massive heights at a young age, and you can guess where this goes from here. Do I really need to explain everything? She grows big, government helps her bahhbahhhbahhhh. But it would be interesting how Reikozilla lives in her city as a kaiju.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanna use her?</span></div></div>",

This is my first interactive story on this site, so it might not be perfect. But this is basically a story about a random teenage girl that will grow as big as your heart desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I don't want to act like a prison warden, and I like to see the creative writing on this site, but I'm gonna sets some ground rules here so this story doesn't get out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">No short chapters:<br>\r\nI know some people can have a \"creative block\", keeping them from writing longer chapters .But I don't want this story to be filled with nothing but <b>\"How big will she get?\"</b> <b>\"What is her name?\"</b> or <b>\"Can I write a chapter in this story?\"</b> (even though I\u2019m also doing that). At least a hundred words will do for a chapter.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrew it, I\u2019m getting desperate. I COULD write some chapters myself, but I\u2019m <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a freaking idiot</span> in a writers block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1. No giant males:<br>\r\nSorry. Not against it, but we can\u2019t have that here. That's the way it has to be. You want a fifty foot tall dude,there are other story's for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2. The giantess must be gentle:<br>\r\nThis one is pretty straight forward, the girl must be a nice giantess. But that doesn\u2019t mean they have to be gods gift to the Earth. They cans be a little mischief, as long as no one dies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#3. Giantess must be a teen:<br>\r\nI mean, this wouldn't be <i>The Gentle Teen Giantess</i> if the giantess wasn't a teen.<br>\r\nJust in the range of 13 to 17 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#4. No full on nudity:<br>\r\nLet's not make her completely naked, that's just weird. Realistic, but weird. Her clothing can still tear apart when she grows, but let's leave her underwear intact, or at least put her in a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Don't get to <i>Sexual</i></span><br>\r\nIgnore this rule, this rule is dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should be all the rule's. Sorry to put you through that. Unless you skipped this description I work hard on (And I don\u2019t blame you) Ether way, please enjoy.</td>",
