What was always considered a boring normal town is now considered very special even if you still find it boring. It has been two years since the furry's appeared and built their society over the remains of human society and since then your small town has become a human sanctuary. A place where humans can live in peace and not worry about being captured or hurt, it is one of over 200 cities that... blah blah. All that really meant to you was that you went from living in a boring town to not being allowed to leave the boring town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne reason you hated the rule was the boundary set for the city made it so any hideout you had before the takeover was now off limits. You hated the rule but, you did obey until that one day you had a fight with your mom, over something petty it was an argument dumb enough that you didn't even remember the reason by the time you calmed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that moment of anger was enough to change your life as you decide you didn't care about the rules you wanted to go to your old hideout so you were going to go. You get out of the town and find your old hideout find that your comic collection was still where you hide it so you stayed there reading it you calmed down. That when you realized that in those two year you forgot how to find your way back home. So you walk the forest lost until you hear a rustling in the trees, as you cross a clearing, you look to see two eyes looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there in shock for a moment you were always told how big the furrys are but looking it in the eyes you knew it was far larger then anything you have ever seen. So you quickly turn to run away but it moves faster, faster is an understatement as it could outrun you if you both were the same size, It blocks your path and you now see that those eyes belonged to...</span></div></div>",

It enters the clearing blocking your path on all fours and eyes, sticking out from under a hoodie, that feel like it is stalking prey, until it looks you over then you and it's eyes soften. It hops forward into a squat and lifts the hood for you to see the the predictor was a female around 19 years old with black fur and dyed red hair and she had the biggest amber eyes you ever seen. she was wearing a dark green sleeveless and unzipped hoodie over a sports bra that was holding in some very large breasts. She had on spandex shorts and tennis shoes and appeared to be out for a jog. She sat there watching patiently as you looked her over then when she felt you had enough time she leans in to examine and smell you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she leans in she starts to talk to you, \"Sorry for that thought I found a little rodent (wild human) but your so clean are you a lost pet?\" You hesitate for a moment before saying, \"I'm... I'm not a pet but I am lost I am part of the human sanctuary.\" Her face lights up when she hears you. she starts a rapid fire of questions about like, how many people, do furry visit, do you like it, and so on. You answer her question the best you could and it quickly becomes a long conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explains that her name is Amber and that humans like you without pet tags are considered rodents and the finder can do whatever they want with them. Then she winks and informs you that means she is now your master unless she wants to eat you. Then she does a biting motion towards you to make her point. Intimidated by her remark you try to back up but she moves her arm behind you Then laying down she traps you in a circle she makes with her arms and she rests her head over her arm asking, \"Why are you trying to run?\" As you look her in the eyes you can't tell if shes playing or actually hurt so you apologize timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and forgives you as she picks you up and lays on her back before setting you between her breasts. When you land on her fur your so surprised by the softness that you zone out as your rub your face against it. She giggles and says, \"If you want to get friendly...\" Then she squeezes both her boobs together and jiggles them for a bit. Then after releasing you she sits up which causes you to fall in her cleavage. Then she just gets up and goes back to the path and returns to her jog she was doing when she originally smelled you. After her job she returns home to...</span></div></div>",

After about 10 mins she stops jogging and begins to walk. You are still stuck inside her cleavage unaware of what is happening around you but, at least the slowed pace allowed you to get your bearing. The only thing that you can see besides the furry mountains on either side is Amber's face which looked more beautiful the longer you looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she stops and tells you that we are here before reaching in to pull you out. You look at the house as she walks up and it was the largest building you think you ever seen. She brings you in and shows you the two bedroom house and you think its amazing how this house probably the size of your entire town is only considered cozy to Amber's size. She notices your reaction and finds it quite enjoyable to show you things she finds normal like her 30 ft TV, gigantic bed, and other things. When she is done she puts you on her couch's armrest and turns on the tv before telling you she will be back after a shower. You tryed to use the remote she left but, after realizing it takes your full body weight to change the channel you decide what she had on was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few mins you hear the shower stop and soon after she comes out with a towel around her head, for the long hair, a black t- shirt and skull PJ's. You stare for a bit before she happily teases, \"flattery will get everywhere, little boy.\" You blush and look away as she sits next to you. Then she picks you up as she moved positions to lay on the armrest. When she gets all settled in she sets you on her stomach. It was interesting sitting there cause the fur made it very soft and inviting but you could also feel under the coat she had pretty hard abs so you assume she often worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked if there was anything you wanted to watch and you tell her you don't know any shows cause your town hasn't had TV other then news for two years. So she flips through the channel and you both watch for a bit till you finally feel you need to ask the obvious question. \"Do you consider me your property?\" She mutes the TV and looks at you. As she sits there thinking you began to get nervous. Then to your surprise she asks, \"do you want to be?\" Then she goes on to explain that she can buy stuff that would allow you to move around the house freely and the pet tags are cheap. You think about it staying with her does sound very temping but  your family doesn't know what happened to you. Then you remember that Amber found you looking for a snack for all you know you really would just be answering if you want to be a pet or food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sees that its a hard decision for you so she says, \"I can't just let you back in the forest when it is so dark out so how bout this we have dinner, hangout till bed, then in the morning you can give me your answer.\" You agree so you both do just that, eat she is an amazing cook by the way, then she plays some video games while you watch then you both go to sleep her in a bed and you on a folded up towel on her night stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to Amber poking you. She brings you into the kitchen where breakfast was already prepared. You both eat and after the meal she asks if you made a decision and you say...</span></div></div>",

Amber sees this and gives a suggestion. \"I need to go to class this afternoon I can leave you near the sanctuary, you can tell people your fine, pack some cloths and leave for me to take you back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I just stay in the town?\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans in with a playful smile, \"well, then you would be a boring little boy.\" Then she heads toward her bedroom. As she walks away you watch her butt sway side to side in an almost dramatic fashion. Then after a few steps she stops and looks over her shoulder to say, \"You can't say no to this butt anyway.\" Your face turns red and you quickly turn away knowing that you fell for her trap hook line and sinker. She laughs as she walks away to go get changed and she comes back in with a black T, great looking jeans, Boots, and the green hoodie from yesterday. She grabs her backpack then you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe softly pets you as she takes you back home. Amber's petting and peaceful walking pace completely relax you to the point of barely staying awake. You look out at the city as she walks and notice for the first time that human really are just pets in this world. This culture shock starts to freak you out but, then you hear Amber softly shh you and soon her petting soothes away your anxiety. Soon she walks into a park and follows a walking trail but, after a while she goes off into the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe softly sets you down and points you toward your town then she tells you to be at this spot at 7 tonight. You thank her and go back into town to a mother worried sick. You get everything settled with the town your family doesn't want you to go but allow you to choose. So you leave with your bag and arrive at 6:45 at the meet up.</span></div></div>",

She was wearing glasses and didn't seem to notice that you were there so you took sometime to admire her beauty. She smiles as she turns the page and closes the book, then she turns to face you still hidden in the bushes, \"ready to go Jake or do you want to sit there staring at me some more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed you come out to say, \"I'm ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? I can do some poses for you.\" she moves onto her stomach then arches her back shoving her butt in the air. You look down as the heat building in your face from the embarrassment.

After seeing that you couldn't hold in your excitement was he really going to buy you. As a big grin formed on your face it ended up not lasting long as after looking at you a bit longer he stood up straight and walked away. After watching the wolf walk out of your field of view you went and sulked back to your bed. This wasn't the first time your hopes had been crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two kinds of human pets in this world the ones who are fine with being pets and others that aren't. You belonged in the category that being a pet was fine. You actually liked being around the giants. Sometimes some of the workers here would take you out for a little bit of fun since you've been here for 4 years. Even if you were about to be 20 the thought of playing hide and seek with someone much more bigger than you excited you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were thinking if you were ever going to be bought you heard a tap on cage. Turning around you saw it was the same wolf from earlier. You saw him open his mouth to say something but you couldn't hear him as the humans cages were built so neither human or anthro could talk to each other as sometimes problems would arise if they got into arguments. It wasn't long after though that you heard the door to your cage open up behind you. What soon came in though was a brown furred hand you were familiar with. Knowing that the hand was here to pick you up. Not wasting any time you got unto to palm and were whisked out of your cage and brought up to the face of the otter whose name was Geoff. He was one of the few workers here that would pay attention to you and play some games with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey looks like someone finally bought you I bet your excited.\" The giant otter told you as he rubbed your stomach with one of his fingers. You never really cared for belly rubs before but when it was by one of the giant anthros you liked the feeling of the fur against your bare skin. \"I am but I'm also going to miss you.\" You told the otter as you were reaching the door so you could meet your new owner. \"Don't say that we'll probably see each other again since your vet is going to be from this store so you'll he back every once in a while so I'll make sure to visit you when you're here.\" Geoff told you while flashing a big smile. Getting red with embarrassment you looked down at his palm left to wonder if the giant otter knew of your affections for him. You soon reached the door and you finally got a good look at your owner.

After you finished giving him a quick look over you noticed him walking around Geoff to get a look at you. \"You know if you want you can hold him.\" Geoff told the wolf as he looked at you intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.. do you think it'll be okay I've never had a human before but I have interacted with some before and the ones I have are a little nervous with strangers.\" The wolf said surprising you. Even though he could grab you and you would be powerless he still considered your feeling even though those weren't your feelings but still he tried. \"It's okay if you want I'm fine with you holding me.\" You said with a loud voice to the giant wolf. \"There you see you can't argue with the human himself.\" Geoff said as he handed you to the wolf. \"You're sure I can hold you right?\" The wolf asked with a slightly worried tone. This wolf actually surprised you, here you were thinking he would be a master who wouldn't care to much about your feelings but you were proven wrong. \"Yes you can I trust you.\" You told him. \"Ok then.\" The wolf said as he put out his palm for you. Geoff put you over the paw and let you jump down yourself. As you stood on the palm of the wolf he stared at you some more and when he was satisfied he told Geoff he was ready to take you. After Geoff finished going over the rules to the wolf over again about their human policy. The wolf had to sign some papers and then you officially became his. As you left the store in the wolfs palm at the entrance he lifted you up to his face. \"I know you probably heard my name already but I haven't really introduced myself my name is Rick.\" Your owner Rick told you. \"Well I have an actual name but my nickname from the store is squirt so you can call me that if you want or you can call my Eddy which is what the other humans in the store called me.\" You told Rick as you gave him a quick smile. Smiling back he said, \"That's good I'll decide what to call you later but now we need to go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His long, blond mane flowed from his had and down his shoulders and even under the chin, he was hairy and... a tad sweaty if your nose told you anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis guys kinda cute.\u201d The massive lion thooms overhead to the store manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You pay attention to what could very well be your new owner as he walks away and the first thing you can tell is her really is HUGE as you surmised before, standing a good foot or two over everyone else in the store. He was wearing athletic clothes, a tank top that showed his bulging pecs and draped over his pudgy belly, shorts that looked way too tight no matter what angle you viewed them from, from the back displaying the generously sized and perfectly round butt and to the from they hugged his equally jaw dropping manhood, they looked like they were practically painted on. Below was two pairs of athletic shoes, old, scuffed but large in their own right, they needed to be to cover such paws. Overall he was breathtaking, he was exceptionally well built with bulging muscles everywhere you looked but on top of all that he seemed to be mostly unaware of how stunning he was given the happy little smile he wore the entire time we was in the store, even as his giant, clumsy tail whipped around, knocking things off shelves. Needless to say you were very much infatuated with this unbelievably sexy stud of a lion and would have no problem calling him your owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s very good, would you like to hold him?\u201d The owner asked, scooting past the large bulge and belly of the lion to get to the human cages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! That\u2019d be awesome, thank you!\u201d He said excitedly, following after the shorter manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sat, a little afraid of what to expect as the owners large paws undid the latch on your cage and reached in to pick you up with ease before pulling you out. It was strange, seeing the store from a different perspective for the first time since you and your fellow humans were stacked there but you didn\u2019t have long to dwell on the thought before the manager spun around and raised his paws slightly to the lion who now looked even bigger than before as he loomed over you like a smiling colossus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure you support the legs, they can be a bit unsteady at first but after a while they get used to being held.\u201d He says, handing you off to the noticeably bigger paws of the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god! He so tiny!\u201d He says excitedly, holding you on the soft, doughy pad of his paw which matched the color of his nose. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute, I mean... like just look at how little his limbs are, I\u2019m worried I might hurt him.\u201d He says, gingerly cupping you in his paw as he pokes a plump, feline digit at you, trying his hardest to pet you with one finger but most of the time not even touching you at all. \u201cHe seems pretty calm.\u201d He says, after holding you a bit and truth be told you did feel pretty calm in his paws, you felt like you knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt you... intentionally at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, all of our humans are calm, we make sure to get the ones like that because we find they take to their owners easier.\u201d He says, speaking about your kind like they weren\u2019t sentient. \u201cThe rest we usually keep around for ourselves for some anthro training, getting them acquainted with the prospect of creatures bigger than them interacting with them. Some have trouble with the prospect but this little guy seems right at home with you. So do you think you\u2019ll take him?\u201d He says, smiling at the oversized cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, absolutely!\u201d The lion stud says, still kinda petting you sometimes with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent, I\u2019ll just put him back and get the paperwork and we should be good!\u201d And with that you are taken from your now owners paws and placed back into your cage and and carried to the counter where the two exchange paperwork for money and with a wave goodbye and a bidding a good day and good luck to the lion the two of you depart the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so cool little guy, my name is Roman, I guess I\u2019m your pet dad now.\u201d He says, chuckling to himself. \u201cI promise you\u2019ll love being mine, I already have a nice place picked out for you and everything, you\u2019re gunna love it!\u201d He says walking. \u201cSo, do you have a name or is that something I give you, do you speak much?\u201d He asks and you...</span></div></div>",

Her breasts were wonderfully sized. Not too big but you'd definitely get lost in those E-cups. Her legs were impossibly long, which was obvious to you despite the size difference. Her hair was long and jet black. Her amber eyes glowed beneath her hair too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there little fella. I'm Skylar. I've seen you a lot around here,\" she said to you with a small grin on her face, thankfully a gentle one. You were always shy around anthros, especially exotic animals like tigers. \"Um... hello Skylar. Nice to meet you,\" you replied quite meagerly. She reached through the cage and softly petted your head with a finger, which admittedly you like and made you smile. \"How would you like a home little guy?\" she asked, in a rather manipulative way knowing that you loved the petting. \"Yes please Skylar.

The husky slowly pads around the room in which all the cages were kept, inspecting each human individually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky disappears from view, and her footsteps halt.

Your stomach churned a little as Jane brought you up to her shoulder. Setting you on her shoulder, Jane began to stride out of the room with a sort of spring to her step.

I've been anticipating getting a pet for a while so I have a lot of stuff pre prepared. Speaking of pre-prepared things, do you want some clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod furiously in reply to the very rarely asked question between a giant anthro and their miniature human pet and by very we are talking about almost never asked like only happens every one in a million times an anthro decides to get a new pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting into your new wardrobe which is mainly comprised of loose fitting black T shirts and boot cut jeans with a couple black sweatshirts on there as well. \"You look nice.\" Jane said as you finished getting dressed \"sorry about the generic wardrobe, I wasn't sure what gender of human I was going to get and there weren't very many places that sold clothes at human size.\" \"Ahh it's fine so don't worry to much about it. Either way, this is basically what I wore before the whole, pets turning into giant anthros thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is very convenient, so anyway, back to the tour.\" Jane bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you would notice on the walls that there are a series of catwalks at about my eye level and when it crosses over the hallway or to something in the middle of the room, it will go over my head and down to the other side. Main use is to get around my house a bit faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Next room is the kitchen, again pretty obvious what it is used for but I have a small table set up there for you to use. Do you like the human food they gave you at the store?\" \"About fifty fifty.\" You reply truthfully. \"Ok then so I'll give you some of what I make for myself for meals for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Next we have the guest room but you really shouldn't have any need to go in there at the moment. Here's the living room, again pretty obvious what this room is used for but I do have a chair set there for you. Just FYI I control the remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Last but not least, we have your room or well, your part of my room. I have a room set up for you on my nightstand with a bed, a nightstand for you, a lamp, and a closet. Sorry I couldn't give you very many entertainment options in there but I did have a bay window in there so you can watch TV from my TV while I am rather gone or somewhere else in the house. Do out like it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, but I do have some quick questions and just say something if you aren't comfortable answering any of them.\" You say. \"Sure. Shoot.\" Jane replied calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ. How long have been wanting a pet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA. About a year or two now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQ. Do you own this house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.

Her hair is also red and reaches down to her back. Another thing that gets your attention is her humongous breasts. They almost obscure your view of her pretty green eyes. She bends down so that she's eye level with you and peers inside the cage. Along with her face you get a good look at her cleavage, which makes you gulp nervously. \"Hey there little guy.\" she says and sticks a finger inside. You step back, but she motions for you to come over. \"Its okay, I won't hurt you.\" she says. You slowly walk over to her massive digit and place a hand on it. It quickly moves above you and starts petting your head. You want to retreat backwards but are captivated by the feeling. You get closer as she continues and lean in for more. \"I think I'll take this one.\" she says to the owner of the store. You are snapped out of your little trance when she stops and walks away. She gives the owner some money and then comes to pick up your cage. The movement makes you nervous but she tries to calm you down. \"Its okay little guy.\" she says and makes some cooing noises. \"We're just going to your new home. She carries the cage to her car and places it in the passenger seat. When she starts the car it frightens you and you fall on your butt. This is the first time you've ever been in a car and the its scary at first. Looking toward your new owner you see her looking back at you before she turns to the road. \"Calm down, we'll be there soon.\" she says. Once the start is over the ride is quite smooth and you actually enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the ride stops and she takes your cage inside a building that you assume is her house. She sets you down on a table and opens the cage door. You stay inside but she gently tips it over and you tumble out. She lifts you between her two fingers and brings you to her face. Seeing her this close is a little overwhelming. She's gorgeous and looking down you see those giant breasts. Also behind her that bushy tail is swishing around almost hypnotically. \"So can you talk?\" she asks. \"Uh yes master.\" you say shyly. She smiles and places you in her paw while petting you. \"Good!\" she says proudly. \"Now you'll be a good boy right?\" You nod quickly. \"Yes master! I will! I promise!\" you tell her. \"Good, now just to let you know,my name is Veronica, but you still call me master.\" she says. You nod and look around at the room you're in, then find yourself examining her body. \"Hey now, looks like you love your new master already.\" she says with a grin. You blush and get on your knees. \"I'm sorry master!\" you say. \"Its okay, I don't mind.\" she says, then drops you into her cleavage. She squishes her boobs together before pulling you out. \"See?\" she asks with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night when its time for bed you find yourself in her bedroom on her dresser. She catches you looking at the bed and smiles at you. \"Sorry but thats my bed.\" she says. \"You sleep in the catch, but if you're a very good boy I may let you sleep with me as a reward.\"  She then turns and walks to the bed, showing her fantastic butt. Her tail swishes to emphasize it and you get a little aroused. This seems like it will be a good life. She makes sure you remember you're a pet but she's pretty open minded toward you. She even let you eat the same thing she had for dinner! It was so much better than the human food at the pet store. \"Good night little guy.\" she says and turns off the lights. You drift off to sleep happy about the day. The next day...</span></div></div>",

When she has her back to you her tail swishes back and forth, your eyes following along. When she's done she turns to you and grins when she sees you. \"Staring again eh?\" she asks as she nears your cage. She opens the door and reaches inside to scoop you up. She then walks you to the kitchen and sets you on the table. \"Okay, time for breakfast.\" she says. As she cooks your mouth begins to water at the smell. When its done she has a plate with eggs and bacon much bigger than you. She sets a few small portions aside for you and eats her own. You attack the food with gusto and love every bite. Having real food is so good! When you're done you look up at her and she smiles. \"Enjoy the meal?\" she asks. You nod with a smile and she brings down a furry finger to pet you. Once its close enough you can smell the faintest bit of bacon grease in the fur and can't stop yourself. You begins to lick her finger and she giggles in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica watches in amusement as you lick her until there is a knock on the door. \"Coming!\" she calls and leaves you on the table for a second. As the booming of her steps gets father away you are drawn to her plate. there are still some bacon bits on it and you greedily gobble them up. Soon there is a rumbling and you feel a huge presence behind you. At first you assume its your owner but it doesn't quite feel the same. You slowly turn and are faced with what looks like a pale blue under belly. Further up you see the belly belongs to a massive dragon woman. She's got sky blue scales and dark blue hair reaching down to her shoulders. On the sides of her head are horns that curve downward in a spiral. This new woman is even bigger than your owner, and you fall back in shock as she bends down to get a better look at you. \"Well hello little guy.\" she says. You tremble as her gigantic claws come down and pick you up. You are brought to her huge face and dangle in the air as she stares at you. She's actually quite good looking, and upon gazing down you see she's got huge breasts. Your thoughts are cut short when she grabs both your arms and begins moving them around like you're a toy.You feel like you're about to cry when Veronica comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Doreen let me show you my-\" she says but then sees whats going on. \"Put him down!\"she says and snatches you from the dragon. \"He's not a toy!\" Doreen folds her arms. \"I was just playing with the little guy. He's really cute!\" she says. \"Look at him! He's shaking!\" Veronica tells her friend. Doreen leans in closer and sees you trembling. \"Aww, I'm sorry!\" she says and picks you up once again. Veronica watches closely to make sure she doesn't do anything funny. \"I didn't mean to scare him. I was just checking him out.\" Doreen explains. \"Well just tell him you're sorry then.\" Veronica says. \"Okay, okay.\" the dragon says. \"Sorry little guy, but I'll give you a treat to make it up to you.\" Your ears perk at the word \"treat\". What kind of treat does she give you?</span></div></div>",

She allows you to see her underbelly, and further up she holds you over her cleavage. \"I think I'll let you play with me.\" she says. She then looks at Veronica. \"If its okay with your owner.\" The fox looks from Doreen to you and sighs. \"Okay, I guess he does need to unwind after you scared him like that.\" she says. \"You can use my bed.\" The dragoness carries you to the bedroom and tosses you onto your master's bed. You don't understand. She said she wanted to play but instead she's throwing you around. You start to get scared again, wondering what she'll do next. She then starts taking her clothes off and you wonder if she's going to sleep.The next thing you know she's plopping down on the bed, causing you to spring up and back down. You roll down the mattress and bump into her giant ass cheek. \"You must be a little confused.\" she says. \"Um, yes. ma am.\" you say. \"I thought we were going to play.\" She grins. \"Oh we will. Your little brain might not get it at first, but when your male instincts kick in you'll love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks you up and places you between her giant boobs as she lies on her back. You look around at the mountains on either side as she glances down at you. \"Climb them.\" she orders. You comply immediately, not wanting to make her mad. It takes a little while but you reach the top of her breast, with Doreen giggling the whole time. You see something big in the center and are drawn to it. When you reach it you touch it and it grows slightly. \"Ohh, keep it up.\" she moans. You do as she says and the things grows larger and larger. You feel yourself getting an erection as you do this. Your little human brain finally puts two and two together. This is her nipple! Upon realizing this you start gripping it tighter, sending shivers down her spine. You then nibble on it and rub your erection along it. Her giant fingers come down and begin twisting it, pressing you against it in the process. Her fingers are working her vagina down below and she twitches as she goes. She finally stops and pulls you away from her nipple. You look disappointed but she smiles. \"We're not done yet.\" she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother finger comes from her vagina and presses down on you. The juices cause you to stick to it and you are taken for a ride. You arrive in front of her snatch and she wipes her finger against it. You come off onto it and struggle to get free. As you do you stimulate her labia and she begins twitching some more. You break free but keep clinging to her labia. You climb it and when you see her clit you grab it. This causes her to spasm uncontrollably and she begins masturbating again. As her finger plays with her clitoris you also begin biting it, causing her to reach climax faster. When it happens she spasms and then a flood of thick liquid rushes out of her vagina. You fall off and land in it, finding it hard to move in it. From above you hear Doreen speaking. \"I hope you enjoyed that, because I think I want some more.\" she says. Just then booming footsteps approach and you look up to see your master standing over the bed. What does she say?</span></div></div>",

But she said it was okay if you had a treat! You begin to shiver a little but then look up again. She's taking off her shirt and pants. \"Damn it Doreen, I was going to make him earn this but you got me all horny now.\" she says. Doreen grins and tosses you down between her legs. \"Well I am your girlfriend after all, I'd like to think I make you horny.\" You stare from one to the other in confusion. Girlfriend? You don't have much time to think before your master plops down onto the bed. Now there is a giant on either side of you and you start to feel intimidated. \"He's a nervous little guy isn't he?\" Doreen notices. \"Thats good in a way.\" your master says. \"He knows his place.\" The two of them lower their faces to you and smile. \"This might be a little late but this is Doreen, and she's your master too.\" Veronica says. With two huge beauties this close you begin to turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning each one of your masters lowers their tongues on you. They lick the other's tongue with you caught in the middle. They separate with you wrapped in Veronica's tongue and she pulls you into her mouth. You are surrounded be saliva and giant teeth as she swirls you around. Soon her mouth opens and light floods in only to be blocked again. Doreen's tongue enters and they once again play with you together. Their tongues wrestle with each other and throw you around. You end up swallowing quite a bit of saliva but you find it actually tastes good. After a while you are grabbed by Doreen and she pulls you out into the open air. She lowers her head toward Veronica's boobs and begins licking her nipple with you along for the ride. \"Hey, start doing your part.\" Veronica says as she breathes heavily. Following orders you grab hold of the nipple and squeeze and bite like crazy. You and Doreen work hard as Veronica pants. The giant tongue lifts up and you are caught in a strand of saliva. You drop to the bed below and are between their massive pussies. The two of them move closer and you are mashed between their privates. As they make out above you their juices coat you and your arms and legs end  up inside the both of them. Soon everyone climaxes and you are laying in a puddle of mixed juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew!\" Doreen says as she wipes her forehead. \"Didn't expect to do that this morning. I'd say this little guy is already pretty useful.\" She scratches underneath your chin and you smile at the praise. \"Yeah, I knew he'd be a good little boy.\" Veronica says and also gives you a scratch. The fun ends however when they get up and begin getting dressed. \"Well now that we've started the day with a bang we should head to work.\" Veronica says. \"Maybe our little bed buddy would like to come too.\" Doreen suggests.

You get to live with both of them one day? This is great! Veronica is really nice and Doreen seems to like you. You are so glad the days of the pet store are behind you now. Not to mention you're hoping for more \"treats\" in the future. \"Well okay.\" Veronica says. \"Just be sure to keep him safe.\" Doreen gives her a kiss and picks you up. \"Don't worry, I'll take good care of him.\" she says and puts you in a small cage Veronica bought for traveling purposes. \"Are you ready little guy?\" she asks, and you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you find yourself riding in a car. You're still a little scared at first but looking up at your master calms you down. \"Almost there.\" she says as she puts a hand on your cage. Soon you come to a stop and she grabs your cage. After getting out of the car she enters a building and you look around. There are a lot of tables and chairs. There are even little sections near the walls where it looks like people can sit separate from everyone else. Doreen walks behind a long counter with stools in front of it. \"This is called a bar little guy.\" she tells you. \"People come here to have a good time, and I serve them their drinks.\" You look around and don't see many people. \"We're getting ready to open.\" she says. \"I tend to work varying shifts and today I'm on day duty.\" She sets your cage on the counter and begins rummaging around, getting ready for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumbling then starts and huge badger woman comes out of a door behind the counter. She's got long black hair with white highlights and a nice hourglass figure. \"Hey Doreen.\" she says but then she's sees your cage. \"Whats this?\" she asks and plants both hands on the counter. Its so sudden you are knocked to your feet as she lowers her face to get a better look. \"You brought your pet? You know this isn't the place for that.\" she says sternly. \"Come on Betty.\" Doreen says as she takes you out. \"He's perfectly sanitary and just look at how cute he is!\" She holds you up but Betty doesn't look impressed. You smile nervously and wave but she just sighs. \"Yes he's great but just make sure he stays out of trouble.\" the badger says. Another woman, this one a very chubby cow girl, walks over and gets a look at you. \"Oh he's so cute!\" she says. She's got shoulder length brown hair and enormous breasts. You get a great look at them before Doreen returns you to your cage. \"Thanks Bonnie. Veronica bought him yesterday and I'm just taking him out for the day.\" Bonnie and Doreen get to talking and it seems she works here too. You see them open the place for business and your day begins. How does it go?</span></div></div>",

From your spot behind the counter you see some people sitting there drinking as they chat with Doreen. Bonnie will also come up to the counter and get drinks to take to others. Every now and then she comes up to your cage and sticks a finger in to pet you, which you appreciate greatly. \"You doing okay?\" Doreen asks at one point when she has a break in customers. \"Yes master.\" you tell her. She smiles and reaches for a small plate to the side. \"Here you go.\" she says and offers you a small piece of what smells like onion, but its got some kind of bread on it. You taste it and then gobble it down. \"The kitchen's closed while we get some stuff fixed but we can still make some food.\" Doreen says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day goes on you sit quietly. One group of girls sits at the counter and one of them, a doe, sees you as they talk and drink. \"Excuse me, what is that?\" she asks Doreen. \"Oh thats my little pet. I brought him along today to give him a taste of the world.\" Doreen says. \"Can I get a closer look at him?\" she asks. Doreen smiles and puts your cage on the counter. The doe peers inside and grins. \"He's so cute!\" she says. \"He is kinda cute.\" her friend, a sheep girl, agrees. Soon all the girls are fawning over you and you love it. Doreen grins as she watches. \"The little guy just loves attention.\" she says. \"Can I hold him?\" a squirrel girl asks. \"Okay, but real quick.\" Doreen tells her and gets you out of the cage. The squirrel picks you up and pets you gently with a smile. You enjoy the petting and also the view of her breasts as she does so. When she finishes she sets you on the counter to watch you walk around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext the sheep girl picks you up and begins to pet your head. Everything is fine until someone behind the girls backs up and bumps into her. She fumbles with you but ultimately drops you forward. You're afraid you'll get hurt but land in her drink instead. As you try to get to the top some of it gets in your mouth and you find it rather tasty. Its sweet, and if you can recall you heard her call it \"wine\" when she ordered. You become a little greedy and begin drinking more of it as you float in the glass. Soon though you are fished out and placed on the table.\"Are you okay?\" Doreen asks worried. You feel great at first but suddenly start to feel a little woozy. The next thing you know...</span></div></div>",

Your dragoness owner lifts her hand with you still attached and brings you to her face. \"Oh he's drunk.\" she says with a sigh. \"Really? Can I see him?\" the sheep asks. Doreen looks hesitant but holds you out for her to see. As the giant sheep peers at you her squirrel friend nudges her. \"Jeez Wendy I know you need a man but getting him drunk?' she says with a laugh. \"Shut up Pam.\" Wendy replies with her own chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two girls banter they get your attention. You look up from your spot in Doreen's hand and see them shoving each other playfully. Your focus is brought to their breasts, which are jiggling slightly as they shove each other. In your alcohol ridden mind those breasts look very inviting, like giant pillows. With a drunken smile you jump from your owner's palm and land inside Pam's cleavage. The squirrel lets out an EEK and looks down. When she spots you she starts laughing and gets her friend's attention. \"I guess the little guy's feeling a little more daring.\" she says. \"I'll bet, with that liquid courage in him.\" the doe says and fishes you out. \"Stealing my buddy, Dana?\" Pam asks. \"I'm just giving him back to his owner.\" she answers. Before she can though you make another jump into Wendy's boobs. It feels like heaven. They're bigger than Pam's, and while the squireel's furry breasts were comfy, these woolly ones are divine. Its like cuddling with a cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little more playtime with the three girls Doreen finally takes you back. \"You should bring him more often!\" Pam says. Not wanting to draw her bosses attention Doreen puts you back in your cage. \"You're a popular little guy huh?\" she asks as she scratches your head. When her shift is finally over she heads home with your cage in tow. \"Guess you got an up close view of my job.\" she says with a smile. \"Lets just keep the whole getting drunk thing between you and me though okay?\" She pets your head before starting the drive home and you drift off to sleep.

I love you!\" she says. \"Besides, I'm sure our pet would love to see both of his masters first thing in the morning.\" They both look down at you knowing you're listening. You nod your head and are treated with a scratch under your chin. \"Well we wouldn't want to keep him waiting, now would we?\" Veronica says. Doreen puts an arm around her and they watch TV until its time for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your two masters decide to turn in Doreen says she'll stay the night. Veronica puts you back in your cage and carries you to the bedroom. She places you on the dresser and Doreen comes up from behind and hugs her. \"Come on, lets get to bed.\" she says in a seductive voice. Veronica sees the hopeful look on your face and bends down to your cage. \"Sorry, but you're not coming along this time.\" she says, much to your disappointment. She reaches in and pets you with a smile. \"Your little treats are just that. TREATS. We can't give them to you all the time or you would end up spoiled.\" she explains. You give her a sad look and Doreen leans in. \"Not gonna work little guy, so just bear with it.\" They head to the bed and she gives you a glance. \"Nice try though.\" The two of them start to go at it and you watch in excitement. When they finish the both of them lay there before Doreen reaches for the lamp by the bed. As she pulls the cord she gives you a wink. She must have kept the light on so you could watch!

I knew I would keep him close always, I love those pets, some can be mean though. Some are weird, my mommy said it was something I might think of when I was 13 or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      I finally make it to the store and immediately find a scared person in the corner of a cage. \"It's okay whittle guy, I won't let anyone hurt you again\" I put on a brave face for him and hold him against my chest, I walk up to the counter and stand on my tippy toes, \" I wana but this guy mista\" I say holding this up and bringing out my allowance. I have stuff already for him, my mom told me I would need to<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I get home I realize he is still scared, if I put him in his cage he might get scared.

You look down at the new pet shivering and pressing himself into your tail away from your face. You find the pointless attempt to be cute so you calmly introduce yourself, \"Hi I'm Alison, Alison Wolf but, I'm usually called Ali, I'm going to be your master now so I will take good care of you. Do you have a name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up at me as if he didn't expect me to talk to him. He still looks scared which is cute in it's own way and he softly answers, \"I... I was told... that I would be given a name.\" He says with his head down. \"So you don't have a name yet?\" I say mainly to myself but, he nods anyway. \"Well a cute little guy deserves a cute little name so how about Toby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toby?\" he replies and I nod with a big smile. \"I like it,\" he says with a small smile, it isn't much but your glad to see that he is warming up to you.
