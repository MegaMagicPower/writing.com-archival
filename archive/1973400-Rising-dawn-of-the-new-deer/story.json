Her loud crying had attracted the attention of a nearby hunter. within minutes the hunter found her and locked his inferred scope onto her heart. Kingsley's mother was then hit by a bullet.

Kingsley happened to be her second attempt in bringing a new life into the world. Her first fawn was stillborn and it broke her heart. It was many months before she decided to give child birth another try. She had her doubts that she could ever have a happy healthy fawn of her own so when Kingsley was finally born, it was the most wonderful of miracles. She hadn't felt this kind of joy in a very long time. A soft muzzle wiped the off the tears now streaming down her face. \"Why are you crying mommy?\" asked the young fawn. His mother just smiled, giving him a loving nuzzle. \"Its nothing,\" she replied. \"I just love you so...\" The concern in Kingsley's eyes faded, \"I love you too mama,\" he smiled. </span></div></div>",
