She browsed nearly every stand in the market even though most of them sell the exact same things for weeks sometimes for months.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zelda knew what and where to check in the market.  Just before she was about to leave a new booth caught her eye.  Zelda walked up to the strange booth. There was an old woman selling bottles with potions in them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome young lady what would you like to buy?\" the old woman said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I would first like to know what it is you sell here?\" Zelda asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes of course I sell potions that naturally make you stronger and wiser.\" the old woman replied showing the princess various bottles and vials. Zelda was a little intrigued by one of the potions the old woman showed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll buy this one then.\" Zelda said.  After making her purchase she walked toward the back alley and quickly uncorked the bottle she took a quick whiff of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww! This stuff smells horrible but if It\u2019ll make me stronger...\" Zelda said as reluctantly she gulped down the entire contents of the bottle.</span></div></div>",

The light disappeared as well the icy chill she had. Zelda examined her self for a second.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't look different. And I don't feel different.\" Zelda said to herself. Zelda turned toward the potion shop to ask the old woman about the potion. To her surprise the entire booth was gone as if it was never there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to this booth, I know it was here before?\" She asked herself. Her train of thought was interrupted by a noise.  Zelda identified the sound as her stomach growling. She obviously worked up an appetite for some odd reason.</span></div></div>",

Zelda approached the booth owner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness how may I help you?\" the owner asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I would like to buy 3 apples please?\" Zelda asked  \"Of course princess here you go.\" the owner said  After that Zelda paid him she started eating the apples.  Now Zelda normally measured at the height of about 5'11 but after that first bite she was now 6'2 and after her next bite she was 6'5 and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course growing at such a slow rate Zelda had no knowledge of her spurts. By the time she was finished with the apples she was nearly twelve feet tall. Still unaware of this Zelda went to another booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Pr-Princess c-could I he-help y-you?\" the owner of the booth said trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Zelda said looking down at the owner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing wrong with me now what do you want to buy?\" he asked her.  \"I'll buy a banana bunch.\" Zelda said.  By now Zelda was drawing so much attention with her large presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked at the (tiny well at least to her) bananas and ate them all in one bite.  Slowly she shot up another twenty feet. She was soon was as taller as most of the buildings in town.  Zelda noticed that her gloves were staring too rip.  Before long they were in shreds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso her feet were very cramped after awhile her shoes burst into a pieces. Leaving her barefeet on the hard stone ground. Her gold gear(earrings,chains and such) didn't grow along with her and broke off as well.  This left Zelda only in her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe after all this Zelda was no longer hungry but her thirst started to grow. Soon all she could think of was liquid. She thought of places were she could get something to drink.</span></div></div>",

I'm so thirsty...' and with a second thought Zelda bolted out of town toward the Lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally a trip to Lake Hylia on foot would take several hours but now that Zelda was somewhere between 35-40 ft. tall she was there before she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready seeing the upcoming Lake, Zelda broke into a spirit and completely destroyed the iron gate to the Lake with one stomp. She stopped just before the coastline and licked her wet lips and instantly placed her mouth into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drank and drank Zelda unknowingly did not feel her body continue to grow upward. Her arms and legs grew longer and longer with each drink. Her chest and torso also grew bigger and bigger as did her head. Also lucky for her, her dress seemed to keep up with the rest of her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed on and Zelda had drank about 1/4 of the Lake. She slowly lifted her head as well as the rest of her body and stood at her full height about 200 ft. tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow now that was a good drink.\" said Zelda happily and oblivious to her height. A few seconds passed and Zelda noticed that her surroundings seemed different, it was then she got a look of her body in the water's reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Goddesses...I'm huge! But how...wait it must have been that potion. As well as the food and the water. I must have drank a little too much water...\" said Zelda to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder though have the effects worn off now that I've had my full of water...\" she then glanced at the lake before her wondering if she should test her theory.</span></div></div>",

When she stopped she spat all the water back in the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it only works when I'm thirsty?\" Zelda thought to herself. She looked down at the lake traces of her saliva covered the surface. Plus her first drink left the lake looking pretty empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda left the lake her giant figure could be seen from anyplace in hyrule. She made her way across the field. She was right near Lon Lon ranch when she felt something inside her she started to yell in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice began to echo across the entire land. Windows broke ,animals screamed and the people began run into their homes. Zelda then felt something strike her in the chest she fell to the ground completely unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's humongus body began to glow black then a form just as huge as Zelda emerged from her body. She looked exactly like Zelda except she hand short thin brown hair, her dress had a greenish tint it, her eyes had a blood red color to them,and her skin tone was much darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Zelda examined herself then examined Zelda who was still unconscious. She then set her eyes on Hyrule castle. With an evil grin on her face she slowly walked toward it crushing anything she wanted on the way. </span></div></div>",

She had laced up boots, and a tightly tied dress that was tinted green. Her short brown hair was a constrast to Zelda's that gave her a wanderers look too.

Taking the time to destroy anything in her path. Even occasionally stopping to grab the odd Hyrulian and scarf them up into her hungry mouth. She felt like she hadn't eaten in forever. Had it been that long that her energy had been welling up and eager to escape into the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPasserbys could only stare in wonder as the casually stumbling mountain of a beautiful girl moved toward their beloved kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst of all, to the residents of the land, it looked like their own adored princess Zelda!</span></div></div>",

Each of her thunderous steps threatened to knock poor Link off his feet.  Link gritted his teeth as she came closer, desperately trying to think of a way to defeat his opponent.  All of the monsters he had faced before had a specific weakness, something he could exploit.  However, this new threat seemed to have no openings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now little man... you will die!\" laughed Dark Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink watched in horror as she lifted one large boot-clad foot over him, its large shape blocking out the sun.  As she brought her foot down with a crushing force, Link barely managed to roll out of the way.  Dark Zelda simply smiled and raised her foot again, toying with the small hero.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may only have one shot at this,\" thought Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink quickly unslung his bow and took aim with a fire arrow, at the same time emptying his mind as he called upon Dyn's Fire.  As Dark Zelda brought her foot down again, Link released his arrow, striking the sole of her boot.  Suddenly Dark Zelda's foot burst into flame as Dyn's Fire erupted from the arrow.  Dark Zelda yelled in response and began teetering backwards, trying to extinguish the fire.  Acting quickly, Link shot his Longshot at her opposite foot, he dug his Iron Boots deeply into the ground and pulled with all his might.  He felt the strength flow from the Golden Gauntlets he wore as Dark Zelda began to lose her balance.  With one last mighty heave, Dark Zelda fell to the ground in a resounding crash that shook foundations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time...\" thought Link, as he took careful aim.  He reared back and tugged on the Longshot, letting himself be pulled off his feet as the chain retracted.  Using the momentum he vaulted onto Dark Zelda's leg and began running towards her face as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Zelda was not impressed, not only had the puny man managed to damage her boots, but he had humiliated her.  She carefully rubbed the back of her head as she raised her head.  Suddenly she caught a glimpse of light out of the corner of her eye.  She gasped as she saw the small man launch himself into the air over her breasts with an arrow gleaming with holy light knocked in his bow.  The arrow flew straight and true as it hit her left eye.  Dark Zelda screamed in pain as she felt the light burn and clutched at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink managed to land on the ground with only a little damage and scrambled away as the giantess started thrashing about in pain.  While the arrow did damage her, it did not have the affect that Link hoped it would.  Dark Zelda was in pain, but she was still as strong and menacing as ever.  She slowly rose up, covering her left eye while her right burned with fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that last move, Link was out of options.  Suddenly he remembered an item he had picked up traveling in Termina.  Slowly and carefully he drew out the Fierce Deity's Mask.  Most of the masks he had obtained in his travels had been carefully stored away.  However, he did not dare to let this one out of his sight.  He remembered the one time he had dared to put it on and shuddered in fear.  He remembered being completely overcome with power, and anger.  Ever since then he felt as if someone else, another presence was continuously looking over his shoulder, a presence that radiated fury and uncontrollable power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink hesitated, waging a silent war with himself and was rudely brought back to reality by Dark Zelda jumping to her feet.

The dark giantess was rewarded with a sickening crunch as Zelda staggered back clutching her nose. Then Dark Zelda punched Zelda in the gut before kicking her on the side of the head. Zelda fell on her side and lay still for many long moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZelda! Get up!\u201d Link shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Zelda didn\u2019t.

She was just as happy being as big as she was without being a serious threat.

Before she knew it she was in the Kokiri forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered the forest most of the children ran inside their houses. Although she been to his house several times she did not know which house Link lived in. So she took a good look around and spotted a house that was difftent than the others it had a bridge conected to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Link lives in there.\" Zelda thought  She picked up the house and tuned it side ways and emptied it out. Tables,chairs,beds, and other furniture fell out before long a small Kokiri girl fell out of the house and landed in Zelda's palm.  Zelda stared at the girl for a moment. She was cowering in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'm not going hurt you.\" Zelda said. The girl didn't even look at her. Zelda brought the girl closer to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm not going hurt you so calm down.\" The girl stopped and looked at Zelda. <br>\r\n\"Alright\" the girl said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Zelda asked her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Saria?\" the girl replied  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saria huh?

Though Zelda was taller than Saria, Saria had an advantage in speed, from years of playing with her fellow Kokiri while Zelda was confined to the castle. As a result, the two were fairly evenly matched. Unfortunately, this spelled doom for the innocent bystanders, who were running in several different directions in a panic and often being crushed by Zelda and Saria alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a long battle, Saria grabbed one of the apple carts in the market and smashed Zelda over the head with it.  The blow to the head phased the princess enough that Saria was able to tackle her down to the ground and pin her, causing an incredible amount of destruction in the process as Zelda landed on a few buildings when she fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impa!\" Saria called, \"whatever you're about to do, do it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link struggled to get people to safety, all the while planning to have a little chat with Saria later regarding the damage she caused, Impa was on the verge of completing her incantation, which would remove Gannondorf's influence over Zelda and shrink the two titans back to normal size.  Unfortunately, just as she was about to finish the last syllable, Zelda came crashing down near her, knocking her to the other side of the market and knocking her unconcious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda suddenly screamed in pain and started to glow similarly to how Saria did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!

Before long Link was standing in a deserted  part of the forest. Suddenly hundreds of animals ran by Link. Before long Link could see the titanic princess walking through the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Hyrule! Zelda is that you?\" Link yelled. Zelda despite her large ears did not hear Link yelling. Zelda still seeing miles of forest ahead started running through out the forest franticly looking for Link. Link saw Zelda's colossal foot over his head before he new it her had been stomped flat by Zelda's foot. He was not dead lucky for him she out-grew her shoes or she might have killed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was bruised badly and unconscious. But he would be out for a few hours. Zelda didn't feel Link at all when she stepped on him. After all she had been stepping on trees rocks and other things.

Zelda expression changed from worried to discouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess he's not here. We should probably leave for now.\" Zelda said in a sad tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? Wait aren't you going to take me home?\" Saria asked  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You want to go home? But I want someone to keep me company. Don't you like it up here?\" Zelda asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the it is pretty up here and the breeze is nice but-\" Saria said before she was interrupted by Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat I'll take you back to the castle.\" Zelda said.</span></div></div>",

Link fell to the ground. Malon bent down hovering her humongous face in front of Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I did it. What are you going to do about it?\" Malon said smiling. Link got back on his feet drawing his sword in the process. Malon grabbed it off him and examined it for a second before tossing it off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww lost your sword did you? Don't worry you'll be seeing it real soon.\" Malon said giggling maniacally. She grabbed Link and tossed him in the same direction as the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye-Bye fairy boy!\" She said as Link disappeared into the distance.</span></div></div>",

I better be more careful next time,\" Saria rubbed her head, surprised that she would hit something. Lucky for her, she was only 5 feet away from hitting the ceiling. Link rolled his eyes while walking toward the pit of lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked down into the pit. \"Allow me to assist you.\" Saria picked Link up and placed him on her hand. All it took for her was one half stride just to get to the island in the middle of the pit. Link thought, \"Wow, now I don't have to struggle with all that platforming.\" Saria's feet took up the whole platform, so she couldn't set Link down. Instead, she put him on her right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria noticed the big head of the Dead Dodongo in front of her. Link talked into her ear. \"This is the part I'm having trouble on. The dodongo is supposed to lead me to a new path if I can make his eyes red.\" Saria responded, \"What new items did you pick up? Normally what you find is what's useful in a situation like this.\" Link's mind jumped with an idea, \"Bombs!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea Link! Could you please pass me a bomb?\" Saria asked nicely. Link fetched a bomb from under his tunic and Saria held it with her two fingers. The bomb looked like a blue berry when she held it at her fingertips. She simply placed the bomb in one of its eyes and, BOOM!! It's eye turned red. Saria repeated the same process. One second later, both eyes were lit red. The jaw lowered, leading a new passageway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink thanked Saria, \"Thank you! If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have ever figured that out. You can be of great use to me on this trip.\" \"You're very welcome Link! Do you want me to help you even further?\"</span></div></div>",

Link nodded his head, knowing that he shouldn't let a good arsenal go to waste. She set him down inside the Dead Dodongo's jaw, while she tried to scrunch in. Saria was amazing. Even as a giantess, she fit through that tight opening with ease. From that point on, Saria had no choice but to crawl on all fours. The ceiling was just above her by a few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Saria kept crawling, she felt like the ground was going to collapse. Link felt the same thing, too. Suddenly, Saria's tremendous weight broke through the floor. Link was screaming at the top of his lung's. Saria was able to catch him in mid-air and she landed on the ground safely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA square arena greeted Saria and Link. The land was a doughnut of earth and a filling of lava. A big lizard awaited them on the other side of the room. It looked enormous compared to Link. But to Saria, it looked like a mere dog that only went up to her waist. \"Aww, what a cute animal.\" cooed Saria. \"Don't let your guard down, Saria!\" Link yelled while on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard rolled over to Saria, but she easily pushed it away. The Dodongo King was bashed against the wall, stunned for a few moments. \"Poor thing. I hope I didn't hurt him. I'll give him 5 of these weird berries to make him feel better.\" Saria picked up the weird looking berries, and walked toward the Dodongo. It sucked them up like a vacuum, trying to suck up Saria in the process, but she was too big for him. The big lizard blew up a second later. \"Hmm, that's strange.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heart container flew out of him and Link was able to catch it, just by sitting on Saria's shoulder. \"Using those bomb plants was a good idea for beating that boss.\" cheered Link with confident joy. Saria felt weird within her, strangely.</span></div></div>",

It's not like me to kill something that is misunderstood.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you did was a good thing, Saria. The Dodongo King caused problems for the Goron race by eating all of their prime sirloin rocks. That big lizard was nothing more than a minion of Ganondorf.\" Saria wiped off the tears from her soft cheeks, and said, \"Now I feel much better now. Zelda sent me on this mission, for the sole purpose of stopping Ganondorf. I'm glad this deed was of some help to you.\" Saria stopped crying once and for all and a calm grin showed a more pleased Kokiri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two saw the light blue portal that would help them escape the dungeon. Saria picked Link up again and put him on her right shoulder. She walked into the portal. It instantly took the two heroes back to the entrance of the Dodongo cavern.

Aren't you going to eat it now?\" Saria kneeled down, looking at the small Malon. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a seemingly normal summer day in the kingdom of hyrule when suddenly, a message from the royal guardsmen came in from the Faron woods, alerting the people of hyrule castle that monsters were attacking the land once again. Impa was of course the first to hear these news, however with link and Zelda gone fighting off in the eldin caves, and Lana and cia going back to the valley of seers, she would have to settle for a squadron of whoever she could find. Impa ran around the town looking for anyone that looked like they could put up a fight. In the end, she had assembled quite the random assortment of team members, those members being one of the local store owners: Ravio. A proud and well renowned Goron soldier: Darunia. As well as the young girl who believed she was the legendary hero and had helped protect the town from total ruin: Linkle. This rag-tag crew was truly impas only option, so with sword in hand, Impa and her soldiers rushed out towards Faron woods, along with a few new faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much longer so we have to walk, Impa?\u201d Linkle said in a whiny tone \u201cmy feet are killing me!\u201d She added. \u201cWe will walk as long as we need to, we have to save the people in the woods, you call yourself a hero right? Act like one\u201d Impa replied sternly \u201cright, right, sorry... it\u2019s just, being the legendary hero is hard work!\u201d Linkle said, getting a little more cheer in her voice. The team had been walking for hours on end, as most of the horses they had back at the castle were severely injured after the battle with ganon, and so they all headed towards the woods in the sun on foot. Most of them were wearing there usual attire, with Impa sporting her armour, Ravio having on his trademark pink bunny costume and Darunia seemingly wearing nothing. However Linkle decided to change up her attire slightly for the mission, wearing her same green hood with her grandmothers compass, but wearing much shorter boots while having her dual crossbows strapped to her back instead. She didn\u2019t much like this way of storing her weapons, however Impa had told her it was more practical, and so just this once, Linkle had on normal sized boots, leaving much more of her legs bare. <br>\r\n\u201cYou know, if you\u2019d like, I can sell you this water bottle for only 10 rupees!\u201d Ravio said to Linkle from behind \u201care you really trying to sell our water to our own troops?\u201d Impa asked \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I brought this water from home, and this is a prime opportunity for profit, of course, the bottles need to be returned afterwards\u201d he said. Impa simply sighed and stopped paying attention to him. Linkle always thought Ravio was kind of funny, but he really reminded her of somebody for some reason, she brushed off the though after something on the side of the rode caught her attention. It was some sort of shiny thing, and she really wanted to have it. She separated herself from the group momentarily and went towards it, only to find it was some sort of blue crystal \u201coooh, pretty!\u201d She exclaimed as she shoved it in her pocket, not knowing the power it held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours of walking in the hot summer sun, Linkle, Impa and everyone else had arrived at the woods, everyone ridiculously tired, hot and drenched in sweat. As they arrived they could immediately hear fighting going on in the forest, it would seem this raid was being lead by the dragon knight of eldin caves: Volga, he had been searching many days for a worthy challenger, and a mysterious vision had told him that a woman with enough power to defeat him would appear in these very woods, he would use this opportunity to finally combat somebody worthy, and to do so he had to lure whoever it was out with this attack. A few bokoblin scouts had noticed Impa\u2019s party and ran quickly back to their master. \u201cSo... a sheikah knight and some cucco farmer are my only two options? Well then, send several units to attack, but don\u2019t harm those two, it wouldn\u2019t be a fair fight!\u201d He commanded, and his troops followed his orders by immediately charging out of their own keep and heading for our heroes base. It didn\u2019t take long before one of the goron captains Darunia had brought along noticed the all out attack on the allied base, he headed back and reported straight to Impa and the other captains. \u201cSo the dragon knight is leading this attack? This shouldn\u2019t prove to be to much of a problem if he only has bokoblins and lizalfos on his side, however, Volga is an extremely powerful man.I suggest we stay in groups just in case somebody runs into him.Darunia and the goron forces, you\u2019re with me, we\u2019re going to head east. Ravio, you take Linkle and the hylian troops and head to the west. If any of you find him, send out some sort of signal, alright?. Go!\u201d Impa ordered as she sent everyone into battle. \u201cWhy do I have to be supervised? I\u2019d be totally cool and fine if I went out on my own!\u201d Linkle complained \u201cyou\u2019re staying with Ravio for your own safety, Volga is one of the most dangerous men in hyrule, it would be unwise to go alone, now get moving, there\u2019s people out there who need help.\u201d Impa said with the same strict attitude as before. And so, the two units charged into battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is dumb, I can definitely handle myself, I\u2019m the legendary hero!\u201d Linkle said to herself as she ran along the bridges of the forest. \u201cOh come on, it\u2019s not that bad, I can\u2019t be that unpleasant to be around?\u201d Ravio said, running alongside her with his hammer. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that, I\u2019m just saying that Impa always treats me like a little girl, and not like the super tough and cool girl I am\u201d Linkle said with a smirk. \u201cWell maybe she just wants you to not die, not dying is pretty fun, and speaking of which...\u201d Ravio said as their group encountered a group of monsters, Volga being in the direct center of them all. \u201cWelcome, young challenger, today is the day we test your might and see if you are the one who can finally defeat me!\u201d Volga shouted, fire spewing from his mouth \u201cI think nows a good time to hit things, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d Ravio said \u201cyeah, probably\u201d linkle responded, pulling out her crossbows. Soon the two armies began to clash, with monsters and soldiers being taken down left and right. Ravio seemed to be doing alright with his large arsenal of bombs and ice magic. However Linkle was not doing so good, as she wasn\u2019t yet used to having to get her crossbows and arrows from her back instead of her boots. Even with this minor setback, Linkle was still able to put up quite the fight. \u201cYAAAAHHH\u201d Linkle screamed as she was hit in the legs with a boko club, this sudden impact to the legs had knocked both of her short boots off, leaving her feet bare, as socks had not yet been invented in hyrule. Even with every little twig and pebble poking into the skin of her feet, Linkle was able to take out many different monsters with her perfectly accurate and well timed crossbow shots. It didn\u2019t take long before all the monsters were gone, and the only one still standing was Volga himself. \u201cI see you have managed to dispatch of my men, no matter, now I can get a proper fight!\u201d Volga said with a wild grin, eager to have a true challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s five of us and only 1 of you!\u201d Ravio said pointing to himself, Linkle and 3 captains \u201cwell, four of us if you have enough rupees, but I doubt you have any!\u201d Ravio added, trying to profit as always. \u201cI have no interest in fighting any of you but the girl! My vision told me of a girl with extraordinary power who was destined to defeat me! However I don\u2019t see that happening, as I am a true warrior!\u201d Volga shouted, more energized then he had ever been before \u201cbut first, a test, just to make sure I shouldn\u2019t be going after the sheikah woman instead!\u201d Volga said as he reared his head back, preparing to launch his fire breath \u201cwhat do you mean tes-\u201c Linkle was cut off as flames enveloped her entire body \u201cNO!\u201d Ravio yelled in worry, but to his surprise, Linkle wasn\u2019t harmed at all, even her clothes were fine, however something strange started to glow in her pocket, it was the stone she had picked up from before, as well as her grandmothers compass, both glowing as bright as the triforce itself. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is this some sort of trickery?\u201d Volga asked with a yell, when suddenly, the stone attached itself into the compass, and the spinner inside it began to spin wildly around and around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light had soon enveloped Linkle completely, leaving Ravio more worried then he had ever been, and Volga excited for what could possibly be making his opponent for powerful.<br>\r\nSoon, this light began to expand, and everyone could only watch in awe as Linkle\u2019s body began to grow with it until she had finally grown to a grand height of 60 meters tall! (About 200 feet) Ravio and Volga, as well the other captains were simply speechless as they saw the little girl from before turn into a giant larger then anything they had seen before, even taller then hyrule castle itself. What did Linkle do first with her new size?</span></div></div>",

At first, she twisted her head, braids cutting through the sky - she couldn't see anything but the tops of trees and clouds. But once she looked down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" She cupped her massive gloves to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lush green fields of the fair Faron Woods spread out before the curious little Cuckoo farmer's high-stretching form - her own traditional emerald tunic and brown pants joining the majestic trees' leaves. She stepped back, old oaks and elms quivering against her legs - fairies rushed out in surprise, fluttering by her pointed ears and outstretched eyelashes. Everything was there below: tiny captains and worn soldiers staring up at her; Impa and Darunia's forces in the East; monsters rushing for cover to the Dark Forest Keep, beneath gnarled growths that brushed by her knees and waist. Bursting with amazement, the \"Legendary Hero\" leaned in - the entire forest caught in the shimmer of her blue eyes as she breathed it in with excited gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn days before the wars, Linkle's grandmother used to tell of an ancient warrior who descended from the skies upon a great bird. She wondered: is this what he saw? A sight reserved only for them... and balloon-mounted mapmakers. The smile across her face - able to swallow a man whole between her sweet lips - cast a bright, radiant eclipse over Impa's ragtag squadron and Volga's incursion alike, blocking out the scorching sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir collective silence concluded when the girl jumped into the air, fist pumping up. \"I'm... <b>huge</b>!\" For a second, anyone looking up could see dirt embedded into her battle-weary soles. They braced themselves as she landed - a mighty quake shook the battlefield, knocking men nearby, rattling armor and shields for meters around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hylian's giant jaw fell: that jump, alone, could stun them? She stood, in awe of the sheer power at her disposal... and not just a little cocky. A second wave of the monster army approached, having seized the nearby outpost. \"Don't worry, everyone, I've got this one covered! Linkle, ho!\" The Hylian shouldered an aged tree's side, sending it crashing with a resounding SNAP - and blocking the reinforcements' approach. With another troop approaching, she stomped the narrow path - Lizalfos slamming into the side of her sole. Their bites and swipes were harsh; but a simple kick sent them flying into the leaves around. She felt some of the keep's walls shatter on her skin; but what did it matter now? They had to make way for the hero!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirt clumps accumulated in her wrinkles and under her nails from the intense fight rained down indiscriminately on the captains - though to her, it was like twigs falling from her feet. The strong, earthy odors of the forest mixed in with the hours of hard work she'd put in the earlier fight, for a nostril-cleansing experience for the rushing soldiers. Ravio dashed left and right, clutching to his bunny hat - trying to pick up the products he'd dropped from her step, while dodging roots and branches uplifted by her stomps. The heroine's unwieldy, trembling legs carried a layer of perspiration from the long and warm travel. If only she'd agreed to buy some water from him, the heat from her toes wouldn't be so sweltering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa said that they should stay together for safety against Volga; but was <i>Volga</i> really the biggest threat here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavio stopped. In this chaos, within the feminine shadow, he noticed something jutting out. \"Hey, watch out - below you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HRAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crimson dragon rammed into Linkle, tackling her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHylian recruits screamed, diving for cover from the oncoming bottom - her own eyes wide in surprise. Her chestnut shorts fell into the soil, dragging dirt from the sheer force of her opponent's charge. A trail of allies dodges swiftly - pots of munitions shattered within the folds. Pain shot through her stomach. \"Thanks, Ravio... Geez...\" Her groans rattled the Faron Woods. She clutched for her opponent, cheeks red with tension and embarrassment. When her 19 meter long arms extended, the man returned to his human form, flipping back. Volga slipped between the tree-like digits, landing right by her sun-kissed thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barked: \"Is this my promised challenge?\" He twirled his spear, gazing at his opponent from behind the mask - and charged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrgh - was he underestimating her, too? She brought her thighs together, squeezing his armor with both great pillars. Earthy soil gathered up along them, tickling the sides. The sound of armor crushing against itself dominated the air. Even the immense strength built up in his biceps, of which he was justly proud, were naught before the muscles in her legs. In the middle of the crushing pain, the miniature army's leader laughed. \"Ahah... Yes! This heat in my blood, it's so... fresh!\" With both shoulders, he struck the skin away, using her sweat as lubricant on his sturdy armor to leap out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavio, just wanting it to end, charged to intercept the knight - only for his flaming breath to dispel the merchant. \"Coward, you are of no use to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped, recovering to her majestic height, ready to avenge her friend. Still not used to her weight, she waved her gloved hands for balance, causing miniature sonic booms. \"Whup!\" The Faron Woods' West Square bore a permanent imprint of her buttocks and shapely limbs in the ground. The simple action traced every intricate detail of her round rear below, and filled it with a puddle of her feminine fluids. The embarrassment made her pull her braids. Clutching her compass, she shouted: \"Impa! Are you watching? I'll stop Volga, and save you all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Eastern Tree, the Sheikah was panting, surrounded by Lizalfos and Bokoblins. With a steady breath, and thoughts of the princess on her mind, the royal family's guardian shouted a war cry, and swung her Naginata. Enemies screeched, backing away - rushing to their master for aid before the blade touched them. Impa glanced at the towering ally between blows. At first, her mouth had fallen agape. Now, the girl served as a beacon. It appeared that Linkle's growth - her compass gleaming - had boosted the soldiers' morale. \"Hah... 'Legend' or not, Hyrule has a great asset in her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking aside a Bokoblin, Darunia put a hand to his hip in pride. \"She's even pulling off a Goron Pound! Haha, what a brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goron Pound?\" The commander winced at the sound of metal clashing. \"...Oh, Hylia, please no!\" She covered her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mix of a song and a battle call, Linkle leaped again - remembering the strength it had last time. The wind from her spring blew blades of grass clean off. This time, she aimed right for the Dragon Knight! Her round heels, with murky sediments squeezed within the creases of her skin, practically gleamed with energy in the warm sun. Volga stood ready, his mask tilted upwards for the blow, spear ready, boots firmly in place. \"<i>Face me!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Slam.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs descended, outstretched toes greedily digging into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething scrunched beneath her - and she twisted on it in satisfaction, feeling the call of her precursors pushing her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the dust cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sting on her toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolga had dodged the attack, and was fighting back already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soldier lay near her low arch, grunting, mere seconds from death beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unglued her foot from its deep crater , her pulse quickening, and her eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Oh, no!\" The Hylian's mouth spread out in the sky in disgust and horror, her call making Cuckoos rush from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavio had pushed the soldier away, in a rare moment of courage. And now, his body lay sprawled, stuck to the sole of his ally, having joined with the dirt and ruins accumulated in her relentless rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle pulled him out, resting his little body into her leathery gloves. Her soft lips trembled. His thin, fragile limbs hung as loose as his scarf, his bunny hood drooping over his head. Her spirit sunk, the tree trunks twisting around her in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Retreat!\" Captains called their subordinates to move, lest they join the multitude of twigs and boulders between her toes, or get caught wading in the translucent pools of perspiration forming in the soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers were running from her. \"No! I just wanted to...\" She reached out, crashing into leaves. \"...I just had to be the hero...\" Her hand sunk, her breaths heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother swipe from Volga's arms, below, sent her crashing backwards. Her rear smashed into a sturdy tree, shattering it against the cheeks. \"Hmph, what of that fool?\" He transformed into a dragon , wings blazing in the air. \"You and I are of the same kin - deadly warriors! It is only natural for the weak to perish to our blades!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terror, the giantess dodged the beast's rocketing dive. \"No... No, I'm not a killer!\" She ran. She ran as fast as she could, carrying the unconscious Ravio in her hands - praying to the spirits above that he was okay. The knight took chase behind - she hastened, plowing through trees, the crunch of leaves beneath her a disgusting sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRopes of the young woman's braids crashed above the branches. Her unfettered toes quaked as she stepped, sending tremors over the soft ground and uprooting tall grass. With every lift of her muddied heels from the soft soil, she brought men to their knees, their weapons dropping. Every stomp brought tiny sprays of her sweat trickling down over their heads, and left a great footprint in place. She dodged them, her breaths stinging her, navigating the forest's curves - without her trusty map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone in the Faron Woods could help him - she knew. With deep breaths, Linkle ran towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Thud thud THUDTHUD</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the swiftness of an arrow, Linkle's heels bounced over the trees. Her bare toes plowed loose branches and shrubs, or else trampled them beneath. Like twigs, they broke off and joined her muddy soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clutched her fallen ally in her glove, close to her rattling compass. The Great Deku Tree was in the massive Hylian's sight. Impa's forces had a barricade set up there. Ravio would be safe there, under the Forest Guardian's protection. The fluttering leaves and age-old bark glowed in her blue eyes - distorted by small tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't supposed to happen. It wasn't fair. He'd rushed his life to push a soldier away from under her foot (HER own foot - the blonde shuddered). And what did he have to show for it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fix this...\" She gulped down her doubts. This couldn't be real. Any time, she told herself, Ravio would wake up, ready to cheer her on. But each time she looked at the salesman, he was limp as always - color draining from him. Her teeth chattered in the fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, Volga rushed in hot pursuit. His blazing spear sliced the uprooted and fallen trunks in her wake. \"Fool. To deny the combat's heat in your veins...\" He shouldered an oak flying at him, smashing it to splinters. \"This 'Legendary Hero' spits in the face of destiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead shaking, Linkle didn't even look over her shoulder. \"Is fighting all that matters to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fury, he blasted out flame balls. The projectile hit her immense backside, still holding debris from the old fort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyah!\" Pain jolting through her expanded nerves, the gigantic Hylian stumbled. Thankfully, gentle leaves broke her fall; otherwise, a whole fort might have disappeared under her. The passenger in purple was still safely in hand - but growing paler by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out her crossbow with a free hand, firing arrows at the red-armored man - which he swiftly dodged. Frustrated, she slammed the weapon into the ground. With a <i> splat</i>, its brown surface stuck deep in the dirt, blending in with the roots and growths surrounding. The structure formed enough of a roadblock to stop him. With the post off her tail, she continued to the heart of the Faron Woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come back for those later.\" She nodded. It didn't matter what weapons she had. As long as her grandmother's compass hung on her neck, and the traditional green tunic blessed her immense frame, she was still The Hero - and The Hero had to save people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon Knight took heavy breaths, kicking the side of the structure in frustration. It'd take at least four grown men to operate that crossbow, let alone move it. Calling a Bokoblin scout, he sent a signal: \"Block off the sapling. Don't let that coward escape me.\" From every bush and grove, across the natural canopies, his soldiers slipped in. Arms crossed, he stared at the sky, and the blonde hair overtaking it. \"Gods, you promised me blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growths tangled and twisted around them. Old bark and stone structures, glorious and vast to any normal Hylian, cramped the immense archer. She could barely turn here without her elbows colliding with elderly oaks and birches; protective walls collapsing against her bare ankles; or scores of ragtag combatants falling in her footprints. Try as she might to weave between the tight spaces - keeping her head down to avoid bumping it - the humongous Hylian's frame tore the natural landscape of the western woods' reaches. Debris on her soles fell, leaving more roadblocks in her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarger timbers blocked the path ahead. Turning on her heel, she slipped, before leaping up straight again. \"Can't go by here, so...\" She pointed to the north. \"I'll take another route!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last Lizalfos, panting, collapsed from a blow of Darunia's mighty hammer. He pumped his hammer in the sky. \"Hah! Try again after some Death Mountain training!\" Finally, the Eastern Tree was secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa, tending to her minor wounds, wiped her brow. \"No sign of Volga... We can guess he's met up with our 'brothers'. I can only hope he hasn't bought Ravio off.\" She gazed at the moving mountain, shaking her head. \"Where is that girl running? Is there something at the Dark Forest Keep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of their discussion, a messenger rushed to her, so hurried that he stumbled on roots. \"Ma'am, swarms of monsters suddenly started attacking the Great Deku Tree! We're getting overwhelmed here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sheikah finished applying her bandage, and grabbed her Naginata. \"We'll converge there. Let the other forces know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling his forces to roll out, the Goron chief crossed his arms. \"You think our 'hero' can handle it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa brushed her bangs aside, and smiled. \"I believe <i>we</i> can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, this isn't funny!\" In the winding woods, Linkle glanced left and right, keeping her shoulders tucked closely to her torso. What was once a straight path grew more and more twisted with each stomp. Even when she took \"shortcuts\", kicking and punching dead wood to thousands of splinters, she didn't recognize anything about the tiny surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gotta be this way! Please...\" She held tight to the compass, staring at its needle - and making sure Ravio was secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growing humidity, combined with her own body heat and sweat washing over the area, made the ground muddy and swamp-like. Her soles dug deeper in the ground with each step, scattering insects from their groves. She found herself moving to a slog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the shadows, a loose Aeralfos swooped forward. The Hylian was too firmly rooted to dodge in time. From a series of intense blows, Linkle fell down, crashing through rows of branches and walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crack-crack-crack-THUNK.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer torso crushed 40 square meters of land, encompassing the entire Dark Forest Keep. An immense tremor shook the woods, blowing foliage, and stunning scores of soldiers from both factions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she rose, avalanches of dirt fell from her body. A large portion of the enemy army had perished beneath the blonde's bosom. \"I don't have time for this, guys!\" With her face red and scratched, the green giantess spotted - and swiftly kicked out. The side of her foot squashed him into wood; when she pulled it back, the trunk bent, and toppled. It hit and crushed several more pieces of foliage, revealing a clear path for the Great Deku Tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed a short \"you found a secret\" jingle, and dusted herself clean with a free arm. But when she brushed her chest, cleaning it of debris and monsters' weapons, something was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma's compass! Not again!\" Linkle slapped herself. That treasure was proof of her status as Legendary Hero. Every one of her astounding victories, she'd won thanks to its magic... Panicking, she overturned massive boulders, shook branches clean of leaves, and dug up the ground. \"I must've dropped it in the ground! Or did it snag on a branch? Or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her breath short, she sunk her head, closing her eyelids. With a deep breath, she placed a hand on Ravio's loose hat. \"Later.\" Hood tucked on her, the Hylian left the keep, making her way for the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road forward was straight. With a skip, hop, and a stomp, she could hit the wooden Forest Guardian in moments. But there was a big problem for the big cucco farmer: when she stepped just north of her destination, scores of Hylians and Lizalfos were during at her bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for an empty spot, she tried to step into it. But no matter where her boot landed, many allies would fall under it. Cupping a hand, she screamed down: \"Hey! Hero coming through! I have to save someone!\" Some of the combatants fled; but many were too wounded to move, and simply accepted their fate. The titaness leaned closer, scooping them in her gloves - but she couldn't hold them all. And, she wondered, could air travel do something bad with their wounds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering down to a captain, the girl's huge braids swayed, bending old branches. \"I can't get in without squishing someone! Please carry Ravio and the others to the Deku Tree!\" She lowered her leather gloves, showing the wounded warriors to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe backed away, knowing the fearsome carnage this titan wrought upon the West Square's monster incursion. \"The raid captains won't let us breathe! If we abandon our posts, there'll be nowhere for them to rest at all!\" He pointed to the approaching waves of green lizard-people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...\" She shifted her warm feet, shaking the surrounding soldiers with it.  If she fought here, she could hurt someone - or defile the forest's magical growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaiders approaching, clanging their swords against steel shields. Desperate allies in her unsteady hands. Soldiers below, people she knew from the village, who could get hurt just as easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to grumble. Linkle made her decision:</span></div></div>",

And a hero's destiny is to save people!\" Linkle clenched a fist in resolve - before feeling a dry crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the people held in it, the Hylian quickly uncurled her giant, shaking fingers. Everyone looked in stable condition, if startled. Except Ravio; he didn't move beyond an occasional breath. It was as if he were asking, \"what about saving me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering herself to a knee, the blonde loosened her grasp, letting them slide off near the guard. \"Please, get these guys in, I'll handle the rest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teammates carried them to safety, under the Great Deku Tree's watch. The minuscule soldiers' silence was a cacophony to her pointed ears. Their tired stares burned into her head. That flame only grew as Bokoblins, Lizalfos, and Poes approached, seeking to seize the safe zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been given the perfect opportunity to make up for her accident. To save them. And to prove herself, too. If she kept her distance, she'd be doing her part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle dashed towards the onslaught. Her immense soles pounded like war drums. The monsters shook from the immense quakes, paralyzed. She stopped, breaking on her heel; mudslides covered the first wave of troops. The dirty heel's flesh collided with the rest of them, dragged across the ground, their armor twisting. She charged a stomp, lifting her knee in the air - but remembered what happened last time. The feeling of living things scrunching under her skin gave her goosebumps. The foes took advantage her pause to hack away at her ankles, scratching the soft surface. Hylians and Gorons watching called to her: \"Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a decisive nod, she swung her foot, and simply kicked the monsters. The heaviest of them went flying; lighter ones rocketed to the stratosphere. Shrill echoes of the enemies' voices faded into the distance, as they fell into tree leaves, incapacitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA battle cry pulled the titan's attention behind her. Soldiers remaining on the field were clashing swords with Lizalfos, numbers slowly dwindling. Turning on the ball of her foot, the archer leaned down, and uprooted huge chunks of land out from underneath the combatants. Soil sifted through her gloved fingers as she lifted them up. Each of them shook, unsure of her tactic. She plucked up her allies by their helmets, resting them in her compass-less chest. They tickled slightly; she struggled to stay still. As for the enemies, she lifted her hand to her face, her huge pink lips looming above them. They puckered into a narrow aperture, before she blew them off. Like leaves scattered to the wind, the monsters fluttered into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, that's more baddies taken care of...\" The green-hooded girl pumped a fist, and lowered herself to the ground. The combattants descended from the soft platform, giving various cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such strength!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not crushing any of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle itched at her locks. \"Guess I knocked you guys out of position...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scout called. Some marched to the west - their protector followed. Another crowd of beasts approached, having found their way around her footprints. The colossus simply glared at them, standing to her full 60 meter height, and stomped on the ground. They examined the behemoth: from rope-like golden braids; to her flowing emerald tunic; to her bare legs and feet, marble pillars in their own right. Instantly, the beasts fled, taking cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped her hands in satisfaction. \"Looks like that's the last of them!\" But as soon as she said that, something rang by her ears. She turned. A crimson figure tore through the treetops with outstretched wings, hurdling for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa and Darunia's troop made it in, helping their wounded return to the safe camp, and picking off stragglers. The immense warrior provided a new shade for their tired bodies, along with the existing, rustling shadows of high-reaching leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they entered, the sight of healing men and women made the Goron sob. \"Brothers... You've fought well!\" He beat his chest in honor, brushing a rocky hand near them. \"I love a good, burly brawl as much as anyone - but Volga's gone too far!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShouldering through men, trying to get a closer view of the situation, the Sheikah heard an odd murmur. Ravio rested, stiller than he'd ever been, with a soldier at his side. As she tilted her neck in question, the slightly bruised trooper explained: \"Th-that girl in green! He... She was going to crush me, but he pushed me away...\" Upon further examination, the merchant's scarf had irregular tears, in circles; as if something had pressed and twisted against his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a lengthy look at the two, before marching North, wordlessly scowling. That gigantic young woman was there, fighting even now. To think, she'd raised the troops' morale minutes ago... Now, her allies cringed with every pound of her sole. The commander had to stop her somehow - or learn more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thundering steps were unsteady. The towering knees and shins tumbled around the Great Deku Tree, knocking over oaks and elms. She peered up, and a flash of burning embers made her wizened eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Volga!\" Linkle's shout cascaded throughout the branches, rousing flocks of owls and Keese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her titanic arms swung out to grasp him. The Dragon Knight arced his flight underneath it, and blew a ball of flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering Hylian extinguished it with a wave of her arm. \"This isn't the time! Stop it!\" She slapped him out of the sky with a wave of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding in a tree, the warrior panted, reverting to his human form. \"Rrhh... First, my forces attack you, despite my directions... Now, you continue to deny my destiny.\" He snarled in fury, leaping for her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't dodge in time; the man had grabbed her right braid, and slashed her cheek. \"Ow! Just quit it! I won't hurt anyone else!\" She shook her head, swinging it around left to right - the gusts blowing her opponent off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't escape it.\" He performed a three-point landing on a branch, puffing embers from the sides of his thin lips. \"The prophecy said a woman would appear with the power to defeat me - so show your strength!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle-thirsty man lunged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farmer stood strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Clang.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis blade hit another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolga's bone helmet lifted. \"Hrrmph.\" He swept his spear to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa had parried his blow with her naginata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle stamped her feet, caught between embarrassment and relief. \"Impa! I-I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw Ravio.\" The older fighter didn't look up. \"Don't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gulped. Was the commander angry? It was only right, after all the damage she caused. But then again - what about everything she'd done to help the Deku Tree?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an open stance, the enemies' leader started to laugh. \"Hah, a duel? At last, someone with honor.\" Spear twirling, he lunged ahead. \"I've found my foe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey clashed near the colossal foot, trading blows. Amid swift strikes, the dragon warrior scaled the towering toes for a height advantage. The farmer tried to wiggle him off - but his footing was steady. In response, the princess' guardian leaped from trees, landing on the archer's belt. The titan struggled to stand in place - wanting to offer support, but knowing how much of a danger every twitch was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson wings swept around her armpits. Impa's boots scaled her chest. They swung at each other across her elongated limbs; they dueled atop the golden fields of her braids; and they even fell into her shirt. She groaned at the sensation of their bodies on her skin, facing downwards. A little tug - Volga was grasping to her soft, bulbous breast for support. \"I'm - I'm a hero, not a battlefield!\" She nearly swatted the itchy spots on her skin, but held back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the grey-haired woman made an exit through her collar. \"He's vicious... No matter what size.\" She stood vigil, watching for her opponent's next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the side, the red-clad knight blew a great breath of fire. It spurted out with searing intensity<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" The princess' servant dodged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Linkle swept her arm in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames caught on a tree's leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen on a large, dry branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a blink, the Hylians' safe haven became an inferno. Burning odors tainted the fresh air. No matter where she looked, there was searing fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attempted to blow it out, or spit on it; but the wind and water only intensified the all-consuming embers. She stomped out trees, snuffing the blaze under her bare feet - cringing at the heat. The dead wood continued to burn, feeding the devastating forest fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left! Soldiers, to the river!\" Impa shouted commands, rushing for barrels of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarunia hurled rocks onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolga took flight - but a falling branch fell on him. It weighed him to the ground, trapping him at the Cucco farmer's feet. \"This... isn't the end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavio choked, his breaths growing unsteady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cuckoo farmer shut her eyes, not daring to move. \"It's breaking apart... But... I tried so hard! I tried... to help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice echoed in her mind: \"Do you want to be the hero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood motionless. \"...Who are you? The Great Fairy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt laughed gently. \"That gem you found is quite special. If you so wish, I could grow you taller. Nobody would doubt you. You'd stop this fire with a whisper. You'd be Hyrule's greatest protector... And it costs you nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivered. Was that what she needed - more power? Clutching to her green tunic, Linkle thought of her friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd decided:</span></div></div>",

No matter how cool it'd be, I'd hurt someone if I grew any bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious entity cooed: \"They don't believe in you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hylian smiled to herself. \"I don't need to prove anything. That's what started this trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became a whisper: \"You'd be a hero...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <b>am</b> a hero...\" She pumped both fists to her sides. Her legs stood firm among burning treetops. In the distance, nearly lost among the murky trees, her dropped compass glowed in radiant gold. \"...No... <b>I'm THE hero!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer spirit focused. Both blue eyes snapped open, glowing with a rekindled light in the scorched sky. Amid the smoke clouds, the thinnest traces of doubt left her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorons and Hylians rushed to control the flames; blocking their path and cutting off air with boulders; extinguishing them with buckets of water; and moving the wounded to safer places. Darunia bellowed: \"If I'd known this would happen, I'd have called Princess Ruto for water power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa shuddered. \"We can summon the Fountain Fairy, but the inferno will have spread too far by then.\" She clenched her teeth. \"We can't save everything, but perhaps part of the woods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolga struggled from his wooden prison, trapped under the destroyed trees. \"The fates robbed me of a fair fight... Now, they rob me of a warrior's death...\" His mighty strength couldn't hope to lift the wood, even in draconic form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was trying their hardest. She wouldn't give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating briefly, Linkle slid out from the sleeves. She removed her green cloak - the cloak matching those previous heroes of legend wore. It lay in her hands, worn from battle, but with the seams holding strong. The only remaining sign of her status. The final proof of her destiny. The gift of her grandmother. She quietly caressed it, running the top of her glove across its side. \"I'm sorry, grandma... I'll miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twist, the Hylian flapped her tunic in the air, casting a shadow over the Faron Woods. She waved it; the flares weakened at the mighty winds. But not enough; soon, everything lit in red again. Holding it flat, she lowered the cloth on the flaming treetops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fizzle...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom underneath, Impa gasped. It was like a humongous blanket covered the sky. Drops of sweat and dirt descended upon the soldiers. Branches, even the sturdy wood of the Great Deku Tree, wept under the weight. Blazes caught in the emerald fibers, tearing holes in it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Until they finally died. Smoke lifted from the trees. The heat was no more. The warrior used her clothes to snuff out the fire, depriving it of oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah...\" Panting from her huge lungs drifted among the branches, on a cool breeze. She fell on her rear, her house-sized face flushed. When she lifted her gear, it had gaping burns. She tried to put it on, but it felt charred enough to disintegrate in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't matter. The flames were gone. Thanks to the others' efforts, they'd been contained; and she smothered the last of them. The people below left their spots, panic quieting. All except for one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolga snarled, struggling to escape from the wooden weight. He called up, unable to move: \"Girl! I'm at your mercy. Fulfill your destiny! End this battle with your greatest strike!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twinkle in her eye, the tremendous warrior lifted her fist in the air. Her white shirt stretched to accommodate the outstretched arm. Darunia covered his face, cringing. \"He's - really serious, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single swoop, Linkle punched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Boom.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree cracked, breaking the Dragon Knight free. He tapped at his chest, standing up, with an arm outstretched in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a hand to her hip, scowling. \"That won't solve anything. Get out, and don't push around people like that anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman with the strength to best me...\" With a dry chuckle, Volga bowed his head. \"I'll have to contemplate what the gods meant.\" And with what was left of his dignity, he shifted to his dragon form, flying in retreat with the other dark forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan didn't take her eyes off him until he was a speck in the distance. Then, she slumped her shoulders, breathing a long, cathartic sigh. Her neck sunk, view lowering to the forest. Cuccos chirped in the stillness. \"It's over... Did I... make the right choice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her naginata sheathed, Impa walked to her, smiling up. \"I told you to stay in place. Good thing you're a terrible listener.\" She pointed to the soldiers picking themselves up, reuniting with friends and returning to the village. \"You have a lot to contemplate, too. But we all need to rest from this. Even heroes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarunia rolled in. \"Rest? Ha! I'm throwing a real Goron celebration for our brothers here!\" He pounded his mallet in the ground. \"This was a brawl for the ages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle's lips shifted. \"Ravio... Is he okay, after I...\" She took a breath. \"...After I stepped on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchanged glances, expressions darkening. Her heart weighed heavy. Above the trees, with little troops surrounding her, the blonde Hylian felt very, very small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Until mauve glimmer crossed her eye. The merchant's bunny hood wobbled, as he approached his fellow captains from behind - and grabbed their shoulders. \"Hey! Glad I could sit this fight out.\" He rubbed his neck. \"It smarts, but those healers sure know how to glue a guy together. It's like a fairy was helping them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice in the recess of her mind laughed lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa nodded. \"Thank the heavens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarunia crushed him in a hug. \"Brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay on the treetops in relief, letting the leaves caress her immense arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A real hero's reward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~A week later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle pushed a post in place, enclosing the Cuccos near her farm. She rubbed her hands together. \"Ha, that's another item off the to-do list!... Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chick scurried through a hole too small for the gigantic farmer to perceive. She groaned, trying to grab the bird - and missing twice, digging out huge hand prints from her crops. \"This size has a few downsides...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she followed it, she spotted Ravio approaching. He bowed and grabbed her escaped Cucco, throwing it in the enclosure again. \"Hey, Linkle! Still stuck at this height?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, grinning. \"Until I can find something to reverse that gem, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy in the bunny costume raised a finger. \"Well, then, guess this'll come in handy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" In awe, the gigantic blonde or her hands to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind him, a few villagers carried massive monoliths. Two boots, almost an exact match for her old ones; only big enough for her. And behind them, more carried a new tunic, only in a light blue hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically jumping with excitement, the young woman grabbed it, and immediately slid it on. \"Thank you! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavio rubbed the rear of his hood. \"Couldn't get enough green fabric where I live. I know that's the hero's color.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a perfect fit. With a smile, she answered: \"Maybe it'll set a new trend! Legendary Heroes in the future might start wearing blue, in honor of this!\" She stretched her hands out, ecstatic at the new costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salesman laughed. \"Glad to hear! As a gift... I'll give it to you for 100 Rupees off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinkle blinked. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, got you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir laughter echoed across the village. With her compass, crossbows, and now her clothes back, everything was closer to normal. And though she needed time to adjust, she had her friends and her grandma to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer compass dangled above the poultry's white and brown feathers, around her neck - glowing softly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright and sunny spring's day in Hyrule. The sky was partially cloudy with bright blue skies. The river that ran through Zora's domain was a beautiful clear blue. The lush grass which flourished throughout Hyrule fields blew peacefully in the calm winds. And birds perched in the large oak trees scatter throughout the land sang their joyful hims. It was the perfect day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch time had passed since the evil Gerudo's King of Demon's, Ganondorf had been sealed away. An entire year to be exact. Link now lives in Hyrule Castle with the Hylian royal family, guarding their many precious treasures and assisting the Princess, Zelda Hylia, in any way in his power as the Hero of Time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sages have rejoined the world of the living, resuming their regular duties of their normal lives. Saria has been named most wise of the Forest of the Kokiri. Darunia is now regarded as the greatest Goron to have ever lived. Rauru remained in the Chamber of the Sages, safeguarding it from any impending dark forces and awaiting the day the world would need them again. Ruto returned to her life as the Princess, soon to be the Queen, of the Zoras. Impa has returned to Hyrule Castle, but tries to keep her reputation as a sage shrouded in shadows, much like her personality. And Nabooru disappeared from the eyes of the world, but secretly holds the reputation as the Queen of Theives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut our lies elsewhere. It began as a Forest Fairy's vow to help lead The Hero's way to victory over the Tyrant King. It has now become that fairy's wish to forever be with this hero. And, like before, deep in the Kokirian Forest is where it shall begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village of the Kokiri was well active. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMido and his group creating a new bridge for the Northeast and Northwest Watchmen's towers, as the last bridge was broken by a large, fallen tree limb. Julie and her two twin sister's, Rurie and Yurie, all minded the shops and such while the other working Kokiri fixed the bridge. Other Kokiri simply followed through with their usual day-to-day activities. And Saria, care free as can be, sat on the roof of the tallest of the tree houses in the Villages, supervising the work being done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria was, to tell you the truth, lost as to what to do today. She had grown so used to the sage's life that returning to her own was a bit of a step taken too fast. The repairs on the bridge lasted until night fall. Saria slouched with a grumpy and pouting look on her face. \"Foo. Did it really have to take away the entire day?\" She complained. She might have been wise, but she was also just a kid. And no amount of time could change that part about her. Or for that matter, any of the Kokiri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when her green glow forest fairy, Sinibi flew by her ear and asked, \"Saria, can't find Navi. She disappeared.\" Saria raised a brow  as she looked at Sinibi, then asked, as her response, \"Again?\" She then took a moment and bowed her head as she sighed. \"Alright. I'll go find her.\" Saria told her, getting up and walking to the roof's ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left little Sinibi all by herself. That's when a dark-neon glow Forest Fairy flew over to her and said, \"Heeey, Sinibi! You wanna cool place to cuddle up together an-\" Sinibi punched him in mid-sentence, as this fairy was jerk who always wanted to flirt with her. Needless to say, she had enough of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buzz off, Hex!\" She shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to fly away, but nervously stopped, turned around and asked, \"Does that me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Away, Hex!!!</font></b>\" She shouted at the top of her lungs, making him fly off at lightning speed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, in Link's old tree house, Navi lay on the pillow of Link's bed. Compared to the pillow, she was practically minuscule. She let her light become very dim, making her true body visible. She had the body of a human Teenage girl who had begun to take on a womanly shape, which is what you could expect, as at the age she was, she could be considered a 14 year old by the other Fairies. She had large, pointed, elfish ears. Her skin was a very light blue that was nearingly white. Her medium size, cute eyes had a darker shade of blue to them. And she wore a type of white dress which was fairly resemblant to that of a house coat with no sleeves or collar, covering as far up as her petite chest and reaching as far down as her shins. The rest of her was bare. In the back of the dress were four slits for her large wings, which were fairly full body length, if not slightly larger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a sad expression on her face, coupled with a deep pink blush that ran across her face. She was missing the boy she had made such great friends with... nay. Had fallen in love with... Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their journey was over, they parted ways. Link told her that it was just far too dangerous to accompany him any longer. She knew he was only looking for her and trying to protect her, but the fact that she probably would never see him again, because he was most likely destined for the princess. She had bared this unsure fact on her shoulders through the entire year's ordeal. Even if Link would love her back, the laws of the world were very clear. A fairy could not marry with a human. Not even a Great Fairy was allowed this privilege...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then heard someone climbing up the ladder, drawing her back into reality and forcing these thought to submerge to the back of her mind. She then let her glow grow bright again, hiding her body behind it. Then she began to rapidly flap her wings until she was floating in the air right as the drape at the entrance of the tree house was slid open, revealing Saria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hello, Saria!\" Navi said in her normal high and cheery sounding voice. Saria looked at her suspiciously, wondering what she was doing in here...for the second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria then walked to the bed and sat down on the mattress. Then she looked at Navi with a compassionate and caring look on her face. \"I'm not a fool, Navi. I can see something's wrong. And something tells me that this something's name might be Link.\" Navi immediately jumped at Link's name and pulled her arm behind her back gripping one with the other, nervously looking away from Saria. \"Navi, You know the laws of this world more than anyone. It is simply impossible for two of a different Kind to truly be together...Including the Sages.\" Saria admitted, looking at her feet and closing her eyes. Navi Felt a shutter of hot discomfort, remembering that Saria too loved Link, but far before she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi felt a sickening jolt of sadness flutter up in her stomach. She bit down as hard as she possibly could, trying to contain her feeling. She even shut her eyes so tight it hurt...but eventually her feeling came out in tears that rolled down her cheeks. She sniffled, contained her wine as best she could. Her Glow then began to dim. That's when Saria opened her eyes in confusion, as the lighting in the room had just gotten dimmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Navi and for the first time, she saw what Navi really looked like. She could see her discomfort written clear across the fairy's tiny face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi's emotions finally overcame her and she muttered, \"It not fair.....it's not...\" Saria felt even more confused. Navi descended slowly back onto the pillow. She then let herself fall into sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria scooted in closer to Navi. She then put her head down on the pillow, making certain she wouldn't be touching Navi. \"We should get some rest. It's gotten pretty late, now. We might as well sleep here for the night, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi layed down onto her side of the pillow and got onto her side so she was facing Saria. Saria had already closed her eyes and was nearly half asleep. Navi then whispered, \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Hey... It's not like Link would mind.</font>\" And closed her eyes to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria just barely heard her. \"Oh, Navi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: In the morning, Navi is visited by the Great Forest Fairy, Lilium. She tells Navi that she knows of a way that Navi can be with Link. She gives her the ability to change her size and appearance at will. (I will be writing this one.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: Make up your own method in which you want Navi to grow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the middle of the night. Saria was fast asleep, but Navi couldn't sleep a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still thinking about Link, the boy who her heart ached for. It was enough that the two of them couldn't be together, but the year she spent separated from him was the longest of her entire life. It made her stomach turn when she thought about why they would never be together. All because of the worldly order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach started to flutter with emotions again and tear droplets formed in the corners of her eyes. She buried her face into the giant pillow, hoping that she could block her tears with it's cushion. They did not come, but she kept her face buried in fear that they might start to form again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when a heavenly green glow flooded into the room. Navi looked up from the pillow see that the glow was coming from outside. She rapidly fluttered her wings and began to fly toward the entrance of the tree house. When she got outside, she saw a bright green glow  form into a ball of light and from the back of the glow, four fairy wings sprouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi leaned in closer to the ball of light with wing and thought aloud. \"Sinibi?\" But she didn't get a response. Instead, the ball of light flew away from her and into the forest. Navi, taken by surprise, called out, \"Hey, wait!\" And flew after it into the dense forests. The ball of light swiftly dodged through the trees and their branches, seemingly trying to get away from her, but Navi, determined to figure out who it was, kept up with it. They eventually came to a large clearing in the forest where a spring with many large rocks with strange marking written on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of light flew to the center of the spring and descended down toward it's and dissolved like ice into, forming a large circle of green light in the center of the spring. Out of this light rose a humanly form that glowed, just as the light did. When it stood above the circle, it's full form was that of a matured woman's at about 7'10\" feet tall. Long and flowing green hair formed and reached down as far as near shin, much like Navi's, except her's was dark blue. A gust of wind flowed around the figure's body, making a heavenly robe form around it, the sides of the robe hung loose on the figures shoulders as it's hands moved to it heart's area, pressing against it with both hands. Leaves that had fallen from the tree and fell into the spring gathered around the back and sides of her forehead like a crown. Elvish ears forms under the crown. The face of the figure, one in which was like a goddess's formed. It's beautiful eyes opened and reveal their grass green color. Four large fairy wings that seemed to be made of the moonlight that shun down through a large opening in the trees formed on her back. The green glow of the figured dimmed to reveal a beautiful goddess standing in the middle of the spring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi instantly recognized this woman as she was the one who first assigned her to the great deku tree back when the world was still being threatened by the presence of Ganondorf. \"Great Fairy, Lilium!\", she whispered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilium gazed upon Navi. She too recognized the fairy she had given up for the sake of the world. She smiled lovingly. \"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Navi.</b></span>\" She said in an a calmed, goddessly voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi flew at a great speed toward Lilium, who now held out her hands in front of her. The blue fairy clung to her upper chest in a hug with glee as the great fairy put both hands over her, gently returning her hug. Navi cuddle up to Lilium's chest as best she could. Then they separated and Navi spoke, \"I've missed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>As have I you, young one.</b></span>\" Lilium told her likewise. \"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>The forest wasn't the same with your absence. It was far too quiet without the blue fairy whom I missed ever so. But this fact, dear child, is not the one I've brought you here for.</b></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi gasped silently, caught off guard by her statement. Navi knew exactly what she meant. She just couldn't believe she'd known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>I have known for quite the while. Your Love for the Hero of Time runs deep. It has created a bond that cannot be severed by the passing tide of time.</b></span>\" Lilium told her. \"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>But the mortal laws of this world keeps you from getting your feelings realized by the one who need deserves to know.</b></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi looked to the ground below her, not daring to look Lilium in the eyes, in fear of what she truly thought of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Navi.</b></span>\" Navi forced herself to look back at Lilium. \"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Do you truly wish to be with the Hero of Time?</b></span>\", Lilium asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi managed a nervous nod. Lilium took a moment to search Navi's eyes for doubt, but she found no hint of it. She then smiled happily. Navi was again confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>So be it. I shall grant you that which you desire. The ability you will need for a feat such as this.</b></span>\" She then hold her hands out around Navi, letting a blue, transparent orb form around the tiny fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi felt a strange energy flow into her, making her glow brighten back up as marking began to appear. Mystical light blue markings began to form down her arms, on the tops of her hands, on her hips, down her legs and along her wings. The mark of Farora form on her forehead. The final marking which formed on her upper chest was a double crescent surrounding a small filler circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilium let her hands go back to her upper chest, the orb around Navi finally disappeared. Navi's glow again receded and most of her marking vanished along with it. The only visible marking was the one on her upper chest. Navi stared at the marking for a long moment, then looked back to the still smiling Lilium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened? I feel...strange.\" Navi told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>I have bestowed upon you the ability to change both your size and outer appearance at will. Simply concentrate of the size or the appearance and you will be able to do so. Please, do give it a try.</b></span>\" Lilium told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi took a moment to think, rubbing her chin. \"Now how tall was Link, again... uh... 6'4\" feet tall?\" And at that thought, Navi's markings reappeared, glowing light blue. She confusedly looked at the marking, a bit frightened as she noticed herself growing larger, everything staying within proportion. She soon grew from a mere 4 inches to 2'8\" feet tall in a matter of 6 seconds and was still growing! Another short moment passed an she had shot up to 3'5\" feet tall, then 4'11\" and Finally stopped at 6'4\" feet tall with everything still in proportion. Her markings then disappeared again, except, of course, for the one on her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she noticed that her feet were now just a few inches away from the water of the spring. She didn't need the aid of flying to look someone in the face anymore, unless you counted that huge man named, Boarston. Or the giant Goron black smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let herself land in the cool water, then drew her attention back to Lilium who was still much taller than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Very well done, young one. Though when you return to the village of the Kokiri, you may want to withdraw you wing and change your skin tone. Those two things might give you away immediately to anyone who has seen you without your glow shrouding your appearance.</b></span>\" Lilium pointed out. Navi thought about this and could see the entire village taking notice to this. She then made a nervous laugh, signaling that she understood. She then shook of her nervous thoughts and smiled gratefully to Lilium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Great Forest Fairy Lilium.\" Navi said, bowing out of respect for the great fairy. Lilium put a hand to her mouth, giggling playfully. She then refocused on Navi, regaining her composure. Navi pulled back up from her bow and looked at Lilium in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Please, Navi. Lilium alone is enough.</b></span>\" Lilium told her. Navi smiled, blushing from embarrassment. \"<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Now, please. Return to the Village of the Kokiri. I senses tell me your friends are waiting for you there.</b></span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi nodded and began to walk back the way she came. She looked back to the spring as she reached the edge of the clearing to see that Lilium had disappeared. She simply smile and continued back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then remembered Lilium's advice and focused on retracting her wings. Her markings reappeared and her wings shrunk away and receded into her back. Next she focused of changing her skin tone to the normal humanly pink. Her skin brightened and began to change pigmentation, become a vibrant and healthy pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer markings then disappeared again, except, of course, for the one on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: When Navi returns to the village, she finds that Saira doesn't recognize her at first and tells her that she she is looking for Navi. After telling her that she IS Navi, she realizes that she's telling the truth. She then tells Saira what happened, followed by a demonstration. How WILL she react? (This chapter will be written by me.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: Make up your own path for Navi to follow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span class=\"cnavy\">Here is where you guys can put your own ideas and go through my pre-established setting with Navi as you please. Whether it's just stomping around Hyrule like an old fashion blockbuster monster, beating around the bush and messing with previously larger folks because you can now tower over everyone if you so choose, or something of your own mind, the choice is your's for the taking! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that being said, I saw the other option beside my own made big mistakes with timelines, fashions and technologies that do not currently exist anywhere in Hyrule. I have to caution you all as to what you try to do. Unless you suddenly fling your Navi into the future (even though you risk that Link may not exist in that future and such), you should know that Hyrule is pretty much <b>Midieval Times</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not bashing on the writer of that chapter. I'm just trying to keep the story true to it's current setting. Most of you no doubt know that there aren't very many people anywhere in the world of Hyrule, if any, that know what Jeans and most electrical devices are, much less how they could ever make them. It's pretty much simple wears like cotton Tunics, leather or wool sewn trousers, linen knit undergarments and sun dresses. Leather vests and corsets were also in style. So were blouses of both genders. Other more aged wears were present, but those are the most common types. However, for their feet, you can find that women wore sandals, heels, boots or very simple leather shoes. For men, most are either ever seen wearing the same type of shoes, the strangely named pointy ended hard-leathered boots called Winkle-pickers(Actual researched name), elven shoes, or boots. For more Royal attires, wealthy families tend to wear studded and bejeweled clothing of the same variety, but of greater quality. Some even wore capes with their family emblems sewn into them if they were trying to be distinguished. Other more unusual garments from the Hyrulian royal family included armor pieces from time to time, in case of assassination attempts made on their lives regularly, just as they happened to actual royal families in real life midieval times. And of course, there were the crowns and tiaras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for technology, for those who don't just use magical items and such, there isn't very much. It was extremely limited. No TVs, no cellphones, no walkytalkies or anything of the like. Electricity is still a very unpredictable thing for more than just a majority of the people. The closest people have come to utilizing it is through magical spells, mystic items, lightning rods and the light bulb, albeit a cruder version of it. Bombs exist, so we know they definitely have a grasp on fire and gunpowder passed items of odd sources. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom all this, it's signs that the midieval era they are in is either of or close to the renaissance of their world. Their history is odd indeed with all these magical items and such about, but they aren't out of Midieval era yet, so lets keep it in there, alright? If not, I suppose wander navi through a time gate or a portal or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, all of this is just to make sure you guys don't get the setting confused. I'll end here since I'm sure you all already knew all of this, or at least most of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEitherway, happy writing~!</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember. Our character is Navi. The Great Fairy, Lilium, has just given her the ability to change her own size and shape, allowing her to transform herself into a human girl of 6'4\" feet. However, those same powers don't grant her the ability to magic up clothes for herself. No matter what story you go with, it may be wise to procure some clothing for her, in some way or another. Navi still seems to have remained naive to the fact that her old Fairy wears are gone thanks to her transformation destroying them, but she's bound to notice very soon... one way or another... (Remember, nothing graphic. Censor anything in your writing other than to maybe elude to nude stuff. Someone may gaze and react, but you are not allowed to describe at what. You are also not allowed to write out sexual scenes, still. I'm very certain the author would still dislike that. So please, write responsibly.)</span></div></div>",

She flashed on regular Teen Clothes, a Pink shirt, with Blue Jean shorts. Navi began to run, she never felt the true experience of running, because she had always flown. In the back of Navi's Head, She heard Lillium's voice once more. \"Use this power correctly Navi, or bad things shall happen.\" She heard her say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I would never Lillium</i>. Navi thought. <i>I just want to be with the one I love</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi continued running, and surprisingly, no-one in Kokiri Forest recognized her. Navi bought some Kokiri Boots, and slipped them on. With the Boots, Navi seemed to run even faster. About halfway to Hyrule Castle, Navi stopped to think about something. \"I need a human name, Link would recognize me right away.\" Navi said. \"Aria.\" She decided after a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi ran to Hyrule Castle, and continued past Castle Town. She encountered the Guard at the Gate. \"My name is Aria, may I please see Link, of the Royal Family.\" She asked. The Guard pulled out a Walkie-Talkie, and pressed the button. \"Sir Link, I have some Girl named Aria from Castle Town who would like to see you.\" The Guard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Voice broke through, and it was Link's. \"Send her in.\" Link said sternly. Navi was so happy, and was guided throughout the sandy path, that Link snuck through 8 years ago. The Drawbridge to the Castle lowered and Navi was gestured in. Peasants and Servants greeted Navi in. At the End of the Carpeted Hallway was Link. He was dressed in a Male Zora's Tunic. From what Info Navi had gathered was that Link wore a Tunic of the different species everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Aria?\" Link asked. \"Yes Sir.\" Navi said. \"If you come to my Room, I would like to talk to you.\" Link said. Navi's Wish had been granted, just a little time with Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi was guided by Link to his Room, and Link shut the Door behind Navi. \"Aria, I think I know your true I identity.\" Link said. Navi gasped, but tried to keep her cool. \"Navi. Why would you do this?\" Link asked. \"Link, I'm really sorry.\" Navi said. \"You wanted to be with me? Haven't you?\" Link deduced. \"Still, Beings of Different Kinds cannot be together.\" \"I hate that rule! I just hate it!\" Navi stomped her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi ran out of Link's room in anger, and ran out to Hyrule Field.

Otherwise, I would be gentle to you.\" Navi said squeezing Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was quickly running out of air, and Navi's grip was only gonna get tighter. \"Navi...please stop...I...can't...breath.\" Link choked, and Navi smiled evilly. \"Sorry Link, You tortured me, by making me wait, so I'm gonna torture you.\" She said. \"Navi...I'm...so...sorry.\" Link muttered before passing out. Navi found no more use for squeezing Link, so she removed her right boot, and tossed Link in there. She put the boot back on, and walked back to Kokiri Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi made it back to Kokiri Forest, and went to Saria's House. \"Hello?\" Saria asked opening the Door. Saria looked worried. \"Excuse me Miss, but have you seen a small Fairy, named Navi?\" Saria asked. \"Saria, it's me, and I have a present for you.\" Navi said.

With the Goron Ruby you shall gain the power to control and create new landmasses with a mere thought, and you will be able to reshape the world in your image. The Zora sapphire grants the ability to resurrect the dead, and repair any damage that may have been caused by your powers. Once you have acquired the power of all three, you will gain far greater power than the gems could produce individually. You shall awaken to powers equivalent to the three golden goddesses who created the universe itself!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You're saying that I could become a goddess?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Essentially, yes... Now Navi, take the Kokiri Emerald. I trust that you shall only use this knowledge for good. May luck be on your side...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emerald then fell from the branches of the Deku Tree, and hovered in front of navi. She slowly floated toward it, and as soon as she touched the gem, her entire body began flowing with power. The emerald slowly turned to a dull gray color as its power was absorbed into the fairy. Navi had finished absorbing the power from the gem, and it was now nothing more than an ordinary rock. Without its magical powers, the stone fell to the ground with a thud. Navi felt the need to test her new powers. She began to focus her energy as her soft whitish-blue glow turned to the green color of the emerald. Navi began slowly increasing in size until she was the same size as an average human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was human sized, the glow that once hid her body from view had faded. Her true appearance was revealed to be that of a beautiful young woman with long blue hair. She wore a white dress with blue ruffles on her shoulders, and a golden bracelet on each wrist as well as an identical anklet on each ankle. She was barefoot, and her toes wiggled at the feeling of the grass between them. Her nails were all painted blue, and she was amazingly attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe basically looked like this, except with bracelets/anklets: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/232/3/6/Navi___Could_be_____by_Zallvie.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her new size, and realizing that she could grow bigger at any time, Navi quickly became excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to show this to Saria! She'll be so amazed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi then flew back to Saria's house, and tried to open the door. She realized that it was locked, and remembered that she had flown through the window before. She shrank back to her original size to fly back through the open window, and regrew back to human size once inside again. She then tapped the sleeping Saria on the shoulder to wake her. Saria didn't recognize the human sized fairy, and wondered who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? How did you get into my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saria, don't you recognize me? It's me, Navi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi? Is that really you? How did you get to be so big? You're just as tall as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets just say that it was a gift from the spirit of the Deku Tree... Hey, watch this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi then shrank back to her original size, returned to human size, kept growing until her head was about to hit the ceiling of Saria house, and the returned to human size again. Saria simply stared at her in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can control the size of anything now! Isn't that awesome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It really is! What do you plan on doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... The Deku Tree said that if I got the power of the other two spiritual stones, then I would become a goddess! I think that's what I'm gonna do now; get the other two gems and absorb their power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria was a bit unnerved by this statement, but she tried to remain calm. After all, Navi wasn't the type to let that power go to her head! Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will you do after that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I think that I'm gonna use that power to ___________.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Navi waved goodbye, and left the village quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen in Hyrule Field, Navi thought about being a Giantess, that was her second-most dream, and with the Kokiri Emerald, she could accomplish that dream. She thought about being a simple height of 20 feet tall. She shut her eyes, and when she opened them, she looked down upon Hyrule Field. She took an easy step, accomplishing 13 feet of a normal human in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, she crushed 2 Trees with every step she took in the beginning. She brushed what remained of the trees off her foot, and continued walking towards Kakariko, which was at the base of Death Mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over Kakariko, and many people were scared of Navi's presence. \"Don't Worry. I'm not to cause you harm.\" Navi reassured them. But some were still scared, so one by one, she gently rubbed each of their backs.

Midna's foot slams into Link with incredible power. The kick sends Link flying across the ground before finally skidding to a halt. He looks up to see Midna's foot slowly decending on him. He shuts his eyes tightly, and passes out.<br>\r\n   Midna lifts her foot away from Link. Then she bends down to pick him up. Suddenly she feels a tremendous wave of content fly through her body. Then suddenly her flat chest bursts out into two perfectly shaped DD (from her perspective) breasts.<br>\r\n   \"So it is true,\" she says to herself,\" upon victory it really does improve you in some way, although this isn't what I thought would improve first, I wont complain.\"<br>\r\n   \"You did well she whispers to Link,\" then she places him between her breasts.

That must of meant that something on this side of the portal was calling to them. If my theory is right then I think it might have been the Triforce of Power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked to this news Midna asked \"but how would that send you all into my world and shrink down to the size of a doll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why we've shrunk, but drawing us into your world could have been a defense mechanism of the Triforce if it is ever threatened never to be reunited again. You see even separated the 3 pieces still have a connection and when you were closing the portal you were threatening to sever that connection forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more shocked then before Midna replied with tears in her eyes \"Then it is all my fault. I am so sorry for this, I never meant for any of this to happen. First Zant nearly destroys your world and now I've shrunk it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its alright, there was no way you could have known.

They had only just seen Hyrule castle restored to normal, and shook their heads in despair over this new and even more powerful threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Twilight Princess didn't intend any harm to the people of Hyrule.

She turned her attention over to the Mirror tower, where Link and Zelda where still standing, and leaned her enormous face in for a closer look. \"Oh my! You both are so tiny now!\" she said, making out the tiny figures atop the tower. Her gargantuan face alone was the size of a typical Hyrule village!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Zelda trembled at the size of their friend.

I can't remember the last time I worked this hard before. I guess it's a good thing that those soldiers aren't as cowardly as they use to be, so at least it makes for good business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Two weeks ago, Hyrule was blanketed under a cloud of twilight, rendering the soldiers cowardly against the beasts who invaded the castle. Telma closed her bar out for soldiers who wouldn't stand in a fight. Now that the twilight has been long dissipated, and the soldiers' morale was boosted, Telma opened her tavern back to the soldiers, and she amassed a decent amount of payment from her armored customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if only they didn't make such a mess of this place, that would be just as fine,\" Telma grumbled as she looked around the messy interior of her beloved tavern. \"I should put up a sign telling the customers to not make a mess. Or maybe I should hire a busboy to help with the cleaning. I have enough Rupees to pay them a weekly salary and then some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Telma cricked her back and heaved a sigh. \"But first, I need something to drink. Something to reward myself for my hard work and make cleaning this mess tolerable at the same time.\" She giggled at her own quip and went behind the counter where she inspected her bottles for something delicious to wet her whistle and to get her hide. Inside the cupboards, she set aside any bottles that she didn't feel that would provide both flavor and mild potency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside, she came across a strange glass bottle filled with a crimson liquid. She took it out, popped the cork and sniffed it. Fermented wildberries, hydromelons, and a few other ingredients she couldn't pinpoint. Tilting the bottle to her lips, Telma took a sip of the liquid, letting the strong fruit flavor pass over her tongue, down her throat, and into her stomach. She cringed at the flavor. It burned a small fire in her stomach. It certainly did a good job making her head lighter than air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's some strong stuff,\" Telma told herself. Then she felt that fire in her stomach course through her body, tingling her nervous system with unnatural rising internal warmth. She clutched her stomach as her body throbbed as hard a Goron's drumbeat. For each throb she felt, she felt herself getting bigger... and bigger... and bigger... Her unnatural growth spurt...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He's always been big for his age. Well, that's what everyone else thought. At one point, he had actually been a little on the short side. Wait, I'm probably confusing you right now. Let's backtrack a bit. Keep in mind, this may take a while, so bear with me. His name is Link. You know, the Hero of Time, savior of Hyrule, all that jazz. Anyways, as I'm sure you know, Zelda sent him back after he rescued the country because she felt he deserved a normal life. BIG MISTAKE! Not only did she cause his fairy companion to leave him, she ...err... more or less messed up on the song to send him back. Heh-heh. Hey, in her defense, her fingers slipped. That kind of happens when you play a porcelain instrument in silk gloves. No grip, you know? Back on track, her little (or should I say big) flub kind of messed with Link's body. As you know, a Hylian's body grows until they reach a certain age. Call it puberty. Well, Zelda's song messed with that part of Link, causing his body to never stop growing and also causing his body to grow faster than normal. Let me put it this way, you ever met a 16 year old Hylian approximately 32 feet tall? No? didn't think so. Anyways, Link didn't notice his growth until he left from Termina. While he was trying to find his way back to Kokiri forest , he would notice Epona having an increasingly difficult time supporting his weight. Now, he would have easily labeled it is a weak horse in need of proper nourishment had he not noticed his tightening clothes. Even he knew that you don't grow a foot in a month. Now, this could have deterred him,  but he kept strong. He eventually arrived in Kokiri forest after about two months, all six feet of him. Mido almost had a heart attack seeing his former victim almost twice his height, not to mention his...err...lack of proper clothes or his carrying of the young filly. It was hilarious! Long story short, Mido wanted Link gone but Saria and the rest of the Kokiri wanted Link to stay. Guess who won? DING DING DING! WE HAVE A WINNER! Link stayed in the forest and adapted over time to his growing body. It was a little awkward at times, but he managed to make it work. He even got to re-meet Zelda when she came to visit the Deku Tree. Something about protecting some instrument or other. I can't remember off the top of my head. Now Link was twelve when this happened, so he was about fourteen feet tal to Zelda's meager five feet. She was instantly interested in the giant boy in the loincloth with the pointy hat (Saria was always making one larger for him. What's Link without his signature hat?). They became friends and she visited him as often as she could. They even became smitten with each other. and that brings us to the present day.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n\"Link....Liiiiiink...\" Link rolled in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five more minutes.....\" He heard an exasperated sigh from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come one Link, you promised you'd come with me to the sacred meadow....\" Link groaned. It was too early to be awake. He opened his eyes slowly, squinting in the bright sunlight that leaked from the deku tree's leaves. That was one thing he hated about his lofty stature; he had to wake up when the sun rose. Yawning, he arched his back, feeling the discs in his spine pop into place. He smiled to himself, smelling the comforting scent of the Great Deku tree. scratching his back he stood to his full stature, a whopping 32 feet tall.  Scratching at his messy mop of hair, he heard  feminine giggle from below. Smiling, he looked down into the face of his dearest friend, the little girl called Saria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Saria. How are you?\" Link asked groggily Saria giggle into her hand before placing her hands on her hips in mock exasperation. She plastered a pout on her face, one Link could easily see was fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promised you would go with me to the sacred meadow first thing in the morning. and here I am and you're still asleep.\"  Link couldn't help but smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw yes, but i also said that it's a very bad idea...\" Link began to crouch down,. \"to wake...\" Saria started smiling. Her favorite part was coming up. \"A SLEEPING GIANT!\" As soon as Link bellowed his line, He tickled Saria's belly with his huge finger. She squealed, a sound that couldn't be heard above Link's bellowing laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha! Lin *hahaha* stop it! *hahahahaha* I can't breathe!\" Link laughed once more before scooping Saria into his large hand, allowing her to catch her breath. He smiled and put her close to he heart, enveloping her with both hands in how version of a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You big lug! You want to suffocate me!?\" Saria shouted in mock horror, pounding on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you go if you hug me back!\" Saria sighed, but smiled. Twisting her body, she wrapped her arms around as much of Link's chest as she could. It wasn't much, but Link could still feel the love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OY! You two! As much as I love you two, would you get out of here! I'm trying to sleep!\"  the Deku sprout shouted. As much as he was a god, he was still a sarcastic child who need his rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Great Deku Sprout,\" Link and Saria said in unison. Link strode out of the Deku meadow and stepped over the stone cliff separating it from the village., carrying Saria in his cupped hand the entire time.<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n\"You know Saria,\" Link said while lying on his back in the meadow, \"I need a new loincloth. This one's getting tight again. Saria put her ocarina down in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"come on Link, that's the second one this month!\" Link winced.  While none of the Kokiri explicitly sated how difficult he unintentionally made their lives (except for Mido, but he never liked Link to begin with), Link was aware of just how much they had to do for him in order for him to be semi-comfortable in the forest. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Saria,\" Link said in a low voice, \"I really am. But I can' control my growth. And I think I hit another growth spurt.  I can seriously feel my body stretching right now.\" Link felt terrible. He really did. While he did enjoy being this tall, it was horribly inconvenient at times. He needs a lot to eat and will usually go to the outskirts of the forest and tear up old bushes and trees and eat those. While not delicious, it does fill him up. Sometimes he gets barrels of Lon Lon milk from Malon, whom he saved when she was stranded in Hyrule field when the wagon's wheel broke. He heard her screams when the skeletons rose from the ground around midnight. He fought them off and stayed with her all night until she could properly fix the wheel in the morning (this involved Link holding the wagon up while Malon replaced the wheel with a new one she brought along. Link's hands were too big for anything else). Link and Malon  were still great friends and he would still play with Epona, who wasn't afraid of him despite the  huge size difference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, don't feel bad. It's just a bad time for us all, that's all. We're still making new cloth. could you please hold up for a couple more days?\" Saria asked sympathetically. She could only imagine Link's discomfort. Link sighed, but agreed. Smiling, Link propped himself up on his elbows, looking down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Saria, you got me up this early. You want to do something?\" Saria smiled shyly, meeting his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The early morning had been very quiet thus far, and only a few birds had so much as made a sound. Skull Kid had grown accustomed, if not reluctantly, to solitude however the peace did grow tedious quickly. It was as he was wishing that Tatl and Tael had accompanied him that Skull Kid finally picked up on a rustling in the brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Skull Kid's surprise it was none other than the same mask salesmen from which he had stolen Majora's Mask shortly before he had been taken over. On one hand Skull Kid had a bit of a vendetta against all grown ups, and would usually attempt to chase them from the forest, however the salesmen often had interesting things worth taking. Skull Kid had undoubtedly biten off more than he could chew with Majora's Mask, and he for a moment thought that he might owe the man free passage, at least once. It was then that a strange mask on the side of the cart caught his eye. It did not look like much but radiated an aura that Skull Kid could not oppose. Entranced he leaped down in a flurry of stones. The rocks knocked the salesmen back and Skull Kid took his opening. With the mask in his grasp Skull Kid was unable to help putting it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flooded the grove for a moment and then all melted back into shade. Or at least it did for the salesmen; Skull Kid was now facing the brightness of the morning sun over Hyrule. In amazement he glanced down to find himself dwarfing even the highest trees in the forest; they only reached his ankles!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hhhow do I ggggget out offer hhhhhhere?\" Saria shivered as she looked all around the bottle piecing together how to get out of her new predicament. As she though, she also thought of why there would be a bottle of milk on such a bit summer's day in a small (relatively speaking) icebox.. With that, Saria came to the horrifying conclusion that this milk was going to be sold, and her fears came true when a giant redhead of 17 years overshadowed the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon had just finished milking the cows and then boiled the milk to free it from germs and kept the milk in bottles inside the icebox to keep them cool for customers. As one can imagine, Malon was sweating buckets by the end and wanted to have a cool drink of milk all to herself. However, there's a policy that Talon made that only unsold milk can be drunk by employees, and with such a  hot day out today Malon didn't like her chances. That's why Malon had a milk bottle reserved for herself by leaving it open and filling it with more milk than usual. \"That little trick oughta save me some milk at the end o' the day.\" Malon breathed under her breathe as she heaved the icebox onto the art and started pushing her wares to Hyrule market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria was a bit refreshed after riding on the bird, yet she didn't know if she had enough strength to stay afloat for a long time. She could only hope that her bottle would spill over and she could escape. Malon also had a tough time pushing her cart all the way to market. It may not have been a dire situation like Saria, but it sure felt that way to Malon. It was a 10 minute walk to town and those 10 minutes were torture to the young woman. She felt herself sweating like a pig, which cause her cute white shirt to stick to her top which left little to the imagination. \"Thank goodness I have such a long dress skirt, otherwise some of the 'gentlemen' in the market soul never leave me be. It's also good that I got a spare white shirt in the cart, but that won't help unless I cool down first\" Malon lamented in her thoughts as she trudged her cart all the way to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after 10 excruciating minutes of travel and 3 minutes of set up, Malon was open for business.  She put a special marked cap on top of her secret bottle so that it wouldn't go bad and so she could remind herself of which bottle was here's. She couldn't see the green speck in her milk, causing Saria to lose all hope of being found. After 30 minutes of selling milk (which also included running out the rubberneckers who only wanted to see Malon and not her stock), Malon couldn't help the thirst anymore and she quickly grabbed her bottle to drink. At least, that was her plan until Princess Zelda had appeared and taken interest in her bottle. \"Hello Malon. How are you today?\" \"Oh, I'm doing fine, except for this blasted heat steaming me up while I work.\" \"I noticed that bottle of milk you have and I would like to buy it from you, if you would be so kind.\" Malon was a bit conflicted here, seeing as she wanted to drink her milk for almost an hour now, but refusing the royal house wouldn't do to well. Malon decided to...</span></div></div>",

Maybe I can sell you a different bottle instead?\" Malon pleaded to her royal highness. Zelda understood Malon's plight and had decided to accommodate her by simply choosing another bottle instead of the one Malon had. The magic property of the bottle that she sensed earlier could be easily fixed if it did affect the farmgirl, so Zelda saw no issue with Malon refreshing herself with that bottle. \"Okay Malon, I shall have a different bottle of milk then.\" Zelda graciously replied and she left to browse the market's wares. Saria was thus left unaware in the bottle and she saw no hope of being found in the drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon soon found that now was a good time to take her milk break, so she placed a sign on her cart saying \"Out to lunch.\" Malon then uncapped the bottle and she began to slowly bring the bottle to her plush pink lips and enjoy her drink. Malon tried to slowly savor the milk, but when the first drop of milk landed on Malon's tongue she seriously reconsidered savoring her milk and decided to down it as soon as possible to cool her sweat-soaked body.  Saria felt the milk turn into a raging river as Malon placed the bottle's opening in her mouth, showing Saria a dark and misty cavern of saliva. Saria's body forced itself to swim against the milk as she felt her survival instinct kick in, all the while all she could her was a loud and continuous<b><i> GULP... ULP... ULP... ULP... ULP...</i></b> coming from Malon's throat into the bottle. When Saria's feet made contact with Malon's lips, the bottle straightened upward as Malon needed to to take a breathe and Saria fell into the half empty bottle. Saria felt her body just give up on her as she pushed herself beyond her limits. She was sweating buckets herself and she decided to just go with the flow at this point because she didn't see any way out of this situation. To cement this decision, Saria decided to drink some of the milk around her, despite the fact that there was her own sweat and Malon's backwash in it. After swallowing a mouthful of milk, Saria felt herself cool down a bit and she began to understand why Malon was in such a rush to finish it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon felt it would be a good time to change out of her sweat covered shirt into her fresh shirt now that she freshened up a bit.  Malon took her shirt in one hand and her bottle in the other as she headed for a secluded area to change. She unwittingly shook the bottle and caused small waves for Saria to deal with, but Saria simply floated on her back as she watched her captor walk to parts unknown. Malon quickly found a secure room to undress and she began to remove her shirt. Saria was slightly embarrassed by the well-endowed titanic teen wearing a black lacy bra in front of her, but mostly Saria was trying to accept the fact that she would help keep that body looking beautiful, if only for a little while more. As Malon put on her clean shirt, she thought she may as well finish her milk here seeing as her sign made a clear reason for her abscenece. The bottle was once again lifted towards Malon's lips and Saria simply watched as the milk coasted her along into the misty, warm, and milk-scented mouth. Saria made contact with Malon's tongue, yet she didn't go down the throat immediately as she expected. Malon was much more eager to to savor the drink now that she was cooler and she decided to swish her milk all around her mouth to get as much flavor out as possible. Saria was licked and pushed all over Malon's mouth, to the roof of the mouth to being rubbed against every tooth of Malon's pallet to being shoved into each cheek of of the mouth by the giant muscle residing in the cave. Malon felt ecstatic about savoring her milk as she was able to taste the sweetness and a very small hint of a forest mint flavor that brought the whole experience together. However, there was still more milk to go through, and Malon didn't have all day to relax when there was work to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria felt a strong suction force on her body as she realized that it was time for Malon to finish her off. A resounding <i><b>GULP</b></i> was all Saria could hear at first, then she heard the gentle soothing beating of Malon's heart before she finally landed in the stomach. Saria's fatigue finally caught up to her as she decided to sleep as the area around her began to fill up with more milk. As the last drop of milk danced on Malon's tongue, she let out a satisfied gasp and held her hands to her stomach for a moment before regaining her composure and getting back to work. And so, the day passed on as a regular day for Malon as Saria simply disappeared into her body, becoming nutrients that helped Malon maintain her youthful beauty. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A miniscule small from a normal perspective was made when Saria had unwittingly swan-dived into the washbin. Saria quickly resurface, coughing up soap and water as she tried to regain her breath. \"Hah, hah, well I should be a bit safer now than I was before.\" Saria exasperated as she tried to breathe, yet fate decided to play a cruel trick on her optimism. Small tremors that became louder as they approached alerted Saria that someone had planned to use the washbin she was in and she tried to swim out before it was to late. She reaches the rim of the bin but found that it was too high for her to climb out, and when she realised this there was a shadow looming right above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon was sweaty and tied from another hard day of work at the farm, and she couldn't wait to relax and get herself clean. She had already set up the washbin in advance of her last job so that she could get right to the relaxing. She picked up the washbin with some difficulty and took it inside one of the empty farmhouse, out of precaution that there would be a peeping tom nearby. Saria was splashed all around as Malon had carried the water to get ready for her bath, and she was having a miserable time. The waves would push her under or around the bin and whenever Saria looked skyward to her captor, she would see a determined, sweaty Melon that looked onward toward her destination. Malon's sweat would at times fall from her glistening arms into the washbin and cause an eruption of water for Saria to dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Malon had gotten the washbin inside the farmhouse and wasted no time getting undressed for her bath. Saria stared in awe and embarrassment as she saw the well-endowed 17-year old Malon strip from her white dress to her lacy black  underwear and matching bra and then strip even further down to her birthday suit. Saria had little time to be flustered for as soon as the redhead finished removing the last article of clothing she went straight into the washbin, leaving Saria in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh, that's cold!\" Malon exclaimed as she stepped into the washbin with both feet, with the water reaching up to her valve, where Saria had slammed into due to the waves. \"Oh, ohh, <i>aaaaaaaaahhhhhhh</i>, that feels too good.\" Malon sighed as she slowly slid herself into the bath. Malon's descent had pushed Saria to the back end of the bin, where Malon's feet resided. Malon soon rested her head on the rim and decided to relax for a while, as her long red hair flowed over the water, almost above her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria realised that she would have to get Malon's attention to survive this ordeal. Although resting on the bird allowed Saria to recuperate some of her strength, she was nearly wiped out from the washbin's moving, so she swam at a crawling speed. Along the way, Saria was able to see through the water below and see all of Malon. She saw Malon's toenails painted blue to match her eyes leading to her calluses yet cute gigantic feet. Her feet lead into her legs which were toned from years of running with the horses. Saria then saw Malon's private place as she swam over it, feeling embarrassed and aghast at how much larger it was than her. She quickly swam past it to get her mind off of such thoughts. Saria soon swam over Malon's torso and was a bit amused at how cute her belly button was. At this point, Saria had reached Malon's flowing hair, meaning now she had to swim through water, soap suds, and a river of hair to reach her goal, which further tired the miniscule girl out. Finally after about 20 minutes, Saria had reached Malon's breasts, some of which was sticking out of the water. Saria was dead tired and decided to rest on the left island. Unfortunately, Malon had felt a little tickle on her breast and decided to see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, what's this?\" questioned Malon as she looked at her left breast, Saria's green hair and clothes made a great contrast against Malon's red hair.  At first, Malon thought it was a piece of grass that was on her chest, but she realised that such a small piece of grass wouldn't have made her felt anything. After seeing some miniscule movement from the green stick, Malon thought it must'vebeen a bug, and she decided to be a bit playful with the poor thing. \"Oh my, how did you end up in my bath little one? You must've fell in when I wasn't looking. I won't hurt'cha, but you did peep on me during my private time so you gotta make up for that. \" Malon playfully giggled as she grab the towel next to her. Saria wasn't sure how to feel when Malon first acknowledged her. She first thought Malon might squish her because she was seen as a bug, but Malon's giggle at the end had relieved her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, for a second. Then Saria saw Malon grab a washcloth, dip it in the water, and reach out for her. Saria was terrified, yet she had no strength to swim away from the oncoming cloth. Malon soon grip the bug tightly, yet without enough force to crush it, and proceeded to clean herself with her new bug culprit in tow.  Saria was surrounded by white cloth all around her and  she was trapped. She could only hope that Malon was merciful and release her or even help her soon enough, but first she would have to survive Malon's cleaning. Malon wipe the cloth all over her body. She wiped down both her arms, cleaned her face and neck (while being careful that she didn't swallow the bug by accident, she washed her breasts and stomach the moving towards her back and rear. She was careful not to lose the bug when she cleaned her privates with the towel by slowly moving over then. She then slid the cloth down her legs individually all the while having a playful thought on her head. \"This bug is getting to see and feel somethin' that most folks would only dream of. I hope it's a little happy in there\" ahe thought with a playful smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came time to clean her hair, Malon had put the towel on the floor and made sure the bug was inside, and she cleaned her long hair with her hands and nails running rigorously to make sure all  of it was clean. It's a good thing that Saria was in the towel for if she wasn't, then she'dhave to dodge a hailstorm of dirt and dandruff coming from Malon's hair, which would have been near impossible for a fully awake Saria much less a dead tired one. When Malon had decided to leave her sanctuary to take care of the bug, she got a larger towel to dry herself off with and she had carefully slid the bug into an empty bottle. While she didn't want to hurt the bug, Malon was curious about what kind of bug it was. She took the bottle and her dirty clothes and went back to her room to investigate the new bug prisoner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she stepped out of the farmhouse, the setting sun had gleaned across the farm, making Malon's skin seem to glow softly. Saria was in awe at staring at the glowing beauty from the glass bottle and felt a little more at ease from being saved from the hurricane of a bath. Talon was alerted to Malon's arrival as the front door opened, revealing his little girl in a minimal outfit. \"Hey Darlin' you'd best get some clothes on and get ready for supper.\" Talon said as he embraced his daughter. \"M'kay Daddy, I'll hurry.\" Malon replied in a jovial manner and ran upstairs to her room.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching her room, Malon had place the bottled bug on her desk and placed her dirty outfit in the hamper near her door. She removed her towel, leaving Saria flustered yet again witnessing the bear goddess before her. Malon duck under her bed in search of a magnifying glass, giving Saria a very generous view of the farmgirl's supple behind. \"Couldn't she put on clothes first?\" Saria asked out of embarrassment of seeing everything Malon had as plain as day. When Malon found the magnifying, she stood straight up, giving her little mountains and her hair a bounce as she skyrocketed into the heaven's from Saria's perspective. Saria was once again floored by the stature of the large girl and the view straight ahead of her cavern that was large enough to swallow the kokiri girl whole. Saria was beet-red and paralysed from the view she was sure boys like Mido would kill for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's see what kinda bug you are little guy.\" Malon mused as she bent over her desk to see her bottled guest and decide what she should do with it. Saria tried not to stare at the hanging mountains as Malon bent down and instead looked skyward to the giant eye looking down at her. She tried to wave her arms to show Malon that she was a person and not an insect. Malon looked down at the bug and noticed some peculiar thing about it. She saw the bug wave its two front legs above its head, and they were creamed colored and looked like arms. She noticed its head was shaped in a bowl like fashion with tusks that resembled bangs. She saw a slightly fuzzy body that looked like clothes, girl clothes at that with two very tiny indents on the chest region. Finally, Malon saw the face which looked almost like a human girl's face. \"Huh, you look like a tiny person little bug.\" Malon observed,which then turned to shock as she saw the bug furiously not its head. \"Wait... are you... are you nodding?\" Malon inquired. She received another nod. \"So that means that... you ARE a person?!\" Malon cried receiving more nodding from the 'bug-girl.' \"Oh wow, ain't that something.\" Malon saw the girl turn her head, and a quick look at herself revealed why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYYYAAAAAA!!!\" Malon shrieked and jump backward to her dresser as she realised that she was plume naked in front of another person, feeling a massive amount of heat rushing to her cheeks. \"\"Malon! What's going on up there?!\" Talon yelled after hearing his daughter shriek in fear. \"It's nothing Daddy, I just saw a bug in ma room.\" Malon replied, not wanting to alarm her father of her freaky discovery. \"Awe Darlin' I thought you was tougher than that. Well, you better hurry up cause dinner's almost ready.\" \"Okay Daddy.\" Saria recoiled as the yelling was too much for her mini ears to handle. Malon quickly slipped on a nightgown to save face and try to talk with her micro guest. \"H...hel...llo there.\" Malon mumbled as she felt flustered by unwittingly revealing herself. \"My name is Ma...Malon. What's yours?\" Saria tried to say her name but her voice couldn't reach her giantess houstess's ears. \"Oh, right, guess you're too far for me ta hear. Hmmm... I got an idea, but ya need to trust me, kay?\" Saria nodded as she really didn't have a choice in the matter and she wanted to find someone to help her get back to normal. Malon slowly tilted the bottle horizontally and flattened her palm out near the bottle's opening. Saria walked along the bottle staring at Malon's concerned and warm gaze as she trekked to the hand platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick hop off the bottle and a small twitch of the hand let Malon know that the bug-girl landed safely. She carefully lifted her hand up to her ear to listen to the little girl's story. \"I'M SARIA.\" Saria raised her voice to hopefully sound clear to the giantess farmgirl. \"Nice ta meet'cha.\" Malon whispered not wanting to break the forest girl's ears. \"Now, how'd ya end up in ma bath in the firstplace?\" Saria recounted the events that led to this, from playing the song of the minish to surviving a rapid that was a small stream to almost being crushed by a fellow Kokiri girl to riding a bird all the way to the farm. Malon gasped, cooed and tried to comfort the little one as best as she could. \"Awe, poor like thing, I just wanna hug you and make you feel alright.\" Malon then brought her hands to her ample chest to hug her little friend. Saria wasn't uncomfortable, in fact the warmth of the giant hill made her feel a bit better about her situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready! Ya better get sum grub 'fore is gone!\" Talon cried out. \"Okay Daddy I'm coming.\" \"Say Saria, are ya feeling hungry?\" Malon asked bringing the pint-sized girl back to her ear. Saria's body responded by growling loud enough for Malon to hear, and Malon giggled a bit. \"Well, I'll be honoured for you to join, but we can't let Daddy know about'cha, it'd be too complicated to explain.\" Malon looked about her outfit and saw a great hiding spot: a chest pocket on her gown. \"Hold on lil missy, are get ready for a ride.\" Malon tilted her hand towards her pocket, causing Saria to scream of laughter followed by some laughs after she landed in the rather small pocket. It only reached up to Saria's waist, which would have given her away had Malon not been wearing a green nightgown. As she headed downstairs, Malon smelled the roasted cuccoo that Talon made for both of them and she sat down to eat. When Talon was looming, Malon cut up a small piece and handed it to Saria. The head-sized piece of cuccoo had added some extra weight to the pocket that could send Saria overboard and into Malon's drink below. Saria...</span></div></div>",

And as it did, the world around her seemed slightly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d she stuttered. \u201cLet's blame it on fatigue, okay? I must probably be overworked and feel a little dizzy. A spontaneously growing barn or blue light coming out of nowhere isn't a thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe therefore pushed the door open, although this again required a greater effort from the farmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must get this door greased apparently\u2026Gee, why is everything going wrong this morning?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, while Malon was facing the cows, the same blue shimmer engulfed her again, but this time she clearly witnessed its aftermath, causing her to drop the bucket as her frustration was building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, this stupid mail pranked me with some shrinking spell or something. Now let's see who the culprit is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back to the mailbox, she glanced at it to find its origin, thankfully mentioned on the message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, it's from the Kakariko Village apothecary. I should have known better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of Ingo\u2019s absence -he would always sleep more than his employees- she jumped on Epona, which thankfully was still fitting the size of the downsized milkmaid. Malon felt herself shrinking again as she was rushing through Hyrule Field, but the travel proved short enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I'm lucky, I might manage to yell at them before requiring riding a bee to complain to those Goddesses damned apothicarians!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter jumping out of Epona, Malon clearly saw how the town\u2019s inhabitants were looking at her. But could she blame them? She was as tall as a ten year old girl, although her puberty-altered body had stayed the same. She slammed the shop\u2019s door open, making her anger obvious. The shop owner, a handsome young man, who would normally always smile to his customers, was this time looking rather anxious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, sweetheart, how can I help you?\u201d he said with his sugary voice faking his uneasiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm no kid, you hear me?\u201d Malon angrily replied. \u201cI'll have you know I got pranked by a mail from your shop, it contained a spell that turned me like...this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man did not look surprised, although his face turned darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I guess we can only blame the old hag for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe old who?  Who are you talking about..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout me.\u201d An old woman\u2019s voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon was astonished at the sight of the newcomer. She really looked like an old hag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, come to my laboratory. It might not be too late!\u201d She said before maniacally laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon complied, although the ever worried gaze of the salesman was in no way a good omen.

The faster you are shrinking, the faster your size will stabilize.\u201d The shop owner said, holding Malon in her hand, her grisp around the miniature girl\u2019s waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how can you know that?  Except if you are the one responsible for my situation!\u201d Malon shouted, pointing her tiny finger at the witch looking woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's not exactly true. But you have a point when you say I've planned your arrival. Now if you excuse me, I have to introduce you to my other...little friends.\u201d<br>\r\nShe said, locking the minuscule farmer in a wooden cage.<br>\r\n\u201cNext time you'll think twice before trusting mails promoting magic! My master is going to be very proud of having such a beauty in his merchandise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-master? So you are abducting and shrinking people,\u201d Malon deducted as she took a look at the other cages around, \u201cfor a business of some sort?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy of course! Do you really think I do that out of sheer pleasure? You little people are a pain in the neck to take care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the creepy woman left, leaving Malon in her cell, now that she was as tall as a toothpick. Malon fell on her knees, and sighed. <br>\r\n\u201cYou bet that salesman guy looked weird, no body would want to work with a creepy old lady like that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it could be worse\u2026\u201d an unknown voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-who said that?\u201d Malon asked, snapping out of her pessimism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw a short boy dressed in green, wearing a hat reminding the shrunken milkmaid of someone, although she could not remember whom exactly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe great Mido, at your service.\u201d The tiny boy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat is a little hyperbolic, if you ask me,\u201d Malon grinned, even though she knew she was not especially tall either.<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have you been here anyway? And more importantly, what's going to happen to us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what I heard, some of us are going to be used as guinea pigs for her new potions-\u201d Mido said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-and the others?! What about them?\u201d the redhead woman interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-they\u2019ll get transferred to the old lady\u2019s big cheese\u2026That's all what I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon put her hand over her mouth, realizing what that meant. The creepy witch promised to send her to her \u201cmaster\u201d...What was awaiting her ahead? Trying to change of topic, she asked: <br>\r\n\u201cHow did you end up at that size and trapped here anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMido shrugged.<br>\r\n\u201cI ordered a potion to turn into the handsome guy the girl I have a crush on would love. But as soon as I took a sip, I collapsed. Next thing I know, I'm a few inches tall and trapped inside that cage\u2026How about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI received a cursed mail which\u2026dragged me here and slowly shrank me down to that size! Tough luck, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door then opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of bad luck\u2026\u201d Mido commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Malon turned to the door, she saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

Malon's worries were even more genuine as her abductor\u2019s hand reached for her cage, grabbing the handle on the top of it, and lifted it. Malon was using all her strength to not slip to the other side of her prison and knock herself unconscious, although this would have at least been helpful to prevent her from losing control over the fear invading her, as it was the case just now. Her scream, although at a far more sharper tone than what it should be, at least given her current size, echoed through the old woman\u2019s ear like the most annoying of all noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, won't you shut up already?! Foolish girl. This is a privilege I am granting you here. Furthermore, you are not coming alone\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA synchronized gasp emanated from all the prisoners, whom Malon had not even paid attention to, given her state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Fear not, you idiots! I have already chosen my secondary VIP,\u201d she said, seizing an empty cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe lost it,\u201d Malon thought. \u201cThere's no one in that cage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll get you a special friend so that my master is as twice as satisfied!\u201d she fiendishly grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-help!\u201d Malon shouted as she was being carried outside the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were crossing the streets of Kakariko Village, Malon's cell suddenly turned dark, as the wooden bars separating her from the rest of the gigantic world were covered by a black layer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? I'm not that evil. I always make sure my little passengers have a blanket for the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Malon was no idiot. She knew very well what the curtain over the cage was for: it would be rather suspicious if the townsfolk was to see one of its merchants transporting a living doll begging to be released across the normally peaceful city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they walked past the village -the only way for the shrunken woman to figure it out was to no longer hear normal sized people around her talking-<br>\r\n, Malon could no longer tell where they were going, the black curtain obstructing her sight. How was she going to escape now, since she would have no idea where she had been left? Not to mention her tiny size would definitely make her odd of running away even more difficult. Dozens of minutes had passed since their departure out of Kakariko Village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, that old hag\u2019s stamina is no joke!\u201d Malon said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet it is, sweetheart. Now be a good little girl and keep quiet. We're almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had particularly stressed her pronunciation on the word \u201clittle\u201d. The miniature Malon sighed, preferring to save her energy in trying to find a way out of that mess, rather than wasting it in replying to her sassy kidnapper. On a second thought, Malon wondered: who could possibly be this \u201cVIP\u201d she was talking about..? The answer did not take long to arrive, as the constant quakes striking the milkmaid\u2019s cage at each of the old hag\u2019s steps brutally ceased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the space Malon was trapped in, was a familiar voice echoing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm truly sorry for bringing you here, at the entrance of Kokiri Forest\u2026\u201d the mysterious man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't worry about that.\u201d she waved in a sugary manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon did not know what to do. If this man was going to be this crackpot\u2019s next victim...it was her duty to warn him at all cost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have the potion you've ordered. You should take a sip of it right now, it is not meant to be left out in the cold for long!\u201d the old woman eagerly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was looking for a specific bottle among the flasks she had brought along, Malon thought this was the right opportunity to draw the newcomer\u2019s attention. She started to kick the wooden beams as hard as she could to make noise. There was no way she would miss her only chance of saving herself, as well as this man! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's that strange box you're carrying anyway?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt sounds like there's a rat trying to break free from it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA rat you say?!\u201d Malon shouted, her feet still hitting the cage. But her voice was far too high-pitched for her protestations to be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly, you must be psychic, my good sir. I understand why you needed this magic enhancing mixture from me!\u201d she said, handing the bottle over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh !\u201d the shrunken farmer girl squeaked, knowing well what was going to happen, given Mido\u2019s fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, hearing the potion pouring away in gulps, followed by a predictable cry of astonishment as the potion took effect. Soon after, as the dark curtain over Malon's cage was lifted, she saw the other cage was occupied by\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Malon stared at the young man in the green tunic now sharing her fate. His face, and even his way of dressing was...oddly familiar to the farmer. Although the situation was not suited for it, she noticed how she was blushing. She shook her head to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she told herself. \u201cOne problem at a time. I should get his attention and try to reassure him. Finding a friend in this situation is the least I can do to make it better.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stealthily reached for his cage, her arm crossing the bars separating her from the new prisoner. Trying to poke him awake, she extended her arm even further, while looking up, at the old woman. The latter was fortunately not even thinking about them, apparently far too satisfied of her recent harvest:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, with these two...The Ghost Hunter is finally going to accept me as his student! With his magical spells added to my potions, I shall be invincible! Even Ganondorf will fear me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Malon was listening, she blinked as she understood what this was implying. That Ghost Hunter...Whoever he was, was the one responsible for her shrinking! She had to wake that guy up, and find a way for them to escape! Someone with such a spooky name could not be a good omen for the two prisoners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! Wake up already!\u201d Malon shouted as she was grabbing and shaking one of his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee...Did I just find someone even lazier than my father?!\u201d The milkmaid moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then remembered how that kid, Mido, told her how the shrinking potion knocked him unconscious, the only problem was that she had no idea how much time it would take for that man to wake up. She had to find a way while the old hag was distracted: such an opportunity was not going to to show up again! As her mind was cooking up a solution, the old lady\u2019s carelessness kicked in, as she walked through a bunch of bushes, the cages in her hands clashing against the vegetation. Malon instinctively closed her eyes and hunkered down as the leaves and thorns were making their way across the cells. Malon gasped as she felt something dragging her against one of the cage\u2019s walls! Looking at the plants storming inside, she noticed she got stuck against vine: one of its thorns had pierced through her dress and was pulling her as they were advancing. Giving it a good kick, the needle, possibly as big as a javelin to Malon, broke loose while they finally made it out of the miniature jungle. After breaking free from all this mess, the farmer took a look at her unconscious companion. To her surprise, he was left unscathed: the vines and branches passed over him as he was lazily hugging the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sometimes seems that laziness DOES solve all problems\u2026\u201d Malon commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of her frustration, something caused hope to shine on her face: the long, sharp thorn remained in her cage, letting her pick it up to wield it like a spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I were to thrust it into this old fossil\u2019s thumb, that'd serve her right!\u201d She thought, although she quickly gave up on this idea. After all, if one was stung by a wasp, how long would it take for it to end up squashed as a retaliation? She therefore shook her head, thinking of a better plan, since her eyes glanced at the keyhole of her cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I never picked a lock before, especially at this size\u2026Not to mention if this was to fail, I'd be truly screwed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she saw them getting closer to the remains of Castle Town, a place known for its bloodthirsty Redeads, Malon did not hesitate any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Goddesses, let it work!\u201d She prayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thorn then stabbed the keyhole and was stirring around its mechanism while Malon was manipulating it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, come on, just open already!\u201d She said as her panic was building up, and yet the door was refusing to budge. A sudden shock caused Malon's cage to quake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid rock!\u201d Her abductor said while stabilizing herself after tripping on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured by the fact that she was still unaware of what the shrunken woman was up to, Malon was even more satisfied as she heard the door unlock, deducing the old woman\u2019s clumsiness weakened the wooden door more, enabling the milkmaid to pick its lock successfully. She was brought back to reality when she remembered that opening the gate was only the easy part: she still had a jump to make to join an unconscious shrunken guy if she truly desired to save him! Taking a long breath, Malon jumped, her improvised weapon pointing forward. Despite the difficulty of the maneuver, she not only succeeded in jumping far enough, but the tip of her lance landed right into the door of the other cage, simply bursting it open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow, that cage certainly is tougher from the inside than from the exterior!\u201d She said rubbing her head, barely recovering from the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not waste any time and took the unconscious man on her shoulders: she could thank all her work in Lon Lon Ranch for drastically increasing her strength. Only two things were lacking for her evasion plan to be perfect: finding a way to jump off and not splatter on the ground, and if she could by the way find a way to restore them to normal size, then she could start to truly find some relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I'm certainly not in the mood for starting a new life by milking aphids and riding ladybugs in an ant sized farm, like an ideal couple!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed again as she said this. What was wrong with her? She did not even know who that guy was! Shaking her head, she marvelled at a nearby branch, and grinned as she jumped right onto it, her smile even more obvious as the old lady was still on her way to the ill fated Castle Town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we can finally take a breath!\u201d She told her companion as she turned to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, something caught her attention: </span></div></div>",

She curiously could not stop to stare at it\u2026It indeed felt oddly familiar to her. Yet again, the young woman blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's no time for sitting around! First off, I need to find a safer place\u2026for both of us.\u201d The tiny lady said as she was dragging the poisoned man towards a less exposed spot. She found a bunch of dandelions under which they remained for a dozen of minutes, allowing the minuscule milkmaid to have a break, peacefully lying on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalk about a bad day! Now that the old fossil is no longer a threat, I have to find a way to get us back to normal size\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about how she had left Lon Lon Ranch before opening this stupid letter. Ingo was probably raging at her absence and already reducing her salary for going missing without any explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe may think he can shrink my salary small enough to scare me, but it'll never be as tiny as I am right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, failing to find a solution to the situation. A faint grunt snapped her out of her despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Malon said while taking a look at her prot\u00e9g\u00e9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter stirred around, before slowly getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the...Where am I..? What...What is this place..?\u201d he said with an obvious confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Hyrule Field,\u201d Malon casually said, sitting on a rock behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man turned, surprised by the redhead\u2019s presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hi!\u201d She awkwardly waved at him, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHum, hello.\u201d he replied. \u201cExcuse me miss, but what are we doing here..? I don't remember coming to this forest, in fact I sweared I simply was-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-buying a potion from an old creepy lady.\u201d Malon concluded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly! How did you know?\u201d the blonde haired man asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a long story. To answer your first question, we're in the middle of Hyrule Field as I just said, although Castle Town is half a kilometer away, but going there on foot would take us the entire day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that? Hyrule isn't that big of a kingdom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren't that tall either\u2026\u201d Malon moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean we-WOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger stepped back as a dog-sized snail was passing by their lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow, did you see that?\u201d he asked, impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet I did...As I told you, we're tiny.\u201d Malon said without much interest, although she also tried to sugarcoat the truth to the newcomer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be ridiculous, everyone knows that people don't-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Malon\u2019s patience was running short. She had been cursed, captured, and treated like merchandise. Getting mocked by the one she struggled to save was what caused her to lose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm telling you we are tiny! Tiny, you hear me?! I've been through hell to get you out of that old hag\u2019s clutch, while she had captured me as well! Know your place, Fairy Boy!\u201d she shouted at him before running across the grass, her frustration overwhelming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...What did you call me?!\u201d the man shouted back, but Malon was already out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter kept walking, her head staring angrily at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I think I could be taking care of my cows, spend some time with Anju in Kakariko Village...but no, instead I am as tall as a toothpick with that ocarina carrying idiot for company! Talk about a day!\u201d She grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought interrupted the young woman in her anger. She had called this guy \u201cFairy Boy\u201d and his ocarina was definitely ringing a bell, but she could not possibly know him...Or could she?<br>\r\nThe more her curiosity was building, the weaker was her rage. After all, she had not even asked him his name!  The poor guy had not gotten the time to cope with his poisoning that she was already leaving him at his fate?! What kind of savior was she?! Feeling guilty, she slowly turned, and started to walk back to that guy and apologize. Something however interfered with her intentions: while she was walking away without looking where she was heading to, she had managed to stray! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, what have I done..?\u201d Malon said as the seamless tall grass was obstructing her view, just like dense trees would have done in an ordinary forest. This was only the beginning of her problems. As she was hurrying into finding her way, her panic was growing. What if she was truly lost? What if she stayed at this size for the rest of her life..? Would someone even find her? Fate did not show any mercy to her since a rough answer to her question did not take long to find her. In her careless progress, Malon tripped and fell, as something gooey stuck to her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw...What the heck was that..?!\u201d she angrily said, trying to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe failed to do so as the cause of her fall was dragging her in the opposite direction she was heading. The shrunken woman leaned forward to identify what was causing this mess. Malon almost had an heart attack once she spotted the threat: a Skulltula, one of those normally already huge spiders, apparently chose the redhead as its next meal. Malon did not normally fear spiders that much -dealing with them was part of her routine when maintaining Lon Lon Ranch- but her reduced size made it look like a living nightmare. The fiendish, eight legged creature\u2019s eyes blinked as a second stream of silk burst out of its gruesome chericae, slowly wrapping the minuscule milkmaid into the whitish glue. Malon did not want to know what was coming next, although she knew she was bound to end up torn apart by the disgusting arthropod. But while she was desperately waiting to meet with her doom so that this could finally come to an end, something unexpected occurred. A storm of golden flames flared between the Skulltula and its prey, enabling the latter to break free, the cocoon Malon was trapped in burning away as the supernatural fire engulfed it to turn it into ashes, mysteriously sparing the shrunken farmer. The poor spider did not prove this lucky, for the mystical flames redirected themselves towards it, and incinerated the monster in the blink of an eye before finally fading away for good. <br>\r\nMalon simply shook her head, wondering if she had not been suffering from some hallucinations. Her doubts were unfounded when she saw the same young man she saved quickly drawing his hand to help her getting up, saying:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He apparently did not seem angry about her previous reaction. But this was no reason to get away with it, the farmer thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Malon\u2026What's yours? L-listen Link, I'm truly sorry for what I said earlie-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man named Link simply shook his head and replied:<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it's no big deal. I think we both got...bigger issues to take care of, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis somewhat witty pun hinted Malon he was briefed on the situation. After all, did he not save her from this disgusting oversized spider? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you\u2026Do that? With the fire, I mean.\u201d Malon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shrugged, and smiled as an apology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean that?\u201d he said as small and thin flames were flaring from his fingertips. \u201cThat's, huh...What we could call a gift I received from a special friend.\u201d he awkwardly explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis guy really seems to have secrets\u2026 And despite this, I'm pretty sure I know him\u2026\u201d Malon thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter raised her finger, about to ask him something again, but Link covered her mouth with his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy turn for the questions now. What was that name you gave me earlier anyway? You know that \u201cFairy Boy\u201d thing? How do you even know I used to have a fairy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we did meet each other!\u201d Malon said out loud. \u201cI remember it clearly now! There was a boy, seven years ago, who would come to play with me and Epona in Lon Lon Ranch! He had a fairy, was dressed in green, and he even owned an ocarina!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do remember a little girl from there, but she was only\u2026\u201d Link started to explain, before interrupting himself, as if he had come to a brutal conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat little girl? Who are you talking about? What does it have to do with anything?\u201d Malon asked with impatience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink remained silent, trying to think of a way to explain he had been unconscious for seven years after entering the Temple of Time. He therefore opted for a shortened version of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou nailed it. That boy, this was me. But since I was...busy for a couple of years, I struggled to recognize you, just as you did with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what have you been doing during all those years..? What about that blue fairy who was always flying around you?\u201d<br>\r\nShe unknowingly said that with jealousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's a very long story, literally speaking. When I...went missing, I never found my fairy again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I'm sorry,\u201d Malon said, although with some hypocrisy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know how to save her. That's why I was investigating this strange old woman\u2019s business. But it seems like she was aware of my suspicions and tried to get rid of me by doing\u2026this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's what I would call tough luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shrugged and replied:<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we're in the same boat anyway. And complaining isn't that effective of a solution am I right?\u201d he grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you are, although I have no idea how we are going to find a cure for our condition.\u201d Malon commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think one of my special friends could fix this in the blink of an eye, if we can reach one of them, that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you talking about exactly?\u201d the milkmaid asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, the Great Fairies of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Great Fairies, you say? Like those magical ladies that live in fountains from bedtime stories?\u201d a skeptical Malon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. But if you think that I'm a lier, then sure, enjoy your life as a mere bug. Now if you excuse me, I have work to do.\u201d Link said, taunting her as he walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey wait a second!\u201d Malon begged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d the man asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I'm sorry, I'll take your ideas seriously. Besides, I don't think you'll say no to a guide to help you making your way across Hyrule, right? A lot of things have changed over those seven years.\u201d The farmer girl said, confidently standing before her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd I was certainly not going to leave you behind, especially after your efforts to get me out of that cage. I'm just throwing some jokes to keep you awake!\u201d he said as he winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would call that a threat, not a joke, you moron!\u201d Malon thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they were making their way, with Link getting rid of the monsters by scaring them away with his magic and Malon showing him the way across the seemingly tall grass to the shrunken adventurers -she could thank her experience of delivering her products to Kakariko Village for that- they optimistically kept progressing and talking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never asked you but,\u201d Link said, hesitating. \u201cHow did you get shrunk anyway?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon awkwardly laughed and told him:<br>\r\n\u201cI've been an idiot. I received a letter containing a curse and I followed its instructions. I then went to Kakariko Village as I was slowly shrinking down, where I got captured by that freak of a woman to eventually witness you ending up in the same mess as I am now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well,\u201d Link said, getting rid of another Skulltula with a burst of Din\u2019s Fire -his sword being far too small to be of any use-, \u201cYou can't always do things right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was saying this, the thunder roared and a thick lightning bolt flared across the sky, tearing it apart in a flash blinding them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know where you want to go to find that special friend of yours, but we should prepare ourselves better if we truly hope to achieve anything.\u201d Malon commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d her friend replied, looking at the nearby neaby leaves shielding them from the falling raindrops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey therefore chose to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a mutual nod to stop their progression and ensure their long term survival, the two took shelter under a bunch of dandelions, and proceeded to gather nearby resources, such as leaves, flower petals and even small rocks -which were particularly difficult to manipulate given their current situation- to strengthen their lair from any nearby predator, or simply from the soft rain progressively evolving into an airborne maelstrom. Malon was normally not afraid of thunderstorms, but the flashy cracks popping out of the sky seemed like amplified, as if the three Goddesses were unleashing their wrath all together. The spooky dark clouds soiling the usual sunlight by casting their raging shadows did not help either. The young farmer almost regretted the nights she would spend working to compensate for her father's laziness, when the menacing clouds were scaring the cows and Cuccos alike. Shaking her head to focus on what was happening now, she contemplated the walls of stray she had just built, and found some relief in the quality of her work. Even the upcoming storm\u2019s icy winds would not pierce through her minuscule but detailed construction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Link was breaking rocks into bricks and sticking them together using the clay he found a few steps away. He then used them to cover the mud of their improvised shack. Drawing his sword, he shredded the petals into something similar to cotton, resulting in comfortable beds. The two also combined their strength to drag a chunk of wood as big as an apple into the camp, providing enough fuel to sustain a fire for the entire night. Both fatigued after such an unexpected and emotionally challenging day, Link and Malon agreed on taking a rest and calling it a day, they roasted some berries they had found, resulting in a delicious jam. They even found the time to build what could roughly be called a bathtub by hardening the clay with Link\u2019s magical flames and collecting pure water from rain drops. Once feeling clean and revived by the water -they obviously took turns to appreciate the pool, they were only friends after all- they finally opted for taking a nap on the smooth beds waiting for them. And although they were very comfortable, they -or Malon at least-  struggled to fall asleep. She therefore took a look at her companion, lying next to her, and right before the latter closed his eyes, she asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay...wouldn't it be safer if I was watching over the camp for the night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying you're not going to sleep at all? Tomorrow's going to be a long day you know? Not to mention I can take care of it no probl-\u201d Link tried to say, before getting interrupted by this time Malon's own finger shutting his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen. I'm thankful for everything you've done for me. I'd be dead meat if it weren't for your help with that Skulltula. Now I think it's up to me to prove useful. So be a nice Fairy Boy and get some sleep. I'll take care of the camp for that night.\u201d Malon said with a smooth tone she was not used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link indeed felt tired, he gave up and nodded, before saying: <br>\r\n\u201cWake me up in a few hours. It's no use to keep ourselves alive during the night if one of us can't make any progress because of pointless fatigue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it.\u201d Malon nodded back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink therefore closed his eyes, and a few minutes later, snores were already echoing throughout the shelter. Malon, on the other hand, did not pay attention to it and unconsciously focused on the young man\u2019s face instead. The tiny milkmaid facepalmed as she realized she was starring at him like a pervert instead of watching the surroundings, as she was supposed to do. Thus, Malon sat in front of a square shaped hole they had dug through the wall to serve as a window. While starring at the beauty of the lightning flaring from above, Malon almost found her warm and comfortable new house to be more pleasant than Lon Lon Ranch: at least Ingo was not there to yell constantly at her for not working efficiently enough. Speaking of the Wolfos, he was certainly storming with rage even more violently than the thunderstorm she was witnessing for her mysterious absence. The young woman struggled to understand why she was so reluctant about returning to her former life, and sure, she was eager to grow back to normal size, but was she really willing to get back working for that tyrant of Ingo? Malon had always been a very hard worker, even more than Ingo. And yet, she was far from being treated as she rightfully deserved, although she grew accustomed to it. And so she kept looking at the spectacular sky for hours, meditating on her previous and current situation alike, so that she could find an answer to the dilemma poisoning her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like a jolt when Link touched her shoulder, waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to stay with Link!\u201d Malon brutally shouted at an imaginary interlocutor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? I'm right here, right now!\u201d Link laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon gasped as she understood she had been dozing off against the window instead of making sure they were safe as promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not what you're thinking!\u201d she quickly tried to explain. \u201cI was just watching through the window to make sure that-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-I wouldn't feel lonely when I'm snoring like a Goron?\u201d Link joked. \u201cIt's alright. It was my turn to keep an eye on you anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026What did I say, like, just after you talked to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink laughed before answering: <br>\r\n\u201cI'm not sure but, I heard you saying you wanted to stay with me. It's up to you to provide me with a translation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon smiled and shrugged.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I don't think dreams are very relevant of what one is truly thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr are they..?\u201d She awkwardly thought, as Link was taking position before the window, letting her find some rest on her bed. Although she was on the brink of starting a brand new dream, she asked, after covering her mouth with her hand while she was snoring:</span></div></div>",

What do you think about them?\u201d Malon insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink started to walk back and forth inside the small shack they had built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could provide you with a satisfying answer, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what?\u201d the curious redhead asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might think it's pretty crazy stuff.\u201d Link said, now scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon smirked at his comment. <br>\r\n\u201cCome now, Fairy Boy, should I remind you we are as small as bugs, we're currently spending the night under a bunch of flowers we are using as a roof for a house we built that looks more like an ant hill than anything else? You can't get any crazier than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smirked back, and proceeded to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright. Basically, seven years ago, I once had a dream in which I was in front of Castle Town, when a thunderstorm was starting to rage...Just like now, as I'm thinking about it. Anyway, what I saw that night, was Princess Zelda and her bodyguard escaping from the city, while Ganondorf was chasing them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon, impressed, could not help but ask: \u201cThat's a frightening nightmare to say the least, but where are you going exactly with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked very embarrassed now, especially as he was blushing and nervously biting his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my point is simple: everything I saw that night truly happene-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon unfortunately had to show a little more patience on Link's tale, since the latter had clumsily tripped into the four centimeter wide pool (which in itself was rather spacious to them), forcing him to slowly get out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Malon teased him. \u201cDon't bother getting out of there. After all, there's nothing like fresh water to wake up airheads, right? Especially a cute one like yours.\u201d she mockingly smiled.<br>\r\n\u201cSo? What were you saying again?\u201d she asked, before suffering from Link\u2019s retaliation, which manifested as a sprout of icy cold water to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Boys\u2026\u201d She grunted as she was shivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on...\u201d Link answered to the grumpy face glaring at him.<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone knows there's nothing like a surprise shower to cheer up sleep deprived sermoning girls!\u201d he openly taunted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon, keeping her eyes closed, slowly got up, squeezed the water out of her long red hair, before doing something Link did not expect at all: she took off the rest of her clothes -bra and panties excepted - and jumped right into the bathing pool, resulting in an impressive splash, the resulting wave hitting both the nearby walls and Link\u2019s face, and even partially the fire roaring in agony at the center of the shack. As Link rubbed his eyes to clear his blurry sight, what he saw left him somewhat confused: Malon was standing right before Link, asking him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that should do it for your sermon, Fairy Boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer assertion was followed by an unexpected silence. Malon brutally thought: \u201cWhat the hell did I just do?! I'm standing in a pool almost naked with someone I met back a few hours ago! What is wrong with me?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if her mind struggled to find a rational explanation, her heart did the job with remarkable effectiveness. She felt the latter beating harder than ever before and her overall sanity was slipping away as her gaze was meeting Link\u2019s, which looked as confused as hers Malon eventually took a sit in the pool, and tried to focus by asking Link the following question: <br>\r\n\u201cSo...What were you saying, I mean before, you fell down?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink seemed rather astonished by the change of topic, and certainly found it suspicious, but started over his explanation anyway:<br>\r\n\u201cLong story short, everything I saw at this moment proved to be true: Ganondorf was there, Princess Zelda\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link was absorbed within his tale, Malon kept thinking about their current situation. She almost slapped herself in the face as she came to this harsh yet simple conclusion: she remembered why she never really forgot who Link was. After all, he was the only one to whom Malon had ever given a nickname, especially since she had never felt any interest in boys and girls alike. And yet, she unconsciously remembered him, in spite of those seven years. Not lingering any longer with her thoughts, she acknowledged she had always been loving him, hence her irrational habit to stare at the young man, or even help him as best as she could, especially as he had gotten trapped in the exact same way as she was. Her companion, still talking, did not even notice how his friend was aimlessly looking at the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-That's basically it\u2026\u201dhe concluded. \u201cForgive me if I have been talking for too long, bu-\u201d he said, before noticing with too much delay that Malon was getting dangerously closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, Fairy Boy\u2026\u201d She defied him as his face was turning red. \u201cThere is one simple thing I need to know...Ever since we met each other\u2026Who was I to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink\u2019s face was now blazing. He simply could not say a thing. \u201cBy the Goddesses,\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat does she have in mind..? Sure, I kinda had a crush on her as a kid, but times have changed\u2026\u201d This last thought unsettled him even more. What did those seven years mean to him anyway? Malon had changed a lot, and so did he, and her mature body looked more than desirable, he could not deny that. As her lips were about to collide with his, Link simply put his doubts away, and mimicked the red haired woman in her undertaking. <br>\r\nOnce the kiss ceased, Malon and Link\u2026</span></div></div>",

I guess we're both kinda shaken by the circumstances, right?\u201d Link said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d Malon replied, although without sincerity. <br>\r\n\u201cI think we should just get some rest now. Tomorrow is going to be a long day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded without adding anything else to the conversation, and headed to bed, so did Malon and only the awkward silence remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only at midday that Link woke up. Around him was the mess they started last night, the dying embers of their improvised chimney emitting a faint scarlet glow. Link washed his face by splashing it with the pool of running water crossing the shelter. The noise this triggered proved enough to wake up Malon as well, and the latter\u2019s reaction to the scene they left was very similar to Link\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...Talk about a good night of sleep\u2026\u201d Malon casually said, passing her hand over her forehead, as if recovering after a hangover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm not going to object on that!\u201d Link replied with a friendly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn't seem angry at me for kissing him last night. Does he even remember I did?\u201d Malon mentally wondered. \u201cThere's only one way to check it out for sure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, she quickly put her clothes on, while Link was making sure the fire had died off, extinguishing it with water, resulting in a white cloud of dense smoke, which took a while to fade away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-link\u2026\u201d Malon tried to say through the coughs the ashy haze was causing.<br>\r\n\u201cAbout last night, I wanted to apologize. I should have never kissed you like that. I'm sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way Link was looking at her, the milkmaid almost read disappointment on his face, although she could also blame the smoke for messing up with her eyesight. Link, on the other hand, simply laughed and answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now, if I were that upset I would have told you already. I apologize too for putting you in such an awkward situation. I only wish we would-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Malon never succeeded in knowing what Link\u2019s desire was, for loud noises and quakes were harassing their ears and disrupting their frail shack\u2019s architecture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Goddesses\u2026What was that?!\u201d Malon instinctively cursed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Link\u2019s face turned serious. He swiftly waved her into silence, and stood still to sharpen his hearing. The loud stomping shockwaves were increasing in intensity: someone -or something- was definitely getting closer.<br>\r\nAs the mysterious quakes reached a paroxysmal level, the outer mayhem threatening them turned silent,  letting the flows of constantly splashing water stabilize. This peaceful moment proved to only be the eye of a greater storm, for the roof of the minuscule lair brutally was lifted, a hideous, wrinkle ridden hand tearing it apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are, you stupid little pests!\u201d an unfortunately familiar voice roared with satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did not give to the situation a second thought and rushed towards his sword, still lying nearby in its sheath. He however did not expect such a fast retaliation from the intruder, since the shrunken man never reached his weapon in due time. The old woman grabbed him as easily as if he were a mere mosquito, which, in terms of mass, was a rather accurate comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that the tiny farmer could clearly see that the situation was taking a turn for the worse, she looked around her in panic, but certainly not to escape: she grabbed the first item she could find to use as a weapon: fate was cynical, for the young woman did find what she was looking for, but at a price: her hands clutching a burning stick that miraculously had its flames left unscathed by the water spreading from all sides, Malon focused as hard as one possibly could to resist the club\u2019s terrible heat while blisters were forming on her fingers, and thrust the weapon into the gigantic aggressor's thumb. The aftermath did not take long to manifest itself: Link immediately fell down a little further from the shack. Unfortunately, by the time he would make it back to Malon after crossing through the grassy maze, the latter was going to be on her own to keep the diabolical apothecary at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The old woman thundered. \u201cYou again?!\u201d she barked while getting rid of the thorn stabbing her hand.<br>\r\n\u201cThis time you're done!\u201d The old woman threatened, reaching for the shrunken redhead. <br>\r\nMalon struggled to break free, but with no weapon nearby, there was no real hope for her to achieve anything, especially with her injured hands. It took no time for her to end up trapped inside a glass jar the apothecary had brought along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy now,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's no need to try to escape this time: you won't find any lock to pick in there.\u201d She taunted Malon while she was pounding the glass walls with her tiny, sore fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you find us anyway?!\u201d Malon shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let's just say you don't find tiny houses with a nice little smoking chimney everyday!\u201d The potion shop owner taunted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the situation was not that chaotic, Malon would have given herself a good slap. Of course this fire was bound to reveal them. But now was not the time to deal with this. Instead, Malon desperately tried to grab on to the bottle cap, and prayed for her weight to be enough to pull the obstacle within the crystal prison. While she was too busy mocking the pitiful efforts of Malon to break free, the old shop owner never noticed Link in time, who in a flash of mysterious green light, popped out of thin air to land on the bottle, his Megaton Hammer shattering the jar with dazing effectiveness. The apothecary growled again while Malon fell on a bunch of leaves, softening her landing. Link on the other hand, hit the ground rather hard, leaving him stunned. Mad with anger for getting fooled over and over by the shrunken fugitives, the giantess forgot about Malon to give Link an icy stare.<br>\r\nWithout any form of warning, she simply kicked him into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cServes you right, you insect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-LINK!\u201d Malon cried out of despair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated by what she had just witnessed, the tiny woman did not even try fight back once in the clutches of the apothecary. And so\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link was coughing as the water he had swallowed partially made its way up to his lungs. Once feeling better, he walked a little away from the shore and collapsed. He barely survived the kick he received from that old hag, and that was yet again only thanks to the few magical spells he knew: without Nayru\u2019s love, he never would have ended up into the Zora river in one piece. Unfortunately, although the spell was effective at protecting against physical aggressions, it did not grant the ability to breath underwater, that task was up to his Zora tunic. The problem was, that putting it on while in mid air was obviously no easy task, leaving the minuscule young man only his mere muscles to make it out of the monstrous river alive. Exhausted and his willpower failing him after the way the situation had turned, Link let himself fall on the ground, paralyzed with frustration. He failed to save her, whereas she saved him. After spending ten minutes at insulting himself for his incompetence, he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now...Let's try to be useful instead of wasting time. I gotta find her. Let's see...Where could that fiendish woman have taken Malon..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was rubbing his chin to think of a plan, he was interrupted by a loud shriek that was a little too familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't I get a moment of peace already?!\u201d he asked as he turned to face the threat. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe intruder in question, a Keese, did not hear it that way. Little did it know its prey was more dangerous than it looked. The bat-like creature charged at Link, its fangs ready to bite the delicious little green snack. The monster\u2019s intention was only met with a brutal disappointment since the only food it received was a miniature bomb thrown right into its mouth. Suddenly panicking, the Keese squeaked erratically, before eventually getting knocked down by the fiery blast bursting out of its mouth. Stunned but far from dead -Link\u2019s bomb was after all smaller than a firecracker-, the shrunken man stepped on the monster\u2019s back, still catching its breath. <br>\r\nAs Link was about to put it out of its misery, an idea popped out of his mind: if he wanted to find Malon back, he was going to need a vehicle, and using Epona was not option, neither was teleporting with his ocarina or Farore\u2019s Wind: the aftermath of such a strategy at his size was too unpredictable: he might succeed in getting rid of a small Skulltula or a Keese, but dealing with anything bigger would be synonym of death sentence. He therefore needed a swift and stealthy mean of transport. And the solution to this problem was right under his boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay pal\u2026\u201d he told the bat, his sword\u2019s tip dangerously poking the monster\u2019s throat. \u201cIf you could give me a ride around Hyrule\u2026I could be somewhat forgiving and not hold any grudge against you for attacking me. What do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Keese nervously nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. See, it doesn't take much to take a smart decision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, he gave a faint kick on his ride for it to soar and wander across Hyrule Field in search of Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman was shaking in fear as she was being brought to a dark room in one of Castle Town\u2019s old buildings. Catching her breath on the wooden table she was thrown on, something interrupted her before she could even recover properly. Behind the faint light the few candles and the spooky Poes provided, the latters grinning at her in the magical cages restraining them, was a silhouette sitting on a filthy crate, its cadaveric hand clutching a stick it was waving at the captured ghosts, causing them to shiver as well, before noticing the loot its grunt had brought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful,\u201d he said -the voice, although ghostly, definitely sounded male-, \u201cYou're far too inefficient in your abductions to harm our victims more than it is required.\u201d He thundered at the old woman. \u201cNow, what do we have here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood, master,\u201d the designated servant said. \u201cThe lady here is apparently a friend of the Hero of Time, the one you are looking for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember well who my targets are, thank you very much. Why are you wasting my time with this worthless peasant?\u201d he growled, pointing at the shrunken woman. \u201cI have no time for keeping hostages. That was supposed to be your job!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, Master. I understand, but I did try capturing some of his friends, such as those Kokiri kids from the forest, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven with them or after capturing the Hero himself, you failed to return him to me.\u201d The cloaked wraith guessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how her boss\u2019s patience was running short, the old woman explained, stammering: <br>\r\n\u201cB-but Master, please listen. With this girl in your possession, not only you have a good opportunity to lure the Hero here, but also a brand new subject to experiment on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon was speechless, what did all of this mean?  Was that guy the reason why she was cursed, and Link was poisoned..? And she certainly did not want to end up as one of those creeps experiments, getting shrunk was more than enough in itself! She therefore desperately bolted towards the nearest corner she found, only to be caught again by a gigantic hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave me alone, you freak!\u201d she told the cloaked creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm...What an interesting temper. I can't wait to start working on you\u2026\u201d he smirked. \u201cGranny, if you please?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the struggling Malon again, and transferred her to her new prison. Determined to not end up locked up again, the tiny farmer kicked around, managing to spill a nearby bottle containing a thick and strange liquid. The contact with the foul substance not only grossed both the abductor and the small lady out, but scalded their respective skins as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid bug!\u201d The old hag shouted. <br>\r\n\u201cLook at what you've just done!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon would have been satisfied of herself if she was not suffering this much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard, in the background, sighed as the old woman painfully put Malon inside the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are taking pleasure at disappointing me\u2026\u201d The wraith like creature commented. \u201cYou wish to acquire my knowledge to improve your own magic, and yet you manage to waste my precious fairy elixir?\u201d he asked in a threatening tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026Master...If I may\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon, from her cage, could clearly read terror on the apothecary\u2019s face, something she would be enjoying as well if she was not just as terrified, not to mention the effects of that so called \u201celixir\u201d on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's going to happen to me?\u201d she wondered with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d the demon thundered. \u201cNot only this mixture was meant to be drunk, not spilled, but you succeeded in contaminating our subject, making all your efforts vain. And you know what happens when I face such failure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-MASTER! GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was already too late. The imp\u2019s fingers snapped, and the old woman disappeared in a blast of ghostly flames, her cries of despair echoing as if to mark her demise. Malon then saw her new enemy turning to her and saying:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d the cloaked figure murmured. \u201cI have to stabilize your condition immediately. I don't want to have all this time wasted because of a dead subject or one that is too disfigured to be of any use\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sinister tone he used dreaded Malon to the soul. She might have grown partially used to her pain, but if what her prison warden was saying was true, then she still had a lot to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skulking creature was stirring the different vessels on the series of shelves on the dark and cold stone wall with its staff, as if eager to find something in particular. When he did, the miniature woman could almost spot an expression of satisfaction on her captor\u2019s face, if darkness did not concealed it, that is, although she was rather thankful for that fact: given the way he was grabbing her with his decomposing hand, his face was certainly the last thing she wanted to look at. Malon was far past the typical impression of disgust she would be subjected to when in the hands of someone meaning obvious harm to her. The young woman even held a sigh, as her despair was far beyond what anyone could handle. But it is in that same feeling of hopelessness she found the willpower to fight back: after all what could a shrunken and visibly poisoned person like her lose at this point..? Thus, she interrupted her incarcerator in his manipulation of various chemicals he was stirring together in a small smoking cauldron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay\u2026 What do you even have to gain in doing this?\u201d She asked, still trapped in his firm hand. \u201cI seriously hope you're not expecting me to believe you are interested in taking care of me or something? Because I'd rather be left in the middle of Hyrule Field like I was before so that a monster can put me out of my misery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer abductor did not react, and her last assertion truly pained her, for Link remained as an intrusive image in her mind. This guy had gotten involved in this out of pure accident, and certainly was dead as she was speaking. But now was not the time to mourn: she would have plenty of time to do so once in the other world. <br>\r\nBefore she could even exploit her despair to yet again taunt her foe, Malon felt something thick, yet refreshing, flowing all over her body. She realized the wraith had just poured the mixture it was preparing on her. Although this should have been a disgusting experience, the rough texture and dark color of the potion were betrayed by the ethereal weight of the liquid, and especially the faint light it was emitting as Malon\u2019s pain and scalded skin were healing away. The next thing she felt, was her very consciousness slipping away as she peacefully fainted under the influence of the concoction, as it magically wore off, revealing wings on the young woman\u2019s back as well as a glowing aura radiating from her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems my business is finally going to flourish now\u2026\u201d the mouth under the cloak said in a smirk. \u201cLord Ganondorf is going to make of me his most powerful assistant once his request for a brewery expert complete! If I can get him the Hero of Time captured as well\u2026then even I won't be able to imagine how great my reward is going to be..!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the Ghost Hunter maniacally laughed, its ghastly voice spooking the specters it previously captured into shivering inside their prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink\u2019s right foot was growing sore from beating the Keese into the right direction. His dominant one was clutching his ride tight, for they were heading to Castle Town, this ill-fated place being one of the favorite lairs for creepy people such as the old lady that shrank Link, therefore making of it an adequate starting location for an investigation to find Malon back. But Link was no fool: even with the tamed bat transporting him, he knew he was far from safe. That was why he had been thinking of a strategy: if the latter was to pay off, it would even kill two birds with one stone. Link was flying above the naively wandering Redeads, unable to spot the minuscule prey violating their territory. The Keese was getting progressively nervous as they were getting closer to Ganondorf\u2019s castle. Thankfully for the dim witted creature, paying a visit to the infamous tyrant was not part of his plan. Instead, Link remembered the presence of a Great Fairy within the caves surrounding the remains of the Royal Castle: Great Fairies were the magical wardens of the Hylian Lands, coming to the rescue of poor souls with their powerful healing powers. Not only that, but those immortal beings were also gifted with knowledge they would share with those worthy of it. This way, Link would put an end to this size problem, and, with a bit of luck, acquire the information he required to rescue Malon too. The young man was crossing his fingers for the spirit to survive Ganondorf\u2019s evil influence after those long seven years. His forehead was starting to bead with anxious sweat, since the entrance of the Fairy\u2019s cave was obstructed with a majestic argent boulder -one which even a normal sized person would never succeed in removing- Link only hoped he could squeeze his way through, and that was not going to be an easy task, especially with a Keese only waiting for the moment its fangs could finally slice through his flesh. Once near the entrance, the bat received the order to dive across the thin gap separating the cave from the exterior, causing it to squeak out of fear as it was performing the suicidal maneuver. Luckily, its pilot swiftly used his own weight to stabilize the flight and reach the wall\u2019s breach with unrivaled accuracy. The landing however, was abrupt to say the least. The poor winged animal collapsed out of exhaustion while Link simply jumped off its back. The latter glanced at his ride and said:<br>\r\n\u201cI won't be long, so don't think up of any dirty trick in my back, you hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster weakly nodded, apparently far too fatigued for that outcome to be a possibility. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThus, Link ventured inside the ancient yet magnificent cave: its white stone slabs were intact, and the water flowing from the fountain was crystal clear. Only one important thing was missing. Knowing what he had to do, Link stepped on the golden Triforce carved onto the floor -the shrunken man had to walk up to its inner triangle- and prepared to call the Great Fairy with his ocarina. Once Zelda's Lullaby echoed across the wide sanctuary\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link put the ocarina back into his pocket and waited, his anxiety still raging.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let it work!\u201d he mentally thundered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later -which felt like hours from Link\u2019s perspective- a magical orb of light burst out of the water and progressively grew larger, until taking the form of a gigantic feminine entity, a laughter Link knew all too well echoed throughout the Great Fairy\u2019s lair and concluded the spirit\u2019s apparition. The latter stood in the air, magical bright sparks surrounding her, as she was staring at the golden triangle on the floor, where her rare visitors would stand to consult her. This time however, she was left confused by the absence of her summoner, typically a Royal Family member or one of their loyal servants, and occasionally the Legendary Hero himself, although no one had awaken her in those long seven years. Thus, the spirit awkwardly looked around, trying to determine the source of the call. As it prepared to dive back into the depth of her fountain, something caught her attention: sparks of emerald light were flaring out of the Triforce facing her pool. She therefore took a closer look, as this shimmer was oddly familiar to Farore\u2019s Wind, a spell one of her sisters transmitted to the visitors of her lair. Her doubts proved accurate since the Great Fairy spotted a man dressed in green, carrying a very peculiar sword which made his identity very obvious, the only detail confusing her was the man\u2019s size. She nonetheless greeted the newcomer, acting just like the rest of her siblings:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, Hero of Time, I am the Great Fairy guarding this sanctuary. How may I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did his best to sound confident, but the situation did not help. Thus, he answered as followed:<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I required your help to solve a... little problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit laughed and said: <br>\r\n\u201cWhy of course, let me get you rid of your fatigue!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Link could object, a warm shimmer enveloped him, effectively revitalizing him, although his size was still the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thank you, but\u2026\u201d Link stuttered, trying to ask her how could she omit a problem as obvious as this one.<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think this fixed the issue I'm dealing with right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he explained what happened in details. Great Fairies might be rich in terms of knowledge, but their lack of thorough analysis could make of them very dim-witted interlocutors at times, although Link wisely chose to not mention this aspect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is indeed powerful magic you are dealing with here.\u201d The Fairy commented. \u201cTo be honest, even a specialist in magic may find it difficult to reverse its effects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeat\u2026\u201d Link thought. \u201cI'm sure Malon is going to enjoy hearing that: \u201cLink, I can't believe you rescued me! What? You say that we're bound to stay at this size? That's so great! I always wanted to live in the grass in a shack of mud like a bug! Thank you very much!\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link was almost turning back, defeated, the Great Fairy said:<br>\r\n\u201c...that is, if you hadn't come to me!\u201d she smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can't be serious\u2026And don't tell me those seven years have gotten you a sense of humor\u2026\u201d Link mentally groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magical entity snapped its fingers, and a small bottle containing a pinkish substance popped out of thin air, slowly levitating towards Link. He caught the potion, which was of a respectable size for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiven your state, you should barely require one sip of it, not only to grow back to normal, but also to develop a temporary immunity to any magical spells. Be careful though, for it took me years to produce such a quantity of this elixir. Use it wisely.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thanks\u2026\u201d Link said, looking at the shining vial with a new interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what's about your friend, I suggest you simply investigate the inner part of Castle Town. There are a lot of Ganondorf\u2019s servants living in here, where no one is going to disturb their activities. Yet again, I'd be careful if I were you. Good luck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, she disappeared into her fountain, leaving it up to Link to solve his problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Link said, taking a look at the mysterious bottle. \u201cIf I get it right...I might even be able to cure Malon and even more people with that thing! Now the question is, where Malon is exactly..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, he got back to the entrance, restrained the Keese -which obviously proved stupid enough to try to make of the shrunken Hylian its dinner-, Link carefully attached the potion to his belt, preferring to not grow back right away, and mounted on the bat\u2019s back to find where the farmgirl could possibly be. As he was soaring the dark cloud ridden sky, something caught his attention. The normally dark and gloomy ruins of the former city were always pitch black, although an abnormal shimmer was glowing from a peculiar building, which happened to be on fire, hinting Link about the possibility of finally finding who he was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope she was not in this fire when it started though.\u201d he said, before kicking the Keese to double its speed, oblivious to the ominous nature of his own words. </span></div></div>",

Okay only if you try it with me?\" Link said. Zelda's face drooped with a frown. She took a very small piece and unwillingly to a bite off it. Link on the other hand took a huge bite off the mushroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Link felt a little strange she saw what appeared to be the word growing in front of him. As he begins to shrink in front of the her Zelda giggled as her hero was now reduced to roughly 1/10 of his original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda felt herself shrinking too but because she ate so much less than he did she only lost a few inches. Looking down at her hero she picked him up and cuddled him near her face. All the while she thought of what she could do with him.</span></div></div>",

As long as he was completely at her mercy, the smartest thing he could do is do what he is told and hope to stay on her good side. <br>\r\nAs he approached her left foot, he struggled not to gag from the smell.

Working on a ranch for her whole life must have really added a punch to the odor. As he finally reached the large fleshy mass, Link immediately got to work fearing that any hesitation would lead to more torture or humiliation. He pressed his hands against her massive sole and rubbed as hard as he could. More sweat covered Link as he struggled to work through the taste. \"You're doing great, Fairy Boy. That's definitely relaxing after doing all my chores. Maybe after you finish we can play a special game I just thought of.\" She said with a mischievous grin on her face. Link knew that this game she was thinking of would probably mean some unique form of humiliation for him. Then again, maybe she'll actually give him a break after the date with her feet.

An idea soon came to her as she remembered the water temple which resides at the centre of the lake. She looked down at her miniature husband with a smile, making Link feel uneasy. The sky suddenly darkened for our hero as the Zora princess covered Link with her free hand, trapping him in her grasp. Ruto dove into the water, swiftly swimming to the water temple's entrance. Link was at no risk of drowning, since he had donned his zora tunic for his trip to Lake Hylia, but being jostled around by his wife's fast swimming wasn't exactly fun for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was finally able to see where he ended up when Ruto removed her hand from above him. Link saw her activating one of the water level mechanisms, the one that filled the water almost to the top. \"Ruto, what are we doing here in the temple?\" The princess smiled at him. \"I wanted to play a game with you, my beloved hero. I thought this would be the perfect place for it.\" \"What kind of game are you talking about?\" Link asked, getting a bit worried. \"I believe in Hylia, you call it... cat and mouse?\" Those three short words made link freeze up. \"Or, given the circumstances, I guess 'shark and fish' would be a better fit. And I get to be the shark.\"Ruto punctuated this by snapping her teeth shut in a biting motion at Link. The startled hero flinched at this motion, which made Ruto giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the rules. I'll give you a one minute head start to swim away and hide, after that if I don't catch you within, say, five minutes, then you win. If you win, I'll do whatever you ask me to, but if I win, I get to toy with you some more. Time starts now.\" As she finished speaking, she tilted her hand to the left and dropped Link. He yelled in fear as he fell from what was a great height to him, but only a few feet to his aquatic wife. With a tiny splash, he landed in the water that had now filled the temple. Ruto had turned her back to allow him to hide properly, she wanted the game to be interesting, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Link got his bearings, he started swimming. The water temple had a large pillar in the centre, and he figured that would be the best place to hide. Maybe he could find a crack in the wall big enough for him to hide in but small enough for Ruto to ignore. He searched and searched, finding nothing in the finely crafted temple pillar. A large splashing sound then reached his ears. Oh no. his minute was up, Ruto had jumped in the water. Link was now being hunted by his giant, neglected wife. He swam towards the pillar, hoping he could hug the wall or something to help his chances. Just as he began to swim, he saw a massive dark blue silhouette somewhat far away from him in the semi-opaque water that surrounded him. A chill ran up his spine. It was as if leviathan itself was in the same body of water that he was. But our hero had great courage, so he kept swimming in desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only a few short moments, the Zora princess  had circled the entire pool of water, she passed by Link again, this time, missibg him by only about a foot. She had surely seen Link by now, and she could have easily turned around and grabbed Link, but she kept swimming to make another pass, no doubt wanting to play with him some more. Link couldn't match her sheer speed, the next pass would almost certainly be when Ruto caught him. He needed something to give him an edge. And then he saw it. A hole in the stone wall he didn't see before. It was big enough for him to fit through. If he  ould get there i  time he kight just have a chance to win. So the question is... does our hero make it?</span></div></div>",

But in reality, he was only moving about an inch a second. This speed couldn't hope to match the monstrously fast rate that the giant, aquatic Ruto was swimming at. As the Zora princess rounded the corner, she noticed her tiny husband had almost reached the pillar. He might get away at this rate. Ruto had only been swimming at her equivalent to a walking pace so far, but now that Link was about to win, she kicked herself into high gear. Link noticed Ruto darting towards him, but he did not falter. He kept his eyes on the prize. Link was right next to the wall, but Ruto had almost entirely closed the distance between them. She reached out her hand to grab the tiny Hylian, stretching as far as her arm would allow. But Link vanished through the small hole in the wall. Ruto only grabbed a handful of water, and Link was past an opening that was about the diameter of her little finger. She peered into the room, seeing link swimming away from the hole while keeping his eyes on it. Ruto knew the temple like the back of her hand, so instead of foolishly trying to break the wall down, she swam away to go to the proper entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink finally had a second to breathe. Ruto had finally gone away, and he now had a second opportunity to hide. He took a look at his surroundings. Like most of the water temple, the area was pretty geometric with not many protrusions. There was a doorway to his right and a flat wall to his left. But above him was an air pocket. There was a platform above the water level. Perhaps he could find a place to hide there. If not, he'd be on dry ground, which his species was more suited for. Unfortunately for him, as soon as he started swimming, Princess Ruto swam through the door with the speed of a torpedo. Smiling as she found her prey. Before Link could react, Ruto's hands entrapped him on either side. He could feel himself being jostled again as Ruto moved with him in tow. Then the water drained out. Ruto opened her hands to reveal she was sitting on the above water platform, smiling. \"Well, I caught you Link. But my five minutes were up. So, I guess you win our little game. Nice job, hero.\" Link was surprised. He wasn't counting, but it didn't feel like it was five whole minutes. Maybe he just lost track of time. \"Now, my adorable little hubby, as promised I have to do whatever you tell me to do. I'm completely at your mercy. What are you gonna have me do, hm?\" Ruto said this while smiling the sultriest smile she had ever shown. Link then said what he wanted. He wanted...</span></div></div>",

Link saw the same dark blue silhouette, this time coming right at him. He tried swimming as fast as possible, but it was too late. Ruto's smiling face quickly came into view.

Soon it was strong enough to lift him up. The air seemed to toss the hero back and forth until after a minute, it suddenly stopped. Link looked around and noticed that Ruto's mouth was open enough to let him see his sword, shield, and other such items laying on the ground. Ruto's tongue pinned link down as one last gust blew his equipment out of her mouth. \"There we go, now your stuff won't accidentially cut my mouth.\" she cheerfully proclaimed and began swimming to her new destination. River after river after lake after stream, Ruto swam until she finally reached the sea. Durring the trip Link was tossed about in his \"wife's\" mouth. Ot one point, Ruto joked around and pinned him down with her tongue. Link couldn't fight it and was out of energy in seconds. <br>\r\nAfter another hour, the mouth opened again and Link was ejected onto Ruto's hand. \"Enjoy the trip my little hubby?\" She planted another kiss on him, covering him with aquamarine lipstick once again. \"That is definately your color sweetie.\" She said giggling.

This is the perfect place for a nice romantic, and uninterrupted vacation.\" She placed Link down on a small area at the center of the lake that was like a small island to Link. \"Or longer perhaps.\" she thought aloud. :I can picture living here for the rest of my days with you.\" Link shivered as she went on.

Once every light was there they descended into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink approached Aghita puzzled, waiting for her to do something, as he was a few feet away from her she turned to him and said \"I have always loved bugs, and now I can make all the bugs I want\". Link didn't understand where this was going until he saw the bug light coming out of her hands as her eyes glowed, He tried to avoid it but it was too fast, the light surrounded him and leaved him unable to see through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it dispersed he say that everything changed he was about 3 inches tall, he checked himself and felt kinda relieved he was still human.

At least she's not awake.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe commotion managed to awaken some of the insects, most notably the praying mantises who eyed Link the way a 5 year old eyes a chocolate bar.

She lifted her hands towards Illa, and the same bug light which had shrunk link came out and struck her too. In a matter of seconds, Illa was reduced to merely 1 inch in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlla let out a high-pitched scream and started running as fast as she could, but all Agitha had to do was walk slowly and she had soon caught up with the tiny girl and snatched her into her hand. \"Now I finally have a female human bug, which completes my collection!\" she shouted, and then skipped back to her residence in the city - taking Illa and Link with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reopened her palm, she looked down at her two big eyes and giggled at them.</span></div></div>",

As his eyes continued up this titan's body he recognized the dark hair and stern facial expression of Ashei, one of the adventurers who met in Thelma's bar.

Sadly, Link realized that he didn't have any of his weapons or items besides a sword and shield, so he couldn't use bombs or bomb arrows. <br>\r\nJust then an idea popped into Link's head. Quickly climbing her metal boot so that he could stay with her if she started to move, Link began to bang the large metal wall in front of him with both his sword and shield.

Slowly the metallic boot he was standing on started to rise from the ground. Though Ashei didn't walk fast, staying on would still be a difficult task for someone at Link's scale. The fact that her boots had also accumulated some ice didn't make his struggle any easier. Link struggled to hold on waiting for the ride to end.

He stomps down the carpeted hallway of his castle to make his way to the throne room. Once there, he'll probably admire his \"treasure\" a little bit more then plot his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unconscious Link sways back and forth unaware of his predicament. The last thing Link remembers was opening a chest in one of Ganon's vile dungeons Instead of getting the usual loot, a black mist poured out and Link was knocked out before he could make a move. A steady flow of warm air splashes on to Link's face, causing the green clad hero to jostle in his slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink slowly opens his eyes only to find himself surrounded by iron bars. He'd found himself in this situation before,but the way it was swaying made Link uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Mwahaha, finally awake, are we?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink turns quickly to face the source of the sinister voice. The giant face of pig Ganon invaded Link's field of view as Link stood, paralyzed in fear of what he was seeing. Link had fought this form of Ganon before but it was clear he was outmatched. Ganon was humongous. So big that Link could see every hair in his snout, every wart on his face, and every inch of malice in Ganon's stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young hero looked down beyond the bars of his cage and saw that he was many hundreds of feet away from the ground. Ganon took another step down the corridor and Link trembled at the thought of being underneath the massive pig's feet. Link focused his gaze back towards Ganon who was ready to taunt Link mercilessly. This was the moment that he was waiting for his entire long life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you surprised, Link?\", the evil king laughed to himself  \"This is just a part of the power that I hold. Compared to me, the strength of your puny and pathetic form is that of a mere cockroach.\"<br>\r\nLink scowled, but he knew Ganon was right. Link wouldn't be able to do anything against the massive pig. Just being near Ganon, and inhaling his powerful odor made Link weak. But he had to do something. Eying the iron bars, Link begins to form an idea.<br>\r\nGanon continued,\"Now that you have been rendered completely useless, I think my next target shall be Princess Zelda. Then, I shall all three triforces and the entire will tremble before me. And there's nothing you can do about it.\"<br>\r\nGanon lets out another evil laugh, spewing his rancid breath all over Link. But he ignores it, too eager to put his plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ganon has been giving you his menacing speech, Link has been charging up your signature move:The Spin Attack!<br>\r\nOf course, the hero was smart enough to hide his Master Sword behind his back, as not to let Ganon catch on. <br>\r\nAs the flames begin to surround Link's blade, Ganon becomes privy to Link's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>DON'T YOU DARE</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the call was too late. Link spins around, swinging his sword in a most heroic fashion. The force of the strike combined with the heat of the blade is able to cut through the iron bars of Link's cage. But this isn't the end of the hero's trouble. The floor of the cage falls off and Link plummets to the ground with it. Link can see Ganon's face, full of rage, attempting to snag Link out of the air, with no success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a long way down and Link survive the fall, even if the castle floor is carpeted. His only hope is to grab on to the belt of the massive beast Ganon. But there are many ways for this plan to go wrong, yet Link is known for getting out of sticky situations. If Link isn't able to latch on to the waist of Ganon, then he will fall near the evil king's feet. While Link will survive, being near the pig's nasty feet will not help his situation.</span></div></div>",

When I find him, I'll STOMP HIM INTO PASTE?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the threat was unwelcome, Link smiled as he knew that Ganon had no idea where he was. Link stood up onto the waist of Ganon's pants and looked at his surroundings. He saw Ganon's stomach protruding from the cloth of his shirt, signifying that there were no clothes big enough for the massive pig. Link inched along the side of Ganon's massive body, ignoring the overwhelming musk. Being this close to the evil king's body made all of the stenches more powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink reaches the back of Ganon's pants. The smell becomes increasingly bitter and harder to bear. But if Link were to escape Ganon's wrath, this would be the only place that Ganon wouldn't see him.

Saria was delighting in her snack as she licked it all over her mouth. From the roof of her mouth to her palette to imprinting the ingredient in both her cheeks, Saria was loving the taste of what was to come whilst hoping that Link would love it just as much as she did. Then, Saria decided to finish up her taste test and prepare the meal itself for Link's return.</span></div></div>",

All around him Link heard a loud <b><i>GULP</i></b> as he was pulled down into Saria's gullet, and he heard various noises of her inner workings as he fell. He first heard a constant and soothing <b><i>THUMP THUMP, THUMP THUMP</i></b> which was Saria's heartbeat as she felt excited for Link to try her food. Next he heard a distant and echoe-like <i>humm</i> as Saria excitedly prepared for Link. Finally he heard a splash and several gurgling noises all around him as he landed in her stomach.

Her meal helped ease her heartache as she ate it joyfully, yet it wasn't as delicious as the lone ingredient that she sampled an hour earlier. Being the sage of the forest, Saria was immune to the mushroom's shrinking effects. After dinner, Saria had a new resolve to wait for Link another day and see if she could find another one of those tasty ingredients. \"Link, I hope you comeback soon and enjoy a meal with me\" Saria yearned as she clasped her hands over her stomach, right above Link as he enjoyed his final rest with his best friend's dinner.</span></div></div>",

A few nights ago, Zelda had saw something that fell from the sky and landed somewhere on Death Mountain it looked like.  So, Zelda sent the Hero of Time to check it out.  Link had been searching all morning and into late afternoon for something out of the ordinary.  So far, he had no luck.  He only went into the crater of Death Mountain as a last resort.  He didn't much like walking on rickety bridges over pools of lava.  <br>\r\n        He had been looking at a spit of rock that was surrounded by lava.  The rock had a flat top, and there was something on it.  It looked like a sheet of paper.  Link pulled out his Long-Shot and fired it at the sheet.  The Long-Shot picked it up and brought the paper to Link.  Link grabbed the paper and read it.  It was musical notes on a staff.  The tune had 10 notes.  Below the musical staff, was the name of the tune. <br>\r\n         \"Giant Melody?\" asked Link quietly. <br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",
