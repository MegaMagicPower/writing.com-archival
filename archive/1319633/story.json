Not seeing eye to eye, both races have built similar civilizations, but apart from each other.  However, this is about to change soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small group of humans and giant anthros who dream of a world where both races can be fully integrated have started a program to get their ultimate goal started.  This group has gathered some support on both sides, and one of them is a giant anthropomorphic ocelot who happens to be the superintendent of a school district.  This ocelot realized that in order for humans and giant anthros to get along, they must start early.  Therefore, as an experiment, he has enrolled a single human student, namely you, into one of his schools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you wish to follow this storyline, please choose a number, which will reflect how many times larger the anthros are than the humans.  Otherwise, choose Other)</span></div></div>",

You just finished your second year of high school, but apparently, because of this crazy human/anthro integration program, your next year is going to be the alphabet and counting all over again.  You feel that this is too harsh a punishment for your poor grades, even though your parents are insisting that this is an honor and not a punishment.  It's not like you don't hate giant anthropomorphic animals, in fact you think they're kind of cool.  You just don't like the idea of being treated like a four-year old.  Surely you can take care of yourself; you're even a member of the wrestling team!  Either anthros are many times more dangerous than you thought, or everyone is being far too careful in this project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are dropped off, you try to think on the positive side.  Well, at least the work will be easy.  Hopefully, the adults will treat you like a fifteen year old instead of a toddler.  You were told that this is much more of a social experiment than an academic one, and that the idea is that anthros will learn to respect humans better if they interact with them early.  Heck, maybe you're just overreacting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in the door, and see a bunch of giant anthro toddlers wandering around, playing with blocks, drawing with crayons, and other typical toddler activities.  They are anywhere from three to five times your height and definitely do not seem muscular at all yet.  You decide to walk up to weasel child playing with a model train set.  \"Hi, I'm Pete, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel boy looks at you, his eyes widen, and he shouts,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see he's approaching a young cat anthro with white fur and bright blue eyes, sitting on the floor and looking over a pile of blocks. Judging by the fact that this anthro is wearing a yellow dress, you assume it is female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look!\" the weasel said. \"I got a new toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitten looks up, and her eyes widen as she sees you. She gets to her pawed feet and walks towards you and the weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I've never seen a toy like that before! Where'd you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the weasel and frown, still indignant at the anthro's insistence at calling you a toy, but that motion seems to cause a reaction in the kitten. She gasps, and you look over at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, it looks alive! Hey, it moved! Toys don't move! That's not a toy!\" the kitten cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a toy to me,\" the weasel replied. \"Come on, let's play with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to speak up, hoping that your voice will convince the kids that you are indeed a living thing, but the kitten cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, let it go! It's not a toy! Lemme see it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel glares at the kitten, but then crouches and releases you. You step forward, wanting to put some distance between the weasel and yourself. You look back to see that he is stepping back, and then he sits down with crossed arms and a frown on his face. Meanwhile, the kitten crouches down and looks at you closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you a toy?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head vigorously. \"No, I'm a human! I'm here because of some exchange program or something. I'm not a toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitten looked over at the weasel and stuck her tongue out. \"See? Told ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel glares at her, and sticks his tongue out too. \"Fine. So he ain't a toy! Whatever. You can play with him if you want. I'm gonna go get a real toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes away, leaving you alone with the kitten. You start to feel a bit scared near her, and you look up at her big blue eyes nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never met a human before,\" she says. \"You look cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile up at her, realizing that she seems to I deed be gentle. \"Aw, thanks. You're cute too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitten giggles. And then, to your surprise, she reaches down with both paws, clasping you between them. The pads soften her grip, but it's still tight, and your arms are pinned. She raises you up to her face, and brings you to her cheek, nuzzling you against her soft fur. You smile widely as she does so, closing your eyes and enjoying the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I hold you?\" she asks. You nod, feeling better in her grasp than in that of the weasel from before. The kitten is pleased with your answer, and nuzzles you a bit more before holding you out in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really cool!\" she exclaims as she looks you over. \"You're like a little dolly, but you're alive! Mommy always told me to be gentle to little things, though, so I won't hurt you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief, glad to hear that. You just hope that she really will succeed at keeping you safe, because in a setting like this, where everything was ten times bigger, danger is everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitten's ears suddenly perk up, and she looks over to the side. You look too, and see...</span></div></div>",

In the distance, you can see the huge city; the city where your new school is.  You have to wonder what your parents were thinking, sending you to a school filled with big hairy monsters.  Even at your old school you were picked on, and you are convinced that it will be much worse at Eastpaw Junior High.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the talk that you had with your parents before you left.  They were big supporters of the whole \"species integration\" idea, and had agreed with some important anthro figure to send you on what they called a \"big adventure\".  They insisted that there was nothing to be so afraid of, but what do parents know, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, your heart pounds as your parent's car merges onto a much wider road.  There is a small dotted line indicating where it is safe for humans to drive.  Huge automobiles much larger than monster trucks zoom past the tiny car you are in as if it isn't moving at all.  Time seems to slow down, and you feel like your going to your own funeral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe open road shifts to busy streetways as the journey heads into the city.  You look out the other window and see all sorts of giant paws lifting and stomping across the sidewalk.  You try to look up, and you notice with fear that many of the anthros are looking at the tiny car oddly.  As you see the school approaching, you are amazed that none of the giant anthros had decided to wreck the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building is absolutely enormous: it is as tall as a thirty-story building and much wider, and yet the map of the school your were given clearly shows that the building is only three stories tall.  The car stops, and you feel your heart do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good first day at school, John!\" your mother says before she blows you a kiss.  Lifting your backpack, you hesitantly leave the false safety of the car.  You notice that there is a small ramp leaning on the curb.  At least you won't have any trouble getting onto the sidewalk.  You walk cautiously up the ramp and stare in the direction of the school.  You notice ...</span></div></div>",

You look at your schedule, and your luck fades away: your first class, Mathematics, is on the third floor.  You are still afraid that the big anthros walking around might want to bully you, so you try to stay out of their sight.  Half walking, half dashing, you make it to the entrance without being seen.  So far, so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, you quickly hide behind the propped door and return to your map.  You read it over and over, looking for anything that might be an elevator.  However, all there are is three staircases.  This is going to be a very difficult commute every morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you see the crowd of giant students growing, you decide that you will be less likely to be seen in the crowd than in the open.  So, hugging the wall, you inch towards the stampede of anthros, then make a dash for the nearest staircase.  You immediately want to regret your logic as you find yourself dodging big furry paws and sharp taloned feet as large as you are.  Zigzagging left and right, you lose your breath when your head brushes against a dangling pant leg.  You quickly disappear before the anthro noticed anything; you didn't even care what kind of anthro it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reach the stairs.  You hug the wall, staying in the shadows, and look at the first flight.  There are twenty steps, each of which is four feet high.  Catching your breath from all of the running, you toss your backpack onto the first step, then drag yourself up.  You look towards the other wall and see the plethora of climbing paws start to thin.  Knowing that time is short, you toss your backpack up another step and scramble after it.  You do this two more times, and already you are completely and utterly exhausted.  You feel hopeless now, and wish that you could have just gone to a normal school like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought it could not get any worse, your greatest fear is realized.  Above you, you hear a voice saying, \"Do you need any help, human?\"  You shout in fright as you see who had spoken to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are quite shocked by the visage of your math teacher, and almost fall off the friendly tiger girl's hand.  The teacher had unnaturally thick lips and eyelashes, a long neck, and curly hair all over her face.  You cannot tell what kind of monster she is yet, but that is not what worries you most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see that the human got to class all right,\" said the teacher, more to the tiger girl than to you.  \"Very well, go ahead and put him down on a seat.\"  The tiger girl seemed dying to say something, but instead she obeyed and set you down on the surface of a desk.  You realize that you forgot your backpack on the stairs, but the tiger girl then brings her other hand to the desktop, reavealing your backpack hanging from her pointer finger.  She slides off the backpack and places it down gently next to you, and she takes a seat to your immediate left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the teacher was writing down her name on the blackboard.  You can see that she holds the chalk in a hoof-like hand, and you realize that she is a llama, or something similar.  When she finished writing, she moved over, and you saw the words \"Mrs. Paca\" on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, class, I'm Mrs. Paca, and I will be teaching math this year.\" spoke the anthro you now identify as an alpaca.  \"As you may have noticed, we have a human student in our school this year.  Therefore, I would like to start off the year by saying that you should all focus on your own work and not let him distract you.  Now, let us begin by opening our textbooks to page 3...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout math class, you cannot pay any attention to Mrs. Paca.  Instead, you are very self aware of all of the huge students around you.  You are aware that the whole reason that you were transferred to this school was to help anthros and humans develop a better relationship, but after you have heard the things that teacher said, you realize the extent of the problem.  Even an adult was downright disrespectful; she did not even want to talk to you, and spoke of you as if you were an object, not a person!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of Mrs. Paca's ramblings, you feel that the room is far too quiet.  You look at the other students, and see every single one of them looking at you.  Their faces are ones of disgust, as if they think you are some sort of freak of nature.  You feel that had this not been a classroom, you would have been smashed to pieces by any one of them.  The only exception is the tiger girl, who is also looking at you, but in a much friendlier way.  You are glad that there will be at least one anthro in this school that doesn't hate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very long hour, the bell rings.  All of the students get up to leave, and even Mrs. Paca packs up her tote bag.  After all of your things have been put back in your backpack, the room was already empty, as if nobody wanted to share a classroom with a human.  On your own again, you hop down about ten feet to the desk chair, then about fifteen to the tiled floor.  You go to the giant open door, ready to get your school map out and find your second class.  However, when you enter the hallway, you almost run into a thick, furry leg.  You look up, and you see someone looking down at you.</span></div></div>",

Kneeling down to get a better look at you, she speaks in a very sincere way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, human, I'm very sorry that you are going through all of this.  I mean, I don't really know anything about humans or why a human is going to this school, but no one should be treated like that anywhere.  I felt so bad for you; you looked so frightened in there, I thought you were going to try and run away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though that you are still terrified of this girl, you start to see her as a bit more like a human now.  You are too afraid to reply to her, so instead you step forward and stroke her giant paw a bit, not knowing what else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thats really sweet, human, I was sure that you wouldn't like me anymore after what happened in class.\"  She returned by stroking you under your chin with a massive fingerpad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you feel a bit more comfortable, so you gather your courage and speak to the tiger.  \"Thank you.  Well, I never got your name ... Mine's John, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello, John, I'm Melanie,\" speaks the tiger anthro.

If one of them decided to hurt you, escape would be utterly impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the door in time, but there is another problem, the door is closed.  The door knob is far too high for you to reach, so you pound heavily on the door, hoping somebody will open it.  You do not care if you are noticed now; you fear that if you are late to health class, the teacher may not be nice enough to let you go with a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the door swings open, but something goes horribly, horribly wrong.  Since you were banging on the door when it opened, the giant wooden door rammed right into your head at forty miles per hour, sending you screaming through the air across the tiled hallway and landing in a heap on the floor.  Pain dashed through your head as you heard gasps echo through the hall.  Everything started getting dark as you saw giant furry faces appear high above you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, your whole body aches, especially your head, and your vision is blurred.  You wriggle a bit, and fortunately nothing seems to be broken.  You reach your aching arms onto your face and you notice that your forehead is thickly bandaged.  Suddenly, you remember everything that had happened, and you cannot help but start crying.  Today had been an absolute failure for you, and you are sure that you let your parents and even humanity as a whole down.  The tears do help your vision to clear up, and you notice that you are in one of three giant-sized beds.  You realize that you are still in the school, and judging from where you are, this is the nurse's office.  You suddenly become aware of a presence in the room.</span></div></div>",

Past the line of Melanie\u2019s claws, you can see enormous expanses of green stretching away on your right and left. From your dizzying height it's hard to tell, but each seems like it could fit several football fields comfortably before they hit a fence which was easily twice the height of your house. These fields were separated by a wide expanse of gray the size of a four lane road. Shaking your head at the vertigo, you look up and see a massive structure which is twenty stories high, clearly a house. You look back at Melanie, who's looking down at you patiently:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents are okay with this?\" You try to keep your voice level, but the question comes out as disbelieving and incredulous. Melanie frowns at you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't like it?\" She sounds offended, and her face takes on a menacing mean. You hastily shake your head and wave your arms, sudden fear of this building size anthro freezing your insides:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I didn't mean it like that...\" Your shaky response is drowned out by Melanie's sudden laughter. Her face changes all at once to amusement:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kidding. I guess if I were in your position I would ask the same question.\" Her claw flicks your shoulder in a comradely gesture. You nod, relieved. She moves her paw closer to her face, her other paw cupping over the side in an exaggerated motion, \"Gotta learn to stop that flinch, though.\" She says in a conspiratorial tone, warm breath washing over you, \"most of us anthros can smell fear, you know.\" Her playacting takes the sting off her words, and after a moment you nod hesitantly. Satisfied, she straightens up and looks around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think, really?\" She turns around, clearly slowly for her but still fast enough to make the landscape blur a little. You still get a good, panoramic view, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2019s... it\u2019s a lot like home, actually.\" Indeed it is, with rows of houses stretching away down the street, (relatively) small patches of green in front of moderately-sized houses and towering trees providing shade. You can even see a mixed group of anthro children across the street drawing on the sidewalk with chalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit bigger, though, I'd think.\" Says Melanie, half teasingly, half thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And also, if an Anthro showed up in my human neighborhood, they'd attract a lot more attention.\" Melanie chuckles appreciatively as she walks into the house. As far as you could tell, the Anthros on the block had not even noticed your presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the similarities continue, although there are a few subtle differences which you barely have time to notice as you are whisked through the air at Melanie's walking pace. As you walk into Melanie's living room, you spot another giant Tiger walking in through another opening, clearly Melanie's mom. You stare in awe, she's the same height compared to Melanie as an adult would be to you, but she's significantly broader. She's wearing a sweater and broad tight jeans, but it takes you a moment to realize that the outdoor movie theater sized piece of cloth she has over it is an apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi honey!\" she's says cheerily, rapidly getting closer and looming over you. Suddenly, the world starts flashing past rapidly and topsy-turvy as Melanie leans in to her mom, who is bending over, and nuzzles her on the cheek, clearly the tiger equivalent of an affectionate peck. The procedure causes you to bounce into the air spinning as Melanie remembers you at the last minute and jerks you away from her Mom's body. It prevents you from getting crushed by the massive expanse of tiger, but it does send you somersaulting with a yelp, and you're glad that Melanie's paw-pads are of the same consistency as a stack of gym mats when you come back down with a thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? Are you okay?\" You blink for a moment, disoriented at the spectacle of two tiger faces hanging in space above you, one upside down. Melanie nudges your stomach with a claw for the second time in fifteen minutes, and you snap out of it. A bit shaken and dizzy, but otherwise unharmed, you get to your feet, glad that you hadn't suffered the indignity of losing your previous meal in front of these two massive figures. You wave at them to show you're okay, and they relax, much relieved. Melanie's mom gives you a warm, feline smile, and extends a claw:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that John, didn't mean to give you a tumble, guess I'm not used to having human guests. We haven't been formally introduced, I'm Melanie's Mother and I'm glad to see you're awake this time.\" You shake her claw, minding the extremely sharp end, and call back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, no problem, thanks for having me over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure.\" She nods at you and, formalities done, turns her attention back to her daughter, \"Now, dinner's going to be ready in about an hour and a half, why don't you....</span></div></div>",

Melanie looks over and sees you hanging on for dear life as her hand continues to move up and down. The feeling in your stomach reminds you of that time when you (ill-advisedly) got on that amusement park ride that shoots up into the air and comes down in a free fall. Melanie stabilizes her hand at once and gives you a sheepish grin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.' Melanie's mother intervenes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'd better get used to John in private before going around in public.\" she says firmly, taking her daughter by the shoulder and marching her through the living room to the stairs. You are recovered enough by now to wince:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, cheap shot.\" You mutter to yourself. The adult's antenna-dish sized ears twitch:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it, though?\" She says innocently, turning and smiling down at you You wince, you hadn't thought that either of the two would be able to hear you. Melanie is also looking at you in a friendly matter, although for different reasons, so you must have been wrong on both counts. Melanie's mother fixes Melanie with a stern eye and she gives in, waking up the stairs slowly. You look around, fascinated as you pass poster-sized family pictures hanging at exactly your level. In one of them, you can see a whole bunch of anthro tigers, clearly Melanie's extended family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the top of the stairs, Melanie pauses wordlessly once more sweeping her hand around to give you a view. There's not much to see, as the airplane hanger sized hallway is sparsely decorated, with a number of doors leading off it. Melanie steps over to the second on the left and enters. She silently steps across and sets you on a giant desk. You look around. The warehouse sized room contains a large amount of stuff, with bookshelves across from you, a TV set on a low table to your left and a bed on your right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their size, you can't make out much detail about their structure, so you look around the desk itself. It is made of a dark wood, which has been heavily treated, to the point where it\u2019s almost as slippery as ice for you. You have to move carefully to keep from slipping and falling. You speculate that ordinary wood would easily catch a tiger's claws, so they heavily waxed it. There are a number of panels and buttons on the desk, with deep holes in them where a claw could easily catch and press them in, but otherwise the desk is featureless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving moved closer to one such button, you had lost track of Melanie's movements as you stared at it. You are brought sharply back to awareness, however, when a large, heavy object suddenly drops out of the sky only a few feet in front of you! It hits with a thump and you practically jump ten feet into the air, heart racing. It could easily have caused serious injury to you if it had connected. Calming down, you turn and glare at Melanie, who is settling down into a chair and putting some other things you can't see on the desk. You open your mouth to say something, but once more you find yourself scrambling out of the way as Melanie opens up her textbook and the cover starts descending on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You shout up at her. Melanie ignores you, feline face dark. You get the impression that she's sulking. You hesitate for a moment, as you don't know what she might do if she gets angry at you, but you decide to take action. You walk over to the textbook, step up onto the thick sheaf of paper and march across it. You are momentarily distracted by the sight of the pencil, which Melanie is using to mark her place. It has thick groves on the sides for her claws and its taller than you are! You set it aside, however, and march right into Melanie's focused line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds her pencil approaches you and hesitates, You're worried that she might either ignore you or simply knock you out of the way, but she gives a sigh and drops it. She folds her hands on the book and leans down, putting her chin on them, so that her eyes are only slightly above yours. You seize the initiative:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know homework sucks, but don't you think that this is a bit, you know, much?\" you ask her. Her mouth opens, giving you a view of some <i>very</i> sharp teeth, but it closes again, and she just stares at you. You meet her gaze, and eventually her eyes drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I just wanted to show you so much stuff...\" she breaks off, staring at you for a moment. At length, she straightens up, face brightening: \"But hey,\" she waved a claw around your bandaged head, \"I guess you're not really up to it right now anyway, are you?\" you laugh and shake your head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not. Some other time then.\" A mischievous gleam enters Melanie's eyes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hold you to that.\" she says solemnly. You gulp, hoping you won't regret your words.  She gently pushes you with the end of the pencil away from the center of the page and resumes reading. She stops again after a moment, however, and looks at you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just realized...</span></div></div>",

However, she then fishes out a pink notebook and rips out the first page, sliding it close to you.  Written on the top in curly cursive writing are your assignments for your classes.  As this was the first day of school, most of them required just reading through the textbooks.  However, one class, English, required you to write a paragraph about yourself.  After you do the reading, you note that Melanie is finished with her homework and just staring at you with her big eyes, the pupils curled into friendly slits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Melanie, do you have any looseleaf paper in my size?\" you ask.  Half expecting her to bring out a little notebook in between her fingerpads, you groan as she rips out another huge sheet of paper from her pink notebook.  \"Sorry, John, but nobody would be able to read your tiny handwriting, so your going to have to just use some of mine and write big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feline friend then rolls you her huge nine-foot pencil.  You struggle to lift the massive wooden implement; it must weigh a bit more than you do.  You carry the pencil to the of your page and start to write a foot long letter 'J' to start your name.  It is grueling work, and you have to put down the pencil to put the weight off your legs for a while.  You are none too pleased with the misshapen squiggle that was supposed to be a 'J'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Melanie, who had not once taken her eyes off you.  You can tell that she was immensely enjoying this show you were putting on in front of her looming face, and you feel ashamed to ask her for your help.  However, she presents the opportunity herself, saying, \"Looks like you need a bit of a hand with your penmanship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at her little joke, and she picks up the eraser on her desk and removes your bug splat of a letter J.  This time, she help you hold the pencil upright, and you guide her big paw through the words by pulling or pushing.  It takes a lot longer than you would have liked, but you are pleased with your paragraph, and it almost looks like your own handwriting.  \"Well, if English class is like this, I don't even want to know about Gym,\" you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie laughs at your joke, then, in a friendly but not jokingly way, says, \"Well, I have to tell you, this is the most fun I've ever had doing homework.  I guess that it wasn't so bad that I couldn't show you around the neighborhood today.  I'm sure you'll get the chance some other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, Melanie, dinner is ready!\" calls the voice of the tiger mother from the kitchen.  Picking you up in a claw, your friend carries you to the kitchen, where you notice that her mother is serving...</span></div></div>",

To test your theory, you casually step over the next line of text that Melanie is reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" You call up to her, \"Finding it difficult to concentrate?\" Her eyes go to slits of amusement at your witticism. Her paw, however, suddenly drops the pencil and comes up from behind. She seizes you and lifts you into the air in front of her face. You give her a toothy, slightly abashed grin. She finally deems to reply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a bit of a nu... distraction.\" She hastily corrects herself and pauses, searching your face for signs of offence. Seeing none, she continues: A distracting Nuisance.\" She gives you a grin which easily outshine- and out\"tooths\"- your own. She turns in her chair and leans forward, setting you on the ground at her feet. It\u2019s slightly disorienting, for a moment. Staring up along the columns of fur that are an anthro's legs is strange enough, but to see Melanie's face hovering in the sky and peering down at you between them. The wave of vertigo quickly makes you look down, hand to your suddenly dizzy head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" She asks, suddenly concerned, reaching out a paw. You wave her off:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do this if you're not up to it.\" She says warningly. The dizziness passes and you collect yourself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up to it.\" You tell her confidently. She nods, and starts to turn away. Suddenly, a thought strikes you. \"A thought just struck me.\" You shout up to her. She pauses in her turn, looking back down at you absently:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What thought?\" By her tone, she clearly wants to get back to her work:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just seemed ironic to me.\" You shout at her: \"At home, human's cats usually get on top of their books and have to be moved. Here, it seems, the reverse is true.\" For a moment you fear you have offended her with the mention of her (very) distant relatives, but she laughs, nods at you warmly, but distantly, and turns back to her work. <i>Thus proving my point</i> you think to yourself. You set off across the floor, but before you go more than a few steps another, much different, impulse strikes you. You turn, drawing in breath to shout, but you're interrupted:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bathroom's across the hall, one door to the right.\" She sounds impatient. You blink once, twice, scratching your head, then turn and keep walking. <i>Damn</i>, you think to yourself, <i>she has</i> really <i> good hearing. Or she's psychic</i>. Whatever the case, she is correct. You have slept all day, after all, and it's been a long time since you have been able to go. With this in mind, you quicken your pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your dismay, however, you find that the going is harder than you might have thought. For one thing, the distance is far greater (obviously) than it would have been in your own home, and your aching bladder seems to multiply the distance by another ten times. Even then, the distance isn't all that great. The real problem is the floor. Unlike in a human house, the floor isn't made of polished wood or carpet, which would catch a tiger's claws. Instead, it is a hard, grey substance, and it is filled with cracks. You suppose that the uneven surface of the floor is barely noticeable to an anthro and probably comfortable to their pads, but for you its is horrible. The cracks are the absolute worst size, too large to be easily stepped over, but small enough that spotting them can be tricky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt therefore takes you some time to get to your destination, tripping, twisting your ankle (although not badly) and swearing. After a little while you make it into the hallway, and you pause for a breather. You take a moment to take in the sight. You had come the same way not fifteen minutes earlier, but from the ground the view is even more unreal. The hallway stretches away on either side for hundreds of yards in both directions, with small tables rising from the floor as large as small buildings and massive lights hanging from the ceiling a hundred feet overhead. Across the hall, a door rises up, looking perfectly immovable. This brings a worry into your mind, what if the bathroom door was closed and latched? You look over quickly, but you can see that it, thankfully, is standing wide open. You quickly, or rather as quickly as is possible with that horrid floor underfoot, cross to the other side and go through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor here is smoother at least, with smaller cracks. Two large rectangular structures rise from either side of you. You assume one of them is a sink and mirror, since there is a lip of smooth marble past the edge of the wooden cabinet. You can't fathom what the other is, from your angle you can't make anything out about what is on top. You hurry eagerly on for a moment, then pause, remembering the open door. You move over to the wooden rectangle. It rises twelve times your height and looks like it weighs, literally, a ton. Nether-the-les, the thought of Melanie's Mom, Dad or, perish the thought, Melanie herself walking in while you are doing your business makes you at least try. You strain against it for a few moments, panting with the effort. You would have had about as much success moving one of the walls of your house. You give up after a moment, glaring at it angrily. The door just sits their.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and go past the counters, and stop dead in your tracks. Rising in front of you is not a toilet, but what can only be described as a low throne, with high sides leading to a smooth, white back and a bottom which was only slightly above your head. You walk over to it and pull yourself up. You firmly [i] do not [/i] think about how this facility is used and what must have touched it as you walk over to a large covered hole which is apparently pressure sensitive, seeing as how it slides away as you approach. You do your business, and quickly scramble of the chair and walk quickly out of the bathroom. You are so intent on your escape, moving as quickly as possible across the broken floor of the hall that you are taken totally off guard by the approach of a massive tiger anthro. The first thing you know a column of fur descends in front of you and SLAMS into the floor not a foot away. The vibrations, and the shock of seeing such a large object hit the ground, cause you to become distracted, and at that moment your foot steps in a particularly vicious crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are sent sprawling, tumbling for a ways before coming to a rest. Your ankle is a violent ball of pain, enough to leave you immobilized on the floor for a few moments. As you start to recover (your ankle thankfully is not broken, just sprained), you hear a voice thunder down from above:</span></div></div>",

Even in the midst of your own moderate pain from the sprained ankle, you can\u2019t help but wince. Your own bones would be creaking with that maneuver. You roll onto your back and stare at the sight over your head. Melanie cocks her head at you, grinning, and then unceremoniously snatches you off the floor, rising to her feet:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve really got to get used to being around anthros.\u201d She comments, amused. She clearly has noticed the way your clutching your ankle, as she carefully arranges you so sitting up in her pad (there\u2019s not enough room for you to lie down), ankle somewhat elevated. You glare at her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your damn floor.\u201d You shout up at her. Her face darkens, eyes narrowing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that was you I heard swearing earlier. You better stop talking like that, or I might have to wash that mouth out with soap.\u201d You gulp; she sounds serious and could easily do it. She has stopped, and is directing the entirety of her attention at you, her mouth in what appears to be a pursed expression. Clearly, she\u2019s waiting for you to say something:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d You say eventually, for lack of anything better to say. It apparently does the trick because, after a few more uncomfortable moments, she relents, saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were saying something about the floor?\u201d her tone is neutral. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, yeah, uh, it was just...\" you mumble off into incoherence. You really don't want a repeat explosion. Melanie looks at you, than rolls her eyes, sighing in exasperation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry; it's just that I had some bad experiences with this subject. But seriously, you've got to get over this fear thing. I'm not going to bite you in half whenever I get mad.\" You blanch at that image, especially as you are looking straight into her room-sized mouth at the time. She seems to realize this, and guilt flashes briefly on her face. She regards you for a moment, then:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not that intimidating, am I?\u201d This question is coupled with such a piteous feline expression that you have to laugh at the incongruity. She brightens immediately: \u201cSee. I know we\u2019ll break you out of it eventually. Now, tell me about the floor. Just don\u2019t swear.\u201d You sit there nonplussed for a moment, trying to wrap your mind around the giant mind-bending double mood swing you have just seen play out in front of you. Then you start to speak:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that the floor is cracked and uneven, making it very difficult for me to move around.\u201d Now that the pain in your ankle has diminished, you find it easier to speak without swearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it like that at your house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d You tell her emphatically, \u201cWe have wood, or tile, or carpet at home.\u201d Then, seeing her blank look of incomprehension, you ask: \u201cYou do know what those are, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I know what tile is!\u201d She says indignantly, but hastily. You smirk:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you don\u2019t know everything.\u201d You say, nodding sagely. That leaves her sputtering in search of an answer, but you decide to relieve her pain, and you tell her what \u201cwood\u201d and \u201ccarpet\u201d mean. She settles down on a couch in the living room (you had barely noticed the surroundings flit by) to finish the conversation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, wood and tile are smooth and hard, and carpet is like fir, except short, hard and bristly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She makes a face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe tile at school is hard enough on my claws; I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to have my claws caught in something like that. You humans, however, have such soft feet, it\u2019s probably comfortable.\u201d She reaches forward with a claw and carefully strokes the bottom of one of your foot with the smooth side. She\u2019s right, the paw you are sitting on is as tough as leather compared to your skin. Suddenly, your stomach growls. Loudly. You haven\u2019t eaten all day, after all, and there are some very interesting smells coming out of the kitchen. Molly laughs:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, <i>someone\u2019s</i> hungry.\u201d You blush, and try to cover your embarrassment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on the menu? It isn\u2019t raw meat, is it?\u201d you ask unwisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes your family eat unripe bananas and insects picked off each other\u2019s bodies?\u201d she retorts. You shake your head, duly chastised. \u201cThen don\u2019t assume we keep the same eating habits as out evolutionary precursors either.\u201d Molly stands up and takes you into the dining room. Once there, you are confronted with the sight of Melanie\u2019s dad, even taller than Melanie\u2019s mom and broader still, sitting at the table with a number of sheaves of papers in front of him, scribbling furiously with a pen. Before he notices you and Melanie, you see Melanie\u2019s mom walk in with a number of plates and pointedly seize a stack of papers to be replaced with her burden. Melanie\u2019s dad glances up in annoyance which quickly turns to sheepishness as he sees the plates, then spots Melanie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d He bounds to his feet and moves over to Melanie, smiling and looming over her (and even more so you). Melanie prudently moves her hand away as she nuzzles her dad for a moment, you are thankful to skip a repeat performance of summersaults. Melanie\u2019s dad turns his attention to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello John, my name is Zacharius Prusten. Nice to meet you.\u201d He extends a claw, which you shake. He probably could have shaken your entire body up and down with that one claw. Introduction made, Melanie sets you down on the table and the three tigers get to work. They are obviously practiced, and the meal quickly takes form. The table is already set for the anthros, but they do have to arrange your place. It is, thankfully, human sized (although, from their slightly odd proportions, not human made) utensils and plates which you receive, but they are set on top of what looks like a bottle cap and you end up sitting on what suspiciously resemble a thimble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie\u2019s mom then brings in the food, centering around a massive hunk of meat, expertly prepared and glazed which rises above your head, and clearly comes from an animal which is proportioned to the anthros. You privately resolve to never go anywhere near an anthro zoo, as Mr. Prusten\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mr. Prusten hacked and slashed furiously at the huge slab, carving out large chunks of meat that could each feed an army.  You are repulsed by the display, which Melanie notices.  \"Haven't you ever seen meat being carved before, John?  You'd think you were a herbivore by the look on your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not the problem, it's just your father's claws...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that, I'm sure they're perfectly clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough that was not what you were worried about, at least you don't have to worry about getting food poisoning on top of accidentally getting rendered.  However, the carving is done, and Zacharias starts serving heaping portions to his family.  Of course, he gave you a relatively small portion, which was still nearly the size of your head.  \"As our guest, you can have part of the tenderloin, John,\" spoke the huge father, showing his huge pointy teeth that could theoretically have your dinner stuck between two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot very concerned about what kind of animal the meat comes from, you start digging along with the rest of the tiger family.  The food is delicious; it is like beef, but gamier and leaner.  The meat is seasoned with tasty spices very thoroughly, and it is not too tough nor overcooked.  You don't know how you do it, but you manage to eat the entire plate of meat before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel stuffed now, and the tigers also look full and content.  Melanie very daintily wipes a few dozen pounds of meat off her face with a napkin, then says, \"Thanks for the dinner, Mom and Dad.  Can John and I be excused?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a bit annoyed that Melanie is excusing you, but since it's not very likely that you can get off the table yourself, you dismiss your anger.  Melanie's parents allowed her to pick you up and leave the table to go wash up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, your parents sure are good cooks,\" you say to your feline companion.  \"What kind of meat was that, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zebu,\" says Melanie.  Seeing your confused face, she adds, \"It's like an ox, but larger and a bit less heavily built.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, but something new is starting to get to you.  Melanie's parents said that you had to 'wash up', but Melanie is a tiger anthro, and tigers, being a part of the cat family, clean themselves by, you shudder, licking themselves.  While dinner was for the most part very similar to a human dinner, you hope that Melanie has somewhere where you can wash in a manner you are accustomed to.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Honestly Melanie, I think I prefer the sink.\" You tell her. The idea of having Melanie \"clean you up\" creeps you out. You and she have hit it off famously so far, especially given the difference in size and evolutionary ancestry, but still\u2026 you shudder. Looking up at her, you notice a little flash of something. Disappointment? Unfulfilled anticipation? You wonder. Whatever it is, it disappears and she nods:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d You\u2019re glad she didn\u2019t argue. Reaching forward a story above your head, she turns a knob inset high up on the tiled wall. You hear the pipes in the wall give a tortured gasp and a shrill, high-pitched blast of air emerges from the sewer-outlet sized faucet on your right, but no water emerges. Frowning, she turns it left and right, her extended claws delicately slotted into the slots running all around the knob. Nothing but air emerges, so after a few moments she stops. She walks away from you, opening the door and yelling out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAD! THE PIPES ARE SUCKING AIR AGAIN.\u201d Her voice is enormous, and the acoustics of the bathroom make it physically painful to your relatively tiny ears. You miss his reply, but clearly he can\u2019t do anything about it at this time of the evening. She comes back over, and you watch her apprehensively. Even for those few steps you see her walk is more... predatory, more aggressive. You swallow as, looking up past her expanse of striped fur and clothing towards her grinning face. She beams down at you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems you get to try a new cultural experience, and I get to see what a human tastes like.\" Your heart flops in your chest and you take an involuntary step backwards. <i>No way</i> repeats over and over again in your head, but you force yourself to stay calm and reply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI don\u2019t think so.\u201d You try to sound firm and decisive, but your voice quavers. Noticing this she settles down onto her haunches, bringing her head down to your level. It\u2019s meant to be reassuring, but it fails miserably as you are confronted with her wall-sized face, her mouth showing rows of very sharp teeth, which you saw tear through a chunk of meat five times your size at dinner. You watch, unmoving, as her nostrils flair and she takes in a theatrical sniff. Finally (even in your apprehension you manage to think <i>Keep me waiting why don\u2019t ya?</i>) she speaks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, you know that smelling fear thing? I wasn\u2019t kidding, and it\u2019s quite palpable around you. Wait,\u201d she says, holding up a paw, \u201cNow, kidding aside, we\u2019re not animals, despite somewhat biased viewpoints on both sides.\u201d She grins wryly, and you give her a wan smile, \u201cSince we\u2019re not animals, you\u2019re not going to let your fear control you like your tiny prehistoric ape ancestors would, and I\u2019m not going to eat you like my normal-sized cat ancestors would.\u201d Finished, she looks down for a moment, probably embarrassed at giving a speech. Somewhat rattled yourself, you are still determined to break the tension:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Tiny apes\u2019 and \u2018normal-sized\u2019 cats, eh? What was it you said about \u2018biased viewpoints?\u2019\u201d You ask, smiling. Tension dropping, she stands back up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d She says mock-huffily, producing a laugh from you. Then, more seriously: \u201cYou ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe patient Melanie,\u201d You chide her, \u201cGood things come to those who wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy put off to tomorrow what you can do today?\u201d She replies. She brings a paw down and nudges that back of your legs insistently. You sigh, and acquiesce, sitting down carefully with your legs dangling over the sides of her paw. She carefully lifts you into the air, bringing you with her a few steps (to her) across the bathroom to the second counter you noticed earlier. As the coming ordeal draws nearer and your heart rate starts to speed up once more, you distract yourself by complaining:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou always seem to get your way.\u201d You manage to keep a whining tone from your voice, so Melanie simply lets you hop off her paw onto the counter (somewhat slipperier than the other) before turning around, placing her paws on the counter behind her for balance and hopping up on her butt onto the counter:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it has something to do with the fact that I\u2019m ten times your size?\u201d She suggests lightly, looking down sideways at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d You concede taking in the enormity of her form, so quickly, dexterously and casually tossed about, \u201cAlthough an argument could be made for those teeth.\u201d you give a shudder which is only half faked. She grins down at you, displaying her full, extremely sharp set:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI can see how someone the size of a large rat might see it that way.\u201d She says, straight faced. You can\u2019t let that go unchallenged:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, watch who you\u2019re calling a rat, you big fur ball.\u201d You both laugh and she gives you a comradely flick on the arm with a claw. She reaches over to a ledge above your head, grabbing a small paper cup filled with some kind of liquid. Noting your curious gaze, she lowers it down to you. Peering inside, you see a small pool of translucent, pale green liquid, which gives off a very subtle scent, a cross between antiseptic and mint. Comprehension dawns:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this mouthwash?\u201d You ask her.  She shakes her head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like tongue wash. Neither you nor I want to end up smelling like meat after this, so I\u2019ll swirl this around my tongue to remove any lingering traces.\u201d With that, she tosses the liquid into her mouth and commences swishing. <i> Sounds like mouthwash to me, </i>you think to yourself. She thoroughly swished the liquid around in her mouth, then spat it out into the kiddy-pool sized cup. Setting this aside, she swiftly and unceremoniously grabs you. With a small yelp you are brought before her face, her foreclaw hooked into the back of your shirt and you nearly vertical before her. You do your best to remain calm and not hyperventilate, despite your racing heartbeat. Grasping at anything to delay the upcoming ordeal, you blurt out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, don't I need to take off my clothes?\" You regret the words the instant they leave your mouth. Melanie pauses, then roles her eyes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to get undressed?\" She asks you pointedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn\u2019t like that either. Do remove your shoes, however\" She says firmly. You obediently shuck them, and they fall through the air down to her waiting paw. Looking up, you see her face start to go through strange contortions: \"I'll just have too,\" She murmurs thickly and slowly, \"Use more spit than I usually do to get... through the cloth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, more <i> spit </i>...\" Is all you can get out in a high-pitched voice before, seemingly satisfied with the volume of saliva in her mouth, she stops grimacing, leans forward, opens her mouth and smothers you with her tongue All you get is a brief impression of her yawning closet of a mouth and her flexible pink carpet of a tongue before it covers you like a very wet blanket. Her feline tongue, you know, is far larger proportionally than a human tongue, and it is just large enough to cover your entire body. You are instantly soaked in her slightly sticky spit, and she starts moving her tongue slimily up and down your body. Your involuntary struggles are, of course, meaningless to her, and she simply pins them with her tongue when she needs access. It seems to go on forever, the thick slab of muscle roving over your body for an eternity. You can't see anything and you can barely breathe, your mouth almost covered with saliva. At last, however, with a few more desultory licks, she lifts her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look blearily out at her through your saliva-covered eyes. She merely grins at you, however, and deftly flips you over in her paw. This time, your face is not covered by the tongue, and she had mercifully positioned your head so that it was in the gap between two of her claws, along you to breathe, and to see a hazy-white light. She is just as thorough as before, and your body is repeatedly slammed into her palm, although thankfully not very hard. This time, once she is finished with her genera cleaning she goes after specific areas. The bottom of your feet- you half to laugh, even something as big as her tongue tickles there. The top of your head- your chin is slammed into the webbing between her claws. She then withdraws for a second, before delicately, with a hint of a chuckle coming from behind you, using the tip of her tongue to deliver an unreasonable (it seems to you) amount of her natural cleaning solution to areas she clearly thinks are most dirty. She starts with your hands, but then, to your chagrin, she gets behind your ears and at the back of your neck. Finally she finishes and lets you face her once more. You hang from her claw, limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squeaky clean now, and totally soaked,\" she says, trying and failing to hide a smirk. \"Now we need to get you dry.\" She smothers you again, but this time is different. Her tongue, which before had been thoroughly lubricated, is now bone dry. You can feel the individual bumps of her taste buds, and on the few areas of exposed skin you have your skin feels almost abraded. She does one slow lick for your front, one for your back and one for your head. <i> That </i> hurt. Your hair feels like its getting pulled out of your scalp, and you yell in pain. She pauses for a second, then gently licks your hair back down onto your scalp. With that, she pulls back once more and examines you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the hair.\" She says contritely. She leans over to her side and picks something up, out of your view. \"For my ancestors, that would've been it, but thanks to the wonders of modern technology we can ensure...\" She trails off as you cough something out, sputtering on her saliva. She turns her head so an ear faced you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said,\" You say, coughing, \"What's with this 'we'. This seems like a very one-sided process to me.\" That's all you have the energy for. She blinks once, slowly, than smiles appreciatively:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, thanks to the wonders of technology <i> I </i> can ensure that you are totally dry.\" With that, she brings an enormous hairdryer into your view. You look at it in dread, its mouth alone could swallow you (widthwise) whole. She adjusts her drip so you are truly dangling in mid air, suspended by a claw (if you weren't so exhausted you would be terrified of a fall, surely your shirt can't take this type of punishment). She points the hairdryer at you and turns it on, full power. You are buffeted by hurricane force winds of a truly extreme heat, like in the middle of the desert. You are blown around on her claw, forced back and up like a pendulum. She rotates her paw so that you are entirely exposed, the heat just barely low enough so that you don't get burned. She finishes and shuts it off. She eyes you critically for a moment, before gently setting you on your feet next to her. You take a few wobbly steps before falling heavily over, only barely caught by her paw. She frowns at you for a moment, before lithely getting off the counter and opening the bathroom door. Stepping into the hallway, she sets you down on an end table across the hall from the bathroom door, arranging you so that your back is up against a table lamp. You sit there, with barely the energy to slowly move your head and look at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie looks down at you with a grin, only slightly abashed by your bedraggled condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rat analogy continues, now you're like a drowned one.\" She grins at her own pun. You appreciate the humor, and grin slightly yourself. Encouraged, she continues: \"Anyway, it turns out that you don't taste so bad, different from what I usually eat though, exotic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I gave you the opportunity to expand your cuisine.\" You tell her hoarsely. She takes both the sarcasm and the truth in your comment, absorbing it. Then, quietly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks John.\" You give her a weak thumbs-up sign. She steps back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to clean myself now, so don't you go anywhere.\" She calls back over her shoulder. There\u2019s no real chance of that. You're not in pain, but you are entirely exhausted by the ordeal. You simply sit there, in a kind of haze, leaning up against the lamp which is almost blinding in intensity, you being directly under the shade. You can't sleep, so you just sit unmoving until... </span></div></div>",

You know it's Melanie, but the lamp's intense light has blinded your vision, so all you get is an impression of her size and shape. The monolithic figure hesitates for a second upon reaching the table and seeing you, but then she reaches forward and carefully picks you up in one paw. She walks into her room, closing the door behind her and setting you on her desk. You sit up and stretch, your exhaustion fading. It hadn't really come from exertion, after all, just a feeling of being overwhelmed. You blink rapidly as the spots disappear from your eyes, looking around. The dark grey tinge over everything slowly fades, leaving you able to see once more. Looking over at Melanie, you are confronted with the sight of a massive expanse of white. You blink again. <i> are my eyes playing tricks on me? </i> you wonder. Shaking your head and looking again, you crane your head up. Melanie is standing directly in front of her desk, her head far above yours. She's clutching a large, white, fuzzy towel around her body, and her head is darting around clearly looking for something. Eventually she looks down at you, something very much like consternation written on her face. You can't think of anything to say, and her eyes scan past you, settling on something behind you. She reaches down, her paw hovering over you for a second, blocking your sight. She moves it over behind you, and you here a <i> click </i> and a smooth whooshing sound. Looking behind you, you see a large section of the desk rising up, a panel the size of the outside cellar doors in a human house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" you ask, confused. Melanie glances at you swiftly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In you get.\" She tells you, \"I need to change.\" You climb slowly to your feet, too wise to argue. Melanie, clearly impatient, \u201chelps\u201d you to the dark hole in the desk, essentially by putting her paw on your back and scooting you across her desk. You nearly go plummeting face first into the receptacle, only saved by two of her claws closing on the back of your shirt, brining you back up with a jerk. You look back up at her dubiously, the receptacle is barely illuminated. \u201cIn.\u201d She says shortly. You raise your hands:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d You take hold of the edge and swing yourself over. Your feet don\u2019t touch bottom. Swallowing, you let go. You fall for less than a second before hitting the floor. The panel closes above you swiftly, leaving you in darkness. The wood isn\u2019t thick, and you can here her moving around outside the desk. To amuse yourself, and relive your anxiety at being trapped, you carefully explore the space. It\u2019s not very large, only a few paces in any direction, and you know the \u201cceiling\u201d is only a little higher than your height with outstretched arms. You stumble over various objects, but you can\u2019t identify them. Eventually, you settle for just sitting there, waiting and listening. You\u2019re prepared for a long wait, since girls always seem to take a long time changing. Melanie is merciful, however, and long before you start to go stir crazy you hear the <i> click </i> again. The panel rises, letting in a blinding amount of light. You shield your eyes and feel Melanie pick you up again, placing your feet on her desk. When you can see again, you notice that your giant host is now seated so that she looms over you only slightly. She\u2019s giving you an apologetic look:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for being so abrupt.\u201d The sincerity of her tone is obvious, so you let it pass:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d You turn to the receptacle, contents more brightly illuminated now that Melanie has turned on all the room\u2019s lights, \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d She peers over your head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that? It\u2019s where I keep my random electronic junk, portable storage, IDN connectors, spare\u2026\u201d She grins at you, \u201cmice.\u201d You glare at her, but she continues blithely, \u201cSeems kind of appropriate now that I think about it.\u201d You recall her rodent comments from before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha, very funny.\u201d You tell her flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so.\u201d She reaches over your head and uses a claw to press the wooden panel down. It sinks below the level of the desk, than comes back up and catches. She puts her elbows on the desk and crosses her fingers in the air above you, resting her chin on them. This forms a large, orange-colored arch, at the top of which her eyes stare down at you, considering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now what?\u201d She asks you. You shrug,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s your house. What\u2019s there to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could play a game, we\u2019ve got some time before bed. Hmmm.\u201d She scoots backwards and leans down. You are placed in the unique position of looking down at the broad expanse of Melanie\u2019s back, covered now in a loose blue tee-shirt. Beyond that, you can make out the back of her chair, and past this you can just barely make out a glimpse of sinuous motion that can only be her tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an \"ahah!\" Melanie jerks backwards, causing a cascade of other objects that you can feel through the desk's surface. She straightens up, showing you her prize. Clasped tight between her two paws is a large, white and black sphere:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought we could try out some soccer!\u2019 She informs you brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I like soccer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, I guess we can\u2026\u201d She trails off, a thought clearly occurring to her. She looks between the ball and you, between you and the ball. She reaches forward and carefully sets the ball on the desk, with its distinct, if much amplified, rubbery sound.  You see the problem at once. The ball is about two feet taller than you are, and you could easily fit inside it yourself. <i> Heck, a third of my room could fit in there with room to spare </i> you think to yourself. You step back hastily as the ball gives a slight movement and starts to roll in your direction. Melanie, seeing the danger, thankfully stabilizes before it had rolled more than a foot, her paw resting on top of it. You give her a relieved glance:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, getting squashed by that ball probably wouldn\u2019t kill me, but it sure would hurt.\u201d  She nods gravely:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soccer's definitely out.\" She says firmly, removing the ball. You breath easier with it gone. One slip on Melanie's part might've sent you to the hospital.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about a nice, safe game of chess?\u201d She asks you. Her tone is over-bright, and you don\u2019t quite like the way she used the word \u201csafe\u201d so\u2026. condescendingly. However, it\u2019s not like you have a choice, so you respond:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u201d. She nods and stands up, You watch her move off to another shelf in her room, whose contents you can\u2019t see from your angle. She hesitates, than turns and gives you a mischievous grin, one that makes you gulp even across the not-inconsiderable distance of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, I just remembered\u2026.\u201d She walks out of the room. You wait, frowning. From what you\u2019ve seen of her so far, you know that Melanie is usually quite nice, but she doesn\u2019t always handle disappointments as well as she should. You hope she isn\u2019t planning an elaborate revenge for not being able to play soccer with you. These hopes are dashed when, upon her return, you see that Melanie is carrying a truly massive chess set. She is clearly struggling to lift it, it\u2019s wider than her torso and she\u2019s bowed awkwardly under its weight. Melanie stands there for a moment, panting, leaning the board on a bedpost. She hoists the chessboard up again and staggers towards her desk. As she looms closer and closer and the shadow of the board creeps over you, you realize you are in serious danger,. You scramble out of the way. You feel like you are creeping across the desk, the hairs on your head stand on end as Melanie reaches her desk and the board hovers over you. You know there is no way you would\u2019ve made it if Melanie hadn\u2019t halted the board\u2019s downward motion, keeping it from squishing you. As it is, you are barely a foot away from the edge of the board as it SLAMMS down behind you. The rush of air nearly causes you to fall over, but you recover your balance. Turning, you see Melanie sit down heavily in her chair, looking pleased with herself. You take the opportunity to approach the board.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe height is considerable for such an object; you have to step high to reach the top. Once on top, you are looking out along a checkered vista, about ten yards by ten yards. Over at the far end, Melanie gazes down at the board for a moment before bringing up a large cloth bag. She fiddles with the tie for a moment, opening it and setting it on the board, where it covers most of the center squares. She reaches forward and carefully upends it on the board, Despite her care, a large number of the door-sized objects bounce across the board, and you hotfoot it to avoid them, When they finally settle down, you find yourself looking at a large number of sculptures of tigers in various getups, lying all askew. Clearly, these are the pieces. You here a few thunks from across the way. Turning, you see Melanie rapidly picking up, examining and placing the pieces. Her hand is so large and fast that you have a hard time following it, it resembles very much an industrial crane at this moment. Suddenly, you see her pick up a black piece and head towards you. You duck your head just in time from keeping it from getting knocked off as she sets a black rook (although it in fact is carved to resemble a tiger in inordinately large amounts of armor) on one side. You walk to the center of the board to keep out of the way. When she's finished, you can see two double lines of figures, all larger than you, facing each other. The white and black lines are quite far apart, but you still feel slightly claustrophobic, a deer in the headlights. Going over to one, you see (to your immense irritation) that even the pawns tower over you by a few inches. Behind them, the larger pieces loom still higher, the rooks, bishops and knights (although not resembling any human game pieces) easily one and a half times your height, while the king and queen reign over them all (and you) at twice your height. Your contemplation is cut abruptly short as you feel a pressure on your back. You turn in time to catch Melanie's sweeping pad in the front instead of the back. She hoists you effortlessly into the air, giving you a view of the entire board (which is clearly oversized, even to Melanie). She reaches forward with her other hand and picks up the black and white kings, setting them aside. Without a word she reaches forward and sets you in the black king's spot Your claustrophobia is magnified ten fold as the black queen on your left, a voluptuous tiger women with a crown and a massive sword, and a bishop (a robe-clad tiger) rise over you on either side. You can't even see the white lines well without moving, as you are staring at the back of the pawn in front of you. Your attention is torn by Melanie, who finally decides to speak:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you like your forces, little king?\" She asks you. You glare at her, feeling a bit fed up at her elaborate attempts to make you feel small:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little king? Listen here Melanie, this is way over the top...\" You Yell at her. She just wags a claw:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, be nice. I could've made you a pawn.\" This does little to settle your discontent, but, deciding to mind your manners as a guest, you tolerate it. \"Speaking of pawns...\" her voice trails away as she grabs two pawns, a black in one hand and a white in the other, than moves them out of sight (in this case simply behind the white lines, which are impenetrable to your gaze at this distance) and shuffles them, then grabs them again. She leans forward enough so that each palm hovers over the black lines:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you clearly can't do this, I'll offer you the pick of color. Pick a paw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The right one.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right or my right?\" She asks you innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My right.\" You call back, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, my right it is.\" She says decisively, opening the paw on your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, you're playing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI guess you\u2019re white.\u201d She says. Before you know what is happening, she swiftly plucks you off the board, moves you to the other end and drops you in the white king\u2019s space. You stumble dizzily for a moment before recovering. Turning, you see that Melanie has gripped the board on either end. With a powerful jerk she spins the board around so that she has the black end. Her room flashes by in front of you as you are knocked on your back by the powerful motion. Standing, you weave dizzily on your space as you try not to lose your very large dinner. When you recover, you look up at Melanie, who is looking very amused:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour move.\u201d Deciding that there\u2019s nothing to be done except let her have her fun, you grudgingly comply. You can still barely see anything, being surrounded by a mass of white wood is, if anything, even worse, as now as well as being cut off you are also blinded as Melanie\u2019s desk lamp reflects off their gleaming surfaces. You decide to go with the classic opening, which will allow you to at least see the black end of the board:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKing\u2019s pawn to D-5\u201d you shout up at Melanie. She just looks down at you with a self-satisfied smirk on her face. The silence stretches for a moment, then you roll your eyes. <i> I hope it\u2019s not too heavy </i>, you think as you step up to the pawn and brace yourself. With a heave, you push the pawn forward. Thankfully it\u2019s not as heavy as it could be, given that its solid wood, and it whispers across the board on what appears to be a felt covering on its base. Still, it takes some effort to move it the requisite two spaces. You step backwards, looking around. The board remains as it was, but you hear a noise above you. Melanie is making a very half-hearted attempt to conceal her snickers with a paw. You glare at her, which sets her off again. Eventually, you wise up, turn your back on her and walk back to your space. You turn and wait, arms crossed over your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we playing chess or am I just doing this to amuse you?\" You ask her, half rhetorically, half seriously. She regains her composure, looking a bit shamefaced, but still quite amused. She reaches down, and in a manner similar to that of an industrial crane lifts up her queen's knight and moves it to cover your pawn. With that, the game begins in earnest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the multitude of disadvantages you are faced with, you do rather well. Despite her playful attitude and her antics with the chess set, when Melanie settles down to play chess she is a skilled and ruthless player. She quickly seizes the initiative, placing her two bishops in the center of the board and using them to try and constrain your movement, then exploiting openings to get at your large(r) pieces. For your part, you have to play a defensive game, moving your pawns to try and protect your large pieces. The main difficulty is, of course, your inability to see the entire board. Even the pawns are slightly taller than you are, so your range of vision, especially as the game progresses and the board gets cluttered. You can see Melanie, of course, and her paw moving her pieces around, but identifying exactly <i>which</i> pieces those are, and where they\u2019re going to and coming from is nearly impossible, you have to go and investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to having to run around the board, trying to keep a mental picture in your head of the action, you\u2019re also kept on your toes. Melanie\u2019s responses are quick and immediate, often you don\u2019t even make it back to your space before she goes (which adds the problem of having your back turned when she moves). This is especially true when she\u2019s exploiting openings you missed. Once, for instance, when you had just finished moving a rook she slams her bishop all the way across the board, sending your rook flying and knocking you onto your butt. She just barely missed your toes with the attack. She collects the piece and adds it to the dismal line on the side of the board (which you can just barely make out), and you stand up, brushing yourself off. The game continues, and you\u2019re thankful that it isn\u2019t timed. Melanie would be even more aggressive, and how would you ever manage to push the button on a clock scaled for anthros?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving the pieces around is, of course, your source of greatest difficulty. While the pawns are slightly bigger than you, they pose little challenge. The larger pieces, especially the knight, are far more serious problems. You greatest \u201cjoy\u201d however, is the queen. Standing at twice your height, moving it around is damm near impossible. You have to lean it over onto your back and haul it around the board at a tortuously slow pace, often knocking other pieces off their spaces. Since it\u2019s twice the size of the pawns, it\u2019s also twice as heavy, and your exertions are so pronounced that you feel something like relief when she manages to rid you of it in a queen-bishop exchange. That\u2019s the beginning of the end for you. Despite a coup you manage to pull off a few turns later, taking her other bishop through an opening that you didn\u2019t even see until that turn, she slowly annihilates your defense and corners you-literally. As your forces are swept from the board, you run into more problems. Throughout the game, Melanie has tried to restrict your movement. Numerous times you would find your way between two pieces blocked by a white pillar topped by orange fur, Melanie\u2019s foreclaw, a column of fur flesh extended by the conical, pointed claw itself, stuck into the board to cut you off, followed by a comment along the lines of <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to move my paw all the way around the board on my turn, why should you need to move yourself?\u201d You just ignore her on these occasions, and move around her claw. Unfortunately, sometimes she presses her \u201cpoint\u201d and tries to nab you off the board when you ignore her. You come up with a fairly simple counter-strategy. Whenever Melanie tries to grab you, you duck into a cluster of pieces and yell at her not to touch the pieces when it isn\u2019t her turn. It is quite effective at first, but as the game goes on there are fewer and fewer pieces (especially white ones) that you can hide among, the consequence being that she can get you more and more. By then, however, it is far less important. The board is far more open now, and you are quite able to see your doom approaching in the corner that you\u2019ve taken refuge in. At last, Melanie moves her queen into position, setting it down with a large <i>thunk</i>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheck.\u201d You had expected the move, as it was obvious, putting the queen two spaces diagonally from you. You turn to your rook, which you had been using as a shield in front of you. You brace yourself against it to move it a space to the right, shielding you from the queen. When you start to push, however, you find that it is suddenly immovable. You strain for a while before realizing that something is up. Looking around the rook, you see that Melanie has placed her paw back on to the rook, pitting your strength against that of her paw. You lose, no question. By now you\u2019re so tired that you can barely move, let alone yell loud enough to be heard, so you simply glare up at her in exasperation. She glances significantly down at the board. Turning, you see the foreeclaw of her other paw tapping her rook at the other end of the board. To your dismay, it\u2019s covering your rook, so if you move it, you\u2019ll put yourself in check, which is not permitted. You sigh, then turn and walk one space to the left of your original space, getting out of check. With an awful inevitability Melanie pounces, sliding her rook across the board slowly and carefully knocking your rook off the space. Now all you have is a few pawns and a knight on the other side of the board. It\u2019s your turn, but you can\u2019t move yourself as king, as you\u2019re pinned by the rook, which is in turn covered by one of Melanie\u2019s knights. You just stand there for a moment, than gather yourself together. Your doom is assured, but at least you can go out with some dignity. You turn to track wearily across the board to uselessly move one of your remaining pieces, but you are brought up short. Melanie has a claw hovering over your knight, a questioning look in her eyes. You nod, and she moves it for you, something she hasn\u2019t done all game. Having moved you knight, Melanie her paw over to her queen. She picks it up her queen and sets it down a few spaces over with an air of finality:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheckmate.\u201d <i>It\u2019s over</i> is all you can think, relieved. Then, your back stiffens. Melanie, who had become far more somber and serious as the game wore on, is grinning. \u201cYou lost, so your king has to be knocked over.\u201d She informs you, you back away, shaking your head, but of course there\u2019s no where to go. The massive black queen rises into the air and then starts slowly swinging forward like a wrecking ball, heading straight for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof\u201d the base of the queen hits you in the chest. Melanie probably did everything possible to make it no more than a gentle tap, at least from her perspective, but it still lifts you off your feet and knocks you onto your butt. You lay on your back for a moment, gasping. You gently probe your chest with a free hand, discovering no broken ribs, and not even a very large bruise. Melanie had judged the amount of force to a tee. It didn\u2019t even hurt that much. You push yourself up into a sitting position, just in time to see Melanie\u2019s claws coming straight for you! She grabs you by the collar behind your neck, a spot she seems to prefer, and lifts you off the board. Depositing you on the other side in front of her monolithic black queen, she says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, kneel before the victorious queen.\u201d Now, you know this game has entirely been about satisfying Melanie\u2019s whims and you had resigned yourself to the fact, but this borders on the absurd. You consider refusing for a moment, but then a better idea strikes you. You kneel to the queen, which already towers over you, and thus by inference, since Melanie is directly behind her queen, to your giant, power-tripping host. After this, however, you take it farther, abasing yourself with your face on the board and your arms extended before you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease accept, most glorious and large victor, my humblest praise. Clearly, you are the master of this game, nay this art. I never even had the shadow of a hope of victory, your mighty and gigantic form was simply overwhelming beyond words\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh! Stop.\u201d You look up, see that Melanie looks supremely uncomfortable and get to your feet, brushing the dust off your clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I go on?\u201d You ask her, \u201cTalk about how this humble worm is not fit to grovel in your majestic presence, perhaps?\u201d Melanie is uncharacteristically silent, looking distinctly uncomfortable. Your point was made. She reaches forward again, but this time instead of picking you up she gently shepherds you off the board, than starts picking up the pieces, sticking them back in the cloth bag. When she\u2019s finished, she stands, picks up the board and walks out of the room. Returning, she stands in front of her desk, an expanse of blue on orange and black, with a small sliver of navy towards the bottom where her sweats meet her loose blue t-shirt. Kneeling by her bed, she pulls something out of her backpack, then turns and offers it to you. It\u2019s your backpack, and a large bag containing, among other things, your toothbrush, a change of clothes, your PJs and a duffel bag. Her giant voice rumbles from behind you while you\u2019re rummaging through the bag...</span></div></div>",

I might have gotten a little carried away.\u201d You don\u2019t turn, knowing that she is probably really embarrassed right now. You wave your hand idly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, you see that Melanie seems to have recovered her composure. You give a theatrical yawn:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, it was fun but moving those pieces around wiped me out.\u201d Melanie smiled and nodded her agreement:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I think it\u2019s bedtime.\u201d She nods to the PJs in your hand, \u201cYou need to get changed?\u201d She asks. You nod, looking around. There\u2019s no cover in sight:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Melanie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, I\u2019ve got you covered.\u201d She pauses for a second, than:\u201dNo pun intended.\u201d You groan, and she laughs. She bends over and opens up the same panel on her desk. She grabs you and lowers you inside:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in three minutes.\u201d She warns as she shuts the top. The darkness, your overactive imagination and your resulting clumsy, too quick movements nearly cause you to miss that deadline. You\u2019re barely decent before the <i>click</i> comes again. Your super-dilated pupils can\u2019t take the light, you flinch and shield them. You feel Melanie grab you and lift you up; when you can see again, you\u2019re being held at arm\u2019s length, gently turning as Melanie twists her paw around, inspecting you from all sides. You lower your arm and wait. Eventually, appearing satisfied, she looks at you solemnly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie?\u201d She hesitates for a second, than, a grin breaking out: \u201cYou look like a black-striped red mouse!\u201d  Having expected something like this, you quickly return:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you look like a giant orange, blue, black\u2026. thing.\u201d You conclude lamely. She gives a bark of laughter, and you wobble uncontrollably, nearly losing your balance on her paw as it twitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice comeback. Here, grab your toothbrush.\u201d You do so, and she walks to the bathroom. Once there, she sets you down on the counter and reaches up, extracting her own, 4X4 length toothbrush from a niche that\u2019s obscured from your sight because of the angle, as well as a tube of toothpaste and another of her seemingly infinite supply of small paper Dixie cups. Setting these aside and turning the knob for the sink, she is rewarded with a massive gush of super-pressurized water which falls almost your own height before reaching the drain and being sucked down. She fills the cup with water, and then offers both it and the toothpaste to you. You carefully swirl your toothbrush inside the opening of your tube, its large enough to accommodate your toothbrush, and then swish it in the water. You brush quickly, spit into the massive sink in a rather pathetic dribble, and then turn to watch Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is in the process of carefully polishing her fangs, which make up the vast majority of her teeth except for a few flat molars you noticed in the back during your cleaning. She works quite industriously, creating quite a foam. You\u2019re glad that you can\u2019t see very well, even from here you can see some dried juices being swept away, giving a slight pink tinge to the paste. When she\u2019s finished, she reaches down and grabs the Dixie cup, swirls the water in her mouth and spits it all out. Her output is far greater than your own, several gallons at least. She then breaks off a piece of floss and offers it to you. You shake your head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019ll work.\u201d The floss she offered you was as thick as moderate rope, and would never fit between your teeth. She shrugs, then begins flossing. To distract yourself, you make conversation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you guys have red mice?\u201d She nods:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and they\u2019re about your size.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to make out her words, but you manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kind of got that. Anyway, we only have white, brown and black mice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have those to, but the red ones were considered delicacies to those of my ancestors who lived as desert nomads.\u201d You nod; red mice would\u2019ve had a camouflage advantage on the famously crimson sand of that desert. Melanie tosses her floss off to the side into a trash can below the counter, than grabs you again. Emerging from the bathroom, you both see two planks of wood leaning against Melanie\u2019s doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks over to them and sets you on the floor. As she gets into position to lift the two pieces, you notice that the long one is actually taller than she is! The notion boggles your mind so much that you nearly get decapitated as the base of the long piece of wood sweeps across the floor as Melanie turns it into a horizontal position. You see the large base sweep barely a foot in front of your face. The rush of air following its displacement beats against your chest and tears at your hair. You smooth down your hair and straighten your clothes, heart pounding. Melanie appears not to have noticed, simply continuing the motion until she\u2019s standing with the boards held horizontally in front of her. The boards hover in the air far above you, creating a small area of shadow and blocking out Melanie\u2019s body and head. You try not to think about the consequences of her dropping those boards. Sensing movement, you turn and see Melanie inching forward her foot gingerly, carefully prodding the area in front of her. You move aside several times as she sweeps the floor around her. Eventually:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, John? I can\u2019t see you, please touch my foot.\u201d You comply, moving over to one of the tall structures and tapping. You feel a bit shorter just standing next to it; your head barely reaches halfway to her knee. \u201cThanks, follow me in but keep a wide berth.\u201d She carefully lifts her foot up and over, using a single claw resting on your shoulder to keep you still. You flinch momentarily as it\u2019s directly over you, but she quickly move sit, settling it down to your. She starts slowly sidling into the room sideways, moving slowly enough that even you can keep up with her, once more moving across the uneven floor. You have to jump to avoid her tail, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, she went through another complicated turning operation, admonishing you to \u201cstay out of the way\u201d. She is clearly tired and out of breath, and you note with concern that the boards are shaking somewhat. Apparently they\u2019re very heavy. It also makes you wonder about the relative strength of humans and anthro tigers. You grimace. <i>In actual strength</i> you think to yourself wryly, <i>she could toss me around this room, and I would need a crane to lift those boards</i>. She sets the wood carefully down in front of her desk, and waits for a moment, massaging her biceps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTired? They looked pretty heavy.\u201d You tell her in a faux-sympathetic voice. She glares down and back at you, you having walked unnoticed up behind her, but says nothing. You gesture towards the pile of wood. \u201cSo, what\u2019s all that for?\u201d You ask. She considers for a moment, then that familiar grin appears:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you. In fact, you can help me test it.\u201d You don\u2019t like the sound of that and start to back away. You are brought up short, however, when you back into a thick, springy ropelike barrier. Looking over your shoulder, you see that Melanie has moved her long, thick tail to block your escape. She chuckles, and her tail applies pressure on your back, you are swept across the floor as Melanie swishes her tail around her body, causing you to smack straight into her waiting pad. She jerks you into the air and sets you down seconds later on one of the boards. \u201cHold on.\u201d She advises you. She grabs the board, one hand grasping the closer edge in front of you, the other reaching across and grabbing the other edge behind you. With a grunt she jerks the board into the air. That alone nearly sends you flying off the board as the unstable surface wobbles, but after that as she lifts the board up past waist height to chest height she begins to tilt it. At first it is almost vertical as Melanie adjusts the board so that one edge is resting on top of her desk, and you have an unpleasant moment of near-freefall before impacting against Melanie\u2019s wrist with a thud. You grab her fur and hang on grimly, wishing it was over. Once the board is firmly set, Melanie quickly moves the edge of the board on the floor, so that the angle is much less steep. You release your death grip on her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat about does it.\u201d She tells you, frowning down at her wrist, where two spots of matted ad twisted fur are clearly visible. She licks and smoothes them, then prods you forward. You walk up the slope, glad that someone (probably Melanie\u2019s dad) had sanded the wood to a degree that even human-scaled feet aren\u2019t in danger of getting splinters. You ascend past Melanie\u2019s face, with her scooting minutely sideways on her haunches to keep up with her progress. When you reach the top, you turn to survey your progress, pumping your hands in the air ironically. Melanie pulls out a gigantic roll of duct tape, pulls on the end and roughly places a length of sticky grey plastic over the end of the board, sheering it off with her claw. As she repeats the procedure at the other end of the board and sets up the other board so it goes between the desk and her nightstand, you examine the duct tape. It looks identical to the duct tape you use at home, if much, much bigger, but you find when you experimentally tug on a corner it\u2019s much more adhesive at well. You can lift it, barely, but it takes a lot of effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of you humans\u2019 best inventions.\u201d Melanie\u2019s voice sounds like it\u2019s right in your ear, and you jump. She chuckles, and turning you see that Melanie had indeed leaned forward so her face was right behind you. She withdraws her head and gestures to her nightstand. You grab your bag, backpack and sleeping bag, and then head over across the newly-installed bridge while Melanie takes the few steps required to move to her bed and sit down. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk across the stand and approach Melanie\u2019s bed. You set your stuff down close to the bed. A quick puff of air from Melanie makes you look at her closely, staring down at you, but any mirth there might have been was quickly wiped away, she just continues to examine you with interest. Your suspicions, honed by an evening of her devilish, if good-hearted, size pranks, are far from alleviated, so you remain tensed as you spread out your sleeping bag and pillow. Surprisingly, nothing happens. When you finish, she gently places your sloes, held incongruously by sticking the tip of her claw in the openings, next to your stuff:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat setup is so you can, uh, use the bathroom during the night without needing to wake me up. \u00ce tend to get grump when I am woken during the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kind of figured.\u201d She gives you a dirty look, your comment could have related to either point she made. Her arm hovers over you for a moment as she clicks on her lamp. You shade your eyes and turn your head, but the light is blinding, the nightstand being small enough that even at the end you are under the lampshade. You hear a few clicks and the rustling of large amounts of cloth, the creak of huge bedsprings, and then Melanie clicks off the lamp again. The darkness afterwards is impenetrable to your super-dilated pupils, but once your eyes adjust you stand on the edge for a moment, surveying Melanie\u2019s bed. It\u2019s a dark expanse that stretches away from you, with Melanie\u2019s form rising up as a almost formless mass. After a few moments of looking, contemplating your truly unique situation, you turn and crawl into your sleeping bag. As your head hits the pillow, you hear Melanie, who you believe has been watching you with as much interest as you had of her, say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night John.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Night. Melanie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, during the night, you have occasion to be thankful for Melanie\u2019s trouble. Feeling the urgent call of nature, you claw your way out of your entangling sleeping bag and head for the bathroom, Melanie\u2019s sleeping on oblivious, her large presence seeming to hang in the air above you. You had discovered that Melanie doesn\u2019t snore, thankfully, but she breathes very deeply when she sleeps, giving an unearthly quality to the room, as the sound of her breathing echoed through the room, never diminishing. Thankfully for your sleep addled mind, the planks are so wide, about the same as your hallways at home, that you can stumble across them without too much danger of falling to your death. You squeeze out of the small crack Melanie left in the door, than head for the bathroom. You have a bad moment when you find the bathroom door seemingly closed, but on closer examination you see that there is still a foot of clearance left, only a bit more than an inch for an anthro but easily sufficient for your needs. The darkness inside the bathroom, where the light from the small hallway lamp does not reach, is somewhat of a hindrance, but by now your eyes have adjusted and you finish rapidly. You return to Melanie\u2019s room, stumbling over the uneven floor but not cursing, as you are now very afraid of Melanie\u2019s preternatural hearing, even when asleep. You ascend the makeshift ramp once more, but you pause when you reach the top, a whim striking you. Seeing that Melanie is deeply, deeply asleep, you move stealthily over to the panel you had been dumped through several times before. Its position is hard to discern, especially in the dark, but by kneeling and rubbing your fingers over the wood you can discern the crack. It\u2019s actually an excellent piece of craftsmanship; if the crack is fine and hardly discernable to you, than it must be totally invisible to an anthro without a magnifying glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand and set one foot on the panel, both hands on top of the connected leg. You push down with all your strength on the seemingly immovable desk. At first nothing happens, but as you bear down even more, muscles straining, you feel it begin to give. <i>I\u2019ve got it!</i> you think exultantly. The panel sinks down into the desk on its hinge, which causes you to overbalance. Because of the additional pressure on your extended leg which comes as a result, the panel sinks even farther, enough so that a chilling <i>click</i>, more felt than heard, issues forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best to scramble back, but in doing so your foot rises for a split second off the wood of the panel. It\u2019s enough. The panel springs open, momentarily catching your leg and lifting you into the air upside down over the hole. You have only a moment to contemplate your stupidity before the angle becomes steep enough that your foot slips. You give a brief yelp as you plummet into the hole, one that is cut off abruptly as you land on your\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You lay for a moment, panting, your stomach a solid ache. Groaning, you get to your feet, hobbling over to some unidentified object and sitting down. You massage your stomach and try to think. The panel is, thankfully, still open, and after a period of sitting and gasping your brain recovers enough to begin to plan a way out of this hole. The tiny amount of diffuse light provided by the cracked door all the way across the room is not enough to determine the contents of the whole, although you can see various shadows of objects. Although you\u2019re very tired and in pain, the fear of getting stuck in that hole motivates you to hobble over to one wall and lift your hands over your head, sending a new flash of pain through your body. To your frustration, you can\u2019t reach the edge, even standing on your toes. You start feeling around, almost completely blind, looking for something to boost yourself with. You first run into a bundle of cable, as thick as a telephone wire, as large as you are but which gives way when you try to stand on it, forcing you to extricate yourself. Next you try the cube like object in the middle, which is bigger than you, but you can\u2019t move it, it seems to be attached to the bottom of the space. You are looking around for something else to try when you notice a sudden silence. Melanie\u2019s loud but even breathing, which had filled the entire room, has stopped. You hear the creak of bedsprings and the sound of cloth rustling. You guess that Melanie is getting up for the same reason you did. You start yelling at the top of your lungs:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie! Melanie, in here! Melanie.\u201d Your voice comes out raspy and barely audible. You clear it, but by the time you do you hear heavy steps padding out of the room. You wait impatiently for her to return, clearing your throat so you can speak, or rather yell, normally. After what seems like ages, although in reality it\u2019s only a few minutes, you hear her steps once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMELANIE!\u201d You roar at the very top of your lungs when you judge she\u2019s right in front of her desk. A pause, and then you hear an unintelligible mumbling. You hear her move off, and you are preparing to yell up the receptacle again when you finally hear something distinct:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn? Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDOWN HERE!\u201d You bellow. You are momentarily blinded as even the faint light produced when Melanie turns her desk lamp on, which is blocked from your line of sight, is enough to cause pain. From the sound of her gasp, you\u2019re fairly sure the same thing is true with her. You blink and dimly make out the shape of Melanie\u2019s paw reaching down into the receptacle. She feels around clumsily, movements uncoordinated.  You are a bit wary of Melanie's hand as it feels around blindly on the bottom of the receptacle, but, as Melanie knows, you can't really avoid it. The rubbery flesh of her pad envelops you as she feels your body, and she wraps her claws around you roughly.<br>\r\nShe lifts you out of the receptacle and looks at you blearily. You blanch inside, taking in her looks. Her face, usually so full of good humor, is practically expressionless. Her fur and whiskers are entirely disheveled, and her eyes are dead. It's like looking at a zombie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John...\" her voice is monotone, her words slow, as if she is having a hard time thinking of words, \"What were you doing in there?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Uh, I was..\" you stammer, rubbing your hand behind your head sheepishly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Wait... how did you even get in there? It was closed I thought...\" her voice trails off as she struggles to remember. She looks at the open lid for a second before slowly closing it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"It was closed, I was just... experimenting.\" Your face turns red. She just looks at you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experimenting. I see.\" Her voice is flat. You can't think of anything to say, but you feel like more explanation is required. However, when you open your mouth to talk she shakes a claw at you warningly: \"Don't talk. We'll have a long conversation about this in the morning, but for now...\" She shifts her grip on you so that your body is encircled and your limbs pinned. She moves to her nightstand. You try to see what she's doing, but she responds to your squirming around to see by tightening her grip. It becomes all too clear, however, when a moment later she holds your sleeping bag under you, spreading its opening with two claws. You struggle valiantly, but she has you trapped in her grip:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STAY...\" She lines you up with the opening while giving a loud whisper: \"...PUT!!!\" She stuffs you into the sleeping bag, pushing you down into the dark, fluffy space and holding you down with a claw on your head.  She removes the claw, but only so that she can zip the bag closed over your head! Even as your heart races, you can't help but admire her dexterity. <i> That zipper must be like the head of a pin to her!</i> you think. She dangles the bag for a few moments, your skin crawling at the realization that only a few inches of cheap cloth protect you from a drop of over 40 feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie shakes the sleeping bag a few times to make sure her point got across, than puts it down, none-to-gently (although she didn't slam it, that could kill you) back on the nightstand. You lay in the bag for a moment, trying to breath in the close atmosphere inside the bag and having a hard time doing so. You hear the bedsprings give a loud CREAK and the rushing of air as Melanie throws herself onto her bed, muttering imprecations:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot mousy behavior...so tired...idiot, could've gotten killed.\" You wince at the last one, knowing she has the full moral advantage. After a while, the muttering stops and regular breathing resumes. You carefully work open the zipper from the inside, not daring to make even the slightest noise for fear of waking Melanie. You manage it eventually, however, and you carefully adjust yourself so you're comfortable. You're quite tired, and the feeling of the pillow and sleeping bag is just...so...soft...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG!!BANG!!BANG!!BANG!!<br>\r\nA massive noise fills the air. You scream in wordless panic and try to leap to your feet, but become entangled in your sleeping bag, with the result being that you roll sideways instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAH!\" You scream as you go plummeting over the edge of the nightstand. You fall for barely a second, however, before you impact on Melanie's outstretched paw. You stare up at the ceiling for a few moments, far up in the sky and painted white, before a rumbling sound makes you turn your head. You look up the orange black ribbon of fur that is Melanie's arm up to her face. She's turned on her side so that her right arm was out to catch you, and now her other paw is covering her mouth, from which loud snickering still succeeds in emerging. It becomes full blown laughter and you stare at her, a dumb expression on your face. The incessant BANGING, unfortunately, continues to sound as you lie on her relatively soft pad. At last she is able to control herself, although amusement still dances in her green eyes. She rolls onto her back, closing her paw around you and keeping her arm straight, so that you are in the stomach-churning position of being held face over her prone body, the long expanse of white blanket illuminated by the morning light streaming in from the window over Melanie's desk. You're still trapped in your sleeping bag, so you're uncomfortably warm from her added body heat as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie's mirth finally seems to fade enough to notice the horrible sound coming from her nightstand. She reaches over and shuts it off somehow. Craning your head around, you see her fiddling with a thin wooden structure rising from her nightstand. <i>That wasn't there last night...</i> You think to yourself. It's a weak thought, however, as most of your attention is being taken up with the effort not to barf. You're being held high up, and the vertiginous feeling this produces is making you nauseous and weak, an effect which is only increased when Melanie's blanket starts rippling as she shrugs it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie.\" You gasp, \"Please put me down.\" Her gaze focuses on you momentarily, and she smirks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Her voice drips with insincerity, \"Sorry about that.\" She turns you so that you're facing up, and then sets you on the nightstand. You scramble out of your sleeping bag, seeing now that the thin slab of wood in fact was a piece of the nightstand, coming up to your shoulders, which had risen silently on hinges, leaving a square section empty. On the surface of the wood you can see the time clearly displayed in ghostly characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie swings herself out of bed so that she's facing the nightstand, paws on the floor. All in all, she cuts a very monolithic figure in the soft morning illumination, white tee shirt rising high into the air above you. You can look out straight into her stomach across her legs. Her tail swishes in the air behind her as she regards you, and it settles across her upper legs, orange on blue, as she starts to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that you needed some perspective.\" She says, clearly referring to trapping you 25 feet in the air over her body. \"So that perhaps next time you get it into your head to 'experiment', you realize how dangerous it can be when you're your size in a place that's...\" she places a paw on her chest \"...my size.\" You can't meet her eyes, so you instead stare fixedly at her tail, cursing your sleep-addled self. The silence stretches for a moment before Melanie breaks it with a cough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your giant feline friend again; having grown more used to her facial expressions; you can tell she's embarrassed. Grinning wryly, she says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's my moralizing speech of the morning. I'm really bad at them, so please stop getting yourself into trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" You promise, \"Sorry about last night. You looked really...\" You search for an adjective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zombieish?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Your acknowledgement is instinctive, and she laughs at the mortification on your face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. There's another reason not to repeat your escapade last night: I'm not at my best when suddenly awakened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were already awake.\" You point out, \"ouch.\" She flicks your arm as you point this out, but she smiles to take away the sting:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but off topic.\" You rub your arm, and then remember her clock, clearly an alarm set by her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this?\" You wave your hand vaguely at the wood. She grins at you unabashed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I planned <i>that</i> last night. You were so funny when it went off, like a startled mouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still on that I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" She nods happily, \"You're still in those awesome red PJs, so the connection is still there in my mind.\" She taps her forehead with one claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" You say, nodding agreeably and circling your own head with your finger. She makes a face when she realizes what you're doing, and stops you with the simple expedient of grabbing you again. She sets you down on her desk, where the panel is still open from last night. She nudges you towards it, and you go reluctantly, dragging your feet. You're not really all that eager to get close to it again. Instead of making you go back down the hole, however, she points something out instead:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you didn't realize this last night, but you probably could\u2019ve gotten out without my help.\" She informs you. You look at her incredulously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? By using my newly discovered power of teleportation?\" She shakes her head, fighting down a smile:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, by doing this.\" She puts you on the very edge of the receptacle, indicating that you should watch. You take a small, surreptitious step backwards as she reaches in and pushes down on the wooden cube in the middle of the space. To your surprise, it depresses down significantly, and the bottom of the space starts rising, whispering up the wood until it's at the level of the desk. You look at it in astonishment, Jaw literally hanging open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like an elevator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only made of wood and a lot smaller. Anyway, press once to go up, again to go down. Careful not to get caught on the rebound as you obviously did last night. Try it out.\" You comply, moving forward and repeating your actions from last night. This time you spring back in time, and the wooden cube rises without hitting you. The square quickly descends back into the receptacle. You marvel at the construction; it's an incredibly smooth ride, even for someone your scale. When it settles back down on the bottom, Melanie's paw appears above the opening, blocking out the light:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out below!\" She calls. You scramble out of the way as something falls from her paw into the receptacle. It turns out to be your bag. \"Changing time.\" She tells you brightly, her face appearing above the opening. Before she can close the panel, however, you call out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, do you have to close that panel?\" The paw stops, and then comes the inevitable comment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, is the little mouse afraid of the dark?\" She asks in a high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you shoot back, \"it's just hard to change with no light.\" Taking her silence for thought, you continue, \"Besides, your privacy is assured even without closing the panel. I can't possibly see you down here.\" After a lengthy pause, the paw retreats. You're rooting through your bag when she brings you up short:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but I know you can use the lift function now. If I hear it moving, you'll be in for it.\" Her warning is somewhat superfluous in your opinion, and you go on changing. At about the same time as you finish, she calls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can come up now.\" Depressing the extended cube is harder than when it was flat, but you manage it by using both palms flat on the wood and bearing down with all your strength and weight. When you reach the top, you see Melanie dressed in jeans and a jacket over another tee-shirt. She examines you and says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I liked the PJ's better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of got that.\" You tell her dryly. You grab your stuff, quite an armful, and she grabs you and heads into the bathroom. You both quickly brush your teeth. Finishing before Melanie once more, you examine yourself in the mirror. You\u2019re tall enough to be visible from the waste up, and while you look slightly rumpled everywhere, your hair is the real problem. You have a serious case of bed head, hair sticking out in all directions. You try vainly to smooth it with a brush, but it\u2019s stubborn. You fail to notice Melanie finishing her brushing and leaning down closer to you, so you are taken completely off guard when she says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, I\u2019ll help you with that.\u201d It\u2019s over almost before it begins, hand shooting out to steady you and her mouth, which is now positioned directly over your head, opening. Her tongue quickly envelops your head, smearing your face with saliva while quickly moistening and flattening your hair. You sputter as she withdraws:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie!\u201d You yell, coughing from saliva in your mouth. Her only response is to stick her tongue out at you. <i>Ah man, now I smell like mint,</i> you think to yourself. You pause, and admit grudgingly, <i>it does look kind of cool this slick</i>. You give her a dirty look as she proffers her palm, however, to show you won\u2019t take this kind of thing lying down. Melanie then heads downstairs, shouldering her massive backpack as if it is nothing (to her, it is).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're on the stairs, you venture a comment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have a lot of panels and hidden stuff in your room...\" Melanie lets the searching comment hang for a moment before giving a reply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well I guess we have more than most people, but I don't really think that it's abnormal...\" This starts a discussion that lasts for quite a while, as you bounce around in her paw as she goes down the stairs, get tossed into the air (again) when Melanie gives her mother a cat equivalent of a peck on the cheek, and then get seated at the kitchen table. While Melanie's mother hovers in the background, giving Melanie eggs and sausage which she then redistributes via claw to you, and cleaning her own dishes, looking every inch the perfect housewife in her apron, you and Melanie continue to discuss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, that type of sliding and hidden technology, which borders on the fantastic for you, is quite commonplace with Anthros, although its popularity waxes and wanes. Melanie has liked it from childhood and gotten as much of her room as possible done up using that kind of thing. You ask her why, and she tells you simply: \"I like the sound.\" You tell her that that type of technology is barely seen with humans, and it's the province of the rich in any case. \"That's too bad.\" Replies Melanie, staring down at you as you clean your plate. The eggs and sausage were very good, and even with Melanie's generous (or rather, gluttonous) slicing you were hungry for more. You look up from this to see Melanie musing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Her face is speculative, \"You know, I've always wanted my room to be entirely sliding. Your guys' stuff is small enough; it might actually be possible for you...\" Her daydream is interrupted by Melanie's father smacking her on the head lightly with a newspaper. You both jump. Neither of you had noticed him coming, despite Melanie's acute hearing and your small size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, please pay more attention to your guest.\" He tells her firmly, she glances at you. Seeing your very mixed feelings about her fantasy written on her face, she shrugs and smiles sheepishly. She looks at the last remaining sausage on the plate, a big link thicker than your arm and as long as your leg. She spears it with one claw, tosses it in the air above her upturned, yawning mouth. She gulps it down, making an audible, sound. This earns her a chuckle from you, but a reproachful look from her mother, although her father looks quietly amused. She stands:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think its time to go.\" She tells you. She picks you up, and for once the experience is somewhat unpleasant. She had cutlery, but still opted to slice the sausage and eggs with her claws, which were now incredibly greasy, enough to make you gag. She doesn't notice, because she's at the time announcing to her parents:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're off to school on....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, we\u2019re off to school on my bike.\u201d Melanie shoulders her backpack as her parents bid her farewell. You barely have time for a quick \u201cThank you for having me, Mrs. Prusten, Mr. Prusten\u201d before she\u2019s out the door and into the hall, with you clinging to her greasy claws. Melanie comes to an abrupt halt, however, when her father calls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie, come back here.\u201d Melanie, caught in the act of going out the front door, jerks to a halt (nearly sending you flying out of her paw). She turns slowly and returns, dragging her feet. She looks apprehensive, although it\u2019s hard to tell, as you\u2019re concentrating on not throwing up. Never before had the height seemed so nauseous. You point to Melanie\u2019s claws, which are bathing you in the smell of rapidly-turning-stale grease, as the culprits. Your head is even starting to throb again, despite the fact that it hadn\u2019t been bothering you all of yesterday. Melanie\u2019s father appeared in the archway into the kitchen. Melanie\u2019s dad is standing in the archway to the kitchen. He gives her a mildly reproving glance, than focuses his attention on you. Melanie lifts you higher, without being prompted, to the level of her face. Even so, you\u2019re still only at shoulder level on the imposing figure in front of you. You\u2019re slightly shaky, and still quite nauseous, but mustering an effort you stand straight. He proffers a claw, and you shake it formally, being careful of the sharp tip. His return shake is meant to be gently, but it\u2019s still enough to nearly lift you off your feet. He clears his throat:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell John, it was nice to meet you, the first human in an anthro school. Please feel free to come over again any time you\u2019d like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d You echo his grave tone, conscious of his and Melanie\u2019s eyes on you. Mr. Prusten stares at you gravely for a moment, than a smile quirks across his face, making his whiskers twitch. Leaning forward, with one paw covering the side of his mouth and his face filling your vision, he faux whispers:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd try to keep her,\u201d He jerks a thumb in Melanie\u2019s direction, \u201cout of trouble.\u201d The graveness in his voice is gone, replaced by humor. You reply solemnly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, sir.\u201d He looks at his daughter dubiously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just hope your best is enough.\u201d Melanie breaks in:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAD!\u201d Her voice rises to a high pitch, and you\u2019re sure that under her fur she\u2019s blushing. She whirls to go out the door (forcing you to cling to her stench-ridden claws), but is brought up short by her dad:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t I get a hug?\u201d Melanie pauses, and you see a strange expression cross her face. She carefully sets you down on a conveniently-placed table. She then whirls and hugs her dad fiercely. You wait for a few moments, and you notice him saying something into her ear. You don\u2019t catch it however, and they break apart. The next few moments are a blur of motion that you can only reconstruct after she finishes. As far as you can tell, Melanie had given her dad a peck on the cheek, turned, and ran out the door, grabbing you in passing. You have a vague impression of being slammed into her oncoming pad, and as you come to your senses you find yourself face down on her pad. You find you\u2019re nose buried in a coat of grease, and your nausea, which had been fading, returns full force, with the result that you find yourself unable to stand for several moments, When you recover enough to move, you see that Melanie is preoccupied, the paw holding you held safely off to one side as she deftly wrestles with her bike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bike itself is blue, and looks a lot like a human bike, except that the seat is oddly shaped, much narrower with a high area in the back, and the coverings on the handlebars are made of some fuzzy material instead of rubber. What really catches your eye, though is the basket attached in front of the handlebars. It is a large whicker basket, of a type which hadn\u2019t existed in human lands for over thirty years. From the glare that she shoots you after she sees the object of your weak snickering, its clear that the same is true about anthro styles as well:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a perfectly nice basket.\u201d She tells you defensively. You just laugh, and she looks frustrated, \u201cFine, be that way\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a sore spot.\u201d You croak. She looks annoyed for a moment, but then she notices your debilitated state. She pauses in her struggling with the bike, which is caught on a bush, looking concerned. She cups her hands to better examine you, but this simply doubles the concentration of stale grease sent in the air, eliciting a groan from you. She begins to look alarmed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie I\u2026\u201d you pause as she brings you closer to your face, your stomach reacting to being suddenly jerked ten feet farther into the air, \u201cI feel sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSick? Is it your head? Do you need to see a doctor?\u201d She sounds like she\u2019s close to panicking, her stream of babble coming at a fast rate, \u201cAn anthro doctor? I don\u2019t know any human doctors\u2026 A small animal doctor?\u201d Stung a bit by even her unthinking reference to a vet, you muster the strength to hold up your hand, forestalling her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie, just put me down somewhere.\u201d She complies immediately and gently, carefully moving to her bike, which is upright, if still entangled, and placing you in the basket. You sit for a moment, eyes closed, breathing heavily. After a little while, your stomach decides to remove itself from your throat and return to its normal position, and you open your eyes. You observe dispassionately the uniform, slightly rolling appearance of the area around you, the brown floor abruptly ending in the equally brown wall, undulating its way up on all four sides, shading the entirety of the bottom of the basket. You slowly become aware of a large shadow blocking out the moderate amount of light entering the basket. You wave at it, and Melanie nods, worry still written plain on her face, which fills about half of the visible sky:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d You consider the question for a moment, mind still operating a bit slowly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Melanie nods, relieved. After a moment\u2019s pause, she asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat brought that on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour paws.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy paws?\u201d She asks, baffled, bringing one of the offending appendages into view and looking at it front and back. You wave at her to get her attention again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they\u2019re covered with grease. It stinks to high heaven, which was bad enough, but it seemed to interact with my semi-concussion from the door yesterday. It made me feel really, really sick. You\u2026\u201d You pause to grunt as you heave yourself into a more upright position against the basket wall, \u201cYou might want to give a bit more consideration about what is on your paws when you\u2019re going to be picking someone up.\u201d You deliver the last remark in gently reproving tone, both because you don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings and because you can\u2019t seem to get up the energy to yell at her at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie had listened to you with guilt playing across her face, actually wincing (which, interestingly enough, made the field of fur covering her cheeks and chin stand slightly on end) when you told her about your head. Now she looks at her paws as if she\u2019d like nothing better than to chew them off. Slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m <i>really</i> sorry.\u201d She tells you, voice close to cracking.  Unable to think of anything to do help you, she instead begins to lick her paw, aggressively and with great force, as if she was using the act of cleaning her paw as a substitute for penitent self-flagellation. An idle thought crosses your mind, like a drunk staggering across a sidewalk, as she performs the strange feline drying process with equal vigor: <i>That tongue could probably take off my skin if she licked me that hard</i>. When she finishes, a guilty pause ensues as she searches for something to say. Then:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, why didn\u2019t you say anything sooner, like when I picked you up? You might\u2019ve gotten really sick\u2026\u201d She trails off. Drained you may be, but for this statement you muster the effort to lift your head and stare straight at her incredulously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents would have heard.\u201d You tell her simply, the statement, in your mind at least, sufficient to explain all. When this is greeted with a look of blank incomprehension, however, you explain it to her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf your parents had heard, you could\u2019ve gotten into trouble. Big trouble, considering all the craziness about the whole \u2018first human injured thing.\u2019 Definitely not worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you must have been in pain\u2026\u201d You interrupt her weak objections:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriends don\u2019t get friends in trouble with their parents, or with their teachers, or the principal. Period. That\u2019s what friendship is.\u201d She is silent for a moment, and you close your eyes in the face of another nausea attack. Over and above the waves of cramps affecting your stomach, you hear Melanie say quietly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d A warm, living weight covers you, fur brushing softly across the skin of your face and arms. You blissfully allow the warmth of Melanie\u2019s body heat to wash over you, too proud to refuse, especially as it soothes your muscle cramps. You continue like this for an indefinite, although probably short, period of time, but eventually a pressing concern pries its way into your mind. Opening your eyes, your field of vision is blocked by a fateful of soft fur. It tickles your eyes, and you reach forward, pushing her hand away. She quickly withdraws, and you look up at her, her face farther away and in a different position. She\u2019s got her chin resting on an arm draped across the right (her left) handlebar.  She puts her other arm on top and leans on them both, continuing to look at you with an expression which, now that you\u2019re recovered, makes you uncomfortable. You push the thought you had out into the open:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie, don\u2019t we need to get to school?\u201d You ask her. She nods reluctantly. \u201cWell then, let\u2019s go.\u201d Her expression changes to one of extreme reluctance, and she begins stammering a few worried exclamations about your health. You interrupt her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie, I\u2019m fine.\u201d You hate being treated like a handicapped invalid by your giant4 friend, to whom you must already appear considerably handicapped, for obvious reasons. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late, so let\u2019s get moving!\u201d You say the last with what you hope is a commanding snap to your voice, which is sufficient to get her moving. She disappears from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour claim that you are fine is slightly untrue, as evinced by the stab of nausea as your world is rocked when Melanie, with a grunt of effort, finally heaves the bike out of the entangling bushes. Your world goes green for a moment, and it takes a while for you to recover. Thankfully, however, Melanie was to busy to notice the first reaction, so you safely sit in the basket recovering while she pedals on her way to school. The sides of the basket are by no means impermeable, and the constant stream of fresh, cool air blowing across your body is quite helpful in your recuperation. When you recover once more, for good this time, you think, you work your way to your feet and cling to the tightly intertwined straw, trying to get used to the odd motion of being a passenger on a massive bicycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The motion is smooth at the times when you think Melanie is coasting or pedaling straight, with a slight, even roll. The yaw produced from Melanie\u2019s minute adjustments to the handlebars, which of course the basket is attached to. Things get bumpy, however, whenever Melanie reaches an uneven section of ground, and things are really weird when Melanie hits a turn. She\u2019s apparently fond of leaning into her turns, which means that you are unwillingly sent stumbling across the basket to slam into the other side as the bike becomes more and more horizontal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bike levels out again, you feel up to trying to engage in conversation with Melanie. You let go of the wall, stagger a moment as you regain your equilibrium, and move to the side directly across from Melanie. Looking up, you see Melanie\u2019s head floating in the air above the rim of the basket. Her fur, ear and whiskers are all blown back a little, making her look a trifle odd. She\u2019s focusing on the road ahead of her, looking far past and above the basket, but you had noticed before every so often she looks down into the basket. When she next does this, you wave at her. She smiles at you, then straightens her head again while saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there john. I take it you\u2019re out of your coma?\u201d She asks lightly. You nod. She declines her head to look at you very rarely while she speaks, but since her eyes flick down towards you intermittently, or not, when you\u2019re talking you can tell when she\u2019s listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, I\u2019m all better.\u201d You have to yell, but not with extreme force do to her sharp ears, in order to be heard. For Melanie\u2019s part, her words are oddly muffled, but she\u2019s also understandable.<i>And she doesn\u2019t even have to yell,</i> you think to yourself a bit sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Hang on a second\u2026\u201d As she says these words the basket and bicycle start to wobble significantly. Well, significantly to Melanie, which means you\u2019re sent teetering to and froe across the basket, crashing into the walls. You momentarily stumble into Melanie\u2019s paw, which was in the basket for some reason. She rights you before she withdraws, and when the world stops spinning you call up to her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMELANIE!\u201d You yell up at her in exasperation. She just grins and nods into the basket. Looking around, you see your bag and backpack, battered and a trifle deformed but otherwise fine. You feel a little heat on your cheeks: \u201cOh. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Problem.\u201d She replies graciously, not looking down, with only a hint of a smile on her face. You recover your bags and wedge them safely in a corner, and as you do so a niggling little detail that had been bothering you in the back of your mind suddenly resolves itself into clarity:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie,\u201d You call up to your giant, bare-headed friend, \u201cwhere\u2019s your helmet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d She replies casually,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, shouldn\u2019t you be wearing one? Aren\u2019t there helmet laws?\u201d You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we Anthros don\u2019t have helmet laws.\u201d She tells you, taking the bike into a slow curve. You adjust your balance and continue:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should still be wearing one. It\u2019s safer. If you crashed, you might crack your skull.\u201d She lets the comment hang for a moment before replying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I find them uncomfortable, especially on my ears. I\u2019m a good rider. Besides,\u201d She declines her entire head to look at you for a second, \u201cYou worry too much. It would take a lot more force to break my head than yours, don\u2019t you think?\u201d She lifts her head again. The last part was said in a tone that sounds very much like amused, gentle condescension, which seriously annoys you. Before you can argue further, however, or even get in a comeback centered on stubbornness, Melanie announces brightly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are.\u201d A massive sliding sound fills the air as Melanie applies her back, and you have to hang onto the wall tightly to resist the force of deceleration. The bike bumps to a stop, you feel Melanie engage the kickstand and get off the bike, leaving the floor at a moderate angle, and as you gather up your stuff you catch a glimpse of Melanie wrapping a high-voltage-line think lock around her wheel and a bike rack through the weaving. You shoulder your backpack and grab your bag, then carefully step onto Melanie\u2019s proffered paw. As she heads up the steps to the school, which are scarcely populated with a variety Anthros, she tells you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my-sorry our- first class is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Our first class is geometry.\" Melanie repeats, as if she's not totally sure that she's right. She collects herself, \"Yeah. Definitely geometry.\" She nods and reaches for the handle to the door- with the paw you're in! As she turns her paw, with the pad becoming more and more vertical, you look around wildly, close to panicking. Thankfully, you think fast for once (\u2018cause Melanie clearly is not). You run up the pad before it becomes too vertical and you fall off. You scramble onto the side of her paw, pulling hard on the thing fur covering the webbing between her foreclaw and thumb. You're just in time to; even as you swing your feet up so you're lying with you're body stretched out along her forefinger and she flinches from your abuse of her fur, nearly causing you to fall, the massive metal bar of the door handle thunks into her waiting pad. It's really cold; your right arm gets goosebumps from being in such close proximity. You're just glad it, and you, weren't crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie pulls open the door by reflex and walks through, while you hang on with all your might. She doesn't seem to notice at first, but after she brings her arm around in front of her again she absentmindedly lays her left paw on her right to rub away the pain. The result is that she grinds you into this very bony part of her paw, making it almost impossible to breathe, while at the same time she crumples the cloth of your clothes and stretches your skin and hair. The combination of the pressure on the back of your body and the hard surface beneath you is very uncomfortable, almost painful. With a growl you release your right arm's grip on her thumb, lean over into a precarious position and punch up into her pad with all your strength between one rub and the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" She says. <i>That hurt?</i> You think to yourself in disbelief, <i>It was like punching a stack of mattresses!</i>. She stops, removes her paw and lifts you towards her face, leaning against a wall. The sight that is revealed, you clinging grimly to the side of her paw, legs wrapped around her foreclaw and arms wrapped around her thumb, trying to keep from falling from one side or another (your body is wider than the side of her paw) is enough to make her blink. Once. Twice. Then:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" She can't seem to think of anything else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, \u2018oops'.\" You confirm. She's got a look of blank stupidity on her face, so you prod her along; \"If you wouldn't mind...\" you gesture towards yourself with your left hand and nearly fall off for your trouble. Her face fills with comprehension, and consternation, and she hastens to help you, doing so by closing her fist. You first hastily pull down your shirt, which her rubbing had pushed halfway up your back, and then you gratefully heave yourself up and sit cross-legged on the circle formed by her thumb and foreclaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie again is at a loss for words, and clearly to give her some time to think she suggests that she continue on to your first class. You agree, and she pushes off the wall, heading down the hallway. She keeps the paw you're on close to her chest. The experience is vastly different from yesterday's; instead of scrambling around under a vast number of unaware Anthros, in constant danger of getting stomped and completely ignorant of what it is that's passing above you, you instead sit serenely forty feet above the floor as Melanie does the walking for you. <i>It is,</i> you reflect, <i>a much more pleasant experience.</i> The hallways are strangely depopulated, however; you can see only a few Anthros hanging around outside of doors. All of them look over casually at Melanie, than start staring at you perched on her paw.  One, a lizard Anthro of some kind, even takes a few steps forward, yellow eyes fixed on you, but then he notices Melanie and retreats for some reason. You look up questioningly at Melanie, who shakes her head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know him.\" She finally reaches your first class, which is deserted, and sits down in a desk near the window, in the middle row. Melanie sets her paw down and slowly opens her fist. You uncurl your legs and jump down to the floor through the opening, so that your body up to your lower chest is momentarily encircled in a column of her claws and paw, preventing you from moving off. She quickly releases you, however, and you take a look around as she gets settled. The desk itself is bland, a plain of wood with a dull grey grain running across it in stripes, ending abruptly in empty air on three sides, empty for twenty feet before, inevitably, it runs into another desk. All the way at the front of the classroom, half a football field away, you can see a desk, and the blank blackboard, stretching across the length of the room. All around the room are hung maps of all sorts, as well as posters showing renderings of various land features. Even the smallest of these is the same height as your house, and the largest could be posted to the front of a six-story block sided office building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with a number of globes, which stood on various flat surfaces, and some full and half cabinets, this is what makes up this room, and probably every room in the school, although undoubtedly there are variations based on subject matter. The element needed to complete this picture, the 25 or so Anthros (and, as of yesterday, 1 human) that are supposed to populate the room, is strangely missing. Except, suspiciously, for you and Melanie. You turn around and cross your arms over your chest. Melanie has just finished sitting down, a procedure which seemed to require an inordinate number of loud bangs, thumps and squeals, which you had determined not to react to. You accomplished this, although the scrape of her scraping her chair out nearly made you jump out of your skin. <i>She's watching me. If I jump, it might give her ideas.</i> When you finally turn around, you see that she is indeed watching you. The desk edge comes up to the bottom of her rib cage, and you follow the expanse of her shirt all the way up to her face. It takes longer than usual, as she's sitting straight backed, as if rigidly at attention, with her two paws laid nervously flat on the wood. Your lips quirk in amusement:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You afraid I'm going to arrest you?\" You ask her archly. She blinks, looks down, and relaxes somewhat, leaning forward a bit and resting her upper arms on the table, paws turned sideways. You back up to try a better angle on Melanie's face, but even if you backed off the edge of the desk you still would have to crane your head significantly in order to hold conversation. She clears her throat nervously and begins to speak:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, John, about earlier...\" You watch her squirm expressionlessly. Inside, you want to let her off, but you know that she needs to apologize, for a multitude of very good reasons. She continues, looking at anything but you (which is fairly easy for her to do), \"Well, earlier and the time before.\" She's very flustered, but at last she manages to get it out, \"I'm so sorry. I might've killed you...\" She looks ready to go on, but you forestall her with a hand:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted Melanie.\" You smile at her and say: \"Just remember to watch out for who's in your paw next time, Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\" She nods vigorously, and begins to babble about how she would never, ever do it again. Again, you cut her off gently:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine it must be really weird, having me around and having to watch your step all the time,\" You say the last a bit wryly and she giggles briefly, before she recalls herself and simply nods, \"and I <i>know</i> it's weird being around a big hulk like you, trying not to get squashed. We've both screwed up, and we'll screw up again. The key is just to learn from our mistakes and not repeat them. Okay?\" You're not as calm and unoffended as your words suggest, but you'd realized as Melanie walked that it would be better to act, and try to be, so. The calculating part of your mind didn't want to piss Melanie off, for one thing, but more importantly the rest of your mind didn't want to savage her feelings. Besides, you still feel a bit guilty about last night. Melanie looks moved by your words, and after contemplating them for a while, she says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow John, you can be pretty wise...\" She pauses for a moment to let the seriousness of her words sink in, but then she lightens her tone, \"...that is, when you're not too busy being dumb.\" She grins merrily and tweaks you with a claw. \"Who do you think you're calling a hulk, tiny?\" You pretend to consider for a moment, than grin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\" You inform her, at which point she promptly, and mercilessly, noogies you with the knuckle of one claw rubbing into the top of your head. You attempt to protect yourself with your hands, and surprisingly enough you succeed, forcing her claw away from your head and extracting yourself from the immediate reach of her paw. This, however, is due to the fact that you were only fighting her finger muscle. If she'd been using her arm or even her wrist muscle she could've easily overpowered you, but she would also have crushed you instantaneously. She doesn't pursue and both your laughter subsides. After rearranging your much-abused hair, you ask the real burning question in your mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, where's everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're just a <i>tad</i> early.\" She replies. You look at her suspiciously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how early is a <i>tad</i>?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, about forty minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty MINUTES!\" You exclaim, \"You told me we were going to be LATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that,\" she points out smugly, \"you did. I just kind of... went along with it.\" You change tacks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, exactly, did you feel it was necessary that we get here forty minutes early?\" You demand. You're still put out about the way she had tricked you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I usually like to get to school early, and today I thought we needed some time to get, you know, situated.\" She has a very reasonable tone to her voice, but you're still miffed. You acquiesce, however, seeing that this conversation can't go anywhere. To pass the time, as both of you are getting bored rapidly, you propose playing Rock-Paper-Scissors. When you discover that she doesn't know the game, you immediately insist that she learn. She picks it up quickly and you're both soon shouting \"Rock Paper Scissors Shoot!\" at each other. Well, you're shouting. She just needs to raise her voice slightly to surround you with noise. You win handily for quite a while, as she doesn't seem to realize that she's fallen into a pattern. This makes her quite frustrated, and she accuses you of using your \"tiny little hand\" to fudge the results. You don't take much offense; as you'd won five of the last seven rounds and you go on to win two more. After this, however, Melanie starts slamming her first down on the desk before shooting, instead of on her paw. It was unnerving enough to have those two walls of flesh slam into each other right above your head, but this shakes the desk. You bare with it for a while, but when a particularly violent smash knocks you over onto your back you relent:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Melanie,\" you call up to the large, frustrated feline face hovering above you, \"I keep winning because I predict your moves, because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She interrupts, comprehension dancing across her face \"I know! I keep getting into a pattern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" You affirm. Melanie helps you to your feet with a claw, and you continue, more amiably now that Melanie has started winning more often. In fact, she quickly starts threatening your lead. At one point, after one of your victories, you agree to take a pause. Looking at her paw, out flat in a long paper position and resting close above the table, you have an idea. You walk over to her paw, feeling Melanie's eyes following you. It's about at eye level, a furry platform close to your face. You smile up a Melanie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Melanie, why do Scissors beat Paper?\" You ask her. She smiles, going along:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why John?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Scissors Cut Paper!\" You yell the last gleefully and attack her \"paper\" with your \"scissors\", thrusting your hand forward to try and \"cut\" her paw. Of course, you have no hope of fitting the massive girth of her pad between your fingers, but you manage to enclose a thick swath of fur and skin and squeeze. Melanie laughs at your antics, especially as you start with your left hand, both hands now hanging on to her paw. It could've have been more than a barrel noticeable pinch for her. Eventually your laughter subsides and with a wicked gleam in her eye she proposes another round. \"Rock Paper Scissors Shoot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" you cry, staring in dismay at her paper to your rock, \"You've outthought me!\" She nods, a satisfied look on her face, than asks...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey John, why does Paper beat Rock?\u201d You gulp, seeing the trap, but you can\u2019t see any way out of this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy Melanie?\u201d You ask, trying to back away slowly without her noticing. No such luck, and besides there\u2019s no place to go. She holds her open paw up above you, blocking out the light, and says gleefully:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause Paper covers Rock.\u201d Her paw comes down, covering you and bearing you to the ground. You hear her laughing and start laughing to, flat on you back covered by her paw. She leaves you in darkness for a while, restrained gently by her paw, but eventually you both stop laughing and she lets you up. By mutual, silent agreement, you stop (you won, but only by a few rounds). You both just lounge, you leaning back against Melanie\u2019s forearm, hands behind your head, and Melanie resting her chin on her other paw, eyes far away. You rest uxoriously for a while against Melanie\u2019s fur {you\u2019re becoming quickly becoming used to using Melanie as a piece of furniture), while Melanie daydreams. Before either of you can get bored, a new distraction arrives: The teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe (at least you think it\u2019s a he; the deep pitch of his voice which you hear later seems to confirm this assumption) is a Zebra Anthro. He walks in when you have your back turned; you don\u2019t even notice until Melanie gives a start and sits up straighter, removing her arm and unceremoniously dumping you on your back. You glare at her, and she nods towards the front of the room. You see the titanic, white black figure putting a briefcase down on his desk. You quickly get to your feet and try to look attentive. You and Melanie struggle to hold your respective attentive positions without cracking up, but it\u2019s difficult: He trips no less than three times and somehow ends up facing a cabinet instead of his desk. Melanie lets loose one giggle, but maintains her composure. The teacher does make it to his desk, and after setting down his briefcase (thankfully without mishap), he glances around the room and spots Melanie. He starts to come over, then, with a bit of squinting, spots you. Now that he\u2019s closer, you think for a moment he\u2019s naked, as undulating white and black stripes go all the way up and down his body. You realize he\u2019s wearing a zebra-colored shirt and pants, nearly indistinguishable from his clothes. <i>Weird</i> you think. He looks down at you, and then Melanie. He clears his throat:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Prusten I presume, Mr\u2026\u201d He stops for a moment, befuddled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn.\u201d You supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. John.\u201d He nods to himself. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m Mr. Grekela. I hope you\u2019re accommodated sufficiently for your, uh\u2026 condition.\u201d While he had been talking you had moved to the side and turned, so you could see both of them, perfectly positioning you to notice Melanie\u2019s wince at the awkward word choice. <i>Very satisfying</i> you think to yourself. Your own polite \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d is interrupted by Melanie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there is a distinct lack of a chair or desk for John.\u201d She says in a chilly voice. You smile inside; the teacher is as impervious to this as he is to running into hard objects, but it\u2019s the thought that counts. You try to again to get in a pleasantry about being fine, but they talk, literally, over you. The circular, uncomfortable conversation which ensues, centering mainly around the fact that neither Melanie nor Mr. Grekela knows where to find any school furniture your size, thankfully comes to a quick end when another student, an Anthro Hawk, walks in and takes a seat somewhere else. Mr. Grekela returns to the front. Without taking her eyes of Mr. Grekela\u2019s retreating back, she asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo John, what is your last name?\u201d She focuses on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 That would be telling, wouldn\u2019t it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>John!</i>\u201d She cries, her voice hitting an unusually high note. You just laugh. Further outrage on her part is curtailed by the arrival of a whole bunch of students, a mixed group of Anthros. They all take a seat on the other side of the classroom, talking amongst themselves. As more and more students walks in Melanie inspects them one by one as if looking for someone; a friend, you bet. She doesn\u2019t find anyone, however, and finally the last seats near Melanie fill with more giant students as the bell rings. You take an instant dislike to the bell: it somehow manages to be annoyingly high pitched and grindingly deep at the same time, and loud enough to shake some of the glass on the window. You see the entire class give a simultaneous wince at the noise. Mr. Grekela stands to address the class:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my name is Mr. Grekela. This is Geography.\u201d As he talks, he paces back and forth in front of the class, all of his earlier clumsiness forgotten, \u201cBy the time you have finished this class you <u>will</u> have learned so much more than nations and cities.\u201d He picks a globe up off the desk and holds it in front of him. You can\u2019t make out much detail, \u201cYou will have learned map and globe reading, population densities, population distributions geographical features of all kinds, the basics of pre-GPS navigation\u2026\u201d He continues on, pacing back and forth, gesticulating with the globe, and often pointing it towards specific students as if he was trying to drive the point home with the fifteen-foot diameter globe as a hammer. It grows quite difficult to watch:  he\u2019s so big it\u2019s like watching a hillside on the move, and as the white and black pictures undulate up and down, up and down, you find it hard to think\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie nudges you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn.\u201d She hisses, and then blocks your view with a paw:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d You say stupidly. She gives you a sympathetic look and waits for you to regain your wits. When she sees you can think coherently again, she says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZebras definitely should not wear color match clothing.\u201d She informs you. She hides a grin and points. Turning, you see that half the class have dazed expressions on their faces (or beaks, or muzzles), sitting inertly in their chairs. Following the line of her claw, you see that a bird of some kind has its head on its talons. Even as you watch, it slips free and is startled momentarily into wakefulness before its eyes glaze over. You and Melanie laugh, but then the class is suddenly woken up by Mr. Grekela dropping the globe onto the desk with a massive thud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, to start with the most basic of geographical divisions we shall consider the obvious; that is, the geographical placement of Human and Anthro areas.\u201d The entire class sits up and starts looking interested, with many a speculative glance in your direction. A few from neighboring desks look interested in whispering, but then Mr. Grekela suddenly snaps:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of you, get out paper. Take notes.\u201d The class gives a groan but complies. You move to the front of the desk as Melanie sets a massive sheet of paper, more like a lawn covering really, down on the desk in front of her and sets a pen to it. As noted earlier, you don\u2019t have a desk, so you decide to lie down on your stomach on the desk and set your own, small piece of paper down in front of you. It\u2019s not the ideal position, but sans a desk and chair it\u2019ll have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you learn is actually quite interesting and far more comprehensible now that Mr. Grekela has, blessedly, stopped moving. With the aid of maps at the front, he explains that most human nations, or enclaves as he often refers to them, are located \u201cbehind\u201d the ancestral lands of one or another particular type (species? race?) of Anthro. Furthermore, in the past they were all separated by significant natural boundaries. He refers specifically to one particular place where a river so wide that it stretches to the horizon for both Human and anthro, very deep and having an incredible strong current. However, strangely enough he doesn\u2019t refer to the past boundary of your own nation before your ancestors had pushed beyond it in the last half-century. <i>Weird</i> you think to yourself as he drones on. <i>The mountains are only 70 miles, 7 for an Anthro, from my house, which can\u2019t be more than 220 miles from here.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re distracted momentarily by the arrival of a globe, which the class has been passing around. Melanie sets the stand down on the desk with a clunk. The fifteen foot diameter globe looks to you like it belongs in a planetarium rather than in a classroom, especially when Melanie gives it an idle spin and the countries and oceans move at a moderate speed across your vision. You wait for it to slow down a trifle, than reach out with both hands to try and stop it. You manage it, straining you muscles against the movement. When it does, you laboriously push against nations and oceans indiscriminately turning the globe slowly until you get to a satellite\u2019s view of the area in which you live. You can see Felinton, located on the border of Striland and your own country, which is actually a third the size of Striland. Proving Mr. Grekela\u2019s statement, it does indeed border only Striland, being located on a triangular peninsula. Weirdly, however, your nation is colored exactly the same as all the other human lands, a dull white, and there is very little detail besides the borders, not even the capitol city or the name! Considering the intricate detail of all the Anthro nations, enough that it looks like either someone your size or an OCD person with <i>way</i> two much time on there hands made it, the lack is glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie lifts the globe away and you return your attention to the teacher:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere have been, of course, a few exceptions to this rule,\u201d He continues, pulling out another map, historical, and pointing to thins strips of white surrounded by color, \u201cAs you probably know, however, most of them are gone, under\u2026 difficult circumstances.\u201d <i>I\u2019ll say</i> you think to yourself. Your teachers in elementary school had given long and grisly lectures on the subject- those were really some of the few times that Anthros ever figured significantly in your earlier education. One of the most recent incidents happened relatively close to here, actually. A few hundred years ago, there was a strip of human land that ran up the length of the coast of Striland to another human nation to he north. A bunch of Anthros, tigers, showed up one day, built a castle (they still had castles back then) and claimed lordship over the entire region. Things didn\u2019t end well for the human population. You\u2019re surprised that he doesn\u2019t mention it, or really any details of any of this negative interaction. He just moves on to continents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dutifully take notes for the rest of class, mostly on continents, which you already know (your knowledge is in the context of humans instead of Anthros, however). At last, the bell rings, and the class gives a sigh of relief. Everyone starts reaching down to grab their backpacks and put away their notes, and you stand up to do the same. Just as you\u2019d feared, there\u2019s a massive cramp in your neck from the awkward position and you groan, massaging the back of your neck. Melanie spares a moment to give you a sympathetic glance before zipping up her bag. You put away your stuff and shoulder your backpack, overnight bag in your other hand. The bell rings and the class stands. It\u2019s quite a sight, row after row of giants simultaneously adding another 20 feet to their height, rising into the air effortlessly. <i>It\u2019ll take a while to get used to that sight</i>, you think. To your poorly hidden distress, a group of eager Anthros immediately comes over to congregate around Melanie\u2019s desk. As they surround the desk a variety of \u201coohs\u201d, \u201cahhs\u2019 and other exclamations of delight and wonder issue forth far above your head, with the entire, enormous babble threatening to overwhelm your ears. They loom up around you, and when Melanie stands up to try and deal with them the light is almost completely blotted out. This leaves you standing in the middle of a circle of cloth, fur and scales, rising far into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that this resembles very much a recurring nightmare of yours, especially in the way that it\u2019s very hard to identify the Anthros staring down at you since their faces are cast into shadow, you try to keep your cool. The noise is deafening as they resort to speaking even louder to try and be heard. You can\u2019t here any individual questions or comments, although you can pick up a varying number of tones, mostly curious, a number excited, a minority disapproving. You circle in place slowly, thoroughly disoriented, looking for Melanie as Anthros jostle each other and peer around bodies to get a look at you. You swallow. You want to retreat to Melanie, you can see her trying to get them to calm down, but you know that these are your classmates, and you can\u2019t look like a chicken, or like you need Melanie for everything. You need to get things calm down before the Anthros start getting violent, or before someone wants a \u201ccloser look\u201d and snatches you up, and without running to Melanie. For lack of a better idea, you raise your hand and start waving weakly. This produces some reaction, but in the wrong direction: they start hurling even more questions. Finally, somewhat fed up and more than a little nervous of one shadowy monolithic figure in particular, which has been edging closer, you raise your hands to your lips and bellow:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!! BE QUIET!!\u201d To your complete astonishment, it works. Your voice is audible, if not loud enough to really override their voices, and it cuts through the chatter. They settle down, but now they\u2019re all watching you eagerly, a disconcerting experience when most of the eyes belong to mammalian predators, raptors or reptiles. You must your courage:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, yes I am a human,\u201d (answering the most common question) \u201cand my name is John. Could you please step back? It\u2019s hard to see you all from down here with everyone standing so close.\u201d With some jostling and a few heated exchanges, the mountain of fur and scales move back, like a tidal wave in reverse. You give a sigh of relief: some of them are leaving, now that their curiosity is satisfied. There\u2019s still plenty left, however. Turning, you see Melanie, looking harassed and out of joint, fur and clothing somewhat askew from close proximity. She looks down at you gratefully:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks John.\u201d She mouths. You give her a thumbs-up. But now another anthro, a male\u2026 Iguana? steps forward towards the table again, looking at you eagerly. When he speaks, however, it\u2019s to Melanie, who\u2019s somewhat distracted by trying to recover her backpack:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, he\u2019s so cool. Can I hold him?\u201d As you look on with apprehension and a surge of anger at being talked over, Melanie replies\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him.\u201d Melanie\u2019s chill, practically arctic tone froze the Iguana boy\u2019s hand, which he had eagerly been thrusting towards you. You breathe a sigh of relief and slowly straighten, having crouched in preparation for taking evasive action. His hand is massive, but to you it looks skeletal, long thin fingers covered in scales tipped by a claw, with very large and bulging joints. The only hint of softness is the webbing between his fingers; all in all, it looks quite unpleasant to be grabbed by. His hand slowly withdraws, to your relief, and he looks at Melanie, and then after a while you, in evident confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d His confused objection comes to a halt in the face of Melanie\u2019s glare. He scratches a loose scale on his neck. When he tries to talk again, Melanie forestalls him with a claw and points downward towards where you\u2019re standing looking up at the giant encounter. It\u2019s fascinating to watch the way his face moves in response to his emotions, it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s experiencing a great deal of uncomfortable emotion, but his face lies so far out of the realm of your experience that you can\u2019t really tell. Melanie\u2019s own, once unknown face seems comfortably obvious and mammalian by comparison. You and Melanie wait patiently for a few moments, and eventually he seems to get it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!,\u201d He exclaims, seemingly astonished, \u201cYou mean I should ask the <i>human</i> if I can pick him up!!\u201d Melanie replies seriously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that is the idea.\u201d Her manner is grave, but you can tell that she\u2019s suppressing a grin. He blinks, and looks down at you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I pick you up, uh\u2026\u201d He looks at Melanie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn.\u201d She supplies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026John.\u201d He finishes, looking at you hopefully. You look him square in the face (not hard, really, considering it fills a large portion of the sky):<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you can not pick me up.\u201d You tell him point-blank. His face falls and he starts to turn, looking dejected. You look at Melanie, who\u2019s giving you an ambiguous expression, and raise your voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may, however,\u201d he stops and looks back at you, suddenly hopeful, \u201cset your hand down on the desk, and I\u2019ll get on.\u201d There\u2019s no mistaking the expression on his face, whatever his species: he looks like a kid who\u2019s been denied a treat who just got it back. Eyes wide, he slowly lowers his hand down to the desk, visibly hesitant and shaking slightly, in marked contrast to his earlier eagerness. You consider his hand, resting flat on the desk in front of you, with no little trepidation, considering this giant\u2019s behavior so far, but realizing that you can\u2019t back now and get any respect from your peers, which you desperately need as they\u2019re all 10X your size, you walks over and step onto his hand. You struggle to maintain your balance as he lifts his shaking hand from his desk, his face filling more and more of your vision as you get higher and higher. Finally you reach the level of his chest, looking up at him looking down at you with wonder in his eyes. You let his breath roll over you for a few moments, he\u2019s practically hyperventilating, It doesn\u2019t smell <i>too</i> bad, but it\u2019s still kind of unpleasant. To distract yourself, you introduce yourself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I\u2019m John.\u201d He just gapes at you. With a long suffering sigh, Melanie whispers theatrically:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell him Your name.\u201d He blinks and then gets it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, my name\u2019s\u2026 Brad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Brad.\u201d You tell him politely. He smiles and appears less nervous:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you to. Sorry If I was a bit grabby earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a misunderstanding. Still, you guys need to ask. Only Melanie gets to grab me, and then only when I\u2019m about to get squashed or something.\u201d Brad nods, eyes wide. He can\u2019t seem to stop staring at you. Melanie clears her throat meaningfully:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go; we\u2019re going to be late.\u201d She holds out her paw expectantly. Brad nods, dazed and hands you over. The audience in the background gives a disappointed sigh as you step onto Melanie\u2019s (much softer) pad and she walks out the door. You walk along, well she walks and you just maintain your balance, through the crowded hallways. Melanie\u2019s in a hurry, moving with as much speed as possible through the tight-packed crowd, which is quite a sight, a colorful, towering mass. After you get through the main mass, mostly unnoticed because the relative sizes of you and the dense pack, Melanie finds a secluded niche near your next class and looks down at you with an ambiguous expression. At last, she remarks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I can think of a few occasions when I\u2019ve grabbed you even though you weren\u2019t going to get squashed.\u201d Her tone is speculative. You grin wryly and call up over the noise of the hallway:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust trying to lay down some ground rules. It\u2019s too late for you; you\u2019ve got too many bad habits. The rest of them don\u2019t need to know that, however.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t mind me...\u201d You see a gleam in her eye and move to correct it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, you\u2019re not going to get me that easily. Let\u2019s just say that I deal with it when it\u2019s not too unreasonable.\u201d Melanie chuckles, clearly remembering a few \u2018unreasonable\u2019 moments, and forges a path across the hall into your next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s Math this time, taught by a giant, bespectacled Ostrich anthro. Her body looks normal, but her neck is highly elongated, jutting straight up into the air like a bizarre flagpole. You and Melanie introduce yourselves to Ms. Lizkit politely, with her bending her prodigious neck down nearly double in order to get a closer look at you, adjusting her spectacles to keep them on her face. Aside from the neck, the teacher looks pretty humanoid, differing only in the feathers which cover every exposed area of skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Melanie sit down in the front row, with you lacking a desk once more. `You get less attention this time as the class files in, mainly because Melanie's sitting in front. You're not sure if this is on purpose, but you are grateful. The few of your classmates who do spot you have little time to do anything but gape from afar, as Lizkit begins the class the instant the bell rings (or rather, the instant everyone recovers from said ringing). Mrs. Lizkit begins stalking slowly back and forth in front of the still-dazed class. Her neck is outstretched to its full length. This is so long, in fact, that, from your position on Melanie's desk, it is as if you're looking up at Melanie's or one of your classmates' heads from their feet. It is quite intimidating, even, you sense, to your classmates, for whom it obviously seems far less towering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter surveying the class for a moment, Mrs. Lizkit begins speaking in a very loud, very high pitched voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello class, my name is Mrs. Lizkit, and this is 7th grade Math. If you are not supposed to be here, speak up now. Anyone? Good. Now, I assume you all have your arithmetic?\" The class gives a dazed, collective blink and shakes itself. Before the realization that a response is required sets in, the teacher storms: \"You can all add, subtract, multiply, divide and the like?\" You are first to give your assent, your pitifully feeble shout of assent readily overridden by some groans to the same affect from your classmates, including a tired rumble from Melanie. The teacher's speaking rhythm, as well as her high pitch, makes it very hard to tell when she's asking a question, a fact that you and your classmates will curse later on. She gets angry with students who don't answer promptly, giving them the bite of a harsh tongue, or even very occasionally detentions when she is in a particularly foul mood. At least her voice doesn\u2019t have a soporific effect, like the droning of your previous teacher (although that was somewhat negated for you because his voice was low enough to actually shake your bones), as the keenest of attention is necessary to keep up with the furious pace of the notes Mrs. Lizkit begins drawing on the blackboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" She begins, the high pitched whine of her voice easily audible when she's facing the blackboard, \"our first subject is geometry, and I'll start by teaching you all about the geometry most important to our daily lives, dimension.\" She draws a point, a line, a square and a 'cube' on the board. \"We all live in a four dimensional world, which is defined, as the name implies, by four dimensions, namely length width, depth and time.\" As she lists the first three, she traces the chalk along the lines of the cube, going in a different direction with each dimension. The class is scribbling like mad, copying down from the board as the lesson goes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a giant tiger paw appears beside you, interrupting your own note taking. Melanie sweeps all of our stuff up next to your body, than gently uses the back of her left paw to brush you and it smoothly across the desk to the other side. You're blinded for a moment as your head is enmeshed in soft orange fur. You don't struggle; it would be entirely useless, and besides you're sliding smoothly and painlessly. Even your note paper isn't getting messed up. You end up in the other corner of the desk, bag, backpack and notebooks jumbled in a heap but, more importantly, notes intact. You see Melanie smoothly laying her used note sheet where you were, to her upper right, while swiftly transitioning to a new sheet with barely a pause. Clearly, she has a system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the sapling sized pencil clenched in Melanie's paw move across her bed sheet of paper for a moment before looking back. Melanie, intent on her work, eyes far above screwed up in concentration, never-the-less spares a moment\u2019s glance for you. You raise your eyebrows and look at her quizzically. She shrugs and gives you a wry grin. You roll your eyes and return your attention to the lesson. Mrs. Lizkit has drawn diagonals in the square and cube:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Reiterate,\" <i>Good,</i> you think, drawing what you missed, <i>she's reiterating</i>, \"dimension determines how an object in space can move.\" She points to each line, the straight and the two diagonals, in turn: \"With only one dimension an object can only go right or left. With each added dimension an object can travel in two more directions, so our real world has six directions and infinite combinations thereof. Time, of course, is needed so any of this movement can take place.\" She pauses, and abruptly sets the chalk down, turning to face the class. \"Now, dimension gives direction, but magnitude, the amount of something, is also dependent on dimension. For your lesson on this, let's have a more practical, tangible demonstration.\" She turns towards yours and Melanie's desk with a  strange glimmer in her eye: \"John, Melanie, would you two please come to the front?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispers sweep the classroom as those in back verify that there is no other John in the class and those in front tell them about you. Soon the whole class is looking over each others' shoulders to try and catch a glimpse of you. You and Melanie share a significant, apprehensive glance. This time it's your turn to shrug. Melanie gives you a considering look, than slowly scrapes her chair back and stands. She walks around the desk and pauses next to you, clearly waiting, so you scramble to your feet and hop without a pause over the edge of the desk. You hear gasps all around, and as you straighten up on Melanie\u2019s waiting pad they turn to sighs of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re quickly improving at maintaining you balance on Melanie\u2019s paw, only wobbling slightly as she goes to the front and turns to face the class. You have their undivided attention, rows of giant, multicolored faces all with eyes fixed on you, or Melanie. Mrs. Lizkit begins speaking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClass, this is John and Melanie. John, as you may or may not know, is going to be studying with us this year. Melanie is his partner.\u201d You raise your left hand and wave, Melanie does the same. Mrs. Lizkit leaves you hanging and goes to her desk t o retrieve some items. The instant she sets out the tape measure your heart sinks to the pit of your stomach. You can tell this will not be pleasant. Your human math teachers in elementary school had been fond of measuring their students for lessons as well; it had always been humiliating for anyone so measured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Melanie\u2019s face you see a similar trepidation, but you\u2019re fairly confident that it will be far worse for you, at your size. Mrs. Lizkit starts out with a simple question: \u201cHow much bigger are Anthros than humans?\u201d Everyone\u2019s hands shoots up, she calls on a bear: \u201cMark?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ten times. It varies of course, by species of Anthro and age, gender and genetics of either Anthro or human, of course. Now, John, Melanie, how tall are you?\u201d\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cFive foot two.\u201d You both reply simultaneously, your response barely audible next to Melanie\u2019s reply. You look at each other in surprise:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re as tall as I am?\u201d She asks unthinkingly. You hear a few sniggers from the first row. You theatrically look down at your feet resting on her pad, than lean over the edge of her the edge of her paw, looking first down the two blue columns of her jeans to her paws four stories below, than slowly up her body to her head hovering eight feet above you.<br>\r\n\u201cSure we\u2019re the same height. Whatever you say.\u201d You finally reply in your loudest shout. This earns laughter from the entire class, and you\u2019re sure Melanie\u2019s blushing. You can\u2019t see color in her cheeks under the fur, but the minute movements of the face muscles which accompany it are not so minute in Melanie, and they interrupt the smooth pattern of her fur in a way that is quite obvious for someone your size. Mrs. Lizkit reclaims the class\u2019 attention:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, as you can see there is an obvious disparity here. Let\u2019s resolve it.\u201d She hands Melanie the tape measure. <i>Oh great,</i> you think, hearing Melanie\u2019s jokes about this already. She grabs the metal tab in her teeth and pulls out a length of tape. She sets the tab down next to you and nudges you onto it with her thumb. Your feet leave the ground several times as Melanie brings the measure down; your weight is insufficient to stabilize it. With surprising gentleness Melanie brings the tape measure down until it\u2019s resting lightly on the top of your head. You step off and Melanie hands the measure to Mrs. Lizkit, who announces the verdict to the class: \u201cSix inches and a little.\u201d All your Anthro classmates, even Melanie, give a self-satisfied nod. You struggle to maintain a straight face, but it\u2019s hard. You have always been aware of being small around Melanie, but hearing the cold, hard number mad you truly feel small. Mrs. Lizkit is oblivious; \u201cMelanie, your turn.\u201d She has Melanie stand on the metal tab than slowly pulls it up,. Melanie doesn\u2019t have any trouble holding the tab down, you notice. Mrs. Lizkit carefully measures to the top of Melanie\u2019s ear, than looks at the result:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie, congratulations.\u201d Everyone looks her in confusion. She goes on: \u201cYou are a quite hulking 51 feet 8 inches tall.\u201d Melanie appears quite flabbergasted, and the class seems to be at a loss for words. You straighten a bit, spirits rising. <i>Nice to see that she\u2019s fair with the size humiliation </i>. The paw gives a little shake, Melanie trying to get your attention. Looking up you see her mouth something like <i>Is that true?</i>. She looks troubled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly. She looks at you with dawning comprehension, and perhaps some sympathy:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, this demonstration has shown that while there\u2019s quite a difference between human and Anthro scale, we use the same units of measurement. Therefore, on all papers and test you must indicate the difference like so. She writes \u201cin. A\u201d and \u201cin. h\u201d on the board. You notice that she draws the uppercase A and lowercase h quite emphatically. \u201cNow\u2026\u201d Melanie whispers to you: \u201cShe say\u2019s \u2018now\u2019 a lot. Does she think we need to be reminded that it\u2019s now?\u201d You chuckle and nod in agreement. Back to Mrs. Lizkit: \u201cNow, as our multi scaled measurements have shown, Anthros are ten times taller than humans. But the question was: \u2018how much <u>bigger</u> are Anthros than humans?\u201d Everyone looks at each other in confusion. What is she talking about? \u201cNow, this relates back to dimension. ON this one line, height, the magnitude is ten times. If we were to measure width and depth, undoubtedly those to would be ten times on Melanie. But what about more than one dimension, with area and volume? Area is two dimensional, and reflects the amount that could fit on a surface, while volume is the amount that fits<i>in</i> an object. Now, area is quite difficult to measure on a person. It\u2019s skin of course, but measuring an Anthros entire surface area would be tedious in the extreme, so we\u2019ll skip it.\u201d You hear the last with relief, considering that she omitted humans from the tedium. You are struck with the highly unpleasant image of Melanie forcing you to lie on a paper while she traces your outline with a giant pencil, with everyone crowding around, watching. You shake yourself and return to the teacher. \u201cNow, weight, or mass, is based on both volume, and density, how much matter an object contains and how tightly it\u2019s packed. Melanie, how much do you weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c122 pounds.\u201d She replies, looking embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c124.\u201d Mrs. Lizkit gestures towards something on her desk. As Melanie sets you down on the desk, you see to your disgust that it\u2019s a kitchen stale. You step on without being bid. You begin to turn to glare up at the teacher: \u201cJohn, please keep still.\u201d At that, the class gives a collective snigger. You fume silently, keeping still. At least with your back turned they can\u2019t see the heat burning in you cheeks. At last, the teacher picks you up, literally instead of offering a palm: \u201cA little less than three ounces. Now, does the ten times \u2018rule\u2019 still apply? Jessie.\u201d A deer Anthro:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. That would make a 2 pound 5 foot 2  Anthro.\u201d Everyone laughs, even you. Mrs. Lizkit nods. \u201cQuite, now by cube based volume, the appropriate conversion is ten times ten times ten, one thousand. However, it really is not correct. Does anyone know how much John would weigh under that conversion. Kim\u201d A Panda Anthro:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout 180 pounds.\u201d Her soft spoken reply is repeated by Mrs. Lizkit, who appears to have forgotten about you, still clenched in her fist: \u201c180 pounds, very good.\u201d Now John here is five foot two and clearly not morbidly obese, so this is not accurate.\u201d <i>Not to mention the fact that I told you how much I weigh, to great embarrassment,</i> You think crossly. Mrs. Lizkit turns to start writing on the board. You pound on her fingers just as she\u2019s about to squash you in next to a piece of chalk, and Melanie, who had been following you with her eyes and looking very edgy while you were held by the teacher, quickly steps forward to receive you back in her paw. \u201cNow, the fact of the matter is that humans are somewhat denser than Anthros. While the units of weight are called the same, their values are a result of the human or Anthro populations\u2019 weights. The conversion is therefore somewhat less than one thousand times, six hundred and eighty times to be exact. However,\u201d She turns to suddenly to the class, \u201cThat does not mean that this not a big difference. In fact, to give some perspective on the matter, our 51 foot tall friend Melanie,\u201d She indicates Melanie, who starts squirming behind you, \u201cweighs approximately 40 tons human, the weight of around 43 passenger cars.\u201d The class laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything stops as the bell rings. While the class packs up she bars some instructions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorksheet on arithmetic and textbooks by the door. Due next class.\u201d Released, the class heads out the door, all talking about the demonstration. Melanie hurries to the desk and sets you down. You gather up your stuff and write down what you can of the notes you missed. As you head for the door, Mrs. Lizkit stops you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you, see the principal after lunch. Don\u2019t forget the textbooks or worksheets.\u201d Melanie hurriedly grabs two books and sheets and hurries into the hall, getting while the getting\u2019s good. As Melanie heads across the building towards lunch (your math was previously on the third floor, but the principal had made changes to your and Melanie\u2019s combined schedule, probably because Mrs. Pasca was such a jerk)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what the principal wants.\u201d You remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno\u201d Melanie replies distantly. Something appears to be troubling her. You wait patiently for her to get around to telling you about it. Finally, she fixes you with a somber eye: \u201cFifty one feet, huh.\u201d She says quietly (well, quietly for her). You nod in agreement, keeping quite. She fumbles around some, \u201cI mean,, I realized the size difference before, of course, it\u2019s just hearing it those terms\u2026\u201d She takes a deep breath: \u201cGod, I must be so\u2026\u201d She struggles for the word, \u201c<i>intimidating</i> to you. It\u2019s, it\u2019s.\u201d She doesn\u2019t tell you what it is, instead lapsing into depressed silence. You heave an inward sigh. Melanie has a tendency towards moroseness, you\u2019ve noticed, when confronting these issues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, maybe that\u2019s true, at some times. Certainly not now. But,\u201d You lighten your tone, \u201cIt is true that you can be quite <i>hulk</i>ing at times.\u201d Melanie seems downcast for a moment, but then she catches your reference. She lifts here head, a gleam of mischief in her eye: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s more likely that you simply don\u2019t <i>measure</i> up. It\u2019s okay, you always did seem a little <i>dense</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019d kind of like a passenger car right now. Could you pull one out of that massive gullet of yours for me?\u201d You both laugh, enjoying the banter. <i>Mission accomplished,</i> you think with satisfaction as the conversation turns towards lighter subjects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at the lunchroom doors, Melanie is in excellent spirits, You can hear a sound like being next to 30 trains going by at the same time, the sound of several hundred Anthros talking all at once. Melanie talks loudly over the storm of conversation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready for your first all inclusive lunchroom experience?\u201d She asks you. You ask what she means\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You do indeed, see. The cafeteria is a massive room with a high ceiling, packed to the gills with Anthros sitting around round tables scattered across the room. Large windows and skylights allow in a large amount of natural light, making the entire room seem airy and spacious, despite both the sheer mass of the giant seventh and eighth graders extending in every direction and the unbelievable amount of noise they are making. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie\u2019s arrival goes unnoticed as she slips through the doors, and you notice her taking unobtrusive, at least in her mind, steps to conceal you from view. She gradually cups her paw and raises her claws, creating a bowl which hides most of your body, and lowers her paw so that it\u2019s at the level of her waist, making it less obvious that she\u2019s carrying something valuable. You suppose she doesn\u2019t want to be mobbed by hundreds of Anthros eager to see their first human. She probably knows best, so you take your cue from her, sitting down in her paw with only head visible. She touches you with her thumb in acknowledgement. This does limit your view, however, and mostly you see the furry, feathery or scaly backs of Anthro heads. Your patience is rewarded; however, as when Melanie reaches her destination you arrive unharassed and free to take it all in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets you down and you can\u2019t do anything but gawp. You\u2019ve arrived at a clear area in the middle of the lunchroom, with Anthros surrounding no all sides. The sight of all those giant bodies would be stunning enough, but you also find yourself standing in front of table upon table of food of every shape and description. You\u2019re standing at the tray, silverware, and napkin area for an enormous buffet, set upon a series of close packed tables, all heaped with food with large heating lamps suspended far above from metal structures. The smells surrounding you are intoxicating, and the sight is by turns absorbing and awe inspiring for someone your size. You\u2019re so absorbed, in fact, that eventually the highly amused Melanie settles for the simple expedient of pushing her tray into the back of your legs, causing you to tumble backwards onto her tray with a startled yelp. You land on her napkin, the thought of which gives you a mental double-take, enough that you miss Melanie lifting the tray and heading off for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you might have guessed, she makes a beeline straight for the meat. As she grabs three plates, of a size that you might just barely lie down on, filled with plain, \u201ccooked\u201d meat (just barely seared, really), she teases you gently:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019re impressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I am.\u201d You tell her earnestly, ignoring her humor. You look at the piles of gently steaming flesh in front of her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes your mother know you\u2019re eating like this?\u201d You ask teasingly. She makes a face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha. Besides, some of this is for you.\u201d You consider the meat, imagine taking a human sized potion out of it, then look at her skeptically. She clears her throat:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Anyway</i>,\u201d she pushes forward, \u201cI think I make up for it here.\u201d She nods towards your next destination. Before (and below) you is a table covered with what looks like piles of green glop on those same small plates. There\u2019s a banner above it (and above all the other table, although you didn\u2019t notice.) This one reads: \u201cVVEGETABLES:  Carnivores.\u201d Melanie notices your confusion and explains after setting down the tray: \u201cThere\u2019s something very peculiar about us Anthros. You might\u2019ve noticed it yesterday when I washed you. Here, look in the back.\u201d Paying no mind to your strenuous protests, she grabs you and lifts you to her mouth. She tilts her head back and opens wide, then pulls out her cheek with her spare paw. Her breath isn\u2019t too bad, considering her breakfast, but her fangs are still razor sharp and massive, so it\u2019s with some effort that you look into the slimy cavern. At least her tongue remains where it is, lying like a huge slimy worm at the bottom of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in the back, past the fangs you see four sets of molars, two on each side, which are quite flat, clearly used for grinding. You voice your discovery and Melanie blessedly closes her mouth and sets you down: \u201cIt\u2019s weird, we carnivore Anthros have these molars in back for some reason, from when we evolved from animals to Anthros. We started needing a little green stuff in our diets. We eat this mushy stuff; we don\u2019t have to chew it too much.\u201d She reaches forward, and grabs a plate of a green mass she identifies as spinach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the pile dubiously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate spinach.\u201d You complain. Melanie gives you a firm look:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh uh uh.\u201d She says as she heads towards the seats, \u201cYou\u2019re a human. I know you guys are omnivores. You need this to be healthy even more than I do.\u201d You just sigh and look longingly back at the berries, and the sweets Melanie passed without a glance. You try to put it out of your mind as Melanie weaves her way towards an empty table in a somewhat quieter spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet\u201d Is a relative term, but it means that Melanie doesn\u2019t have to shout to be heard and your own yelling is at least audible. You step off the tray and move a little ways towards the center of the table, away from the danger zone around the meat. You know, intellectually, that even when hungry and confronted with meat Melanie is careful around you, but still\u2026. Melanie doesn\u2019t notice, as she is absorbed in completely annihilating the first of her plates of meat, slicing and dicing it with practiced efficiency with her claws and then scooping great gobs into her mouth. It\u2019s horrifying to watch, especially considering that some of the bigger pieces are just your size and all are dripping, but it\u2019s also fascinating. She uses her claws much like chopsticks, using two or more to hold large chunks of meat without letting it touching her pad before tossing it back. You notice that despite her speed and ferocity, her method is far cleaner than one would think. Meat juices don\u2019t go flying, instead dripping efficiently onto the plate (which, yes, Melanie does lick clean). Her face fur and whiskers remain clean and barely disturbed. If it wasn\u2019t for her speed and gusto, you might even call it civilized, despite no utensils and her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after thoroughly cleaning her plate, she leans back a bit and pays a more attention to you.  Observing that you had backed away to the center of the table, she looks sheepish and beckons you closer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that. I swear it runs in my family: when my mom\u2019s relatives come over, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve all been starving. The younger ones even fight a bit. I\u2019m okay now.\u201d You come forward reluctantly, and keep well clear of her tray. <i>She certainly wasn\u2019t so voracious at home</i> you think. As you come closer to the meat, which is still steaming and juicy, your mouth waters and stomach growls. You are incredibly hungry. Watching someone else eat, even a giant tiger, had increased your appetite. Melanie\u2019s ears twitch:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hungry?\u201d She asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery.\u201d You reply in a shout. She gives a small grin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, that\u2019ll help the spinach go down quicker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMELANIE!\u201d She laughs, but the looks he gives you is serious:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, John. As your Anthro helper, I have to make sure you eat right in your new, unfamiliar environment.\u201d Her tone starts earnest, but ends quite condescending. You puncture her pompousness:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall any such concern when you sat down.\u201d You point out. Her cheek fur fluffs out in a blush. She looks down at her tray, and tries to make nice, pinching off a seemingly small chunk of meat between two claws and nudges you forward, presenting it to you at head level. You look at it for a moment. While it smells and looks appetizing, the effect is ruined by the fact that, however small it might be to Melanie, it\u2019s still the size of your foot, and you\u2019re essentially being asked to eat out of someone\u2019s hand:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie, aren\u2019t you forgetting something.\u201d She looks at you for a moment, than comprehension dawns:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Oops! Sorry.\u201d She quickly removes the meat, staring at it for a moment before hastily tossing it into her mouth. While she swallow, you ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie, you had plates and forks and knives for me at your house. Don\u2019t they have them here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You both are silent for a moment, considering your dilemma. Suddenly, a soft, deep, oriental voice cuts in:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I might be of assistance.\u201d The soft spoken words are gentle, and you turn as a shadow passes over you. You flinch reflexively, seeing a giant paw descending towards you, but you relax as it stops in front of you. A thick, squat paw covered with black and white fur, quite thick, holding a napkin and, to your amazement, a set of human-sized paltes, fork, knife and glass of water. You stare up at her, seeing a tall, thick-set Panda Anthro looking down at you gently. You collect your wits:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d You swear she gives a bow as she sets the napkin down carefully on the table next to Melanie\u2019s tray before setting her own tray down at the enxt seat, seating herself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Kim.\u201d She introduces herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your John and Melanie!\u201d A new, bright voice interjects before any of you can say more. A giant Deer Anthro appears, a girl, slipping her slender form between Melanie and Kim and putting her hands down on the table. She stares almost directly down at you with large, liquid black eyes, wide with fascination and good humor: \u201cI\u2019m Jessie!\u201d She informs you, sticking a platform of a hand, covered in brown fur with five squat fingers, out for you to shake. By her fascination you guess she\u2019s just looking for an excuse to touch you, but you politely shake the tip of her index finger, feeling her smooth brown fur, different from Melanie\u2019s, and warm skin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d She breathes. You see Kim giver a nudge, and Jessie shakes herself: \u201cOh yeah! Hi Melanie.\u201d Melanie grasps her entire hand and shake sit firmly, before using it to steer her and her tray towards the other seat next to her. From your position between Kim and Melanie, looming up on both sides, you can\u2019t really see her. You take hold of the napkin and drag it towards the center of the table, seeing more and more of all three girls as you gain some distance. While this is going on, Kim says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat stuff was at the buffet. I saw that you forgot to take it and decided to help.\u201d Her gentle voice takes on a tinge of irony: \u201cJessie just wanted to touch John.\u201d Melanie chokes on the water she was drinking, and Jessie squeals in protest:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKIM! That\u2019s not fair!\u201d Kim turns her head ponderously and looks at her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jessie pauses:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Maybe a little.\u201d She admits, staring at you raptly with those enormous eyes, \u201cBut that\u2019s not all! I also wanted to meet you, Melanie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Why?\u201d Melanie asks, surprised. Jessie pauses from eating a plateful of some shrub (sugar grass, you discover later) and smiles at you: \u201cTo learn how you got your paws on such a cute human, silly!\u201d Melanie chokes again, and Kim pounds on her back with massive force, shaking the table, then looks at Jessie reproachfully. Jessie just smiles, clearly unabashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind Jessie.\u201d She tells you and Melanie apologetically, \u201cShe really doesn\u2019t know any better. But we were curious. How did you pair up with John?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to know that as well.\u201d The girls\u2019 heads come up and you whirl around at the familiar voice from behind you. There stands Brad, looking hesitant, table between him and Melanie. You smile and wave the massive Iguana over<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Brad, have a seat.\u201d He drags his feet, looking distressed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure. I mean, the way I acted earlier\u2026\u201d You roll your eyes. It\u2019s like he\u2019s just waiting to be rejected:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad, I won\u2019t hat you forever, or at all really, for that little gaff. I\u2019ll only remember it if you keep reminding me! Now,\u201d You swing dramatically and thrust a finger to the seat next to Kim, \u201cPark it!\u201d While this spectacle caused the girls behind you to burst out giggling (reflecting on it later, you have to admit that it was pretty funny, a tiny 6-inch human ordering around a lizard who could bat him around like a rag doll), it has the intended affect, as Brad quickly scurries over besides Kim and sits down. You maintain a dignified silence as the others finish their hilarity, then turn and observe as Brad gets acquainted. They seem to get along well enough, and as equilibrium is restored, each Anthro munching contently on their particular food, you grab Brad\u2019s attention:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Brad, you were saying.\u201d He swallows and nods:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. How did end up here, and with Melanie. I mean, they told us that you\u2019d be studying here in some kind of integration effort, but nothing really specific.\u201d You and Melanie exchange a look, as Jessie and Brad look at you avidly and Kim looks on with interest, if a little more calmly. Melanie shrugs, so you launch into your tale:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it all started in the summer when I was informed I\u2019d be coming to Eastpaw this year\u2026\u201d You and Melanie relate the tale, while they all look on, eating slowly. They were an excellent audience: attentive, interested and they gasped, laughed or hissed at all the right moments. Melanie took a large part of the speaking, after you\u2019d done the first part, cuing you on just what to tell them. Some things she left out, obviously, but you were surprised with how much she included, especially her own screw-ups, about which she was brutally honest. While she was relating how she carried you home from school (during which time you were unconscious) she makes a motion towards you without pausing. When she has your attention at table-level, she crooks a finger slowly and insistently. You sigh, and grab your plates, walking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She gives you a large glob of spinach and a hunk of meat, both more than you can eat, and sends you back to your seat in the center of the table with a firm poke. Well, her message couldn\u2019t be clearer, so you bravely force down some spinach while she watches you discretely from the corner of her eye. After what you judge is enough, you attack the meat, with almost the same level of ferocity as Melanie. After all, you\u2019re a meat eater as well. You leave a lot on the plates, but after Melanie finishes bringing them up to date, with her setting you down on this very table, she leaves them in contemplative silence for a moment to quickly reach over with a paw, grab your plates and toss their contents into her mouth with a single motion. Catching the others\u2019 astonished looks, she smiles:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, one thing that\u2019s nice about John: he\u2019s sure easy to clean up after.\u201d She catches your look: \u201cOoops, sorry John. I should\u2019ve asked. You just looked like your done.\u201d Considering that you\u2019re sitting leaned back on your arms, legs splayed out, it was a reasonable enough assumption, so you let it pass. She explains to the others: \u201cYou see, unless we\u2019re in a situation that requires an Anthro to take charge, we should probably respect John\u2019s dignity and have the good manners to ask.\u201d The others nod in agreement. You detect a large amount of wiggle room for Melanie, and the others, to use in that statement, but at least she got the message across, and believed it herself. You all sit in silence for a moment, mulling things over quietly, adjusting to each other. This gives you inspiration. Getting to your feet, you call out: \u201cI have an idea,\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Why don\u2019t you guys all pass me around?\" You propose. Four sets of giant eyes widen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You serious?\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Cool!\" Come out simultaneously from Brad, Melanie and Jessie respectively. You nod, and Kim, who had been regarding you approvingly, rumbles:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you John. I know it's a big thing, trusting us like this\" Her voice is sincere, and you smile as you reply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm here to learn about, interact with and trust you guys, right? Maybe this will make humans seem a bit more real to you guys as well.\" This brings another chorus of approval from the Anthros. You stand and make your way closer to Jessie, who's positively quivering with excitement. You slow your step a little, nervous at the massive, quivering ball of fur and energy. She notices and looks at you with her enormous, quivering pools of eyes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on John, don't be nervous. Please?\" Her plea is too much for you, and you resume your quick step. Kim observes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget puppydog eyes, they're amateurs compared to Jessie.\" Everyone laughs. Arriving at Jessie\u2019s tray, you look over the detritus of her meal. There are several plates, with various types of large shrubs lying around, neglected in favor of the new entertainment- you. It appears that Deer Anthros do use utensils, as you spot a large fork leaning askew off a plate. Right near you there\u2019s a large (taller than you) glass, with a milk residue coating the sides and bottom. So distracted are you, that you don't even notice as a shadow falls over you until it\u2019s too late. Looking up, you See Jessie\u2019s hand mere feet from your body, fingers extended in full grab position. You're frozen like a deer in the headlights (oh the irony), and you would surely have been snatched up if not for a timely intervention by Brad:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie, hold it!\" Jessie freezes, to your intense relief: \"Don't just grab John. Lay out your hand, and He'll get on.\" He sounds bossy and know-it all, and you and Melanie smother a matched pair of grins. Jessie complies, laying out her brown hand on the tray, and you carefully step up onto the unsteady surface. Unlike Brad, there's little hesitation or trepidation with Jessie. She raises you to head level and gazes at you raptly. She turns her paw this way and that, examining you from every angle. Finally, she brings up her other hand and, after giving you a pleading look and getting a nod in return, gently strokes you, feeling your skin an clothing. You suffer yourself to be thus touched with dignity. While Jessie clearly is loving just about everything about this experience, she is careful and considerate. The feel of her large, warm fingers is actually quite nice. Finally after getting her fill of touching you, she suddenly closes her fingers and momentarily encircles you with warmth. Your trapped, and at her mercy, but you trust her. Melanie is not quite so blithe, however, and draws breath to reprimand Jessie sharply. Jessie lets go quickly, however, and smile at you;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. That was so totally cool. I just couldn't resist.\" She reluctantly hands you off to Melanie. As you step onto the familiar pad, Jessie leans over and addresses the group:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so CUTE!\" Everyone groans at this and you prudently duck as Brad and Kim start throwing balled up napkins and Jessie. After that dies down, Melanie holds you for a moment more, than gives you a smile and a nod and passes you to Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's paw is far larger than Melanie's, with thick, stubby digits tipped with longer claws. Kim takes you calmly, and you survey her, looking up her white/black arm to her stout body, and then up into her gentle face with its small brown nose and black eyes regarding you. You feel her move her arm up and down minutely, taking in your weight, and then you swear she gives you a formal nod. You can't help it: you bow back, from te waist. She gives you one final, apprising glance, and then, to your complete astonishment, a wink. With that, you go to Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s hand is as hard, green and scaly as ever, but now that he\u2019s already had one experience with you he stays calm. His hand is so steady, in fact, that you feel safe walking across his palms and looking down at his tray. He\u2019s a herbivore to, you notice, with bits of flowers and some kind of fruit littering his plates.  Straightening and looking up, you see that while he might not be nervous anymore, he\u2019s still finds you fascinating, his eyes firmly fixed on your movements. You clear your throat:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad enough?\u201d You ask. He blinks, than sighs. You notice that there\u2019s a massive flap of skin under his chin, connecting with his neck, which seems to indicate his emotions. It relaxes from being taut as he nods and carefully sets you down. You hop off his hand and return to your place at the center of the table. You notice Melanie and Kim have their heads together, but you can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying.  You wait patiently, and finally they both straighten and look at you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn.\u201d Kim says, \u201cMe and Melanie were just thinking. You clearly don\u2019t have a lot of experience with Anthros.\u201d You nod, wondering where this is going. \u201cWell, as you\u2019ve no doubt noticed, there are quite  a few differences between us.\u201d Everyone chuckles. \u201cWell, besides the size difference, which you\u2019re clearly handling, there\u2019s also the fact that there are a lot of different kinds of Anthros,  which all evolved from animals similar to the ones you know. But do you know all us Anthros by sight? It\u2019s quite important. It\u2019s considered insulting to get an Anthro race wrong, and some of the more\u2026 hotheaded ones often start fights over mislabeling.\u201d You stammer, at a loss, as the others all nod sagely. \u201cWe might be able to forgive you for a slip-up, but you might not be so lucky with other people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAFs.\u201d Brad mutters darkly, stabbing a flower with excessive force. Kim nods, but doesn\u2019t provide you with an explanation: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, why don\u2019t we have a little test of your knowledge? Let\u2019s start with Brad.\u201d You gather yourself and reply promptly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad\u2019s an iguana.\u201d Melanie cuts in:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good start. What kind of Iguana?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, uh\u2026\u201d You rack your brain and finally offer: \u201cUm\u2026 Scaly Iguana?\u201d Jessie snorts and Melanie gives a sigh of exasperation. Brad rolls his eyes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScaly huh. Hmm. I personally prefer \u2018Green\u2019 Iguana, not to be confused with the \u2018Gray\u2019 Iguana.\u201d You flush in embarrassment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was my next guess.\u201d He laughs. Melanie waves and points to Jessie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessie\u2019s a Deer.\u201d Jessie smiles and shakes her head, \u201cOkay, not just Deer. Um\u2026 Brown Deer.\u201d Jessie giggles:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo silly. Red Deer!\u201d You suddenly notice the slight reddish sheen to her brown fur and mentally kick yourself. Next, Melanie points to herself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTiger.\u201d Melanie nods: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood enough.\u201d You breathe a sigh of relief as she moves o Kim:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPanda.\u201d Kim shakes her head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiant Panda.\u201d You stare. She snorts loudly: \u201cNo, it has nothing to do with me being an Anthro. It\u2019s just to distinguish us from Brown Pandas.\u201d She turns to Melanie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how\u2019d he do?\u201d Melanie pauses than says dramatically:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrum roll please.\u201d Jessie and Brad comply with clear enthusiasm, pounding the table rapidly with their hands. The shaking is so bad that it knocks you off your feet, rattling their own cups to an alarming degree, but they ignore both as Melanie gives her verdict:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNew Human Student John has officially,\u201d She pauses for affect: \u201c\u2026failed First grade.\u201d All four break out laughing at this as you climb back to your feet and regard them sourly. At last, their hilarity ends. Melanie apologizes, mirth still in her voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry John, we just couldn\u2019t resist. We know it\u2019s not your fault, but in elementary school we spend four of six years being constantly quizzed on this kind of thing, and they are brutal. We\u2019ll help you learn in a shorter period, and maybe, if you ask nicely, a bit less brutally.\u201d They all nod in unison <i>I really wish they\u2019d stop doing that</i> you think. Just then the bell, as loud and screeching as ever, rings. Just as loud and screeching is the sound of hundreds of giant chair legs screeching along the floor as their owners scoot back. You stand well clear as Melanie and your new friends gather their belongings, large backpacks impacting the table before being shouldered, trays being grabbed. When they\u2019re all ready, standing with backpacks properly on backs and trays held clear, you walk towards the edge of the table, where they\u2019re all standing around waiting. You Melanie does a little juggling, than turns, presenting her profile. You step off of the edge of the table onto her proffered pad, and you all are off. They all drop their trays off, than join the general stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three huddle around Melanie, shielding you from the overly curious. Kim is particularly effective, walking in front to clear a path, while Jessie and Brad on either side chatter happily about you over your head. You don\u2019t mind. You\u2019re starting to get a hang of this whole Anthro school thing. The group breaks up in the hallway, none of them have the same class as you and Melanie, but they all looked distinctly queasy when Melanie, after consulting her schedule with one hand, with you looking on, announces:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiterature, with Mrs. Gotec.\u201d She looks up; \u201cWhat?\u201d They all shake their heads; expressing their sympathy, then head off. You and Melanie head for the office. On the way, As Melanie carefully forges a path, fending off curious Anthros, you ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo. You never did tell me. What did you mean when you said an \u201call-inclusive\u201d experience.\u201d Melanie smiles as she heads down a side hallway, into less traffic.:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of the way the school system works. There are quite a few different races of Anthro, all with their own special requirements. You see where this is going.\u201d You nod, it\u2019s obvious enough, considering the vast amount and variety of food you saw at lunch:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey take care of each species individual needs.\u201d To your surprise, Melanie shakes her head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, not quite. There\u2019s actually two ways they have of doing things. \u2018All-inclusive\u2019 is like you said, they accommodate everyone carnivores, herbivores, insectivores, whatever. But that\u2019s actually pretty rare. For most things, there\u2019s something else. They change the official name all the time, but we call it \u2018none-inclusive\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone inclusive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. They managed to find a way to set things up so that no one benefits. Like these floors, made of tile, or the school-issued pencils, or just about anything else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d they do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple. They copied the way you humans do it, except on our scale. Since there aren\u2019t any Anthro Monkeys, everyone else suffers, even humans since you\u2019re, well,\u201d she gestures at you, \u201csix inches tall.\u201d You nod:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that would do it.  So, it\u2019s like that with almost everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Only lunch and the bathrooms are all-inclusive. If it weren\u2019t for our parents, even those wouldn\u2019t be- what?\u201d At the word \u201cbathroom\u201d, you suddenly became aware of a very urgent need, and it clearly showed on your face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, Melanie, speaking of bathrooms\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay no more.\u201d It sounds more like a command than an assurance, but Melanie quickly changes directions, and you find yourself at two twin doors. Rather than a human man and woman stick figure, it instead had simply an empty dress and an empty tee-shirt and pants. You suddenly realize that there\u2019s a fairly large problem here. Melanie looks at you apprehensively:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could open that door, could you.\u201d You take one look at the men\u2019s room door and shake your head. It was over one hundred feet high, clearly designed with giraffes in mind. Considering your problem with Melanie\u2019s door, which was only seventy feet high, there\u2019s no way you can budge this one. Besides:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if I did get inside, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get out again. The handle\u2019s too high up.\u201d She nods glumly, and then squares here shoulders:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to come into the Girl\u2019s room then. Don\u2019t you dare say a word about this to anyone.\u201d She warns as she pushes open the door.\u201d Inside it is fairly nice, and unbelievably large, with innumerable sinks and an bewildering number of stalls, all marked with various animal figures. She turns and locks the door, then heads down the stalls, then opens one up and sets you down. Without a word, she pulls the door closed and heads down a few stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is without a doubt one of the most embarrassing situations of your life. You are of course far shorter than the stall walls, and if you choose you could've easily looked left under the stalls. However, you don't, instead keeping your eyes fixed on the throne-toilet, identical to the one at the Prusten's. Thankfully, the end of the toilet paper reached down from on the stall wall, thirty feet over your head, to the floor. You would not have been able to stand it if you had to ask Melanie for help. You do your business quickly, trying to concentrate on the handle to the door, which of course is unlocked. After you finish, you wait for the sound of Melanie\u2019s door opening before you leave the stall. You spot her at one of the sinks, washing visible, tail swishing a few feet above the floor, clearly tense. As you reach her feet she leans down without a word and picks you up. Thankfully, her hands smell only of incredibly powerful soap, which is itself enough to make you gag. You wash your own hands with some she dispenses for you, than leave the bathroom behind with intense relief. She walks quickly through the now-empty halls and arrives at a very official-looking door:: \"MAIN OFFICE\" Melanie regards you for a moment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's never talk about that. Ever.\" You acquiesce and you both silently walk into the office, where...</span></div></div>",

Not only did you tell the suit things, it could answer them and show you things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" you say, taking a step back, \"this is sooo cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Melanie asked, \"what's it doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow its projecting information onto my eyes, the suit was built to help me get around and survive easier here, its supposed to adapt to my needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll look pretty stupid wearing that\" Melanie said, afterall how many people went around wearing space suits to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its more than just a suit\" you reply, concentrating on the rapid transportation, you watch the suit break up into several small parts, all of them having a bit of a glow as they shoot into the air and onto your back. Straps extend from a piece that holds on your back, other pieces stretch down your arms and legs. On your arms, the pieces come to a round thing resting in your palm, on your legs they go down to a pair of jets on the sides and behind your legs. Then, in back a part comes out and wings expand, its a jet pack of some sort. The projection on your eyes flashes for a second and begins to show information important to flight, but with a thought you can make it all dissappear as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Melanie says, it was her turn to be surprised, \"you guys are ingenious little people, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and key the suit to take off, you shoot up and arch onto your back, a backwards flip and a roll leaves you hovering over Melanie's shoulder. \"This thing is definitely cool\" you say, \"I wish you could see all the things it can do, and I haven't even gotten through all the stuff it started to show me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far its a tiny air plane\" Melanie said,sort of upset that  you probably wouldn't need her as much anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a bit more\" you say, \"I'll show you after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe next class\" Melanie replies, heading out the door, you follow her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"where's our next class?\"</span></div></div>",

Not taking the chance of that, you kept airborne and buzzed inside to the gym teacher, well the male teacher; there was one for girls and one for guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\" you called to the teacher, who just so happened to be a lion, \"what'll I be doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, somehow you'll be joining in\" he answered, \"you may not be able to wear any of our uniforms or participate the same as the rest, but somehow you will. Now get out there and wait for further instruction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was blunt, bland, and you really didn't think anyone could've given a more direct order or answer. With a kick backwards you shot yourself out level and into full flight, all of the Anthros in their uniforms were sitting on the Gym floor, legs crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting Melanie you blazed over and landed on her knee for now, it seemed the best place. \"Now what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I've heard, dodge ball\" Melanie answered, then with a giggle, \"maybe it'll be a game of cat and <br>\r\nmouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see\" you answer, though it seemed more like it'd be a game of 'run for your life' mixed with a bit of avoiding getting stomped on.</span></div></div>",

Today was an even worse day for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym teachers marked out the border line, and head everyone from either side race to the wall while they brought out the balls. You stuck close to Melanie hoping that she'd be able to defend you at least for a short while, or until you had something better than flying between shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whistle blew and total hell unleashed, the giants sieged forward and massive spheres went flying; it was nearly impossible to avoid them all. Buzzing up, down, left, right, forward and back, these things were coming from everywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of the blue one was coming in and there wasn't a thing you could do to escape it. \"ahh!\" you screamed, watching it close in, envisioning your demise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ALSS suddenly came to the rescue, \"ECS\" flashed on the screen, you had no idea what it was, but it couldn't be any worse than being pulverized by a gigantic dodge ball. The wings retracted in, parts of the armor shot off into the air and latched onto you elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plummeted towards the ground, as you hit the ground your knees cave with the suit; next thing you know your kneeling there in something that looked like some kind of super hero suit from the comic books. Sleek metal plates covered your body, and somehow weaved inside of them an infinite number of mechanical parts making this tin can work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to fight back\" you said to yourself, running towards an incoming ball, leaping up, boosters firing and catching it in mid air. All it did was push you back a bit! Holding it tightly you spun, as hard and fast as you could and hurled it across the lines to a lizard running for a ball. Your shot caught him in the hand, he was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next shot on you was too fast, this time though, you had an alternative. Hovering in the air, you cut the jets in your boosts and dropped like a stone to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Melanie though was in a position to catch the ball, unfortunately for you, when she rank forward, she stepped on you! Her huge foot had you pinned to the ground, but that suit held together and kept her from crushing you; but she wasn't moving, at least not fast. On your back you figured to try and get her off, pushing up you found the suit actually had enough strength to pick her up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as your arms were fully extended you fired the boost jets and shot forward, then pushed upward and pulled yourself off the floor to be standing in front of Melanie. \"Mind NOT stepping on me\" you said,  before ducking, spinning to hit a ball back to the enemy side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was in total shock at what you just did, but there wasn't time for that now, both of you were in the middle of a game and had work to do, primarily work defending yourselves from the incoming balls and the people hurling them at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class went pretty well, though as you went on you found this form was too heavily armored to do well with constant flight. For a lot of the class you wound up using your team mates as spring boards, but they didn't mind, a few even through you at high up balls to send them to the other side.</span></div></div>",

You waited on the Gym bleachers for Melanie who'd gone off to take the ugly gym uniform off and put her regular clothes back on. The giants seemed to go streaming out while you sat there dangling your legs over the side of the huge bleachers. They were folded up and made one tall wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed an eternity, Melanie finally came out. In present form you couldn't sustain flight, but she was still willing to carry you, though for now you just sat on her shoulder; it certainly seemed preferable to being carried around on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey John, wanna get some ice cream on the way home\" Melanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed odd, but it might be on the way to her house anyway; and ice cream did sound good, albeit you didn't know how you'd eat it all. \"I guess\" you say, then recalling some of the jokes earlier, \"are you getting a car full or a truck full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fall in\" Melanie replied laughing, \"a small one's enough for you to swim in. That density of yours just might make you sink.\" She got a mischievious look in her eye, you weren't totally sure what she was thinking, but somehow  you had a feeling you'd be getting wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I get the feeling this is going to be an enlightening trip?\" you asked, fiddling with the armor and finally figuring out how to change it at will. With a boost from the boosters you shot up and off of Melanie's shoulders, doing a flip, parts started to shoot off the armor as it changed around. Short wings formed on your back, coming up about halfway up your back they were triangular, delta wings. The armored plating was pretty much gone, all that was left of that were a few underparts leading down to your legs and along or your arms to the repulsers and boosters on your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie kept walking as you hovered next to her, you eventually flipped onto your back and flew backwards, keeping up with her. Sometimes it was better to have a face to talk to than just a wall of fur, \"So, where is this place?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too far\" Melanie answered, though not exactly giving you an exact enough answer to get there on your own. The suit had a navigational system, but that did you little good if you didn't know which if the various ice cream joints she was headed for. \"Race ya\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'm I gonna win? I don't even know where we're going\" you reply, but it was too late, the tigress was already rocketing ahead. \"Ah great, just great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou going into a roll and a dive, shooting forward low to the ground, you keep pace with the fast feline, waiting until your destination is in view. Then you'd pick up the pace and shoot past her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melanie sure was fast, she kept going and going and going. Of course, her mile was a couple of yours and she had a much bigger stride; still though, she was no match for your rockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed at her side along the sidewalk, keeping a good enough distance to make sure you didn't get trampled again. Shooting along you had to duck, roll and dive to avoid some unexpected obstacles; anthros, grass, trees, mail boxes, telephone poles and much more. In this competition size was Melanie's only advantage and unfortunately that meant you had to weave and dive, she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, up ahead you saw what you appeared to be your destination, a tall building built to serve people outside, so there was a counter and windows. You couldn't make out what the name was, but there was a fairly decent crowd of Anthro's gathered around it. \"That'd better be it\" you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie's hand was right in front in your path, but not for long. Arms straight back you angled the repulsers in your hands and started a roll, which dropped you under her hand as you shot to full speed. Around you pressure built up, the suit started to expand an armor coating to protect you from it. Suddenly you felt something weird and heard a massive bang. You'd gone super sonic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was left in your dust as you shot at the building, a tiny missile; there was just one problem. How the hell were you gonna stop! You flipped yourself around, head first and fired everything you had to full. The wall of fur, scales and skin though was still in your way and you were still going too fast. Rotating thrust around you moved left and right between their legs like water ski-ing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you reached the wall, which you slammed into with a pretty loud thud. The back thruster kept you aloft for now, you pushed off the wall and let your jet boots and hand repulsers take over in keeping you hovering. With a slight increase in power you floated up to the counter and touched down right against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now just to wait on Melanie\" you told yourself, walking towards the edge, armor retreating as you went. In the end you sat on the ledge, dangling your legs over. The wings for now had receeded to a much smaller pair with a smaller thruster on your back and an angle one on either side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie walked up and got in line, her orange fur stuck out amidst the mess of other anthros. It took a while, but eventually she made it to the front of your line, \"fast little toy you've got there\" she said, a tad upset at loosing the race to little you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll use it as much\" you admit, \"I'm here to get used to living around anthros, not play with an ultra advanced suit.\" Melanie perked up a bit at that, as it meant you'd still be relying on her, \"that doesn't mean I'm totally done with it How else am I gonna keep up in a race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By getting faster\" Melanie answered. You hear someone coming up behind you, these anthros weren't all quiet, turning you see a deer has come to take your order, \"what do you want John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind sharing?\" you reply, \"unless they sell ice cream about in a dish about a couple centimeters tall.\" The thought of a full thing of ice cream was rather entertaining for you, that'd be a swimming pool worth of ice cream. You shook for a second at the realization of how cold that'd be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medium vanilla in a dish\" Melanie told the deer, the anthro behind the counter went to get the order, you stood up climbed up on Melanie's paw, then climbed up and sat on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat carrying a mouse\" Melanie said, turning her head to look down at you. It wasn't exactly the most entertaining idea, especially with this being a bad place to be if you ever ticked her off; which at some point during the school year you undoubtably would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many mice do you know that fly?\" you reply, now you'd never seen a mouse fly, but that certainly didn't mean Melanie hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several\" Melanie answered, \"of course they needed a little help.\" Just then the server came back with what to you was several tons of ice cream; Melanie paid her with a dollar at least as big as you were, if not a bit bigger. Melanie turned, nearly throwing you off, luckily you didn't as she headed back to her house, eating on the way. Every now and then she brought the spoon up to you, and you'd scoop a bit out in your hand; that was a LOT of ice cream.</span></div></div>",

Melanie took the books and homework upstairs, while you headed for the table with the suit of yours (called ALSS).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad! Can we have friends for dinner!\" Melanie called from upstairs. You had been sitting down on the table, when you heard Melanie yell down, two meanings came to mind; having friends OVER for dinner and EATING friends. That tiger was definitely saying thing's that'd freak you out, now if only you had something to fire back, of course a verbal fight with a giant tiger might not be wise either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Melanie's dad answered, as he walked in, \"hello John, how was school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and take off, flying up to eye level, \"good, I got this to help me get around.\" you answer, eager to show off what for you was a new toy. \"This thing can do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be something it can't do\" the tiger said as he sat down, \"everything has it flaws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its gotta be pretty close\" you reply, then concentrating on some of the suits other forms transform it to show some of the things it'd done earlier. First you made it into that other, high speed flight mode, with and without armor, then that super hero thing from gym class. Then it surprised you by suggesting another form, which you except and tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mid air just about every part of it shot off and formed a hover board under your feet. It was just slightly under so  you fell down onto it, then another form came up on the display, this one was another flight set up, but no back boosters, just the legs and arm repulsors; it also displayed a variant with armor on it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the doorbell rings, no don't Melanie's friends coming over...</span></div></div>",

Brad, Jess and Kim; right after dinner they headed up to Melanie's room while your giant friend stayed behind and picked up. It was quite tempting to just fly up, but you'd told yourself you'd stick to what anyone else would deal with and what you'd come here to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie finished picking up pretty quickly, moving tons of food in a few minutes; there was still enough to feed an army as far as you were concerned. She walked over and held her hand out, you jumped up on, then climbed up to her shoulder; which she wasn't expecting. The tigress's shoulder though was a better spot, her hands were free and you were less of a distraction to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's new\" she said, walking over to the stairs, \"looking for a higher spot? And I always thought rats preferred to hang low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with me here, it leaves your hands free\" you explain, \"better than going around one handed isn't it?\" She started up the stairs, a bumper trip and you did have to hold onto a big of her fur to avoid falling off; that wasn't much of a problem though, you'd certainly be holding on if you were in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the stairs she rounded the corner and walked into her room, everyone was sitting on the floor tackling their daily dose of homework. From here it looked to be an overdose, then again, the books were somewhere around ten or more times bigger than any you'd ever had. Even the 'books' you used this year. To get around one of the size barriers, you'd be given an ebook reader with all the electronic forms of your books on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie sat down cross legged next to Kim, her arm hand was resting on your knee, a perfect route down for you. Sitting down you slid down to her knee and jumped over the edge to the ground, rolling on contact to dissipate your momentum. That was a tiny distance to an anthro, but a big enough fall to kill you if the landing wasn't just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's everyone working on?\" you called up to your giant friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Math, science, social studies\" came the replies from everyone, working on something different, though Melanie had yet to start, she was still rumaging in her back pack. While at it, she handed you yours so you could get to work, then she passed down some of the giant papers from the classes that hadn't given you an assignment to scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy,\" you said, looking at the lawn of paper, \"normally we mow the yard, not write on it.\" This earned you a few laughs from your friends as they watched you attempt to find a way to work on this. Eventually you just passed up on the giant papers for now and headed over to the scaled down ones, which would be much, much easier to work on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou layed on your belly there, put your earbuds in and listend to music while working; what better way to make time fly than with a sub-concious distraction going on in the background. The work on your scale was pretty easy and the material seemed dated, this was stuff you'd covered a long, long, while ago. For now you dismissed this as just a result of different curiculums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey John, what're you listening to?\" Jessie asked, still fascinated by every single thing about you and anything on your scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of the songs from the transformers series, the soundtrack for the movies rocked.\" You answered, at the moment you were listening to a remake of the transformers theme song, this one a hybrid of rock and rap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Jessie persisted, apparently Transformers had never managed to make it to Anthro theatres or tv's. Which seemed kind of odd and ironic, anthros were after all quite similar to the transformers, at least size wise. Other than that there were no real similarities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tv series that spread out to a few movies\" you continued to answer, \"it was about giant robots coming to earth and taking on disguises as human things like cars, trucks, tanks, planes and boats. It was all part of their civil war. Different movies and shows had different reasons for their coming along with different relationships with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like humans and anthros\" Kim cut in, thinking about the giant part, but really there were no other similarities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\" you say, \"they came here on a specific mission each time, they were mechanical and they were warriors. One group was peaceful the other knew only war, and not all of them were giants, some of them were on human scale and some were actually smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting\" Kim replied, she seemed interested in this, then again, she did seem quite curious about a lot of things. \"can we watch any of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a puzzling question, you did have one method, albeit that'd take a while as you didn't have the movie with you, or any of the TV Series. \"I'd have to get someone to send it out from home\" you answered, that'd take a while, a while, especially with you not knowing when you'd be coming back out here. Tonight would probably be the last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chatter died down for now, and you resumed working on your homework and trying to find a solution to your problem with the giant paper. After a while you finially finished off everything you had, everyone...</span></div></div>",

Everyone needed a break and something to clear their minds, after a bit of talking far overhead they concluded to head outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather annoying was that no one asked for your opinion on the matter, but for now you'd have to live with that and talk to Melanie about it later. Before she could get up and leave you up here, you climbed up on her knee and started you way up to her shoulder. You reached your spot just as she stood up, the motion nearly threw you off, but luckily you managed to stay on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one they filed out of the room, Melanie was the last to walk out, she headed down the stairs, at the bottom she headed right and alongside the stairs to a glass slidding door. Before she got that far, both of you were stopped by Melanie's dad, \"John, you parents called. We've still got them on the line.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out his hand and you jumped on, you watched Melanie walk on outside while her dad took you into the kitchen and to a huge phone sitting on the counter, luckily you hearing was good or else this'd be a work out. The giant sat you down and you walked out to the mouth piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom, hi dad! How's it going\" you say, hoping the phone's sensitive enough to pick you up, then you listened carefully to the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi sweetie, how's school\" you here your mom say, it was kind of hard to hear it, but you managed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good\" you answer, \"I've got a few new friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, we've got some news for you\" mom says, \"your going to be staying out with Melanie for the whole school year, you'll be safest that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier you'd had a feeling that there'd be some bad news, or at least semi-bad news. You weren't particularly looking forward to another tongue bath or being dumped in that storage thing in the desk. Though it did seem a good idea considering how school was and it'd certainly be better to be with Melanie from the start than to make it to homeroom in the morning on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we'll be out tonight with some of your stuff\" mom said, \"we've gotta go, its a long drive you know, can you put one of Melanie's parents on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure mom, hang on\" you say glumly. None of the anthros were in sight. With a thought the plate on your back formed itself into wings with jets on your legs and in each of your palms. Rocketing upward you look around for one of the older tigers, and eventually find Melanie's dad. \"My parents wanna talk with you\" you say, still sort of upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it'll all work out\" the tiger says, from the way he talks, you were willing to bet he was a psychologist of some sort; or at the least could be one if he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod an aknowledgement and head for the huge glass door, still open. As soon as you got outside you saw your friends in the middle of a game of soccer, this greatly cheered you up, it was a tad late to intervene though, at least during this round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a huge tree outside you go full speed ahead, level out on your belly for a bit and ring the corner of the soccer 'field' heading for the tree. Right under a branch you pull up and gently hover down to land on the branch. Sitting up here, you looked back at the house, trying to find the 'silver lining' so far you found nothing, but an idea did come to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was enough wood here to at least build a better bed, though right now you had no matress. The idea seemed good, and the matress would be for later, much, much, later. Out in front of you a few 'smaller' branches were sticking out, you sliced them up using a saw from that nice suit of yours. Each one you fell, you layed between your current branch and another one, it took a bit as these were still the 'short' branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worked away for a bit, waiting on the game below to end for you to join in...</span></div></div>",

The only way you'd seen the logs in front of you was from the suit compensating for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Melanie, Kim, Jess and Brad were finishing up their game, they'd declared the next goal would be the last of the day. That did suck as far you were concerned, but you'd get your chance to play with them sometime later; a few days or maybe weeks, but you'd get your chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Melanie started looking for you, you started to work you way around to get down, grabbing your bed to take it with you. With bed in hand you gradually glided down into the grass, it was taller than you were, but that didn't stop you from enjoying a view of the game from the goal posts, a set of empty cardboard boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, Brad was making a run for the goal, coming in fast, he shot the ball right at you! \"Ah crap!\" you yell, jumping off the box, forgetting about the bed you'd had sitting there. Ouch and oof were your only thoughts as you hit he ground rolling and heard the ball smash into the box behind you; turning to look you saw the bed you'd been building had be obliterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh that ticked you off like nothing else could. The suit responded to that quite quickly, surrounding you in armored plating, the HUD on your eyes start projecting data for fighting, info on shields and armor strength, energy levels and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped and shot into the air, hovering in front of Brad, he looked at you with absolutely no idea that it was you, the suit had your head covered in a helmet, with a visor that was entirely obscuring your face. \"Next time, do you think you can come any closer to killing me?\" you say sarcasticly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Brad said, unbelieving of what he had almost done, he seemed to start to stammer, but that wasn't going to get anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, just be more careful' you say, the armored plating retracting as you calmed down, in the end all that was left were the wings, stabilizers and boosters. Descending you turn a bit to see the bed you'd built totally destroyed, which left you with another night in a sleeping bag and a stumbling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you touched down, the suit popped up a notice on your hud, a human car was coming up on the house. That'd be your parents coming to drop off some of your stuff; which Melanie still didn't know about, and this'd definitely be something she'd wanna know about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, could you come in for  a minute\" Melanie's dad bellowed from the house, no doubt to tell her about your new arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming dad!\" she called, then to your friends, \"I'll be right back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Brad asked, there wasn't exactly a lot they could do with three anthros and a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to soccer?\" you offered, with the suit and its armor you could play, you just needed to have it out, as fast as it was, it still couldn't pop out in an instant's notice like would've been needed a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? You said I nearly killed you a minute ago\" Brad said, not wanting to repeat anything like that again any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this\" you answer, shooting upward, a thought sets the suit to change. Parts shoot off all over, your surrounded in a sphere of parts orbiting around you and sticking themselves on in a specific order. In the end you were coated in armor from head to foot, there was no back booster, just repulsers in your hands and jets along your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that gonna do?\" Brad persisted, skeptical that there was enough to that suit of armor to protect you from anything more than a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll prove it. Someone try and make a goal\" you say, cutting the thrusters and slamming into the ground, right between the 'goal posts'. You knelt down from the impact, but then something would have to give with the highspeed touch down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance you saw Kim with the ball, trying to make a long shot on the goal and obviously going easy on you. Reguardless of how easy she tried, the ball was still rocketing in. The suit provided you with its tracectory, you moved to stop it, thrusters on full you hit the ball, killed its force towards you and sent it flying back into the other goal.</span></div></div>",

It didn't have a lot in it and there was plenty of room, it seemed pretty much ideal to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment you were moving up the stairs, the last boxes of your stuff strapped on under your wings. This meant loosing some speed, but that wasn't much of a problem since you weren't going far. At the stairs, you just hovered straight up to the balcony on top, then straight around the corner to Melanie's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giant friend was sitting on a wheeled chair trying to organize the little mess of boxes holding your things, so far she wasn't succeeding in making sense of what any of the boxes were or had in them. That made you smile, you'd always had a really screwy system of organizing things and now it paid off, at least to some extent it was paying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing up behind her you descended and lowered your last boxes onto the desk. With that load dropped you set down and started setting things up, searching through what you had at hand. Among the things you found at the start were a carpet, your game systems, computer, TV, a folding table and a desk. Though you lacked a bed, which would be quite a problem since the one you had outside had gotten destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything but a bed\" you said to yourself, \"that and the kitchen sink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to have the kitchen sink?\" Melanie asked, genuinely confused by the reference. Apparently some things were exclusive to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a human joke\" You answer continuing to work, \"don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long while later you had a room set-up, flat screen TV on a tall stand next to your desk, PC hooked up on the desk along with all your other geeky things. Table and shelves with books and quite a supply of geek gear, but that's the kind of stuff that you'd grown up with. A lot of it would probably confuse the Anthros, they weren't quite as technologically advanced as humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All set?\" Melanie asked, looking down at your room, at least room as far as you were concerned. Albeit it was probably the only room that moved up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so\" you say...</span></div></div>",

As soon as the elevator's done you take off the suit, it seems unwilling, but at the very least it's still listening into your thoughts for when you need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna wait til' later, I'm staying up tonight\" Melanie said, at least you wouldn't have to wait on her all clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to a trunk and pulled out your red night clothes from before. Sure you were called a red rat, but you were sure you'd find something to get Melanie with. As soon as you were dressed you put the back plate of the suit back on and flew up and out, leaving the room down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp top you zipped into the bathroom and quickly brushed your teeth, at least for now it'd be easier than having Melanie help you, especially with her tongue baths. As for cleaning tonight, you had a simpler and better solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few quick steps you stood next to the faucets, they took a bit of work to turn; you grabbed them and with quite a deal of work turned them, almost instantly a steady stream of water flooded out. A nice temperature, luke warm water and perfect for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonzaie!\" you call, jumping into the sink and enjoying the water flowing over you, it was cleansing, relaxing and enjoyable after all this.

Whatever it was, she seemed to be taking wacks at it and getting angrier each time she missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's that?\" you asked, approaching the... whatever it was that Melanie had, as you neared you saw white, grey, black and red things popping up and down, up and down; rather randomly and at the moment in such a way that Melanie just couldn't hit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wack a Rat\" Melanie answered, missing yet again. You noticed that when she was mad her ears stood straight up, swiveling a bit from side to side rather rapidly. Of course, her whipping tail was a much bigger indicator that she was getting ticked; and it was an indication to stay in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, very funny\" you say, Melanie was still on the rat thing, which was going to wear out eventually. Though you were still wearing red. No doubt, tomorrow you'd wear something else, maybe zebra stripes or some other weird thing, but it definitely would not be red!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fun\" Melanie replied, then with a smirk, \"and harder than getting the real thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see\" you say, 30 meters or so off the ground near the edge of the bed. You friend seemed to catch on, sitting down her game and starring up at you, apparently trying to find some way to catch you; something that wouldn't be happening today if you had anything to say about it. \"that is see if you can...catch me before I get back in the desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your on\" Melanie answers, jumping in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut the jets and drop like a lead weight, making Melanie go flying over you to land on the floor several meters away. She rolled and came up crouching, while you were on the floor just ahead of her. The suit comes through for you, showing a good escape path, and you take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoosters to full you rocket along the floor, under he tv stand, and out behind it you pull up rolling to the right. Over the TV you stop and check on Melanie, now standing and coming your way. The tigress starts to reach up for you, as she's just about to get you, the boosters shoot to full on the thought. Suit, wings and all rocket up, you nail the ceiling, push off and bolt back down level with the desk; Melanie's cat-like reflexes might be fast, but this time they're just too slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour 'room' is just ahead, you come in, hit the desk and go into a flip. You flip two or three times to land standing in the center of your little area and to have Melanie starring at you; if looks could kill, you were a dead man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this rat just won\" you say smugly, unfortunately Melanie isn't quite so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your also the first winged rat I've ever seen\" Melanie shot back, \"sounds like a cross of a rat and a bat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\" you say, sitting down in your computer chair, \"we'll see when I beat you to school tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

Getting fast enough that you  were pined down to Melanie's paw/hand. \" this is like riding the Gravetron at the amusement park,\" \"what is the Gravetron we don't have that ride here,\" said Melanie with a slightly puzzled look on her fur covered face.\" It is this ride that spins you so fast that you are not able to move,\" \"cool, I wish I could ride that.\" the rest of the car ride was quiet. Then you came to a vary large restraint. The three of you went over to the table and started to read the menu. About five minuets later the waiter who was a giant anthro raccoon \"hello my name is Robert and I will be your server to day, have you decided what you want to eat,\" \"yes, I will have a hot dog with mustard, fries, a Large soda,\" said Mark \" and I will have a stake with a side salad and water,\" \"and I will have a cheese burger with a small soda.\"  you say.

On the way, you thought of some of the cartoons you'd seen and among the most common things to happen was someone getting hit over the head by a frying pan; at that thought, the suit, which you now knew was called ALSS, re arranged a bit and dumped a helmet off on your head. Along with dumping a ton or so more bits of itself into your head, this time it mentioned a strength enhancement system, an exosuit type thing. The parts running down your arms and legs would make you stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you reached the class,late, but the principle must've called ahead so you wouldn't get any trouble from the teacher, an elephant of some kind by the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie grabbed an apron, it was more like an enormous curtain, and headed for a group in the kitchen area, it was the start of school, but they were already cooking; back home you wouldn't start cooking for at least a week. Either way, you fly after Melanie over to one of the kitchens, one of four for that matter, this one in fact was right against the window on the far side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou buzzed over and watched what the animals were setting to work on, whatever it was it'd be vegetarian. Looking down you saw pots and pans on the stove but they were all empty, then you noticed the anthros had gathered around something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if every else dubbed it so important, then it must be something you'd need to know as well, with a roll and a flip you buzzed over to the group and landed on Melanie's shoulder. For a second you felt like a parrot on a captain's shoulder, but then a parrot here was much, much, bigger than you were. Down below it was yet another giant piece of paper, a recipe for some sort of soup; made of vegetables and soy. Oh joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your on stove, your own clean up, your on this and your on that...\" a Lizard said dividing up the jobs until he came to you, \"what're we going to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was rather insulting, size was a problem yes, but if you could fly around, there would certainly be a way for you to do about anything the anthros could. \"Give me any job, I'll find someway to get it done\" you answer, the Lizard gives you a doubtful look, you hold your ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, your gonna help cook.\" the Lizard said, \"lets get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily you were working with Malanie, otherwise this might've been much harder. You took off her shoulder and followed her across to the stove, then landed on the counter. Melanie towered overhead, reading an ingredients list, though she hadn't read it aloud it seemed she wanted this to be easy for you. Taking a close look up, you tried to decypher what was written on the back, the ALSS helped, it read it and put it up on your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Melanie could even get started, you buzzed off to begin grabbing what was needed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On either wing a grapple shot down and pulled the oranges up under you, with a boost from the after burners the flight to Melanie was fast. Over the counter you dumped the oranges and headed for the next thing on the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next up\" you start, \"an egg? Why an egg? This is soup.\" Complaints aside, you fly to the fridge and pry the door open, grabbing on and pushing away with the jet pack. The enormous door drifted off and you buzzed in, quickly snagging an egg from the carton, carrying it in your arms, this had to be put down a bit softer. Buzzing tight against the counter you hovered for just a second, someone remaining on your belly as you sat the egg down then buzzed back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artificial chicken broth\" you read off the screen, \"oh joy, wonder what that's made of.\" That was sitting out on the other side of the kitchen. Shooting ahead full speed, you rocket by it, grabbing it as you go. It weighs an infinite ton for a second, but then the ALSS compensates and really holds it for you. Shooting towards Melanie you bolt up and over her shoulder to bomb the huge container down behind the oranges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what's next\" you say, hovering over the pots out in front of Melanie. Unfortunately you'd only seen part of the requirements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the rest\" Melanie answered, indicating a 'small' pile of boxes next to the stove, \"they were all in the cabinets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, lets throw this junk together and see what we get\" you say.</span></div></div>",

The sound startled and scared the living heck out of you, just one problem; it wasn't the class bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the fire bell, everybody out!\" the teacher called, \"lets go lets go lets go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not good\" you saw, Melanie nods her head in agreement and begins heading for the door, there was already a crowd gathering and it was time to git while the getting was good. As you reached the door it was getting hard and harder to stay airborne, fur, scales, tails and more blocked your sides, sometimes the way up, and others the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wouldn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALSS detected the problem and immediately began to change itself. The wings on your back became shorter and more triangular shaped, a delta wing, though it was much lower than before, starting where your back did and not even reaching your shoulders. The boosters on the back of your legs expanded down to boot jets and the repulsers in your hands seemed to be getting more power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would work, more compact, more manueverable. Hands at your sides and palms down you pumped all the power you had into a dead vertical climb, arching over through a roll you headed along on the way out far overhead of the Anthros. But, you'd lost track of Melanie, probably giving her a heart attack; and no doubt digging your grave a couple miles deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you reached the door outside, though you'd have to dive to get out without taking out the glass overhead of it. A swift roll dissipated much of your altitude and got you low enough to squeeze through, the second you reached the outside you climbed and hovered, looking for Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed an eternity, you spotted her in the grass past the parking lot, you made your way over to her going full speed ahead, after burners blazing away. </span></div></div>",

Her instant reaction was one of paranoia and fear, which was reasonable, considering it was <i>your</i> reaction, too. Both of you looked to Principal Tabbins for help on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, she wasn't the one to speak up first. It was a rhino dressed in a police uniform. This only made you even MORE nervous. Had you broken some Anthro law you hadn't heard of? When had you done it? Were Anthros not allowed to touch you? Was everybody you've ever known here going to jail!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're John, right?\" he said, stepping forward. Because of the structure of his face, and the level Melanie was holding you at, you couldn't see his entire face - just his mouth. And it was pretty distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, sir, I am,\" you squeaked, shivering. \"...H-have I done something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth curled into a small smile and he gave a low chuckle. \"Melanie, could you raise John up to where I can see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie gulped and nodded. \"Yes, Mr. McRottie,\" she said in a shaky voice, lifting you up to where you could see his eyes. To your relief, he didn't look angry at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, both of you,\" he laughed lightly. \"You aren't in trouble. We're here to talk about you and John. Specifically, how to make you both feel more safe here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you knew you weren't going to have to be a fugitive, you relaxed. Melanie did the same, subconsciously lowering her paw a bit which caused you to stumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what measures should we take, Mr. McRottie?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at the use of his name. \"Well, you've already done some of it, from what I saw in the lunchroom. Since you're much smaller than Anthros, it's easy for them to dismiss you as an object or lesser being.\" That caused you to frown a bit. You didn't like thinking about that, and it obviously made both you and Melanie uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why,\" he continued, \"it's good that you've been making your own choices. You haven't allowed anyone except Melanie to pick you up without permission, and that's asserting the fact that you're equals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I've been thinking of doing is having an official welcoming assembly,\" Principal Tabbins said from her desk. \"Where we formally introduce you to the entire school, and answer the common questions. That way you might not be approached so fervently as the hall monitors have told me.\" She chuckled herself. \"I've been hearing you two have been causing quite a roadblock with the crowd of students around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Melanie. She was probably referring to that 'protective' formation Melanie, Jessie, Kim, and Brad had made around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Melanie said. \"What do you think about the idea of an assembly, John...?\" she asked, looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne look in her eyes and you could tell she was nervous about the idea. You didn't know why, but you didn't dare point out her fear in front of everyone. What was she scared of...? It was just an assembly...in front of everyone in the school...with all their eyes focussed on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you understood Melanie's issue because it became YOUR issue, too. That mental image haunted you...everyone staring straight at you...with a sort of distant curiosity...the way someone would look at a museum exhibit...</span></div></div>",

A pang of fear hits you, and you suddenly blurt out, \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll motion in the room stopped, and your face turned red as it became painfully obvious everyone was staring at you. \"Uhh...I...need time to think about what I'm going to say...to everyone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I suppose that's reasonable,\" the ocelot said with a nod. \"Perhaps sometime tomorrow, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.

Melanie stepped forward, and set you down. Once again, you looked up at her. It was clear the idea of the assembly still hadn't left her mind, and you were pretty sure the two of you were going to have a very long talk afterwards about it. You gave her an apologetic shrug, and look up at Mr. McRottie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subject of extra protection piqued your interest. Y'know, because not dying is a nice thing to have. He reached into a pouch on his belt and pulled out two items, setting them out in front of you. One was a pair of boots with a strange curve on the heel. You frowned. They looked kind of feminine...but also somewhat familiar. The other was...a police uniform? You looked up at the rhino questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to the suit first. \"This is to protect you from more unsavory types. It's made of similar stuff humans have in their police force, but tweaked for more force than bullets. So it won't withstand something like a human shooting you, but it'll keep you alive if someone squeezes you a little too hard, or pokes you with their claw with too much force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Melanie and grin. \"Oh, I can see this becoming very useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't entirely relax her nervous disposition, but she did have a small smirk playing at her lips as she held back a sarcastic reply. \"Go on, try it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to pick up the suit, and were instantly surprised by its<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. This thing must weigh like forty pounds!\" you protested. \"How am I going to get around in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. McRottie let out another chuckle. \"Trust me, you get used to it. But you're right, it's going to be hard to move around in. So only wear it in places where you feel you might be in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held the suit over your head and slipped it on. It sagged on your shoulders, and made you feel like you were chest deep in a pool of molasses. You tried to raise your arms, but couldn't get them past your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie giggled, bending down to look at you. \"I'm going to have to get you started on a training regimen!\" she purred, her tail flicking back and forth in amusement. \"What do you think about that, John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll only do it if you do,\" you said with a smirk. \"Who knows? You might need it more than I do!\" You crossed your arms...or tried. The restrictiveness of the suit meant it looked kind of stupid. Melanie laughed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment you noticed you had something in the belt. Taking it out, your eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're giving me a taser?\" you asked incredulously. \"Isn't this...y'know, super dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To humans, it can hurt, yes,\" McRottie said. \"But that kind is meant for anthros that get a little too frisky. It'll pack about as much force as a semi-strong bite. Just enough for them to drop you. I want you to use it conservatively, and responsibly, alright?\" He looked at you seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Cross my - wait a second, DROP me?! Isn't that even worse?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed a bit. \"That's where the boots come in,\" he said as you put the taser back and began taking off the vest. \"First, put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the black and white boots, you studied them. They were more like braces, really. They were mostly white with black highlights, as well as a curved piece of what looked like plastic. You swore you recognized them from somewhere... You shook your head and slipped your foot inside. You frowned. The heel wasn't aligned with the ground, making you feel like you were wearing high heels. The curved piece bounced a bit, giving you a light agile feel. \"What are these?\" you asked as you slipped on the other boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are Long-Fall boots,\" he said, snickering a bit. \"Now, John, I want you to jump off the desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump off the desk, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie stepped forward. \"M-Mr. McRottie, I don't think that'd be a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out another chuckle. \"Those boots will protect you from a fall much higher than you'd normally be able to stand. As long as you land on your feet, those boots will absorb the brunt of the landing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and looked over the edge of the desk. The floor seemed to expand below you, and you got an intense feeling of vertigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt a poke to your back, and you gave a surprised yelp of fear as you plummeted off the side of the desk, careening towards the floor below. You faintly heard Melanie yelling in shock. Screaming yourself hoarse, you watched the ground soar up to meet you. You got ready to land, bracing yourself for unbearable pain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shudder, the braces hit the ground, cushioning the impact. You planted your hand on the ground to lessen the momentum further out of instinct, and slowly got to your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John!\" Melanie scooped you up and raised you to her face, giving you another helping of vertigo. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm...I'm fine,\" you said dizzily, holding your head. \"Be a l-little gentler about the elevator ride up, though, mm'kay...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks went red from embarrassment at that. \"R-right...sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boots do have their limitations, of course,\" McRottie said. \"They can't help you if you don't land on your feet. And of course, the higher up you fall from, the less the boots can help you. The braces are made of...some science-y stuff I can't remember the name of,\" he said, scowling as he tried to remember. Then he shook his head. \"Point is, it's strong, so it won't break easily. I know because I tried to break it on suggestion of your human scientists. Couldn't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the boots off. \"...Did they have to make them like heels, though...?\" you mumbled. \"Well...thanks,\" you said, looking up at him. \"These should really help, Mr. McRottie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"It's no problem. Now, off to class with the both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" you both said, Melanie picking up your suit off of the desk as you stuffed the boots into your backpack as best they could fit. Melanie turned and walked out of the office, giving the both of them a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's off to Literature with Ms. Gotec,\" you said. You remembered the reaction Jessie, Kim, and Brad had given you when you said you had that class...and to be honest it didn't fill you with a lot of confidence.

Then she looked down at you and cracked a grin. \"So, you're terrified, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Shoot, I thought you forgot about that,\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie laughed. \"What, a couple thousand eyes the size of passenger cars staring at you freak you out a little bit?\" she giggled, poking you with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" you said, rolling your eyes. \"Your eyes aren't the size of passenger cars - you aren't an anime character!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get to Ms. Gotec's,\" Melanie said, changing the subject. \"That reaction the others had didn't exactly fill me with confidence...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...do you know what species she is?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard that she's a pygmy goat,\" Melanie said slowly. \"But usually the last names aren't THAT obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you asked. \"Like...Gotec? 'Goat'ec?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie laughed a bit. \"Yeah, that. If my last name was a pun, I'd either change that, or my species!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. It can't be that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie raised you to her face. \"What if your name was Hugh Mann?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but cringe. \"...Alright, you win this round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled victoriously, and began walking again, going up the stairs to the second floor. \"So those boots look pretty good on you,\" she giggled. \"Very flattering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, don't talk about those,\" you groaned, rolling your eyes. \"Yes, they'll save my life, but is a life where I need to wear those a life worth living?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asking the tough questions, I see!\" Melanie laughed. \"But truly, what is living if you aren't constantly wearing high-heeled science boots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cracked a smile. \"I guess you'll never know. You don't have access to such boots of science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider me jealous of your life-living ways,\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Melanie arrived at the gigantic door to Ms. Gotec's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...here she is...shall we?\" Melanie looked down at you.</span></div></div>",

Then Melanie realized what you were doing, this game didn't last long, Melanie had got you in checkmate after about 10 turns after she had realized your plan. When she had you in checkmate you were about to leave the board when a giant paw blocked your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd you think you're going, isn't it that when you get the King in checkmate you have to knock him over?\" She had a grin on her face which you didn't like, but then she decided to take pity on you. \"I guess your tired, eh?\" She lay down her paw for you to walk on, she then yawned.

You observe the expanding landscape of a nicely smoothed bed sheet all around, apart from the shoe box that cut off your view of the nearest edge of the bed. 'This is my highschool life,' you think to yourself, 'being room mates with a giant tigress anthro.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on your mind?\"  The looming voice behind you causes you to jump up a little.  \"you really do scare easy,\" responds Melanie with a smile.  \"And you have the ability to sneak up on others without making a sound like most other big cats.\"  \" Big cat huh?\"  She kneels down and stares at you at eye level.  \"  Was that a compliment or an insult?\" She asks as her warm breath rolls over you.  You hold your wits even though you are somewhat nervous in the back of you head screaming that this might not be a good idea, you stair back without filinching.  \"It's a compliment of course, i mean who in their right mind would ridicule some one as kind as you?\" After making this coment she lefts her smile higher untill you can see her cleaming white teeth, yet you dont flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so, and your starting to get over your verves and fear but your still a little mouse to me,\" she comments with a teasing note, \"Any ways i brought you your bed.  Take a look.\"  It was a sponge with a felt clothe over it and another felt clothe ontop, one thing was for sure it would keep you warm on the cold nights.  \"Great, where should we put it now?\"  She looks around the says, \" How about under the bed so no mid-night incedents occur.\"  \"Incedents?\" you ask.  She, somehow, turns a little pink from a blush and says, \" I roll around in my sleep.\"  \"Oh...\" is all you can say.  She slowly sets your bed in the shoe box then picks you up and sets you in the box as well and sets you under the bed.  \"Good night,\" you call out and is responded with a \"night...\" You stip into your underwear and get into your sheets and close your eyes.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on ___________, time to get up.\"  A strange yet familiar voice calls to you.  There is a furry weight on you, kind of like the weight of an overgrown cat.  You open your eyes to an expansion of orange and black fur leading up to that of an enormous face of a tigress anthro.  You give a short yelp, and if not for her paw ontop of you, you might have fallen out of your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot about yesturday? after all you went through,\" asks Melanie.  You shake your head in agreement then pick your self up and hurridly get dressed into your cloths again.  \" We need to get you a couple more outfits,\" she states flattly.  Thustly she lifts you and your backpack up and takes you down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom down stairs the aroma of breakfeast snakes up to your nose and it smells delicious.  After a quick meal Melanie lifts you up again and curls her fingers around you, and pressing you into her pad.

You do not believe you had not noticed this before, but there are two other enormous tiger anthros in your backyard!  One of them looks burly, and is barbecuing what smells like chicken on a truck sized grill.  He must be tough if he is cooking without a shirt on.  The other tiger is wearing a sweater and long tight jeans, and looks like she is chatting with two humans in her paw.  You realize that those must be your parents, and this is confirmed when Melanie gets up and walks over to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, John woke up and wants to see his parents.\"  Melanie brings her paw to her mother's which must be twice as big!  You walk over to your parents and give them a big hug.  You are a bit embarrassed that Melanie and her mother are watching, but you decide that it doesn't really matter right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good to see that you are alright!\" exclaims your mother.  \"I'm just glad that there are anthros like Melanie's family that don't feel sore about people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that Melanie's parents are also into the whole integration thing?\" you ask.  This time, the response comes from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Zacharius and I are both fervent advocates for human-anthro integration,\" says the larger of the two tiger females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry John, we should introduce you.  This is Mr. and Mrs. Prusten, Melanie's parents.\"  Mrs. Prusten extends an index finger to you and you shake it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine, John,\" says the tiger.  \"Now, why don't we start dinner, I could eat a horse.\"  You are itching to say that she could probably eat ten, but you don't want to be rude.  Melanie extends her paw to you and beckons you on.  After you step on the padded palm, you are lowered down to a checkered cloth that completely covers the backyard.  There is a place set for you, thankfully human-sized, but right next to you is Melanie's place, which is in a size that suits her larger body.  The burly male tiger serves the barbecue chicken, giving heaping portions to his family and relatively meager portions to yours.  As you start eating, your parents and Melanie's parents start to talk about the integration project.  It sounds a bit boring, but you might find out something interesting.

You pick up the ball and head off to the side of your house.  Melanie only needed to take a few steps to get from the backyard to the side yard, but she still looked eager to play with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two goals set up; you never bothered taking them down before.  As you get ready to drop the ball and start playing, you remember that Melanie is still much taller than you.  She could easily traverse anywhere on the field with one small step, and a single foot paw could easily block the entire goal!  Melanie sees you hesitating, and immediately knows the problem.  \"Don't worry, John, I'll go easy on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit insulted, since you are a pretty good soccer player, and never needed anyone to ease up, especially not a girl in a dress.  You thank Melanie anyway, and drop the ball on the ground.  You immediately kick the ball right into Melanie's ankle, which rebounds the soccer ball to the side.  Running after the ball, you are about to hit it, but Melanie sweeps her foot slowly, drawing the ball way to the other side of the field.  Lightly tapping the soccer ball with her toe, Melanie scores the first goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I though you said you would go easy on me!\" you shout up to your feline friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie shrugged innocently.  \"I was.  I could have sworn that humans could run faster than that.  I guess that humans aren't even relatively as fast as us anthros.  Oh, sorry, don't take that personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I won't,\" you reply, since she does make sense.  Not only is she ten times taller than you; she must have the speed and strength of a tiger to boot.  Even if she were the same size as you, she could probably beat you easily at soccer.  You drop the ball again, and this time you kick at an angle to not hit Melanie's foot.  You run after the ball and Melanie's other foot descends between the path from the ball to the goal, so you feint a kick to the side.  As Melanie starts lifting her foot, you score the second goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your pretty good for a human!\" says the giant tigress.  You nod, but you can tell that she was letting you have that goal.  Now it was Melanie's turn, and this time she was going to impress you with her footwork.  Even though the ball was much smaller than what she must have been used to, she still could kick it between her feet deftly and quickly.  You are running back and forth between her hind paws as they pass the ball back and forth.  Finally, you intercept the ball and kick for the goal, but Melanie blocks the ball quite unexpectedly with her striped tail.  Melanie then easily scores another goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue having fun with Melanie for a long time, even after the sun sets.  Melanie lets you win, but also shows off amazing physical ability.  Eventually, you grow tired, even though Melanie never even broke a sweat.  \"I guess its about time to get ready for bed now,\" you tell your friend, and she replies by picking up the soccer ball and dropping it back by the side of the house.  \"Um, do you have a place to sleep, because I don't think you'll fit ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me, John, my family brought sleeping bags.  Why don't you go inside and I'll just see you in the morning?\"  You decide to do what your friend suggests and enter your house, where you brush your teeth and put on some pajamas.  As you start to get into your bed, you can't help but feel sorry for Melanie, who has to sleep outside like a human's housecat.  You wonder if you could do anything to cheer her up, since she has been so nice to you, and even pretty much saved your life today...</span></div></div>",

Even the smaller ones are intimidating; the moose boy, however, is long and lanky and seems to weigh a thousand times more than you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammer, \"Uh, no I'm--I mean y-yes, these stairs are too steep for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little dude could fit in my backpack!,\" laughs a fox as he heads past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans!,\" smirks the moose, who gives a big pat to the fox's back. \"Ya gotta feel sorry for them, huh?<br>\r\nSee you in science later, Vulpi.\" He turns back to you. \"Well, I can--whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the moose grabs you and pulls you away and you see a fleeting image of brown fur running past.<br>\r\nA steady thump! thump! thump! goes up the stairs, and you look down and see huge brown paws running up the stairs. \"I'm gonna be late, gangway!,\" comes the voice. You realize it's a huge eighth-grade bear, and the fact that the moose pulled you aside means that you weren't crushed by him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moose sighs. \"Why they put these humans here, when they're far too small, I don't know! Well, whatever your name is, I'll help ya.\" He pulls you up and hold you tight to his chest; you are carried up the rest of the stairs and then deposited on the floor at the top of the stairs. Your puny sneakers are almost crushed by the passing paws of giant animals, and you retreat to the side of the hallway so you don't collide with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm John!,\" you quickly say to him. \"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n\"Moosalamoo,\" he replies. \"No problem little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you enter the classroom and climb up on an immense desk to look up at a blackboard which tells you what your seat will be: <br>\r\nThird row, third seat back. A 48 foot tall raccoon arrives and looks at the board: Fourth row,<br>\r\nthird seat back, is the assignment he gets. He looks down at you. \"Hey!

They are all roughly the average size for animals who are 11 or 12 years old, ranging from 45 to 52 feet tall, with one notable exception--you. The raccoon, Procione, places you on top of your desk and you suddenly become aware that the teacher has stopped by to visit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we have a human this year. Do you know what I think about humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, worried about what he will say. \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"They're wonderful. Why, I had a human as a roommate in college. Fun little dude. We looked<br>\r\nout for each other. I'm sure he's a success, wherever he is these days. I feel sorry you're so small, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"A bear almost ran me over trying to get up the stairs--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear. Tall, chubby? A bit oafish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be Irssa. He was in this class last year. Tended to run late and almost ran down some students trying to get here on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female student, a tigress, looks over at you. \"Hey, you're cute lil' fella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and say thank you to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'd make a good pet!,\" she laughs. <br>\r\nThe teacher looks over at her sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now really!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress' twin brother comes forward and jokes, \"Hey, I love humans...they're delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the animals crack up. Even the teacher is smiling a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right, class...verrrry funny. But seriously, I want you to treat him--and everyone else<br>\r\nin this class--with respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger goes up to you; he towers over you and eyes you with suspicion for a moment but then<br>\r\nsmiles. He gives you a friendly pat on the back. \"It's OK, lil' dude, I'm just joking.\" Then he licks<br>\r\nhis lips for the heck of it. You laugh nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher heads back to his desk and is about to distribute the books when suddenly there's a knock on<br>\r\nthe door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" says the fox. A tall, chubby bear opens the door (almost breaking it off the hinges in the<br>\r\nprocess) and says quickly, \"Sorry, sorry but did I leave my book bag in this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProcione spots it and hands it over to the clumsy bear. \"Here you go. Listen...you gotta be careful<br>\r\nwhen you go up the stairs,\" the raccoon tells the bear. \"You almost ran over my lil' friend here,<br>\r\nthe human...John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear walks over to you and bows, then smiles awkwardly down at you. \"I'll be careful, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he exits and you focus on the wonderful world of mathematics.

Hey, I feel bad you have to put up with that kinda stuff and it's really nothing for me to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around at the animals passing by, who give the raccoon a dirty look--since Procione is carrying you<br>\r\npressed up to his chest, holding you firmly with his right paw.

(You think.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the music class is in here,\" says Procione, carrying you inside. There are various instruments as well as computers which will help each student practice his or her instrument. A 60 foot raccoon enters--the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me,\" you ask Procione as you both sit down, \"that teacher in Math said he had a human for a college<br>\r\nroommate. I thought we didn't really mingle in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't but maybe that human was a gifted student or somethin' and got sent to the university.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like we have a human--the one and only human here--amongst us,\" says the raccoon teacher,<br>\r\nwalking toward you. Procione seemed gigantic to begin with but the teacher is even more titanic, but he<br>\r\nappears friendly and you relax a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir; I am John Nesbitt from Earth and this is Procione Irnsbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes your paws--er, hands. \"I don't want to sound like a species-ist,\" the teacher says, \"but we<br>\r\nraccoons can make pretty good musicians. I hope you Earth humans can do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we have some very talented human musicians,\" you tell him. \"We have rock bands like U2 and<br>\r\nColdplay and years ago there was a very good group called the Beatles, and we have all kinds of<br>\r\ndifferent types of music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adult raccoon nods. \"Instrument?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, a little piano.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Little' is right,\" laughs the teacher, reaching over to find an electric piano scaled down to your size. In fact it<br>\r\nwas transported from Earth. \"How many years have you trained?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, Procione?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play guitar,\" he says, and the teacher reaches over and takes out a colossal acoustic guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other students enter the room, including a tall and strong lion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a toy of some sort? A robot who can play the piano?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" replies the teacher, \"is a human from Earth named John and I want you to treat his as you would<br>\r\nany other fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion looks down at you and gives a deep laugh. You see his fang like teeth far above you and hope<br>\r\nto heck you don't get on his bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour or so, it's time for lunch period and you and your new friend head off to the cafeteria.<br>\r\nHe says hello to some other students but they don't seem to want to sit at a table with him.

You're going to Tailwind High, and that's final!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad's voice boomed from the driver's seat of the family minivan.  A mix of emotions filled your head: anger, nervousness, disgust, and, you had to admit, curiosity, just to name a few.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on the way to be dropped off for your first day at Tailwind High School, a hundred and fifty miles from your home.  It was the first day of your freshman year, and while all your friends from middle school were heading to East Jefferson High back in your hometown, your parents, liberal activists that they were, just had to enroll you in the new exchange student program between the schools.  It was an idea that you hated; not only were you going to be in the middle of a group of giant anthros, not only were you not going to be able to see your friends until fall break at the earliest, but you were going to be the only human for miles.  It was an idea that didn't sit well with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, hon,\" your mom said from the passenger seat.  \"All your stuff from home has already been sent to your host family's house, and we sent them a recipe book with your favorite foods.  It'll be just like back home.  We'll be sure to email you often and be up to visit for family weekend in a month.  It won't be so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and stare out the window.  So far, the streets had been pretty empty, only seeing the occasional feet of a giant anthro passing by.  You didn't quite know what to expect, but you knew that it was going to be a tough freshman year.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the van pulled up to a massive building that looked to be ten stories tall and as wide and long as the Pentagon.  You knew that Tailwind was a fairly small school, as anthro schools went, with only about one hundred students across the four grades, but that didn't make the enormity of it all compared to you any easier.  The van stopped, your dad jumped out and opened the door for you.  You hesitated to jump out.  Was this really the best way to start your high school career?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, slugger,\" your dad said (you hated it when he called you that, as you haven't played baseball or any sports since elementary school).  \"Let's get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grudgingly unbuckled your seatbelt and stepped out of the car, backpack in hand.  Your dad gave you a pat on the shoulder, and said, \"You show those Anthros what humans are made of! Make us proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom had gotten out of the car and ran around, throwing her arms around in a tight embrace.  \"Ohh, my little Wes, how proud we both are of you!  You're going to be doing something nobody else has ever done, honey,\" she said as she planted a kiss on your cheek.  \"Stay safe, and let us know if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your parents both jumped back into the van and pulled away.  You watched as the van disappeared into the distance, back towards human civilization and everything that was familiar to you.  It took all your strength to fight back the tears that were beginning to form in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and looked at the large building and the grounds that surrounded it.  Classes had already started; the school administration felt it best that you arrive after all the other students were safely inside, at least for the first day.  You took a deep breath and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, you looked at the map of the building that the school had so helpfully provided for you.  You needed to head to the principal's office, which luckily was right next to the entrance you had come in at, though it still was somewhat of a long walk for you.  Pushing open the door with all your might, you stepped into the office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for you there, sitting behind a large mahogany desk, was the principal, the only anthro you ever really had talked to before, back a couple of weeks ago when this whole idea was first being discussed.  He was a tall, svelte, bespectacled ocelot named Jacques, who was well dressed and looked like he was overflowing with confidence.  Looking up from the papers he was reading, he noticed you, smiled, and said,   \"Ah, Wesley, welcome to Tailwind! How was your trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess,\" you said.  \"A little long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're really glad to have you here, believe me.\" He stood up and walked over to you, each step causing the ground around you to shake slightly.  When he got right in front of you, he leaned over and stuck out his massive paw, with the palm facing up.  You couldn't help but notice that his claws, which were retracted, could easily impale you in the blink of an eye.  You gulped, and stuck out your hand, grasping one of his fingers and offering a quick shake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacques chuckled, shaking his head, \"Well, yes, we can shake hands, I guess, but I was actually thinking you might want to...how should I put this?...be a little closer to my eye level.  Would you like me to lift you up on to my desk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and stepped forward onto his paw.  \"Hang on tightly, now,\" Jacques said as he slowly started lifting up his paw into the air.  You grabbed on as tightly as possible so as not to loose your balance.  After a few short, scary seconds, he brought his paw to the desk, and you quickly jumped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you said, a little shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome,' Jacques said as he sat back down at his desk.  \"Okay, let's get down to business.  You already know your class schedule and have your books, I presume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was all in the packet you sent,\" you said, still trying to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.  Then the only thing I have left to do is to introduce you to your partner for this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partner?\" you asked, confused.  You didn't remember hearing anything about a partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I guess we never told you.\" Jacques peered down through his glasses at a sheet of paper.  \"The host family you're staying with also has a child your age who is just starting at Tailwind as well.  Your parents and I thought it would only be proper to have you paired up, at least for the beginning of the year, so you could get better acquainted with how our schools work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" you said, again growing slightly nervous.  It would be nice to have someone to help you get accustomed to all this weirdness, but something felt slightly off about the whole situation. \"Well, who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacques pressed down on an intercom, and said into it, \"Okay, come on in.\"  From the opposite end of the office from where you came in, another door opened.  You spun around.  \"Wesley, I would like you to meet...\"</span></div></div>",

The fox had a slender build and clean, smooth bright red-orange fur.  White spots dotted his face, and his sharp green eyes were lined by a rim of black fur, which made them look very deep and brooding, and were partially hidden by a tuft of fur that seemed to grew down from his head.  Nolan was dressed in a half-tucked-in white button-up shirt with the top three buttons open, revealing the brilliant white fur of his chest, a dark brown jacket, and a pair of tight-fitting dark blue jeans.  Wes also noticed the dark black fur around his paws which looked a little like gloves (or boots, in the case of the feet), but was all-natural.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNolan stood in front of Jacques and Wes, visibly nervous, clutching his arm with his paw.  \"Wow,\" Wes thought, \"maybe he's as scared as I am about this whole mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nolan, I'd like you to meet Wes Schafer,\" Jacques said, gesturing towards you.  \"He is the one you've heard so much about; he'll be living with you for the next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNolan gave a little wave.  \"Hello, there,\" he said, his voice slightly cracking. He looked away, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Wes said, waving back.  \"Nice to meet you.\"  There was something about this Nolan.  Wes wasn't sure what it was, but he knew that he was going to like this mysterious fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, boys, we've made sure that your class schedules for the year are exactly the same, so Nolan, you'll be responsible for making sure Wes gets where he needs to go at first.  Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNolan nodded, and reached his paw out.  \"Would you... would you like to ride in my pocket?  I've, uh, tried to make it extra comfortable for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in just a few minutes, you jumped on a large paw and held on tight.  You expected Nolan's fur to be harsh and abrasive, like the fur of foxes you'd touched back home, but it was surprisingly soft.  Nolan must take excellent care of himself, you thought.  He lifted you up and placed you in the highest pocket of his jacket, which, sure enough, had some extra cotton packed into it so it was soft and so you could stand and see out of it.  You looked over the edge, peeking down at the ground below.  It wasn't until just then that the scale of the situation truly dawned on you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, boys,\" Jacques said, \"Have a great year at Tailwind High.  And if there's anything that I or my staff could do for you, don't hesitate to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nolan turned away, and walked out of the office.  As he headed down the empty halls, Nolan let out a sigh of relief.  \"Man, I'm glad to be out of there,\" he said.  \"I don't know what it is, but being in that office always makes me freak out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jacques seems like a nice enough guy,\" you said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is, I guess,\" Nolan says, shrugging, which jostled you slightly.  \"I guess it's just the power of it all.  I always feel like I'm in trouble, no matter what I'm in there for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can understand that,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard a loud ringing sound fill the halls.  The doors to the classrooms flew open, and students began exiting into the hall.  \"Homeroom's over,\" Nolan said.  \"Time for first period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out the schedule from your pocket, trying to remember what first period was.  As you opened it, you saw that it was going to be...</span></div></div>",

Some of them gave a genuine smile, but some shot some dirty looks or glares that sends chills up your spine. When you came into the classroom, the smell of papers attacks your senses. Nolan notices your reaction and asked, \"What's wrong Wes? The smell of math too much for you?\".\"Yeah, what happened in here? In my old school, I am on advanced Math/Algebra lessons but I had never known math can create such an odour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNolan laughed, \"I know right, the teacher really hates our scores last year and kept putting posters of the lesson topic all over the walls. The paint and papers create this smell. We all got used to it though.\" It's then when you noticed what looked like hundreds of posters of geometry, algebra, and graphs all over half the white walls of the class. But these posters are as tall houses and as wide as cars. \"You guys call this the smell of math?\" \"Yeah, we called it that as a joke,\" Nolan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe algebra teacher, an anthro fox teacher with thin glasses, came in, \"Hello everyone, my name is Ms.Kiren and I am your algebra teacher for this year.\" Nolan whispers to you, \"By the way, that's my mother. She just joined this school last year.\" \"That would explain why you two look alike.\", you whispered back. \"As most of you might've noticed, today we have the arrival of a new special student for this school. Welcome to your first class in Tailwind High, Wes Schafer.\" You added a cheerful wave back to the other students.\"Now I want you all to treat him and everyone else in this classroom with respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today, we are going to learn about algebraic expressions and how do we use them in our daily lives. But before we start, why don't we ask Mr.Schafer here as the new student to find out what humans had learned in algebra for the past school years.\" You were surprised that they were learning algebraic expressions at this year as you learnt it 2 years ago. You answered back, \"Well, we've learnt this 2 years ago and last year we were doing the laws of indices and a few others.\" \"Wow! that's what we are going to learn next year! As all of you can see or probably hear, humans' education exceeds ours by 2 years in math. Now I'm sorry to say that we had to make this like a review for you Mr.Schafer, as there are other students I need to teach here.\" You think of this and you thought it wouldn't be such a burden as your future plans didn't have anything to do with mathematics. \"Ohh it's ok, I won't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on to the class, Ms.Kiren addresses you as her class assistant and while the class is going, Nolan managed to sneak an introduction to his best friend next to you, Kala, a female grey wolf anthro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the bell rang, you and Nolan checked the schedule for today and found out the next period is...</span></div></div>",

There were some reptilian ones, some avian ones, and of course plenty of mammalian ones.  What was weirder was that every different type of personality seemed to be represented too.  There were jocks, nerds, cheerleaders, stoners, and theater kids.  You chuckled, as you thought to yourself, \"Maybe Tailwind won't be so different after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two of you made it to the classroom.  Nolan sat down at a desk near the middle of the room, and he picked you up out of his pocket and sat you down on his desk.  On it, there was a smaller desk, one scaled just for your size.  Sitting next to it was a megaphone; you guessed that was to help everyone hear you whenever you spoke to the class as a whole.  You put your book bag underneath the desk, and pulled out a notebook, ready to get this whole ordeal started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the class poured in, you noticed that it was a much smaller amount of students than you normally had in your school.  You looked back and saw there were only seven desks (counting yours) in the room.  You figured that, with a smaller school, they could afford to have much more detailed instructions.  A couple of jockish-type students sat down in the back; one was a muscular mustang wearing a jersey-style shirt and tight black shorts, the other was what looked to be a large, muscular iguana, but at his size he looked closer to a dinosaur to you, who was wearing a black sleeveless t-shirt and khaki shorts.  Sitting in the other corner of the back row was a female bear, with a slightly rotund figure and a too-tight t-shirt and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, the seats next to you had been filled.  You looked to your left to see a tall, lanky-looking giraffe, wearing a blue-polo shirt and glasses.  He looked towards you, and his eyes lit up.  Leaning over, he said, \"Hey, you must be that human we've all been hearing about!\"  His voice was very squeaky and nasal sounding.  You quickly surmised that this giraffe was one of the nerds of the school.  \"My name's Wendall.  What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wes,\" you said, as you secretly hoped he would go back over to his own desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to finally see you.  Wow,\" Wendall said to Nolan as he put his hoof over Wes's head, \"he's a lot tinier than I thought he would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Wendall,\" Nolan said, chuckling as he gently pushed him away, \"don't spaz out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head as you turn to look at the seat to the other side of you, where you saw a sharply-dressed female wolf sit down.  She turned to you, smiled, and waved.  \"Hi, there,\" she said as you waved back.  \"Nolan, he sure is cute, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNolan started to blush slightly, as his tail suddenly began to twitch involuntarily.  \"Uh, Wes, meet Kala, my best friend.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWes nodded, and Kala leaned down closely to whisper at him, though with as close as she get, he nearly got knocked over by the gust of wind that was her breath.  \"Take good care of Nolan this year, and he'll take good care of you.\"  She winked at you and then turned back to face the front of the class.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" you called up to Nolan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll, uh, tell you about it later,\" he said as the teacher walked into the room.  The teacher was much taller than any of the anthros Wes had yet seen, his head nearly brushing the ceiling.  He was a majestic-looking bald eagle, and he looked to be on the older side, though still with enough energy and strength to handle teaching high school.  He was wearing a blue sweater vest with a shirt and tie underneath, and brown corduroy pants.  The teacher sat his briefcase down on his desk, ruffled a few papers, then stood in front of the class and addressed the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class, I'm Dr. Kingston.  Yes, that's right: Dr.  I do have a PhD, and I didn't go through all those years of schooling to have people call me 'Mr.'  Now I don't know how the rest of the teachers handle their classes, but in here, you will learn, and you will learn a lot.  My goal is that every one of you at the end of the year will know all there is to know about geography, both in the anthro and in the human world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human geography?\" the mustang called from the back.  \"Why would we need to know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kingston looked down at a paper on his desk.  \"Mr. Chad Parker, I take it?  Let me tell you why you need to know that.  Have you heard of the state of Colorado, in the country called the United States?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad shrugged.  \"Maybe.  What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kingston was now pacing around the room.  \"Well, did you know that in that one state alone, there rests enough nuclear weaponry to wipe out all the anthro cities in the world twice over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad gulped.  \"I--I guess--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't, Mr. Parker!\" Dr. Kingston said, now standing in front of Chad's desk.  He brought his wings down forcibly onto the desk, causing a loud BANGing sound.  \"Most anthros don't know that human technology outpaces our own by a ten-to-one margin.  And if you are to become a leader in our society, that lack of knowledge could prove fatal.\"  Dr. Kingston circled his way back to the front of the room.  \"Now, I don't mean to say that humans are a threat to us; far from it.  In fact, the threat is not from the humans themselves, but from our ignorance of their world.  It is to that end that our school has agreed to host the first of what I hope to be many exchange students from the nearest human community.  Class, meet Wes Schafer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured towards you, and you sheepishly stood up, turned around and faced the class.  After the speech that Dr. Kingston just gave, you weren't sure how to respond, so you just gave a cheesy little wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wes will be learning with us this year, and one of our own students has gone to his school to learn as well.\" God, you had forgotten about that.  You weren't sure how your school would even be able to adapt to one of these massive creatures.  \"Nolan will be helping him get acquainted with our culture, so don't be too hard on either of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you sit back down.  You could feel the eyes of everyone staring at you, and you didn't know what to do.  Now, you realized, you weren't just a new student in a strange school; you were an ambassador for the entire human race.  At this point, you couldn't wait for this year to get over.</span></div></div>",

You could tell it was female, no doubt about it. Her wide hips, thin waist, and large breasts gave it away. Like most tigers, her fur was orange with black stripes. Her face had four large stripes on it. She had yellow eyes with the slotted pupil as well as many cats do. She wore glasses; not the nerdy kind, the kind that made you look really good. She wore a bright pink shirt that hung slightly over one of her shoulders. The shirt had a black heart in the middle of it. The jeans she wore seemed tight, the style most girls always wore. She seemed as calm as can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me in sir?\" asked Valerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valerie, this is Wesley\" explained Jacques. \"He is the human that is moving in with your family for the year. We thought that it would be in the best of things if you helped him out the first few couple of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie walked up and stretched out her paw to Wesley. Wesley noticed that not only does Valerie have retractable claws, but hers are much longer. But thankfully they were retracted. Wesley gently grabbed one of her fingers and shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\" Wesley said still pretty frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, do you think I would hurt you? I don't think your parents or my parents would be happy if their son was killed. Don't worry, I will not harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley nodded and decided to take her word for it, not like he had much of a chance. Jacques gave a good luck speech but Valerie left without him finishing it all. Wesley was being held in her paw. He still couldn't believe how attractive she is, even for an anthro. She looked down and spoke, \"Since I was supposed to help you, you are in all of my classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes since\" said Wesley, \"Which class are we in now?\"</span></div></div>",

You suddenly panic when the car lurches upward; looking to your side you see a giant pink paw pad completely covering the window.  Worried that the window will break, you roll it down.  Now you can see a friendly face with slit-pupiled eyes smiling in front of your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcom to Fangburg U, Lester Smith!\" the ocelot growls.  You can tell that the big cat is trying to be as unfrightening as possible.  You notice that a large pointy claw is sticking right outside your window, so you try to be friendly and give the ocelot an awkward handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lester, I am proud to have a human at my school, and I wish you a great four years here!

As much as you doubted them, you couldn\u2019t help but think about the stories you have heard from your friends, even though none of you had ever seen an anthro before. And now you would be boarding with them several thousand miles from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents had told you about how \u201cmentally-stimulating the experience would be\u201d while ranting on about \u201cwhat a big accomplishment this was for human-anthro relations,\u201d but once the school came into view on the horizon you began to have doubts. It took two more hours before you actually reached the school grounds, and by then you were frozen in awe at how large it really was. The road seemed to spread past the miles-high trees like an ocean as your parents drove down the miniscule extension reserved for humans. Pulling into the parking lot, you were harrowed by the fact the curb towered high above the car. In the back of your mind, you tried to piece together just how big the anthros would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the drop-off point, your parents helped you unload your things and give you a few pecks on the cheek. They reminded you to visit them next summer before driving off, leaving you alone on the curb of your new school. Shouldering your duffel bag, you worked your way up a ramp and finally onto the pathway. You looked around in amazement, seeing the massive double-doors of the main office in the distance. You were both relieved yet a bit disappointed when you didn\u2019t see any anthros hanging about. You prepared yourself for the long arduous task of reaching the door when you saw a figure looking at you through the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crossed the well-dressed anthro\u2019s face as he stepped out onto the sidewalk. You quickly figured him out to be an ocelot as he filled your line of vision. By the time he actually reached you, you were stunned when you realized that you were shorter than one of his toes. He kneeled down before you and held out one furry finger for you to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Evan Larkham,\u201d the ocelot greeted. You managed a quick nod, still taken aback at his size. \u201cWelcome to the North Paw High School.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid his hand on the ground, prompting you to climb on. You felt yourself raised to the ocelot\u2019s chest where he proceeded to talk to you while returning to the administration building. \u201cWe asked for you to come here a day early so we could discuss your accommodations,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe figured it would take some getting used to traveling around campus yourself, so we decided to room you with a few freshmen who volunteered to help you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed past the double doors and stepped into a massive lobby of sorts. He approached the unattended admissions counter and picked up what you assumed were your transfer papers before proceeding down a hallway.</span></div></div>",

Sure, you understand that you need to stay somewhere, but from what you know about yourself, fourteen-year-olds can be rowdy at times.  At this size, you fear that even the smallest bit of roughhousing can cause you serious harm.  As you near a room where you hear the loud yapping of two giant anthros, you quickly get the ocelot's attention by jumping up and down on his padded palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem, Evan?  I was just about to introduce you to your roomates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that I am just getting used to this whole idea of rooming with giant anthros, and I'm nervous.  Are you sure that it's safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ocelot let out a hearty laugh, causing you to lose your balance and fall flat on his palm.  Picking yourself up, the administrator explains that there is nothing to worry about.  \"Of course we didn't choose just any students to be your roomates.  These two are star pupils; they were on the honor roll in junior high and have very many hours of community service between them.  Here, I'll let you see for yourself what they are like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning a door knob larger than any water tower you have seen, the ocelot opens the door and walks in.  The talking you heard instantly stops, and two hulking behemoths get out of their chairs and walk towards you.  As impossible as it may seem, you realize that the ocelot holding you is actually pretty short as far as anthros go, since the teenagers are both about a head taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first student was a huge anthro canine, with grey fur specked with red and an athlete's build.  After he extends a fingerpad many times your height, you shake the wolf's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, you must be Evan.  I'm Windsor Timbers, but you can just call me Windy.\"  The timber wolf attempted a friendly smile, but the glistening house-sized fangs made you even more nervous than you already were.  Apparantly, Windy noticed this, and quickly removed his teeth from your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other student was a reptilian, with silvered horns and claws and covered in goldish colored scales.  He is also wearing glasses, and you note that the lenses are thicker than you are tall.  You shake his incredibly sharp index claw, and the gold dragon speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good to meet you, human.  I'm Gregor, by the way.\"  Unexpectedly, Gregor reaches a bit farther and wraps his huge fingers around you.  You are then carefully carried into the dragon's golden palm, easily the size of two football fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You boys should spend this time getting to know each other,\" says the ocelot.  \"Remember that the other students will show up tomorrow, and class begin the next day, Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the ocelot left the room, you half expected yourself to be ripped to pieces by your roomates.  But of course this does not happen; both the tremendous timber wolf and the gigantic golden dragon continue to treat you respectfully.  The two look at you standing in the dragon's hand, and you can tell by their looks that they are just as amazed at how tiny you are as you are astounded by their enormity.  Windy is the first to speak up.</span></div></div>",

Turning around, however, you come across a perfectly-sized bed and dresser sitting nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's where you'll be sleeping,\" Windy said. \"I guess you can unpack now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving him a quick nod, you place your duffel bag on the bed and begin to sort out your belongings. As you decided where everything would go, Windy and Gregor crouched down on either side of you, watching you with a curious spark in their eyes. Their unwavering stares began to grow somewhat unsettling, so in an attempt to take your mind off of it you start a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you began. \"How do you feel about entering high school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty excited,\" Windy said. \"But I'm also a bit intimidated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Gregor agreed. \"I mean, you don't know how it's going to turn out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still,\" Windy added. \"I can only imagine what it must be like for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've finished up, Windy lowered his massive handpaw for you to climb on. The three of you then headed for a third room, which you quickly made out to be a bathroom. Setting you down on the white tiled counter, Windy then nudged a small (at least to him) plastic container towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use this as a wash basin,\" he explained. \"And there's another one in the shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed you toothbrush and towel on the edge of the swimming-pool sized container before climbing onto Gregor's hand once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let us know if you need anything,\" Gregor said friendlily. \"We'll try to help you as much as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked them for their kindness, and for the first time since you got here you began to feel more relaxed.

Windy fishes around in his pocket and procures an enormous key, with which he locks the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Evan, I think it's about time that you saw the rest of North Paw High,\" spoke the timber wolf.  \"Our schedules were modified so that at least one of us is in each of your classes, so you shouldn't have to worry about getting around too much.\"  You feel a bit relieved; it was just now that you realized the possibility of going to a class of unfamiliar titans who might not be as friendly as Windy and Gregor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first stop is only a few doors down from the dorm, though it would take you half an hour by car to travel the relatively small distance.  \"This is the student lounge,\" spoke Windy, who was enthusiastically taking on the role of your guide.  As you were carried inside, you saw a cosy looking room with couches and ottomans surrounding a table.  \"This is where students living on campus can study in groups, or they can just hang out.\"  You absorb the friendly environment of the room before you are whisked away.  Soon, you are back at the entrance to the building.  \"Right now, we are in Sylvan Hall, where all of the on-campus students live, and also where the administration is.  Down those stairs is the cafeteria, which we will show you at dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWindy then opens the exit to Sylvan Hall, and he and Gregor step outside.  However, since you are much higher up than you are used to being, you are quite cold, and start to shiver.  Gregor notices this, and decides to hand you over to Windy.  Now standing in the hand of a warm-blooded anthro, you feel much better, and thank Gregor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really no trouble at all, Evan.  Now, do you see that large field to the north, where that little shack is?\"  You look past Windy's padded fingers, and are amazed to see what must be the largest field ever.  It seemed to stretch for thousands of miles, easily larger than most human countries.  \"That's Mastiff Field, where all of the outside activities and physical education take place.  I don't know much about human schools, but anthros place a very large emphasis on physical education and health.\"  You think about this; you have noticed that Windy and Gregor seem to be in excellent shape.  \"We have two PE classes a day; one in the morning and one in the afternoon.  The field is very big because the whole campus has PE at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to imagine all of those giant anthros in one place, but you cannot piece the image together in your mind.  Meanwhile, your two roomates continued to walk down the campus paths.  You notice that they are walking very slowly for their size, at a \"mere\" 500 miles per hour.  That's when you remember something from junior high school, that the speed of sound is somewhere between 700 and 800 miles.  Even at a casual pace, creatures this huge would cause a sonicboom just by walking.  You are sure that such a thing would not affect them, but it could cause you irrepairable hearing damage.  You realize that these two must have thought of everything when they agreed to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a twenty minute walk, which could have taken three if you weren't slowing your new friends down, Windy and Gregor stop near an impressive building with a green roof.  You notice that you are starting to feel a bit more used to the large size differences.  Windy cleared his throat, which you could feel rumbling through his huge body.  \"This is Muzzle Hall, where all of the natural sciences and mathematics are offered.  Math classes are on the first floor, biology is on the second, and physics is on the third.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly whizz to the left, and see a similar looking building with a red roof.  \"Right next to Muzzle Hall is Gossamer Hall, where the social sciences and related classes like philosophy and language meet.\"  Whizzing left again, you see a much larger building down the path, easily the size of the three other buildings combined, and that's not even including the impossibly large structure next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, this is the Behemoth Building.  This is where art classes are held, and is also where the teacher's offices are.  And next to it is Behemoth Auditorium, where the faculty make schoolwide announcements and where the art students hold their performances.  Well, that's the tour, I guess,\" concluded Windy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I think that they will also have the school dance in there,\" added Gregor, winking his enormous eye at you.  Right now, you try not to think that far ahead into the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you and your two enormous new friends start heading back to Sylvan Hall.  The sun is still up, but you stomach is growling a bit since all you had to eat today was airline food.  However, your friends didn't seem to be hungry yet.  They looked at you, in Windy's palm, as if they had always been your friend, and you almost felt like you belonged.  After the twenty minute walk back to the door, you ask your roomates a question.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think it relieves stress. I also play chess and basketball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWindy placed you on your bed before he spoke. \"I like to build things just because I think its fun.

I'm a pretty good track runner, and I try to go bowling whenever I have a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded as they elaborated on their interests.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Windy and Gregor carry you down the stairs to the cafeteria, your ears pop from the pressure change.  The air is a bit stagnant, which is expected several miles underground.  The cafeteria is extremely huge; you cannot tell where the walls are.  Most of the plateau-like tables have mountainous chairs placed on top of them, and there seems to be nobody around.  However, as your roomates walk over to the counter to the right of the entrance, you realize that there are two other huge anthros wearing huge aprons; one is a plump badger lady and the other is a younger ferret woman.  Gregor leans on the counter, holding you a bit outward and Windy addresses the badger lady at the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss, the three of us would like to eat now.\"  The badger woman looks confused, but then, looking closer at you in Gregor's palm, exclaimed, \"Ah, I see, you must be the two boys who are helping the human out this year!\"  Both of your friends nod their huge heads.  \"Well, since the students aren't due to come until tomorrow morning, we don't have the full menu up yet, only basic meals.  Are hot dogs or hamburgers okay with you three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a bit surprised that hot dogs and hamburgers are part of an anthro's diet; your friends all told you that they eat all of their food raw.  Windy ordered a double hamburger without cheese, and Gregor ordered three hot dogs with extra mustard.  You notice Gregor reach into his pocket and pull out paper notes that could cover a city block, and the badger lady returns coins that could fit a whole house on one of their faces for change.  As the ferret woman starts cooking the food, Gregor carries you off to the soda fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that you don't mind sharing with us,\" spoke Gregor.  \"Its just that the food here does not come in portions your size, and I'm sure Windy or I wouldn't miss a crumb or two.\"  You completely understand Gregor, but asked him how you would be able to pay for all of your supplies when anthro money is so big.  Gregor just laughs as a waterfall of cherry soda cascades into a massive cup.  \"Don't worry, the program you are in has already paid for all of your books and stuff like that.  If you do need anything, I'll be happy to pay for it; I don't see how anything you could need would cost more than a few cents, anyway.\"  You laugh along with Gregor, then watch him fill another cup with hundreds of gallons of fruit punch.  You suddenly find yourself underneath thousands of tons of bevarage, as Gregor lifts one of the drinks above his palm with his sturdy clawed fingers.  He is clearly making absolutely sure that he has a firm grip, since dropping something that size would mean the end for you.  You assume he has the other beverage in his other hand, since you can feel the golden dragon start to walk somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel much safer when the huge cup is lifted off Gregor's fingers.  Replacing them now are a massive finger and thumb from Gregor's other hand, which gently lift you onto a soft napkin.  Looking around you, you see that Windy has brought all of the food to a table, which you are now on.  The fast food is enormous; the hot dogs are the size of thirty story buildings, and the hamburger is larger than a stadium.  Windy lightly scrapes his burger with a claw, then places a hunk of ground meat twice your size next to you.  You taste the meat, and it does taste just like a regular hamburger patty.  You look up to thank your two friends, but instead you are caught up in fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way that Windy lifts that burger and bites off nearly half of it scares you a bit.  Boulder sized beef bits cling to the sides of his mouth as he savagely chews the burger.  Gregor is not much better; his draconic snout is long enough to nearly stuff a whole hot dog in his mouth at once.  Huge globs of mustard dribble off his chin as he devours the food.  If you weren't so hungry, you would have likely been turned off by these bad eating habits.  However, you remember that even though they are so polite and gentle with you, they're still only fourteen or fifteen, and since when does anyone your age eat fast food politely?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready having polished off his burger, Windy starts to chug down his cherry soda.  Gregor seems a bit disappointed and instead addresses you.  You notice huge chunks of meat in between is pointy teeth.  \"Well, I guess you won't have cherry soda.  How would you like some of my lemonade now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burger is making you thirsty, so you nod to Gregor as you chew a bite.  You see Gregor pick up a straw and dunk it in his lemonade.  Then, putting his thumb on the top of the straw, he carries the straw over your napkin and starts to lower it down.  The sweet drink is just above your head, so you tilt back and swallow large gulps of the lemonade.  When you are finished, your face is covered in the sticky beverage.  Gregor then lifts the straw over his head and releases his thumb, causing a stream to pour into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you hear an extremely LOUD noise that shakes the table and sends you bumping into your burger hunk.  Looking up, you see Windy covering his mouth with his massive paw.  \"Um, excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you laugh.  After finishing the delightful meal, Windy suggests...</span></div></div>",

You would probably have to stay on everyone's good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Windy yawns, that yawn is powerful enough to suck in several skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we are all getting tired.\" Gregor says, you nod, as you now feel the day taking it's toll on you. You are placed on your bed, Gregor shouts lights and the lights go out, you had brought several books with you to read, and your Nintendo DS and LOZ PH and Pokemon Diamond, but you are too-tired to play or read, you here goodnights, you pass them back, you would never know about the events going to take place tomorrow...</span></div></div>",

Such a fate came when you had to live on Gao-L the anthro planet. It had been a thousand years ago when this planet had first been discovered and the titanic inhabitants of the planet hadn't always had the best relationships with humans. At one point both species were at war, but a comet called the Nemesis based by Earth and caused abnormal weather conditions that albeit temporary, forced some humans to take refuge on Gao-L.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh. You were a descendent of humans who moved to the planet and spent your life living in the domed cities the anthros built for human visitors. However, now you were heading to Laird-Tech, a college for giant anthros. You were one of only a few students selected to take part and you were almost there. You look up to see the bus driver, a gigantic gorilla was finally reaching the school. \"Here we are. This is the last stop for humans going on campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately get out of your seat and take your bags from the overhead compartment before walking out of a ramp with the rest of the human students. Soon you're in a human sized waiting room looking at your watch and let out a yawn. It was only 9:00 in the morning. The anthros like to get up early it seems. Soon you hear your name called. \"Jimmy Devlin, come in now.\" You run into the main waiting room and see that you're on a giant counter, you look up and see the R.A., a gigantic Chinese dragon anthro with bright black scales, looking down on you holding a clipboard in the air. \"Welcome to Laird-Tech Mr. Devlin,\" he says. \"First year in an anthro college.\" \"That's it,\" you say nodding your head. \"Major, undecided. I'm going to try several classes this semester to see for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon nods his head and then gestures for you to walk forward and immediately, he snaps a photograph of you and soon you're given your student ID. \"There you go Jimmy,\" says the R.A. \"And let me be the first to welcome you personally to Scarlet Glen. Your room number is 322A. I'll personally escort you to your new roommate.\" \"Thanks.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon picks you up and walks you up the stairs as you hold up your student ID. You couldn't believe it, you were officially a college student and one to giant anthros. It makes you wonder. Soon, the R.A. reaches your room and knocks on the door. This was it, you were going to meet your new roommate. You cross your fingers and hope that you'll get along with whoever or whatever the creature is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens up and you see your new roommate...</span></div></div>",

She was a titanic hippopotamus anthro with gold-colored skin and long orange-blonde hair. She was wearing a black shirt with a blue jacket and skin tight jeans that looked ready to break off. Since the girl was a hippo anthro, she was massively obese, especially in her belly and butt. You look up in awe and see that she has a blue heart shaped tattoo above her right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy Devlin,\" says the R.A. \"Meet your new roommate Elisabeth Wakeman.\" You look up nervously at your new hippo roommate and wave before she looks down and smiles before she totally gushes over you. \"AAAW!\" screams Elisabeth in a schoolgirl's voice that forces you to cover your ears. \"So that's a human? He's so adorable. Nice to meet you.\" You hold out your hand as Elisabeth reaches out the tip of her finger for you to shake. That's when she grabs you and pushes you against her the side of her face as you grunt. At least she's friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon R.A. nods his head. \"I'll leave you two to get acquainted. Classes don't begin until Monday so you two have plenty of time to get to know each other. Good luck in the school year.\" As the R.A. leaves, Elisabeth puts you on the side of a table and lowers her head to your level. \"Sorry about that,\" the hippo giantess says. \"But I've never seen a human up close before Jimmy. You're just so cute, I could just eat you up.\" Elisabeth then teases you by opening her mouth big enough to hold a city and you see large hippo teeth as big as skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she's scaring you, Elisabeth shuts her mouth and blushes. \"Oh, I'm sorry little guy. I just lost myself.\" You let out a laugh. \"It's okay Elisabeth. I just didn't expect my roommate to be a girl.\" Elisabeth giggles as she starts to hang several posters. As she does, she gives you a view of her titanic rear, each cheek a moon in comparison to you. She's wearing white panties with blue hearts on them, but that doesn't stop your nose from bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turn your head before your roommate could notice you staring at her generously sized rump. \"So,\" says Elisabeth. \"What major are you in?\" \"Uh, I'm undecided. You?\" Elisabeth puts her hands on her hips and smiles proudly. \"I'm in the law department. One day, I'm gonna be a cop. Elisabeth puts her hand over her heart and you imagine her in a cop's uniform and then have to grab your nose. \"Geez,\" says Elisabeth. \"That's some nosebleed you have Jimmy. I know something that's good for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisabeth reaches into the fridge in her side of the room before taking out some grapes. She plucks one off and then puts in in front of you It's four times bigger than you, but you don't want to be rude so you start to bite into it. You then see Elisabeth toss the rest of the grapes into her maw and swallow them whole. You're slightly worried before Elisabeth lets out a feminine belch and response. \"Excuse me about that. And don't worry. I'm a vegetarian. The only way you'd wind up in this mouth is with a kiss.\" You let out a blush and then you get back to unpacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens after you and Elisabeth are done unpacking?</span></div></div>",

You look out and see that there were 4 anthro girls as colossal and fat as your hippopotamus girlfriend. All five of them were ungulates just like Elisabeth. First of them was a giant two-humped camel girl with blackish brown hair and violet fur. She was dressed as a goth girl and had black lipstick on. Her fishnet stockings were struggling on her arms and legs not to snap off due to her immense mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl was an orange-red colored rhinoceros giantess who was wearing a white shirt with a white ascot, an indigo blue jacket and a black skirt. She had short bluish black hair and was wearing a pair of glasses as well as a pair of pearl earrings. She was studying a book before she took her head out of it and turned it in the direction of Elisabeth. \u201cHey, Elisabeth.\u201d She said before returning to her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third of the girls was an obese sheep giantess with aqua-colored wool all over her body and curved black horns but also with long blood-red hair that had rainbow highlights at her sideburns. She was wearing a black and white spotted shirt and skirt. From the looks of it, the girl knew how to dress and she was still applying makeup on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast of the girls was a yellow-green furred cow woman with viridian spots. She had long carrot-red hair and a blue tattoo of a cow\u2019s head over her left eye. She wore nothing but a pink jacket, a yellow tanktop and a biker\u2019s cap because she had a large udder that made it impossible for her to wear pants. This cow giantess gave a sly smile as she looked at Elisabeth and walked her way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, Elisabeth, you\u2019re in a very good mood today.\u201d Elisabeth gave a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re as observant as always, Delilah.\u201d The rhinoceros girl then smirked. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t she be? We made it into college. Though, with some of us, it was more obvious it would happen than with others.\u201d The rhino girl was speaking to the sheep who gave an indignant look her way. \u201cDon\u2019t even try to look like a college student, Barbara. We both know very well that you\u2019re mainly here to play pranks.\u201d Barbara gave a smirk at the sheep. Elisabeth let out a laugh. \u201cLooks like Barbara is still picking on Celina.\u201d You look through your massive hippopotamus girlfriend\u2019s breasts and see that it\u2019s perfectly clear that she\u2019s got quite the colorful bunch of friends. \u201cSo, come on, Elisabeth,\u201d said Delilah. \u201cWhat\u2019s up.\u201d Elisabeth smiled and then shook her breasts, causing you some mild discomfort as you fell deeper and deeper into the hippopotamus\u2019s cleavage. \u201cOh,\u201d said Elisabeth. \u201cI just met my new roommate and he\u2019s so cute, I decided to make him my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls look at Elisabeth in surprise. In the process, Celina accidentally applies lipstick to her cheek and Barbara falls flat on her large rhinoceros rump right before the goth camel girl stares at Elisabeth. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d said Delilah with a stomp. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. I wish I could find somebody as easy as you. What is he? A mammoth? A wildebeest? Oh, I hope not a crocodile, your folks would have a fit.\u201d Then the cow woman grunts as the camel pushes her out of the way. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d said the camel giantess as her own enormous breasts and belly push against your girlfriend\u2019s own, a sea of purple fur in front of you. \u201cWhy would they assign a boy to be your roommate?\u201d Celina, Delilah and Barbara realize this and then stare at Elisabeth. \u201cAngela\u2019s right,\u201d said Barbara. \u201cThat does sound suspicious.\u201d At this point, you were at breast level to 5 giantesses who each stood 8000ft high. \u201cExactly when are we going to meet this mysterious man?\u201d asked Celina. Elisabeth gave a smirk. \u201cRight now.\u201d \u201cElisabeth?\u201d you ask. \u201cWhat are you... urk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Elisabeth reaches down into her massive cleavage and picks you up between two of her skyscraper-sized and very thick fingers. She holds you up in front of the massive faces of her four friends. \u201cTa-da.\u201d All four of the giantesses look in surprise as they see you on the tip of Elisabeth\u2019s finger. \u201cJimmy,\u201d said Elisabeth. \u201cThese are my closest friends, Angela, Barbara, Celina and my best friend, Delilah.\u201d Barbara adjusts her glasses before she realizes what\u2019s going on. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cThe university just recently started to accept humans.\u201d \u201cAw!\u201d screamed Celina forcing you to cover your ears. \u201cYou are so lucky, Elisabeth. He\u2019s just so tiny and cute. I wish I had a bite-sized human as my boyfriend. He\u2019s so cute, I could just eat him up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look in fear as Celina shows you her massive teeth and opens her mouth wide. After spending some time inside Elisabeth\u2019s mouth, you did not want to see the inside of another anthro\u2019s anytime soon. However, you then see Barbara, Angela and Delilah lower their heads to your level and lick their lips. \u201cHe\u2019s so small, you actually could swallow him up,\u201d said Angela. \u201cI\u2019d bet he\u2019d taste scrumptious.\u201d \u201cHey, human,\u201d says Delilah teasingly as she opens wide. \u201cBe a good boy and get in my mouth.\u201d \u201cHey!\u201d yells Barbara. \u201cNo fair. I want to eat him.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Angela. \u201cI\u2019d just love to have a tiny human running around inside me.\u201d What these massive girls were saying scared you. They were actually joking about eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisabeth however, comes to your rescue and gives a loud snort. \u201cKnock it off you girls,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring him. And don\u2019t even think about it. He\u2019s my boyfriend and if anybody is going to eat him, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d Elisabeth\u2019s friends just laugh out loud. \u201cCome on, Elisabeth,\u201d said Delilah as she shakes her huge udder. \u201cWe were just kidding.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d Said Angela. Elisabeth then gave a blush. \u201cActually,\u201d she said. \u201cJust now, I almost did eat Jimmy. I kissed too hard and accidentally licked him into my mouth.\u201d You rub the tip of your girlfriend\u2019s lower lip. \u201cAccidents happen, Elisabeth.\u201d Elisabeth\u2019s friends all laugh at that. \u201cLucky,\u201d said Delilah. \u201cI bet it felt good having such a tiny man in your mouth like that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll bet you could fit three human cities in that mouth,\u201d said Barbara. \u201cHe\u2019s so small, he could live in your mouth.\u201d The girls all laugh and you laugh as well. At least Elisabeth\u2019s friends were nice enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d said Celina. \u201cIt\u2019s almost suppertime. You two have got to join us for dinner, I know a place in the area that serves the best...\"</span></div></div>",

Be good for the really big animal people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have seen the really big animal people before, but you did not think that they could see you.  Their heads go up too high to see, and you can only see up to their ankles on cloudy days.  Also, people have told you that the big animal people usually stay very far away from regular humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Earth shook!  You start to shout and feel like crying, but you want to act like a big boy, so you don't.  You look out very far, and instead of the hills, you see a really tall mountain.  However, you see the curve at the end, and you realize that the mountain is in reality a gigantic claw!  You tremble, and suddenly two hard things squeeze your sides!  You feel your body go way, way up high, above the clouds, until the suburb below you looks very small.  From this height, you can see the whole claw is larger than the suburb.  You are very afraid now, but a calm voice talks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid, Mikey, I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm Miss Talons, and I will be your teacher this year.

She looks at you with kind, pretty green eyes, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the surface you are standing on starts to move around!  You turn around and see four mountains start to fall towards you!  You try to run away, but the mountains are far too big for you to go anywhere.  You then realize that the mountains are actually fingers, and soon you do not see anything except for very long and very thin lines of light in the sky.  You can still hear Miss Talons, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Mikey, I'm just making sure that you do not blow off my hand while I fly to school,\" your teacher says.  Soon, you feel her hand move around a lot again, and this time you also hear loud beating wings.  Soon, you also hear a very loud exploding sound, and you wonder what that could be.  It is too dark to see anything, but Miss Talons must be moving fast, since you feel yourself being tightly pressed against her scaly palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what must have been forever, you hear another explosion, and you find out that you can stand up again.  The mountain-fingers lift up off you, and you are amazed to see a huge building in front of you.  It is so big, you are sure that a bazillion million people could fit inside.  \"Wow!\" you cry, \"That's the biggest school ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really not that big, actually,\" says your teacher.  As you look at other buildings that are even bigger than the kindergarten, Miss Talons walks through the front doors and towards a super big classroom.  You are even more amazed to see even more really big animal people, except that they look like they are your age!  All of this hugeness is making you feel very tiny and scared, though, and you do not know if it is a good idea to play with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Talons suddenly says something in a much louder voice.  \"Attention, class, will everyone please sit in a circle?  I would like to introduce you all to our new, special student!\"  All of the really big animal kids stopped what they were doing and obediently sat on the floor in a circle.  All of them looked very excited.  Suddenly, you feel yourself go way, way down as the teacher sits down in the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everyone, please meet our human student.  Introduce yourself, Mikey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Talon's huge hand extended into the middle of the circle.  You suddenly feel very nervous to have so many different kinds of huge animal people looking at you.  \"Um, hello, I'm Mikey,\" you manage to utter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI, MIKEY!\" all of the students yell.  You have to cover your ears from the noise.  You look at the big group of your 4-mile tall classmates.  They are all smiling at you ...</span></div></div>",

You smile back to them, because you like being with friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, class, let us all introduce ourselves to Mikey,\" says Miss Talons.  \"I would like you to pass Mikey around the circle, and tell him your name and species.  Remember, though, that Mikey is a human, so you all have to be very gentle and careful when handling him.\"  You do not know what a 'species' is, but you are probably going to find out soon, so you do not ask your teacher any questions.  You feel the world move as Miss Talon's hand maneuvers to her right.  Soon, you see another hand above you, except instead of having yellow scales, this one is covered in white fur and has big black mounds on the palm and fingertips.  Very carefully, you are pressed against two of these mounds and lifted off of your teacher's hand.  You feel yourself flipped sideways, and find yourself lying on a giant thumb, looking at a cute, fuzzy face of a giant boy animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mikey, my name is Boris, and I'm a polar bear!\"  You wave hello to Boris, and he wiggles a finger back at you.  Suddenly, everything goes black again as Boris places his pointer finger back on your body.  As you move to the right again, you realize that \"species\" must be a word for \"kind of animal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you are placed on another black surface, but this one feels slippery and rubbery.  Looking up past shiny, smooth mountain-fingers, you can see a pudgy face of a fishy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Ambergry, an orca,\" she says shyly.  You do not know what an orca is, but her toothy smile reminds you of a dolphin, so you think that an orca is kind of like a dolphin.  Next, you can see a big orange blob falling down onto you, and you want to tell the teacher that this animal kid is not being gentle like she said.  However, the orange blob is very soft and squishy, so you aren't hurt one bit.  The blob is very sticky, too, so when the blob lifts up, you are stuck in place and do not fall down.  Replacing Ambergry's hand is now is a funny looking boy, with a very green face and giant red eyes that look too big even for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, ooh, I am Thadius, and my species is a, is a, is a Tree Frog!\"  You can tell that Thadius is what your mommy would call \"Hyper\" by the amount of energy he has.  The next student has a hand that looks kind of like your teachers, but it is brown, not yellow.  One of the really big claws gently scrapes you off of Thadius's sticky finger, and then wipes you onto a palm.  You look up and jump back at the scary fangs on the big animal's face, but when you heard her soft, soothing voice, you forgot all about your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, little Mikey, I'm Nagatha, a rattlesnake.\"  You then hear a loud rattling noise come from her wiggling tail, and see that Nagatha is showing off her rattle.  You can see that her tail goes right up to belly, without any legs.  You think that its funny and cool that giant snake people get to have arms but no legs, and tell her so.  She lets out a funny giggle and pats your head with one of her claws before she hands you over to the next animal kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the next kid to be very funny looking.  The hand you are placed in has very big claws, even bigger than Miss Talons' talons, but on a hand that is too small for them.  You can see his face covered in greasy black fur, most of which is behind giant glasses, along with tiny looking beady eyes.  But the funniest part of his face is the nose, which looks like it is covered in little fingers!  You try hard not to laugh at the giant animal boy as you look at his nervous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi Mikey, I'm Spangle,\" says the funny kid in a nasally voice.  \"I'm a star-nosed mole.\"  You could hear several other students snicker a bit, but you do not, because you don't want to hurt his feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at the circle and noticed that Miss Talons is sitting across from Spangle, which means that you have met half of your new students.  So far, you like all of the students you have met so far, and are actually excited to meet the rest.  You wait anxiously as Spangle pinches you gently in his big claws.</span></div></div>",

You look at the kid's face to see that it has a beak like the teacher's, but the color of its feathers, and its hand are different. Instead of the scales like the teachers, you see brown feathers covering a hand-like structure. \"My name is Josh, and I am a red-tailed hawk.\" you look at his arms, and you  think those are his wings (Josh is a different style of anthro, kind of like Falco from Starfox.). You smile at him, and he seems happy. He then gently drops you onto a hand much like Boris', but smaller and completely black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Mikey, my name is Catherine, and I am a black cat.\" She rolled her R's a bit when she introduced herself. Her eyes were a very bright green, and you told her you really liked how shiny they were, and she took the compliment very well. You asked her about the things coming off her nose, and she told you they were whiskers, which helped her sense things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are then shipped off to the next kid. His hands were a lot like yours, but unlike yours, its hands were completely black, like Catherine's hands. You looked up to a face that resembled the structure of your own. \"Hi, Mikey, I'm George, and I am a gorilla.\" He then tickles your stomach as lightly as he can, and you giggle. George hands you off to a green hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you are on the next kid's hand, the green scales turn into scales that are the color of your shirt. You look to see a face that resembles Thadius, but with a smaller mouth, and eyes that aren't absolutely huge. \"Mikey, my name is Camilla, a chameleon. I can change the color of my skin to resemble my surroundings.\" That explains the scale thing. You tell you think the whole thing is really neat. Her hands are then replaced by another paw-like hands, except the fur on these were gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the kid, and you see a long muzzle protruding from the rest of his head, with teeth on the sides that scared you because of their unbelievable size. He sees this, and then hides his teeth in his mouth. His claws look a little sharp as well. \"Uh, sorry, uh, my name is Ralph, and I am...a...uh...gray wolf.\" His voice sounded very nervous, and you could tell he was really shy. You flash him a reassuring smile, and then you are picked up again by the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright class, now that introductions are finished, let's move on to our first activity for today...\"</span></div></div>",

You immediately raise your hand, and surprisingly, so do all of the super big animal kids.  \"Yes, Catherine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans are really, really, really small!\" shouts Catherine.  Most of the other kids now put their hands back down, but you do not agree with what Catherine says.  Before the teacher can call on you, you shout back to Catherine, \"No, people aren't small, they are normal sized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh!\" disagrees the black cat.  \"If humans are normal sized, then why aren't they anthro sized?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Cause anthros are really big!\" you shout back.  Both of you are then hushed by the Miss Talons.  \"Please, indoor voices!  Listen, Mikey, to us anthros, humans are indeed very small, but that does not mean that you aren't normal sized as well.  Normal sized can mean different things for different races.\"  You nod your head, glad that your teacher is so smart.  \"Now, does anyone else know anything about humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you hear a rattling, and notice Nagatha bouncing up and down with her clawed hand in the air.  She speaks after she is called on, \"Humans live in a place that is just for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Nagatha.\"  Miss Talons reaches behind her with the clawed hand not carrying you, and she passes out piece of paper with maps of Earth on them.  She lays one of them in her lap for you to look at.  Right now, she is pointing at a small spot of green colored land much smaller than the tip of her finger.  You notice that the rest of the land on the map was colored red, and places with water were colored blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, class, this is where the humans live, in the green area, and the anthros live everywhere else in the red area.\"  At first you do not think that's fair, but looking at how big the animal people are, you reason that they need a lot more land to hold them all.  Miss Talons then starts to talk about how humans live in cities, farm for food, and have a civilization.  All of this stuff you already know and find boring, but all of the other kids look very interested, by how their eyes are so wide.  However, by the words the teacher is using, you find out that she is saying that humans live a lot like how anthros do, and you are surprised that animals people that are so big live so much like humans.  You continue listening throughout the whole talk, which is several hours long.  You do not remember ever being able to pay attention to a grown up talk for so long, so you think that Miss Talons must be a very good teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the talk, Miss Talons tells everyone what is next.</span></div></div>",

In no time at all his huge thumb and finger scooped you up like a speck of dust and placed you on the swing set.  You felt like you were in a desert made of red plastic, since the spot is still warm from Boris sitting on the swing.  \"Miss Talons said that I can't make you go as high as I did without you falling off, so I'm going to push the swing softer, okay Mikey?\"  asked your super huge bear buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, as long as I can go really high!\"  You see the tip of Boris's black paw pad far away come very slowly closer to the edge of the swing set.

However, when you look up, you see that the swing is barely moving at all to Boris.  The polar bear boy is laughing heartily, \"Wow, Mikey, that's really neat that I can make you have so much fun while doing so little!\"  Boris lightly touches the swing yet again with the tiniest twitch of his paw, and you go even farther forward.

However, when you look up this time, the swing still looks practically still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are having a lot of fun on the swing, what is even more fun is Boris's reaction.  Although he is only poking the swing as light as he can with his finger, he looks very happy and laughs very loudly.  You know that he must be happy because he is so surprised that he can make a human have so much fun doing almost nothing at all.  You find this very interesting as well.  What is nothing to an anthro can be everything to a human at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell rings, Boris brings you inside.  Right now, it is time for...</span></div></div>",

You were able to somewhat make out what those large as they came closer, and you came to a conclusion that they were in fact....TALONS!  \"Is this...anthro.....a.......?\" Your thoughts were interrupted by a voice of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this......?\" You heard a raspy, rather awkward sounding voice in the distance. But all you could do was stand there and take in the sight of two pairs of large bird claws stamping in your very direction, the sunlight partially reflecting off of the claws, making them shine a little.  \"Uhhhhh.....hooman? Hewman? Uhh, haman?\"  The strange voice questioned with a confused sounding tone to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you pronounce this name?\"  The voice questioning itself again.  The glimmering talons now closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing here?!\" You ask yourself in a panicking tone.  \"There's a giant bird walking towards me, with no idea how to pronounce my name or species, and is UNAWARE of the fact that I'm in his path!  I gotta get outta the way!\"  You said to yourself snapping out of the trance the giant shining claws have put you under.  With the claws now at a dangerous distance you try to thrust your body out of the bird's deadly path, you fumble on your clumsy self and fall flat on your back.  Once again, you hear the strange voice \"He should be right here, where is he?\"  The bird asked himself again, his steps becoming more slow and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay on your back, what you see is something completely unimaginable.  A giant colorful body, mixtures of red, blue, yellow, and green, and a large white beak with some black mixed in, with two large eyes looking at what looks like a piece of paper in his feathered hand, still unaware of the small creature he is about to step on.  Despite your current situation, you just lay there and stare at the beauty of this god-like avian.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this guy's further ahead\" The raspy voice said, the voice being no longer distant \"Still don't know how to say this name....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the booming of his steps picked up again and just like that you snapped out of your little bird watching session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! I forgot! Giant talons of doom!\" You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, a glimmering clawed foot hovered above you, and all you could do was stare at it, getting in every detail of the rough-skinned looking foot as it closed in on you, noticing some small twigs and leaves stuck in the creases of the giant's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like this!\"  You sob, bracing for a painful end to your young life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your eyes tightly closed you feel a powerful tremor and loud sound of cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I.....?\" You whimper, afraid to open your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you hear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he should be RIGHT here\" A familiar voice said in a confident tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that you quickly open your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" You gasp to yourself. \"I'm not....dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hastily gather your bearings and observe your surroundings and notice that you appear to be in some cave, or at the bottom of a ravine because you see light shining through the top. Then it hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez! Don't tell me I'm......\"  You try not to accept the truth until you look up and see the a colorful head looking around curiously in the opening of the ravine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In between his toes....\"  You sigh to yourself.  Then something else strikes you as you look at the walls that are his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...I'm so small....well....at least he stopped walking for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around your new environment.  \"How can I get this guy's attention?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing trapped between two toes surprisingly gave you much needed pacing space.  Then after a moment, you come up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, what if I tried this?\"  You walked over to the \"walls\" and began poking and gently sliding your fingers across the gray rough surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...\" You hear a laughter building up in the bird's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh you felt that huh?\"  You chuckle to yourself as you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"walls\" started to slowly move up and down and the laughter from above intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe who's doing that? Heheehe\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird looked down raising the foot that had imprisoned you and at last, you saw the light again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed with relief as the colossal toes released you and the outside world was now visible once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! I'm so sorry!\" The avian's voice boomed as he noticed you standing where his foot was.  \"Are you the...uhh hewman?\"  He asked nervously taking a few big steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the nervous face on the colorful bird, his pupils wide and his beak gaping looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...Yes!\"  You shout trying not to quiver in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I am so very, very sorry!\"  The bird apologized again, carefully kneeling down to get a better view of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh it's nothing! I'm Jeremy by the way!\"  You hold out your hand to the majestic being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A handshake? Oh! Yes! Sorry!\"  He holds out a massive blue feathered finger for you to grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were trying to shake the feather that was bigger than a house, the bird spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh where are my manners? I'm William! It's a huge pleasure Jeremy!\"  He said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise William!\"  You reply, letting go of his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your travel here was not too tiresome.\"  William said, the voice forming a more formal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was long...but I hope it will pay off in the end as we learn about each other.\"  You politely reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course! Don't worry Jeremy! You're journey will not go in vain!\"  William reassured you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we should get going\"  You suggest to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Yes, let's be on our way!\"  He said with haste in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep in mind though...this place is..well...different than your schools Jeremy\"  William began to explain to you.  \"By protocol I must...carry you, if that is fine, to your classes and keep a constant watch on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem at all!  I completely understand.\"  You told William.  \"I know they can't have a little bag of flesh running around getting stepped on...heheheh\"  You joked with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled \"Well then, Let's be off!\"  He ordered, laying his feathered hand on the ground before you.  \"Hop on!  No time to waste!\"  He ordered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed onto his hand, feeling the soft feathers as you get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, next stop....\"  He said, slowly standing up.  \"History class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and began walking with you in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes of awkward silence while being carried on a large red plane of feathers surrounded by five blue mountains, with the constant sound of an ambient rumbling, you decide to break the ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So William...\"  You begin, turning your attention to the giant face looking straight ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Tell me about yourself\"  You finish speaking your request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a pair of giant eyes look down on you, the beaked face still with its attention forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\"  He starts to reply in a slight raspy tone.  \"My name is William, as you already know...heh\"  He lets out a few small chuckles.  \"I'm seventeen years old...\"  He continues.  \"And not to brag but I'm part of a special club here in the school that's exclusive to high class avians such as *ahem* myself.\"  He stated with some cockiness leaking from his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\"  You murmur to yourself.  \"That explains the clothes I guess.\"  You mumble again examining what you can of his clothing.  You had to admit though, this bird dressed pretty classy.  A sky blue polo with what looked like a gold and brown coat of arms being held up by two magnificent looking birds at the top right of the torso.  Dark brown slacks that look pretty costly, and in fact while you he was picking you up, you noticed a huge chrome band around his left wrist, that could very well be a fancy watch of sorts.  You had a feeling you weren't the only reason why he dressed that way.  You return your attention to the giant watchful eyes and listen some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And also,\"  He continues.  \"The leader of the club is an eagle named George, and guess what?\"  He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...What?\"  You reply, bracing for another harmless bragging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the teacher of the history class!\"  He exclaims happily.  \"And when he heard I was going to be the partner of an alien, he said he was going to make a special welcome for you!\"  William happily shouted.  \"I might have ruined the surprise but I thought since you're most likely a nervous wreck about this whole thing you could use some comforting words.\"  He says smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow...I uhh, don't know what to say.  Thanks!\"  Just like that, your almost overwhelming anxiety vanished and for once you felt safe standing on this giant parrot's hand, and the rumbling footsteps didn't seem to bother you anymore.  You just smiled at him and actually sat down in his titanic palm and relaxed for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam chuckles.  \"Feeling better? Heh.  Just sit back and enjoy your ride on the SS William!\"  He jokingly orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh a little with him and begin to lay down in the feathered plane, your arms crossed behind your head when suddenly you remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" You shout.  \"Forgot to tell you a little about myself!\"  You remind William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a loud ringing noise, making you cover your ears begins to go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That would be the bell!\" Williams states as the deafening ringing stops.  \"We better hurry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after he said that, the rumbling you heard was becoming even more constant, and less ambient, yet it doesn't feel like William is moving faster.  You look forward and what you see at the end of the seemingly infinite corridor of giant lockers paralyzes you.  Doors that could very well match the size of Mount Everest begin to slowly open, followed by louder rumbling and what sounds like a thousand voices talking.  Then you see it, dozens of colossal beings pour out of the doorways.  You can make out some of the creatures as they walk through.  Cats,  some dogs, a crow with its arm wrapped around a hawk's shoulders as if they're good buddies, a lion talking with what looks like a bright green lizard and some other unique animals, all walking to their destination without a care in the world.  You wish you could say the same for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, history class isn't that way.\"  A raspy voice you've come to love assures you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and relax in his palm again.  \"That's a relief!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, it's in this room right here!\"  He states again, presenting you to a door with a thin but very large window revealing some desks with some anthros already filling in some spots, a bookshelf with a globe on top of it, and a poster with what looks like the flags of Earth's countries being displayed, with an eagle wearing an outfit similar to William's sitting in a desk with mountains of paperwork on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's him!  That's George!\"  William excitingly told you.  \"You'll get along with him just fine, trust me!\"  He said while using his free hand to open the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door made a slight creak that was probably nothing to William, but to you it was pretty loud.  You feel a cool gush of air overcome you as enter the room, followed by the attention of the well-dressed eagle and some other anthro students turning to you and your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr. Getty!\"  William shouts to the majestic bird raising his free hand as a greeting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle examines him for a moment and notices you in his hand.  \"Well a fine 'hello' to you too William!  And a very special 'hello' to you little guy!\"  He says in a smooth and polite tone.  He gets out of his desk then approaches you and William then offers a gigantic brown feathered finger as a handshake.  \"It's a huge pleasure to meet you!  I'm George!  But you can call me Mr. Getty in case you didn't hear William.\"  He chuckles and smiles at you with a large yellow beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr. Getty!\"  I'm Jeremy!  You can call me 'Little Guy' if you want though!\"  You joke with him as you try to shake his building of a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh\" Mr. Getty lets out a few laughs and looks at William.  \"So have you two been getting along?\"  He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"  William says gleefully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!\"  Mr. Getty replies.  \"Now I'm pretty sure you two want to get settled.\"  He says pointing to a desk in the front row, near his own desk.  \"There's your desk William, along with yours, Jeremy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mr. G!\"  William shouts as he makes his to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you neared the desk, you saw some anthros looking at you, one of them being that very same crow with his hawk friend sitting next him.  As you both make it to the desk, William lowers you onto a vast emptiness of dark wood, a few inches from your desk.  You look around the room a bit before sitting down, you notice the 'Earth's Countries' poster along with a city of books lined up in some shelves.  Then you feel a slight tremor that almost makes you lose your balance, an avalanche of colors descending from a distance.  It was only William taking his seat as gently as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  William says, adjusting himself to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"  You reassure him as you sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the booming ringing sounded again.  Once again you're covering your ears wincing, trying desperately to block it out when all of a sudden everything goes black and the sound is now toned down to a bearable volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\"  You opened your eyes.  \"What happened?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringing noise then stopped and you felt another tremor as light began to fill your vision.  A bunch of colorful mountains begin to move away from you, followed by a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that must have been really loud for you!  Sorry about that.\"  William says in a concerned tone.  \"Did that hand thing help with the sound?\"  He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\"  You tell him.  \"Thanks, pal.  Don't worry.  I'll get used to it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so!\"  He says, looking over you as if he was your parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the time passed, more anthro students fill the room, all looking at you as they walk by.  All you can do is hope this year goes by painlessly.  At least you have some new friends to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Up further you can see jean covered legs stretching up to a white muscle tee. This Anthro is tall, maybe 6'9\" in their measurements. After only a few seconds the Anthro began squatting down in front of you and his thunderous voice booms: \"Hey there, you must be _________. I'm your partner, welcome to High School buddy!\" The Anthro then gently picks you up and begins bringing you to his face. The hand you are sitting on is more comfortable than you had expected. It isn't a hard hoof-like thing, instead it is similar to a human hand but it is fur-covered and a little harder, well maybe not harder but the flesh feels more... compact. Soon you are in front of the giant's face and his large brown eyes are focused on you. You are more than a little nervous and he must have noticed it too because he starts patting you on the back with a finger and tying to comfort you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm sorry little guy, I know it must be scary to be that small compared to me, but you need to get used to being handled, anyway I'm Ethan.\" The titan smiles and extends a finger from his free hand, presumably for you to shake. You reach out your hand and grab the appendage but that is pretty much all you can do because of the sheer size of it. Ethan lets out a chuckle and lightly moves the finger for you. Anthros must have great self control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you said you're my partner, what does that mean?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see the school selected me to carry you from class to class, protect you from any hostile Anthros, you know things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean hostile Anthros?\" You ask feeling a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly there are some Anthros that don't want humans as their equals and will probably want to make you feel a little less than welcome. But don't worry, most of us aren't like that. Besides, to get to you they'll have to go through me.\" Considering his height and build that was very reassuring. Suddenly the bell starts to ring<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's time for home-room, lets go.\" Ethan says as he walks toward the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this wasn't going to be so bad after all...            </span></div></div>",

The two cocky anthros finally get to the both of you, the husky staring at Ethan and the cheetah staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ethan....can I hold that human for a minute? I just want to see him, hehehe\" says the husky snickering. \"Not on your li...\" Just then the cheetah swipes you from Ethans hand, you didn't feel a thing it was so swift!

Give him back!\" Ethan shouts to the cheetah with an angry expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Otto! run away with that ounce of flesh!\" The husky said starting to block Ethan from any movement. You feel intense rumbling in the cheetah's paw as he runs away to who knows where. You cant see anything, the cheetah closed his paw he was carrying you in but you still feel the rumbling. All you hear is loud rustling of the cheetah's cloths as he escapes with his \"prize\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, when Damian gets here we're gonna have LOADS of fun lil guy!\" the cheetah says opening his paw back up so you can see again. What you see is something you would see in a nightmare, rows and rows of grey lockers, tiled floors and wood benches, you finally realise your in the locker rooms! Minutes later you hear thundering footsteps slowly getting louder with every step, you pray its Ethan but it's not, it's none other than that cocky husky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awsome! I see you got the flesh bag here safe n' sound\" the husky says pleased with the sight of the cheetah holding you. Right now your not sure what to be anymore, confused or really scared, just then the husky says \"Otto....we still a half hour of fun with this guy til' second period. \"What should we do Damian?\" The cheetah asks looking at you with an evil grin.</span></div></div>",

The enormous alien visitors who, after finding Earth, became your home planet's greatest benefactors, gladly supplying the tiny world with the natural resources Earth had all but exhausted.  Your father, the diplomat, had been one of the first voyagers from home to visit their planet, securing the amazing technology for space travel for your homeworld so that a 'hyper space' bridge could be built between the two worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a show of good faith in the titanic aliens, you agreed, with some pressure from your father to attend college on their world.

He seemed genuinely excited that you were willing to hang out with his friends, his tail wagging so quickly you can hear it smacking against his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you expected him to be happy. . . what you didn't expect was the gut wrenching vertigo as you were lifted over a few miles towards that smiling muzzle of his, his soft black lips parting ever-so-slightly as they flatten you against his leathery paw pad in a kiss that, quite literally, takes your breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first few seconds of panic were washed away with the the low rumble of Max's breath washing over you as you reveled in the feeling of his soft lips completely covering every inch of your body, your fingers curling against the pillowy surface as you kiss back despite yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as suddenly as the kiss started, it was over, the dog looking both shocked and embarassed at what he'd just done, his tail tucking instinctively between his legs as he chewed on his lower lip.  If only he could see you a little more clearly, he'd be able to tell from the bulge in your now damp jeans that the experience wasn't exactly one way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh . . .goddamn. I'm sorry. I got carried away.\" Max's great ears folded, both tinged bright red with embarassment as he lowered you towards the floor, near the edge of the bed. \"I shouldn't have done that.\"</span></div></div>",

Thank god he could tell.  \"We could jus' lie down?   Talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, your view of the outside world is obscured by the bigdog's thick digts as he closes his hand, leaving you to wonder what he's doing.  It's not until you're deposited on his bare chest that you realize what just happened; he pulled off his worn Jersey and tossed it way before settling into the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but be amazed how much warmer it is in the plush acres of fur that cover the rolling hills of firm muscle that are your roommate. From where you stand on his pectoral, you can feel his heartbeat rumbling beneath you, his nipple rising like a hill of rubbery flesh a few yards to your right as you slowly turn, just in awe of the sight before you. . . then you feel the warm breath on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spin, looking straight up at that handsome muzzle again as it fills your vision, the big dog watching you intently as he softly smiles. \"I hope I didn't go to far.

About you sleeping in the bed with me?\"  You hear the THUD of distant thunder as he talks, the vibration of his tail smacking against the mattress again as he makes his suggestion. \"I'm serious. I'd love to sleep with my little man at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. . . I . . . if you think.\"  You stammer, your fingers curling against the firm, warm flesh you're seated on as your mind races.  Would that be safe?

Would he be able to smell your excitement, your arousal at the mere proposal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNIFFFFFF*  Your clothes are ruffled, the fur around you tugged towards that massive muzzle as he smiles widely, his tongue panting cutely out between those black lips that fill your vision.  \"I'll take THAT as a yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently he could smell it.

We'll have to think long and hard about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax grins as he lies back, lacing his great paws behind his head, the 'ground' beneath you heaving upwards underfoot, becoming even more firm as the muscle tenses, his enormous, muscular arms appearing in the corners of your  vision as you keep your eyes on that handsome muzzle. \"Okay.  I'll settle for 'yet'. . . but we can still just lay here and chill when we're wide awake.  And I won't make any jokes about your use of the words 'long and hard'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head in disbelief, you push your way through the soft, warm white fur that stands between you and the big dog's nipple, climing up onto the fleshy nub before taking a seat, not wanting to vanish from sight if you were to recline in the pup's dense fur. \"Oh, shutup.   I'm trying desperately not to go there, bigdog,   Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell y' what, wee man. Get comfy and relax, may as well TRY to get some naptime in before tonight.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The unfathomably large black panther filling the doorway looks around what must to him be a simple room. To you, however, it might as well be a state, the enormous space so large the walls to either side of your are hazy with distance. This monstrous figure immediately fills the space, though, his titanic body filling the door frame for a moment before he steps up to fill -- then overwhelm -- your vision. The lights shining down on you are cut off by his might, and suddenly everything goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see on the video feed that's been included on your tablet that Chester is peering down at you, his narrowed green eyes piercing to see the speck that you are. When he finally spots you, he purrs and smiles. Rows of sharp teeth bigger than could be believed are revealed, and that simple pleasant noise is rumbling enough to make you feel like your bones could shake apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Brian,\" the big cat purred. \"Welcome to the University. I'm Chester.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know,\" you say flippantly. \"There's really no mistaking you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester's smile brightens. \"Heh, I guess not. How was the trip?\" The panther lowers down so that he's squatting, but he's still looming over your platform by a good distance. His chest seems to go on forever, and that's replaces by immense shoulders and then a muzzle that could swallow your entire neighborhood in one go. He's close enough now that you can only see his nose. If you crane your head, you can see those enormous green eyes looking down at you, sharply focused. You have to admit, it's a little unnerving being under the gaze of such an immense predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was all right, thanks.\" Despite your misgivings, you steel yourself and step forward. You wonder how you must look to this monstrosity, a speck that takes forever to get anywhere. \"It was my first time across the hyper bridge. Really impressive, that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" From this distance, you could see the skin underneath Chester's nose darken a little bit, and your video feed was able to capture the folding of his ears, the lowering of his eyes. It was an endearing gesture, all of the hallmarks of shy acknowledgement. Could it be that he was as nervous as you were? \"We're quite proud of it, actually. It took us a bit of time figuring out how to shrink everything to your scale on the other end, but we've got some really great micro-engineers to help us out with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micro-engineers? That sounds intriguing. Is that what your people call us?\" You couldn't help but smile at that. It's not the worst name they could have found for the human race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester shook his head and raised a palm that could squash several city blocks flat without even trying. \"Oh no. You guys aren't the first little species we've found. Just the latest. And the most interesting.\" Again, that darkening of the skin underneath his fur. He must do that a lot, you figure. Only most people wouldn't be able to see it under midnight-colored fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked your way to the edge of the table and jumped on to the vast plain of the cat's palm. The surface of it was quite smooth and warm, and the irregular terrain of it made for slightly difficult travel. Chester tried to keep as still as he could, but the simple act of breathing caused shifts in the landscape that were difficult to compensate for. \"Well, that's really kind of you to say. We find you quite interesting too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's ears perked. He checked his own small video feed to make sure you were secured on his palm before moving to get your cargo container. \"Really? You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do! It's not every day you meet bipedal, sentient aliens that look like our animals and blown up to...well, incredible proportions.\" You manage to make it further in to Chester's palm and sit down in a relatively stable crease inside the leathery palmpad. You tap your tablet to make sure he knows you're safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well, to us everyone else is incredibly small. It's really a surprise to us that there aren't any sentient creatures who've reached our size.\" He grabbed the cargo container and rose to his full height. The experience was, in a word, insane. Wind whipped around you as your stomach dropped right to your feet. You were lifted several miles in the span of seconds, and the effect was dizzying. Even though Chester was rising and turning slowly, the way he had been trained, you could tell that being carried by this titan would definitely take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" the cat said. He must have noticed you in the video feed. \"Was that too fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you manage to squeak breathlessly. \"This is just going to take some getting used to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester chuckled, a booming rumble that shook your body. \"You and me both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view as you were carried out of the room was nothing short of amazing. Miles of the room whisked by incredibly fast, so that the sterile white and grey walls of the meeting room became a blur. On one side, there was the impossible size of Chester, his torso rising like a sheer, furred cliff stretching miles above and below you. And on the other side, the room became a gigantic hallway, the ceiling well above even the panther's head and the width of it enough for ten of the cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...incredible.\" You look around, trying to guess at how big the hallway is. Really, it could be the size of your home state. Or maybe even continent. To think that it was just a hallway, something to get you from one place to another, was mind-blowing. Without Chester, using your own legs, it would take you days, perhaps weeks, to traverse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, I suppose it is.\" Chester's purr was starting to become familiar now, as comforting as it was overwhelming. After getting over the initial shock of his size, you find that you like him. \"We have to build most buildings for beings of multiple size ranges, though that's somewhat limited here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said that there weren't any other sentient races bigger than you.\" You couldn't keep the nervousness out of your voice. If there were other, larger creatures here, shouldn't you have been briefed on that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester looks down at you, his tone and expression as reassuring as a 15-mile predator could make himself. \"Oh, we are. You mean they didn't tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't getting a good feeling about this. \"Tell me what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChester's ears flick and he looks a bit nervous. Perhaps he hadn't expected to be the one to tell you this. \"I was selected because I was a rather small example of my kind...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Squinting through her thick contact lenses, she finally spots you, and exclaims, \"Oh, there you are!  It's a real pleasure to finally meet you in real life!\"  Jasmine extends a mile-long pinky finger for you to shake, and you do, although you doubt that Jasmine could even feel you through those thick scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, a guy and a girl would never share a dorm room, but this was a very special case.  Jasmine, as a matter of fact, has met your father before, when her own father, a diplomat as well, discussed foreign matters with your dad.  From what you know, this dragon shares your major for the same reason as you; you both are interested in diplomacy with each other's race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, little guy, let me carry all of that stuff for you,\" spoke the dragoness politely, pointing at your relatively dismal stack of supplies.  \"Sure, Jasmine, that would be a real help,\" you reply.  Taking a satchel from her pocket, Jasmine picked up the entire pile and poked it deep inside.  Then, she scooped you up, but thankfully you aren't riding in that satchel.  After putting the platform back down, Jasmine started strolling back to campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, Jasmine starts talking about the obvious: how small you are.  \"You know, I just can't get over how tiny you humans are!\" she said while still trying to sound respectful.  \"When we chatted on e-mail, it's so easy to imagine that you are the same size as me, but when I hold you on my finger like this, it's really weird knowing that you are the same human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what you mean,\" you answer.  As Jasmine starts showing the kindness that you knew about from chatting with her, you slowly start to feel more comfortable with the fact that your house is the size of a grain of salt to her.  \"So, Jasmine, I have to know, how is this going to work, us being, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll try to make you as comfortable as possible while you room with me,\" spoke the dragoness sincerely.  \"Of course, this means....</span></div></div>",

Besides, my father wants me around you as much as possible.  If anything were to happen to you we don\u2019t want to look like a bunch of clumsy giants that are too dangerous to be around your kind.  Plus, I am fascinated by how such tiny creatures are just as smart as us and I want to find out everything about you,\u201d Jasmine explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of interested in you too.  I never even knew creatures of your size existed,\u201d you responded even though you were a little worried about finding out whether of not Jasmine really was a clumsy titan.  One little slip on her part and she could crush you like a flea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re interested in me?  But I\u2019m just a normal old dragon.  There is nothing special to find out.  What you see is what you get,\u201d she said.  Considering that you could not even see all of her from where you were that was saying a lot more than she had intended to.  You were uncertain about how she really felt about you, but you were definitely in awe of the giant dragoness and more than a little frightened of her size.  It might be possible that she was in awe of your small size, but you doubted that she was even the least bit scared of you.  That notion just seemed ridiculous to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness approached something that looked vaguely like an incredibly advanced vehicle to you.  Like the dragoness, it was large enough to defy your perceptions and you were unable to even look at the entire vehicle before the dragoness stepped in.  \u201cThis is a fairly standard transport on my world.  The ones on campus have been specially modified for your use so you can get around in the event something happens to me.  I hope that you will find them adequate,\u201d Jasmine told you.  Then she spoke the name of the campus and you were whisked away by the vehicle.

Whatever this thing was it was faster than any land vehicle on Earth, probably any aircraft too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you seemed to be moving extremely fast Jasmine was tapping one mile long claw on the dashboard impatiently, causing what felt like small earthquakes to you.  \u201cSorry this is taking so long, but public transportation is just so slow,\u201d the dragoness said apologetically to you.  It only took about three minutes to reach your destination and you are fairly certain you had traveled thousands of miles when the university finally came into view.  Then Jasmine scooped you back up in one of her claws and carried you out of the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to your new home for the next four years,\u201d Jasmine said cheerfully as you looked upon the building that dwarfed even the massive dragoness.</span></div></div>",

How so many classes, offices, and dorm rooms could fit in one building, you could not fathom.  And each of the rooms themselves were like small countries; the entire building must be the size of a small planet.  Jasmine stepped into an elevator, and with her huge index finger, pressed a button labeled 'Special Dorms'.  As the floor whizzed upward, you asked your dragoness helper what kind of room you are getting into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the special dorms are usually reserved for students with special needs, and are usually singles, but in our case, it's been set up so that a human can live somewhat normally.  I'll show it to you when we get there.\"  Jasmine looked down at you with a smile on her face, and you feel reassured knowing that human needs have been taken account for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator stopped, and Jasmine walked down a many mile long corridor.  Stopping at room 5047, she reached her free hand to a wall fixing, which  scanned her handprint to allow her access.  The door slid open, revealing a nice, modern looking room, complete with a desk with a computer, bed, drawers, and even a separate bathroom.  Jasmine's claw lowered towards a bedside cabinet, on top of which was a similar setup, only in your size.  It was a bit mind boggling and nerve-wracking, knowing that where you were staying for four years could fit several hundred times over on your roommates fingertip, and that she could easily reach you from where she would be sleeping pretty much every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you unpacked, Jasmine would not stop looking at you work and often butt in to help you.  It was quite amazing how she managed to fold your clothing with those huge claws of hers without tearing them to pieces, much less put them away in drawers without completely demolishing any of the furniture.  It seems that this dragoness wasn't nearly as clumsy as she led you to believe.  You were glad that Jasmine was so willing to help you, though by the look in her eyes, she seemed to enjoy it immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished making your tiny bed, Jasmine turned to you and said, \"So, now that your things are all set up, I'd really like to talk to you, now that we've got some free time and nobody else is around.\"  You feel more than a bit nervous, but Jasmine seems friendly enough.  \"Sure, Jasmine, I'd like that.  What do you want to talk about?\"  Jasmine replies...</span></div></div>",

It was a 20 minute walk and noticed the skyscraper-sized teeth seem to have huge chucks of sauces, fruits, and vegetables. It appears despite being a dragon that eats meat, Jasmine is a vegetarian. You finally stopped when the tongue begins to slide down. To look directly down and see darkness. It could be 10 minutes but you can't turn down. \"1, 2, 3 GO!!\" you yelled and you fall face first down the throat. Within seconds saliva and mucus covers your face and body and try your best to peal them off but it was useless at a fast pace flying down. While you are flying down you wonder what you just did. Will you survive and how will Jasmine feel when she realizes when you're gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thinking was interrupted when you collapsed on something squishy and a melting feeling. You reached the edge of the esophagus and Jasmine's throat muscles are starting to crush you. Shrieking badly you use your arms and was able to expand the esophagus slightly so you can fall into the stomach. Now you can finally wipe the saliva and mucus of your face and regain sight. The stomach of Jasmine seems like 15 public pools combined with the walls pink and red. The acid is yellowish green with human sized food dissolving. You picked one up and even in air disappears into liquid. The smell doesn't bother you and the acid feels warm on your smoothe skin. After being in the stomach for over an hour testing the acid to see if it kills you, the acid can't kill you. You are so thankful you can't die. Maybe you can progress forward because if stomach acids can't kill you nothing else in a body can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was supposed to be the first day of some new grand project.  As the time approached for you to actually go through with this you had started to analyze your reasons for doing this.  Had you done this because you wanted to be a part of changing the course of history for the better or were you just doing this to impress your friends?  Either way, it felt like it was too late to back out of this now.  The anthros\u2019 school was already in sight and it was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to believe that the anthros had no more than eight students per class in a school so large.  Actually, they would have eight anthros and one human in some of the classes now.  You would think that they would only need a structure that big because they were having a problem with overcrowded classrooms.  Then again, eight anthros might just be overcrowded for an anthro school.  There was just no telling since anthros and humans did not talk much with each other.  That was why they were trying out this program in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was starting out at the high school level since they did not believe those any younger would be responsible enough to make this program a success.  There were a few things you are curious about.  They say that the anthros can change to any size that they wish, but you have never seen an anthro actually change their own size around you.  You would like to confirm that their clothes really do change size with them as they do so.  It would also be interesting to see what would happen to a building if they decided to change sizes.  If they really could become as large as they wished then would an entire building built by anthros also change sizes with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered where you were going to have to park when you spotted a \u201cWelcome Human\u201d sign that pointed you to a parking space right next to the school.  That was a relief.  Many of the anthro students had already arrived and you had dreaded having to walk through a parking lot with the anthro sized cars all over the place.  A problem did present itself though.  There were steps leading up to the school that were way too large for you to easily climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a deep voice from behind you, \u201cHi, you must be the new human.\u201d  You jumped in fright before turning around to be confronted with a 20 foot tall anthro lion with a pitch black mane.  He raises his hands, or are they still called paws, in a sign of apology.  \u201cSorry for scarring you, but I\u2019ve been assigned as your partner for the school year.  We have all the same classes and I\u2019ll be transporting you to all of your classes if that\u2019s all right with you.  My name\u2019s Zen by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d you say, \u201cIt sure beats walking.\u201d  The lion smiled at you and picked you up as gently as he could before placing you on his shoulder.  Despite how friendly he was you could not help but being a little frightened of the lion.  You had expected one of the nerdy types to be taking care of you, not that a 20 foot tall nerd would not have been at least a little intimidating.  However, this lion was built more like an athlete.  You would be surprised if he was not on one or two of the schools sports teams.  This fear of yours was probably one of the reasons why they had started up this program.  If you felt like this about a friendly lion then there was no telling how bad a lot of people felt about the anthros when they had never met any of them.  That also made you wonder what the anthros felt about humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day was going to have an interesting start too.  Your first class was listed as \u201cSize Changing.\u201d  It looks like a few of your questions about anthros were about to be answered right away.  You wondered what it would be like for you though.  This was obviously just meant as something for you to observe so you could find out about anthros, but how would you deal with having to deal with even larger anthros.   You wondered whether they were going to keep it simple or if they were going to try and impress you on your first day.</span></div></div>",

It was kind of endearing, but didn't do all that much to help you with your nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The show's been pretty good so far from where I'm sitting. You guys are like, crazy big.\" You find yourself blushing even as you say that, and your skin darkens even more when Zen actually begins to purr at the statement.

You haven't seen anything yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clutch a patch of Zen's mane as he walks around the edge of the school building to the football field out back. His fur is thick there, but not aggressively so -- he's young enough for his mane not to have fully grown in. He doesn't seem to mind as you get a grip so you can look out at the football field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready you can see an enormous tiger towering over the goalposts on one side of the field. Judging from the size of the goal posts -- the tops of which only reach mid-thigh -- you'd have to say he was at least 100 feet tall. His tail flicked behind him as the students gathered in front of him along the end zone, each dwarfed by the enormous cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" you say, and you find yourself clutching Zen's mane a little tighter. He chuckles softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's just Mr. Hansforth. Don't worry about him; he looks intimidating, and he is a little demanding, but he's a really nice guy as long as you follow the rules.\" The lion sounds so nonchalant about a tiger the size of a ten-story building looking down at them, but it's the first time you've ever seen such a thing. It's definitely going to take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, Zen,\" the big cat booms, narrowing his eyes. \"So good of you to join us. And I see that you've brought our esteemed human with you.\" It was hard to tell whether the tiger was being genuinely friendly or somewhat snide. His expression was predatory but unreadable beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" the lion says, falling into line with the other students. They all look at you curiously. It's a little unnerving being the center of attention in a group full of anthros the size of buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Mr. Hansforth purrs. \"Please set him down on the ground. Human, once you're safely standing you will take a spot to my left. That's the safest place to be for class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but bristle a bit at the set of instructions. One hundred feet tall or no, Mr. Hansforth was being kind of rude. You do have a name, after all. Still, considering this is your first day, you decide not to push anything. You simply nod and jog towards the looming tiger once Zen sets you down. He looks at you precisely as if you were a mouse darting across his field of vision. If you didn't know any better, you would swear that he had to resist the urge to pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then. It is time for roll call. When you hear your name spoken, please remark 'present'. Zen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present!\" the lion calls. He flicks his tail from side to side as he turns to look at you. You know by now that he's giving you a friendly look, but those teeth are awfully large and sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present!\" To the left of Zen was a vixen, slightly shorter than him at 17 feet high or so. She was quite...well-developed for someone her age. Her russet and white fur seemed to accentuate the curves that she was growing into, her chest and hips flaring out from her narrow waist. She watches you as well, her slitted pupils narrowing just a bit. There's no way to tell what she might be thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Towe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present!\" To the left of her was a wolf as tall as Zen and even wider than the lion, if that was possible. He spares a glance at you before turning to face his instructor, his voice and demeanor boasting his confidence as well as his willingness to follow directions. Still, he looked like he could be a handful if he ever decided to be aggressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ogden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present!\" The rat next to Towe was thin but ripped; lean muscle showed through his grey fur, and every movement he made suggested a quick mind and lightning-sharp reflexes. His dark brown eyes shine as he looks towards you, his whiskers twitching as if he can make out your scent from where he's standing. He comes only to the wolf's shoulder, about the height of Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present.\" Another rat, this one with the same fur color and bare paws that Ogden sported. She was female and surprisingly heavy-set, as motherly as Ogden was lithe. Still, she wore her weight well, and by the ever-present smile creasing her muzzle another friendly sort. It occurs to you that she and the other rat might be siblings, though you're not sure if that's because it's so hard to tell anthros apart. Best to keep those thoughts to yourself, at least until you get to know everyone better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kendra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present!\" The next student was a very large horse, as thick as Melody in the hips and chest but quite strong on top of that. She looked like she could match the guys in brawn and stamina easily. Her mane flowed down over one light brown eye, and the other was directed at you. She tossed her head and flicked her tail in what you can only assume is a friendly gesture. Good thing, too, because she was several feet taller than Zen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Adjulowa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present.\" The elephant thunders the one word, and you felt the rumble of his voice where you stood. He was absolutely immense -- he rose above the goal posts with several feet to spare, while everyone save for Kendra would have to jump to reach the top of it. His big ears were the size of sail's ships, and his body was nothing short of monstrous, with a great deal of muscle and fat. He wore clothes, just like everyone else, but he looked like he was threatening to burst out of them every time he took a breath. He flicked his ears and looked at you evenly, then back at Mr. Hansforth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" the teacher purrs. \"You're all here. Since this is the first day for our new classmate, I thought today would be a good day to review our lesson from the very first week.\" The class responded with various sounds of consternation, which all ceased when the tiger held up a massive paw. \"But! If you perform this pop quiz perfectly, I will declare Friday a free period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned as the gathered anthros looked at each other, astonished. They took a few moments to compose themselves, then looked resolutely up at their teacher. Whatever this free period was, it was a pretty big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Hansforth, satisfied that he had secured their cooperation, continued. \"Very well. I would like all of you to grow half again your smallest height at the first speed. I will know if you've gone over that height, and I will know if you've moved too quickly.\" He held up what looked like a car. To him, it was no bigger than a garage door remote. He stared down at the smaller students, his tail twitching behind him. \"Begin.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was hard to know exactly what you should be paying attention to. On one hand, you were close enough to touch a towering tiger as big as a skyscraper. On the other, the seven students in front of you were closing their eyes, putting their hands together and then growing right in front of you. You could feel the movement of Mr. Hansforth through the ground under your feet, but there was a growing rumble coming your way from the collected students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Zen was closest to you, you watched him first. He grew just fast enough for you to notice, his heavy mane and broad shoulders rising higher in the air. It looked like his clothing was growing quite as fast as the rest of him. The fabric creaked more and more around his shoulders, and the pattern on his shirt visibly deformed around his rising chest. Around his hips and thighs, his shorts were starting to get filled, the sheer volume of muscle forcing the bottoms to rise over the lion's knees. Even that thin, ropey tail was growing longer and obviously heavier, making an audible woosh as it knifed the air behind him. The grass, long used to such abuse, was being churned around Zen's paws as the lion put on who knows how many tons of additional weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else in the class seemed to be doing the same thing. Melody's face looked the most inwardly drawn, while everyone else seemed to handle the growth with no problem. In fact, the immense elephant Adjulowa looked positively bored doing it. This, even though his own tank-top was threatening to break around the sheer mass of his back and chest. Towe looked around at the other students as he grew, a low growl rumbling the ground as he wagged his tail. He seemed to be enjoying the expansion. So was Kendra, for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute before the seven students in front of him were half again as tall as they were before. Zen was now an astounding 30 feet tall, while Melody and Ogden were hovering around 25. Adjulowa was nearly 50, his broad ears right at the level of Mr. Hansforth's hip. He clicked the 'remote' in his paw, then swished his tail with a small smile. \"Very good, students. All of you performed perfectly. I'm proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a veritable riot of noise as the students celebrated. You have to hold your hands to your ears to keep from having your brain rattled. Mr. Hansforth must have noticed, because he put up a huge paw and rumbled a command that quieted them down instantly. \"You're forgetting about our guest here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class looks at you, and so does the 100-foot tiger. You can feel yourself blushing, but hope that no one notices. \"If we're going to live together the way it's hoped, we'll have to maintain perfect control in dealing with humans at all times. They're small and fragile, but they're all genuises down to a man.\" The tiger looked down at his class, holding his paws behind his back. His chest jutted out so far it looked like it would bump his chin as he looked down at the class. \"Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seven students quickly fall back into position and nods, looking up at their teacher. \"Yes sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Hansforth ordered everyone down to their smallest sized again, and ran them through their paces for the rest of the class. It was something like working a musical scale, only you were doing impossible things with it. You had never seen furs grow before, and now, for the next hour, you watched them grow anywhere from 1.5 - 5 times their original size at all kinds of rates. Everyone seemed quite adept at it, which was the most impressive thing. Ogden and Nash forgot themselves a couple of times when they were cracking jokes instead of paying attention, but other than that the hour passed by without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....that was amazing!\" You say as Zen comes to collect you after class. The lion's ears flick, disappearing into his mane. You've learned pretty quickly to note this as an embarrassed response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, it wasn't anything. You should see us when Mr. Hansforth has us doing really hard stuff. Sometimes we have to go out into the wilderness because that's the only place where the entire class can be at once.\" The cat plucks you up without asking and carries you off to his next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of that makes your head spin. Being lifted off and carried against the heavily-muscled lion doesn't help either, but you don't mind, you find. \"I...can't even imagine what that would look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen purred a chuckle. \"In a couple of weeks you won't have to. Now, ready to go to our next class? It's...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oddly, your big helper Zen does not enter the huge building, but instead strolls along the side of it to the back.  You notice that there are other anthro students standing in a large clearing, and when they notice the big lion you are on they wave to him.  Zen suddenly starts to run fast, and you have to grab hold of his jet black mane tightly to not fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys, its good to see you all again!\" roared Zen to his buddies.  Sure enough, there were seven other anthros there, excluding an older anthro teacher, who looked like a meek muskrat.  Zen started off by introducing you to three of his friends from junior high school, and you are glad that at least those three seem somewhat accepting of you.  However, it is a bit unsettling that they all are big, burly carnivorous boys like Zen.  You learn that the crocodile's name is Albert, the Kodiak bear's name is Theodore, and the wolverine's name is Claude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shrill whistle blows, and everyone quiets down.  The muskrat raises his forepaws in the air for everyone's attention, then starts to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I would like to thank everyone who decided to come here to demonstrate.  Before you start, just let me speak to the human, to make sure that he understands what is going to happen.\"  Zen walks over to the muskrat, and seems to tower over him.  The teacher lowers his mellow voice a bit, and attempts to calm you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, human, please don't be afraid of what is going to happen.  You see, anthros like to change their sizes often, and we have heard that you have never witnessed even one size change.  These students are all here to help you get used to the prospect of sizechanging, and have all been told to put their all into it so you will be ready for pretty much any type of situation while you are at our school.  Before we start, do you have any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, right, you only have about five million questions.  You do not want to pester the muskrat anthro with so many questions, though, so you try to limit your questions to only a few.  \"Um, Mr. Muskrat, will the clothes also change size, because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen suddenly bursts out laughing, practically throwing you off his shoulder.  He then answers your question himself.  \"Don't be ridiculous, human, of course we don't grow out of our clothes, that would just be plain embarrassing!\"  You suddenly feel as if you asked a very dumb question and you shrink back from Zen's fanged grin.  The muskrat tries to calm Zen down, reminding him that a human would not know the answer to that question.  You decide not to ask any more questions; clearly the anthros have some control of the size of other objects other than themselves and wouldn't grow out of buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, it's time for the growth presentation to begin.  It starts even before you realize it, the process is so smooth, but you do see Zen's head start to grow larger and his shoulder getting roomier.  His friends and the four other students are also growing at about the same rate.  In less than a minute each of the anthros are easily as tall as the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think so far?\" asked Zen, whose voice has grown louder and deeper.  You are completely speechless, and Zen chuckles at your amazement.  The giant lion brings a meaty golden paw to his shoulder and gently plucks you off his fur.  You notice that you are about as tall as one of his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you are that amazed already, then I'm dying to see how you react when were done!\"  The lion then starts to shoot upward, along with the others.  You notice clouds start to pass as you become increasingly smaller relative to the giant paw.  The air starts to get thin, yet you remain warm because Zen's paw radiates so much heat.  As you ascend, you notice Benjamin come up to Zen, wanting to show him something.  Zen laughs, which sounds like thunder now, and Benjamin lowers two of his claws down to Zen's palm.  To your amazement, wedged between the two claws is the school, which looks absolutely microscopic now.  Suddenly, one of Zen's claws hooks your shirt and you rise what must be miles higher to your partner's face.  \"Why don't you take a look down, human?\" says the humongous lion in a god-like baritone.  Looking down, you are frightened and in awe as you see half of the surface of the Earth below.  You do not know how you or any of the anthros are even able to breathe, but you can and you assume that they can too.  You notice that the surface of the Earth is distorted; the field that the growth started on seems to take up a good portion of the Earth's landmass.  You are relieved, because this probably means that the anthros have the foresight to grow what they are standing on so they do not demolish any countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that the growing has stopped for now, and you look back at Zen.  Even though he should look infinetely more menacing now that he could in theory destroy the planet, but he actually looks much kinder now that he is so huge.  You don't know if it is because he is trying as hard as he can not to frighten you, or because at this size his roughness is smoothed out over many miles.  Zen chuckles again, and this time you feel his laughter more than you can hear it.  You cannot imagine that there could be any more growing now.</span></div></div>",

It did not really require any effort at all and they could still keep going.  All of the anthros just kept growing and growing as if there was nothing unusual about what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew they had to be larger than the Earth by now.  It was a mystery how they could get this large without you ever noticing an anthro doing it or without them destroying the Earth.  Somehow, their gift of growth allows them not to cause any harm to the planet and go unnoticed by the human population after a certain point in their growth.  Zen increased in size to the point where you could no longer take in his entire face and he was still growing.  Before long you could no longer comprehend how large any of the other students were.  It would be surprising if they were not larger than a star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped thinking about how large their bodies were and just concentrated on a strand of Zen\u2019s fur.  It was so thick you could actually fit your entire neighborhood on it.  If it were not for Zen\u2019s fur you would not even be able to tell he was growing anymore.  By the time Zen stopped growing even a strand of his fur seemed like it would have been able to hold the entire Earth on it, without bending under the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthros were simply amazing.  How they could do this was beyond you.  It was amazing that you could still breathe and not only were you warm, but you were comfortably warm.  Zen\u2019s paw pad seemed to stretch on forever and yet it felt soft beneath you.  For some reason you felt safe in Zen\u2019s paw even though you were aware he could now end your life without even noticing it.  This must also be tied in to his gift.  You also began to understand why this program had been started up.  It was not for the benefit of the anthros nearly as much as it was for humans.  At the size the anthros were now it would not be a problem for them to wipe out all of humanity.  This program was in place to make sure the anthros viewed humans as their equals instead of just little pests.  You might be wrong, but you have a feeling not all of the anthros in this school are going to be as nice to you as Zen and his friends are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zen does eventually shrink back down to the size you first met him at you ask, \u201cJust how large can you get Zen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know.  Theoretically there is no limit as to how large an anthro can get.  None of us have ever encountered a size we could not reach.  It is fun to try sometimes though.  I usually have things to do, but once I had enough time to get large enough to see the edge of the universe.  It was fun to see that it really isn\u2019t infinite after all,\u201d said Zen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only stare at him in wide eyed amazement.  Before you could pull yourself together and ask Zen any more questions the muskrat teacher blew his whistle and said, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s all the time we have for today.  I hope you found this class enlightening human.  Good luck on the rest of your day here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to thank the muskrat before Zen starts walking off in the direction of your next class.  That next class just happens to be\u2026</span></div></div>",

You consider yourself to be athletic, but compared to all of the anthro boys and girls in the gym, you feel downright scrawny.  You fear that everyone is going to look down on you because you are a human and not be able to see how athletic you really are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a huge white ox in a red muscle shirt and blue shorts stomped into the gym.  You could tell that he has already grown himself past his minimum height, and guess that anthro teachers grow themselves when they need to have the attention of their students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up, everyone!\" boomed the ox in a voice that seemed even louder than it should at his size of seventy or so feet.  \"Today is the first day of school, and that means that it's time to see how fit you all are.  Everyone will follow the test rules to the tee, and no skimping out.  I'm going to grow to an extra large size to keep an eye on all of your progresses.  First, everyone get a partner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen gives you a thumbs up, or is it a claws up?  Either way, you don't have to worry about finding a partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first is fifty sit-ups!  Choose who spots who, then switch over when you can, now GO!\"  The huge ox grows even huger, nearly touching the roof of the gymnasium, and starts a timer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen gets down on the ground and places you by his large feet.  Not knowing how else you are going to hold him in place, you decide to sit on his feet.  Zen is incredibly fast at his sit-ups, and you notice that so is everyone else.  He isn't even doing those wimpy half sit-ups that some of your human friends do.  Zen finishes in about forty seconds, and doesn't even look tired.  You hop off the lion's feet and get on your back.  Zen grows a bit and holds down your feet under a single fingerpad, watching you do your sit-ups.  Your back starts to ache after around thirty-five of them, and you can't help but slow down.  You decide that you should not even try to go as fast as Zen went next time you do sit-ups.  You take more than twice the time Zen took, and when you get up, you notice all of the other anthros nearby staring at you.  Some were even giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay attention, everyone!\" yelled the ox.  \"Next is forty pushups, now GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to sweat heavily as you get back on the ground.  Zen has no trouble at all with his pushups and was finished with all forty before you could even do ten.  \"Are you okay, human?  You look awfully beat.\"  You could tell that Zen was not being sarcastic at all, but you did not want to admit that you could not keep up with the other anthros.  \"I'm fine, thanks,\" you pant.  You finish in about two minutes and pick up your sore body to look at a very impatient looking ox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everyone, last is the one mile sprint!  That's equal to six laps around the gymnasium.  No growing is allowed, that would be cheating!  One more thing, and this is for the human only: you can run two laps, which should be about the same distance relatively.  Now, GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always considered yourself to be a fast runner; you tried to do the \"Four Minute Mile\" once and only missed by half a minute.  Compared to everyone else, though, you feel like a downright slowpoke.  Every single one of the anthros laps you five times.  One girl, a blur of an anthro cheetah, completes the whole mile in only about ten seconds!  At least she looked a bit tired out when she finished.  Zen, when he finished after only around twenty-five seconds, still looked as fresh as ever.  All of the anthros had finished by the time you completed your first lap, and you are highly embarrassed.  Most of the anthros are just staring at you, but at least a few are snickering audibly.  This makes you mad, and gives you the strength to complete the second lap faster than the first lap.  Your time was still well over a minute, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everyone, that's all for the fitness test.  You can all spend of the rest of the period doing cardio work.  However, I need to speak to the human regarding his scores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen notices that you are very tired and scoops you up in his arms before you can say anything.  The big ox now shrinks down to twenty five feet, which must be his minimum height, but is still very tall.  You think you know what's coming up; your score must be abysmal compared to the rest of the class.  The ox looks at your sweaty body in your partner's paws, and starts to speak...</span></div></div>",

Beneath you, you can feel Zen\u2019s muscles tense up.  Zen must be shooting him a pretty dirty look because the ox looks at him before turning his attention back to you.  \u201cUnfortunately they won\u2019t let me place you in any special class since you have to be in all of Mr. Fen\u2019s classes.  You probably couldn\u2019t keep up with the special students anyways,\u201d the ox finishes with a dismissive wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen turns and walks away without a word.  He has seemed pretty friendly up until this point, but that ox really seems to have angered him.  Considering you were the one that the ox had just been talking about you were the one that should be angered.  What you feel, though, is shame.  There is no way you can compete with these anthros.  This was definitely going to be tough adjusting too.  You had been one of the top students back in your school and now you were on the bottom of the class.  Maybe you could do better in some of the other classes.  There was something you just had to ask right now though.  \u201cYour name is Zen Fen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually Zenten Ren Fen.  My parents decided to be jokesters when they named me.\u201d  He sounded a little angry right now so you dropped the subject, but you did kind of like the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zen walked over to join the other students the cheetah walked up to meet you.  She flashed you what you were sure was meant to be a friendly smile.  \u201cWow, don\u2019t you two look in need of cheering up,\u201d she says in a light, almost joking tone.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the ox human, he was born with one hoof in his mouth.  Besides, you\u2019re a lot faster than my old human friend used to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was interesting.  She used to have a human as a friend.  \u201cUsed to?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, before my family moved out here.  He was a little fat, but a nice guy.  I also wouldn\u2019t have made it into high school without him.  I helped get him in shape for his P.E. tests and he tutored me in math, science, and, well, anything that involved a book.  Now that I\u2019ve moved out here it has been pretty hard making new friends with any humans since we don\u2019t normally mix and that I\u2019m now at that size where most humans think I\u2019m going to swallow them the first chance I get.  Oh, my name\u2019s Felicia by the way,\u201d Felicia said as she extended one clawed finger in your direction for you to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the proffered claw and shook it.  It was amazing how friendly Zen and his predatory friends are.  Now this cheetah, Felicia, is being equally friendly despite crushing you in that run.  If anyone could look down on you it was her.  Then you started to think about something.  When you had been running it had been all the herbivores that had been snickering at you.  The carnivores had just looked a little uncomfortable, as if they were embarrassed about something but did not want to say anything.  Even the ox teacher had been much ruder to you than the muskrat, which was an omnivore, had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think that it should be the other way around.  You try to think about why things have been this way so far.  Maybe it was just that herbivores tended to object to change more than naturally inquisitive predators tended to.  If you worked out in this school then there could be a whole lot of change on the horizon.  The predators might view it as some type of fun adventure while the herbivores could look at it with fear.  You hope you are wrong because if you\u2019re right then you have a very large portion of this school that wants to see you fail.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, human, what kind of cardio work do you like best?\" asked Zen.  \"There's the jump ropes, and there are a bunch of treadmills and cycle machines on the sides of the gym.\"  You see the various anthros using the jumpropes that are too long for you, and you would never be able to reach the pedals on the bike machine even at its lowest adjustment.  You guess that you don't really have much of a choice but to go on a treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's my favorite, too, human!\" says Felicia.  The two big cats bring you to the side of the gym, and Zen places you on the large black surface on the floor.  \"I'm just going to give you the lowest speed to start, so tell me if you can go faster,\" said Felicia.  Pressing a button on a panel high above you, the floor starts rolling.  Apparantly, the slowest speed is five miles per hour, which is plenty fast for you when you are running for endurance.  Felicia still waited a bit more, as if five miles per hour was too slow, but she got the idea and hopped on a treadmill next to you.  Her treadmill makes an incredibly high pitched whizzing sound as her legs start to blur once more.  You can't help but ask her what speed she is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, only about three-sixty.  I don't like to overdo it when running for over a minute.\"<br>\r\nYour mouth is agape.  \"Only\" three-sixty?  That means that she could easily keep up with a drag racer without even trying!  To your left, you see Zen pedaling hard on a cycle machine, not going as fast as you would have thought.  He must have set the machine for a huge amount of resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly get nervous whenever a herbivore passes the three of you.  Many of them whisper into each other's ears and point at you snickering.  However, you are downright frightened when one of them addresses you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, human, you think that you're good enough to hang with anthros?\" came a voice high above a pair of thick muscled grey legs.  You look up to see an ugly grin underneath a large white horn; which obscured a pair of sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from him, Corniel!\" roared Zen, looking at the rhinoceros with fire in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool it Zenten,\" snapped the rhino.  \"Well, human, I guess you need all the help you can get now.  Why don't I help you out a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't know,\" you say to the rhino, before Zen growls more.  \"Nonsense, human.  Besides, you aren't even going at a decent walking speed.  Here, let me 'help' you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, the rhino slams the panel with a thick fist.  Zen roars, and Felicia gasps and leaps off her treadmill as you are flung off yours at an alarming pace.  You expect to skid across the floor, but instead you land in something soft that appeared out of nowhere.  Slowly rising in the air, you see Felicia's worried face, now greatly enlarged.  Not only can she run very fast, Felicia can also apparently change size in the blink of an eye.  This wasn't even a slight size difference; you are easily half the size of one of her spots now.  \"Hold, still, human, I just want to make sure you weren't hurt.  As she inspects you closely, you see a large group of anthros surrounding Zen and Corneil.  Zen was making a lot of noise, and Corneil kept his horn pointed at Zen's mane.  Both were growing in size, and you are surprised that nobody has broken through the roof of the gymnasium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two enemies start crouching to avoid hitting the ceiling, Zen, being a lion, was able to crouch much better, and thus was able to grow larger than Corneil.  \"Okay, fine, I'm leaving.  Don't know why you care at all about a human, though.\"  The rhinoceros started stomping away, shrinking back to his minimum size.  Zen was breathing heavily, and growled, \"Felicia, is the human okay, because if he isn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Zen, he's perfectly fine,\" said the nervous cheetah.  Zen held out his huge hand, as large as Felicia is at her now increased height, and Felicia reaches into the palm to place you there.  All of the other anthros start leaving as Zen thrashes his huge tail at the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your frightening lion partner, his black mane resembling a dark forest fire.  \"Listen, human, I'm sorry if I frightened you, but I had to get Corneil off your back.  That guy has some sort of beef with humans like you wouldn't believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are too frightened to say anything, and doubt that Zen could even hear you above his growling breath.  After about a minute, he started to calm down, and also started shrinking to his smallest height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you know Corneil?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen growls a bit, but controls himself.  \"I've known him since the sixth grade.  His full name is Corneil Rhinowski.  All of the other herbivores kind of look up to him because he is tough enough to challenge the carnivores, and that gives him a bit of a superiority complex.  I don't know why he hates humans so much, but he brags about all of the human cities he wrecks each summer.  Say, do you know of any cities that were destroyed by a giant rhinoceros?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sure something like that would have been all over the news,\" you reply.  You shudder at the thought of what an anthro attack would be like though.  You imagine Corniel's huge hoof descending on a whole city, or even a whole country, and grinding it into smithereens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen let out the tiniest laugh.  \"Heh, I knew he totally lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bell rings and you are off to your next class.  You hope you do not see Corniel any more today.  Zen tells you what the next class is.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWe\u2019re headed off to our art class next.  Hopefully that should give you a nice little break after all the stuff you\u2019ve had to go through during this period,\u201d said Zen.  That sounded just fine to you.  You are a pretty talented artist, but you had thought you were in pretty good shape too.  One of the reasons you had been selected to go to this school instead of someone else was because you were one of the top students in the area, in the nation actually.  Technically, you were smart enough to be in college already but your parents wanted you to stick around people your own age.  It was kind of funny that they did not care about keeping you around people your own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zen walked to the art class you were able to get your first good look at the interior of the school.  Things looked pretty similar to a less crowded version of your own school.  It was not like your school was overcrowded or anything, but it seemed like there could not be more than 500 anthros going to this school while your high school had about three times that number of students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that just about everybody was staring at you as Zen walked past them.  It looked like you might have been right about the carnivores and herbivores.  All of the carnivores and most of the omnivores would offer you a friendly smile or at the very least they did not look like they wished you any harm.  The herbivores were a completely different story.  They made you feel uncomfortable and happy that you had Zen as a protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take too long to reach the art room.  The teacher was a colorful parrot that seemed to have put up a fairly large and well drawn \u201cWelcome Human\u201d sign before you arrived.  You could have sworn that parrots were herbivores, but it might just be that not all of them are totally against you just like you are bound to meet a carnivore or two that does not like you.  \u201cAh, welcome students and a big welcome to you my first human student.  I am Mrs. Pare.  This is the first class of the year and I would like to see where all of your skill levels are at.  So, today I would like you to create whatever you like and I will look over whatever you done in the last fifteen minutes of class,\u201d she said in a pretty flamboyant manner.  It did not seem like Mrs. Pare had any room in her for hate.  That might explain why she did not dislike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still had to find a workstation though.  Everything in this room was meant for people at least three times your size.  \u201cMr. Fen, I have a workstation already set up for your human partner next to the window.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Mrs. Pare, I\u2019ll take the human right over,\u201d Zen said.  Then he looked over at you and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice of her to remember I like to work next to the window.  That should make things easier on us in case somebody decides to try something like Corneil did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d you said.  Then Zen dropped you off at a workstation with human sized supplies.  It looked like you had all new equipment since you were the only human here.  Zen quickly went to work on something right next to you and it soon became apparent to you he was only as good at art as the average art student back at your high school.  It was nice to know all anthros weren\u2019t incredibly good at everything.  You had to decide what to draw yourself though.  Then you looked at Zen and he looked like just as good a subject as any.  Felines tended to look good in art in no matter what position they were in and Zen was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not have a lot of time to get your little painting done, but you were still proud of it.  Zen looked at what you had drawn and then he looked back at what he had drawn.  If you did not know any better you would have to say he looked a little embarrassed.  \u201cWow, you\u2019re good, I mean really good.  And that is me, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Zen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s you.  And thanks for the compliment.  I was kind of hoping I would be good at something in this school,\u201d you said.  Zen looked liked he was about to open his mouth to say something when Mrs. Pare walked over to your workstation.</span></div></div>",

The avian art teacher doesn't say anything when she looks at Zen's picture, probably because she can't think of anything good to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the teacher had critiqued all eight drawings, there was just enough time to prop them all up together before class ended.  Zen's looks much worse than the others, and the look on his large face is one of embarrassment.  Your drawing is actually about as good as a few of the others, like a drawing of the school.  However, half of the drawings are excellent; these students decided to draw self portraits, and the drawings were almost indistinguishable from the real thing.  Not only do you not believe that some anthro students are able to match, possibly surpass the ability of the greatest human artists, but they did so in under an hour using only colored pencils!  Once again, you feel put down; these anthros not only beat you hands down physically, but artistically as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rings, you and Zen chat a bit as you head to your next class, Science.  Zen tells you how good your drawing was of him, but you still feel badly.  \"Thanks, Zen, but did you see those other drawings?  How will I ever be able to compete with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know that you have a better shot than me!\" Zen said.  You laughed at his joke, and Zen talked more, making you feel better.  \"Those anthros must be hard core art students to draw like that.  None of my friends from junior high are that good.  You're probably even better than them, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you are at least better than some anthros at something.  But what of science?  You got top grades in all of your science classes at your old school, but could anthros possibly be better mentally than humans?  You can only hope that you will be able to handle the science class as Zen pushes the door open.  The lion takes a seat near the front, and you are a bit relieved to see that the teacher is carnivorous; specifically a pescivore, as he is an elderly looking walrus anthro.  \"Don't worry human,\" Zen whispers from the seat next to your specially made smaller one, \"Science should be pretty easy for you.\"  You hope your partner is right as the walrus starts to speak.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like many science teachers the Walrus is a straight to the point sort of guy.  He writes his name up on the board and starts teaching right off the bat.  There seems to be something wrong though.  Everything looks a little to simple for you.  This was all stuff that had been taught a few years ago at your school.  You try to get Zen\u2019s attention and by the way his ears swivel in your direction even though his eyes don\u2019t you can tell you have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Zen,\u201d you whisper, \u201cThis is a normal class, isn\u2019t it?\u201d  You wonder if this is a class for special students.  It just does not seem like this class is up to your level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this is the advanced class.  You aren\u2019t finding things too difficult are you?\u201d Zen asked while giving you one worried glance.  Now that took you by surprise.  This was the class for their best science students and this was the advanced material.  You thought that the teacher must be taking things easy on everyone on the first day or he was just taking it easy on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour opinion began to change quickly though.  As the class went on you kept answering all the questions while everybody else just stared at you.  The walrus asked you to give the other students a chance at answering questions about halfway through the class.  Even then you were the one that ended up giving the right answer more than half of the time.  While the carnivores in the class looked like they admired you, the herbivores were shooting you some nasty looks.  They probably did not enjoy being showed up by you.  Fortunately there were only two of them in this class and that made them a little easier to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to think of why you were so much better in science than even the best of the anthro students were.  That probably had to do with your size.  Humans just had to be better at things like science to have survived in the past.  By the material you could tell that the anthros weren\u2019t dumb.  A smart anthro was definitely far smarter than a dumb human was, but a human genius should be able to top an anthro anytime if this was as good as they got.  Still, science could just be a weak point for them.  You would have to see when the other subjects came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might not be a good idea to be such a shinning student even if you are smarter than the anthros though.  The herbivores don\u2019t seem to be taking to well to your performance.  You try to imagine what it would be like to have a bunch of 20 foot tall angry herbivores staring at you for an entire class.  That would definitely throw you off your game.  It was only possible in this class because of all the carnivores.  At least you know why Zen thought you would be good in this class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings and it is time to move onto the next class.  Your teacher congratulates you which makes you feel good after having to deal with being outshone in all your other classes.  Zen picks you up and starts taking you to your next class.  \u201cWow, I had heard humans were smart, but that was absolutely amazing.  You might want to be careful in math though since Corneil is in that class too.  Corneil has been the top student in his math course for the past five grade levels and I doubt he would take it well if you took over his spot,\u201d Zen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is our next class Zen?\u201d you ask.</span></div></div>",

The next room was well-adorned with math paraphernalia and the teacher, a kangaroo, donned a small pair of glasses as he welcomed you into the classroom. Zen took his seat on the far right of the classroom, placing you on the desk, and for a few minutes you watched the other students file into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the bell was due to ring, Corneil sauntered into the room. He quickly caught sight of you and gave you a taunting smile. You were glad that the other students had taken the seats around Zen, forcing Corneil to sit to the left side of the room. Trying your best to ignore his stare, you look to the front of the classroom as the kangaroo began his lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, their math was very much like their science. The lesson involved little more than basic algebra, which you considered yourself highly proficient at. You felt such an urge to show off your knowledge, and despite Zen's warning, you decided to raise your hand on the first question, promptly giving a correct answer to the other student's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing a worried look on Zen's face, you glance over at Corneil and see a look of absolute rage on his face. The other herbivores were doing the same, and just to be safe you let Corneil have the next question. He also answered correctly, and a spiteful smile crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the lesson became a shooting match between you and Corneil. You would answer the question then allow Corneil to do the same. He would then give you an opportunity, repeating the process and waiting in vain for one of you to falter. The divided students watched the competition as the teacher obliviously continued his lesson. During this, however, you notice a short (compared to them) fox girl in the corner. Every time you answered a question, a smug smile would cross her face. She obviously had something on her mind, and when the lesson was over you proceeded to ask Zen about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"That's Kira Granger. She was second in math class right after Corneil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, THAT cleared it all up. You looked in her direction as she packed up her belongings, and she flashed you a grin. You couldn't help but feel proud.</span></div></div>",

Zen hears your stomach growling like a miniature lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I bet you'll be glad to know that lunch is next,\" chuckled Zen as he hoisted you onto his thick furry shoulder.  \"Let's head off to the cafeteria, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you both left the door, you were caught by surprise by Corneil, who had grown to sixty feet and was apparently waiting right outside the door for you.

I've got my eye on you, human, and the next time I catch you becoming even remotely on par with us anthros, you will be sorry you ever came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorneil Rhinowski dropped Zen to the hallway floor and stormed off in a huff, leaving you terrified and Zen very peeved.  \"Ugh, that guy is such a jerk!  I don't know why anyone would want to hang out with him!\"  It is then that he notices you in total shock on his shoulder, and immediately changes his attitude.  \"Oh, I'm sorry you had to go through that, human.  I should have realized that even a little spat like that would be so much more frightening for you.\"  Zen's large paw pats your back, and you start to feel better.  \"Thank's Zen, I needed that,\" you reply to your helpful feline friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what will cheer you up, human; their serving my personal favorite lunch today at the cafeteria!  I'll get you some for you, my treat.\"  Suddenly, something odd entered your mind.  These anthros seem so humanlike, and yet can be a bit animalistic as well.  Do anthros eat food humans can eat, or do they something a bit ... fresher?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least when you get to the cafeteria, Zen brings you to a table with his friends.  You recognize Albert the crocodile, Theodore the Kodiac bear, Claude the wolverine, Felicia the cheetah, and even Kira the fox.  All of them seem to accept you like Zen, and you are glad that the herbivores tend to separate themselves from the carnivores in the cafeteria.  Zen leaves the table to buy the food, and your friends also seem quite hungry.  If you didn't know better, you would have thought that they would try to eat you.  Pretty soon, everyone cheers as Zen brings the lunch to the table.  All of the anthros' eyes light up as his large paw sets down a platter piled high with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You approach the platter and see each sandwich is teh size of a car too you. \"Zen!\", you call out. He doesn't hear you, but Kira does. She lowers her head to your level and asks, slightly timidly,\"Something wrong,human?\" You stammer a bit. Kira is quite attractive, even by human standards, and you catch yourself admiring her sweet face.\"Oh, it's just, these sandwiches look delicous, but to me, they're kinda...\" \"Big?\" she finishes. You nod in agreement. She smiles and tears of pieces of bun from one of the Joe's, puts some meat in between, and hands you a ragged, but perfectly sized, Sloppy Joe. \"Thanks, Kira,\" you smile, and sit to eat. Eventually, the plate is cleared, and licked clean by Zen. The carnivores sigh with content. \"I'll get some napkins for us,\" Theodore grunts, and walks away. You get out your math homework and find it as easy as the class was. Halfway through, you hear a clomping sound behind you. The others tense up and narrow their eyes.

You whisper to Zen,\"Is that a sheep?\" He whispers back,\"Yeah, she is. She was in math with us.\" \"I don't remember seeing her.\" Zen chuckled. \"Probably cause she wasn't staring at you in rage.\" You smile,\"Really? Well...wait, how did you notice her then?\" \"Predator thing. I notice everything that happens, or doesn't happen.\" You return your attention to the sheep-girl. She abviously nervous, a prey item surrounded by predators. \"Um, I..my name is Natalie, and I was wondering...I mean, I wanted to meet the human...I mean, the new student.\" She was practically shaking with fear. You tell Zen to let you down onto the table. \"You sure? She's an herbivore, she might be with Corneil.\" \"I don't think she'll hurt me. Like you said, she was the only one not hating me in math. Besides, I don't want word to get around the human is scared of a little sheep-girl.\" Zen chuckles in his throat and lowers you to the table. Natalie sits down and looks at you nervously. \"Um, hi, I guess,\" You offer your hand to her. She extends a finger, you notice she only has 3 and a thumb, and you shake it. \"Nice to meet you, human.\" She relaxes slightly. \"So, why did you want to meet me,\" \"Well, I heard you in math, answering all of the problems right, you seemed really smart. I was hoping you'd help me with my math homework.\" \"Hold on, why should he help you, plant-breath?\" Albert's jaws snapped as he spoke. Natalie blushed and she cringed in fear. \"Albert, it's fine. I'd be happy to help.\" Natalie smiles and pulls out her workbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as lunch is finishing, you finish up with Natalie.

Just stay close, okay?\" Zen gives a strained nod, and Natalie retracts you, placing you on her fuzzy shoulder. She walks carefully out towards bio class, still nervous with Zen so close. The class has a very unique odor, a mix of preservative fluids and old meat, all underscored by the faint smell of excrement. Various cages and aquariums holding animals litter the perimeter of the classroom. A bookshelf to your right is adorned with skulls and jars containing preserved animals. The teacher is an aging crow, and his head jerks to stare at the trio entering. \"Ah, good, you survived the school. I was hoping to meet you, human.\" He extends what you take for a wing, but see under the feathers he has 5 fingers ending in small talons. You shake the hand. \"Nice to meet you, Mr.Kawkins.\" \"Just Mr.K, please. I see you've already made some friends here. You'll need them, I tell you.

The world out there will seem sane after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Natalie and Zen head to the back, sitting in the last row. As they and you take your seats, there's a commotion behind you. Suddenly, a what seems to you like a semi truck leaps of the back counter and lands in front of you. \"George! I swear, I'm gonna turn you into a belt one day!\", Mr.K yells. You see the truck is actually a gigantic lizard, a grey-green iguana. \"Will he eat me!?\" You scream.\"No, son, iguanas, whether our size or your size, are herbivores. George regards you with one eye, tongue lapping out to smell you. \"Hey there, buddy.\" George nuzzles your chest, then whips around and crawls down the line of desks. The remainder of the class files in. \"Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Today, we will be taking advantage of our new student to compare the human and anthro body.\" You gape.\"Zen, human, will you come to the front?\" Zen picks you up and carries you to the front. \"Now, what is the most obvious difference between these two?\" \"Their sizes.\" \"Correct!\" Mr.K writes of the board. \"At their minimum size, anthros average about 20 feet tall, while human males average about 6 feet.\" He writes these on the board. \"That makes anthros a bit under 4 times taller than humans. However, that's hardly all that we differ in. As a whole, humans come from one common ancestor, primates. Anthros, however, have a wide variety of ancestries, evidenced by the menagerie here.\" He gestures to the students. \"What I want to emphasize, though, is what nature adapted each of our groups to. Suppose we could shrink Zen, or grow the human, so they were equal size. Which of the two do you think would win in a fight?\" Zen smirked. You grimaced. \"Zen, of course,\" a deer in the front row answered. \"Yes, he would. Even adjusting for size, anthros are usually much stronger than humans. They also posess other advantages. Natural weapons, so to speak. Claws, horns, poison, venom, the list goes on and on. We also can protect ourselves from the harsh environments through fur, feathers, and scales.\" You sigh.

They used animal furs to survive the harsh winters, created weaponry to make up for their lack of strength, and found ways to cure many diseases.\" The students then look at you in awe as if you were sort of incredible being.

Feeling that he wanted an answer, you amused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I believe the human body is made to adapt to it's environment very quickly. So we got an advantage over anthros at that,\" you got over carried looking up sheepishly up to Zen.

Like I said...we can eat food raw but it will take time to adjust so we rather cook it even if we're away from civilization. If it was me, the first thing to do would be to fine shelter, then water and when you are settle down then hunt for food. It's a good thing we can go a month without food,\" You felt a bit too talkative around Zen and ended it there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, you search his face to find that he is quite impress. \"I must say human, you maybe a bit weaker no offense but you beat us in other ways. If it wasn't for this size changing, things would be a bit different...for good or bad,\" Zen said as both of you thought about each other if things were a bit more even when your stomach growled. Hearing it, you held it in pain with discomfort in your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops..nearly forgot\" Zen said, pulling out a watermelon. Slicing it with his claw, he passed it to you as you started eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said making a pig of yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you were hungrier then I though,\" Zen laughed.

Thankfully, there is no sign of Corneil anywhere, and when you get to the room, you feel oddly safe around the seven other carnivorous anthros.  Felicia also happens to be in this class, and Zen decides to place you on a desk between his and hers.  The teacher, an old and wise looking condor lady, strutted into the room and started to teach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, everyone, I am Mrs. Peckard, and I will be your history teacher this year.  We will be covering everything up from the first discovery of the sizechange ability through to the present day.  In addition, there will also be some parts where our history intertwines with that of the human race.  I know that such material has never been taught before in a general history class, but in this day and age where humans and anthros must learn to respect each other, it is now most important that anthros learn some human history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Peckard started handing out thick textbooks, although compared to the anthros they looked smaller than pocketbooks.  The text is very heavy; at least five pounds, and must be at least a thousand pages long.  However, when you look through the book, you notice that the type is quite large, and is written in a very clear manner.  You actually are quite interested at many of the topics in the table of contents, such as \"Growth's Golden Age\", \"The Hundred Parsec War\", and especially \"Discovery of the Humans\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe condor lady continued to speak about the class syllabus in slightly more detail.  Some things that strike you as astounding about the history is that even in earlier times, the carnivores and herbivores lived uneasily.  Apparently, 'The 'Hundred Parsec War' was between the two groups, and somehow was able to be resolved without either side clearly winning.  You hear names that are very unfamiliar yet have a ring of accomplishment to them, such as King Lionel III (a great anthro lion who brought all of the anthro tribes together), Lycamedes (an ancient wolf philosopher who proved mathematically that there is no largest size an anthro can grow to), and Sir Penti Reticuli (a python explorer that first discovered humans).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost feel sad when the class ends, because you are genuinely interested in all of these colorful characters and wondrous events that you have never heard of before.  You tell Zen about it as he lifts you back onto his shoulder.  \"Wow, Zen, you anthros have a very intriguing history!  It sounds a lot better than the history that I learned in junior high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, human?\" replies a slightly surprised lion.  \"I personally find history to be a bit of a bore.  I do kind of want to find out about about the history of you humans, though.  I find it hard to imagine history without sizechanging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was very unusual thing for your friend to say in your opinion, but at the same time made a lot of sense.  Apparently, this concept of sizechanging, which is amazing to you, is an average, ordinary topic for anthros.  So much, in fact, that they must see it as amazing that humans DON'T change sizes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that only one class remained before study hall, you feel psyched to go to this last class.  You ask Zen what it is, and he replies,</span></div></div>",

Zen and Felicia must have been thinking the same thing because their eyes narrowed at the sight of him.  \u201cWe\u2019ll keep him away from you,\u201d Felicia said silently to you and Zen nodded in affirmation to what she said.  It was a little comforting knowing that the two large felines would be looking after you, but you still could not help but worry.  They could not look after you all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day of shop class did not prove to be much of a problem for you though.  It mostly consisted of Mr. Kodo giving everyone a tour of the classroom and introducing them to the equipment.  Of course, you had your own special workstation that included brand new equipment which Corneil did not seem to approve of by the way he snorted when he heard that.  After the tour Mr. Kodo had to make sure everyone passed a safety test and that pretty much took up the entire class.  You easily passed as did Felicia and Zen, but Corneil seemed to have a bit of trouble.  That actually worried you a bit more since not only did you have to worry about a giant rhino with a grudge against you, but you had to worry about a clumsy giant rhino with a grudge against you.  This was sure going to be an interesting class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell rang to signal the end of the class and the beginning of the lunch period Zen moved to get you out of the class well before Corneil could.  He would not be happy after you had managed to pass that test with ease and he barely managed to pass.  Felicia slowed Zen down a bit when she asked, \u201cCan I carry the human this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen looked at you and you said, \u201cSure, why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia\u2019s eyes seemed to brighten up and she reached out to you but did not grab you.  She was being polite and letting you step into her paw instead of just grabbing you.  When you did she carefully placed you on her shoulder which was noticeably smaller than Zen\u2019s and that made you feel a little worried about falling.  She noticed that and grew herself a couple of extra feet to give you a more comfortable perch.  Then you were off to lunch.</span></div></div>",

Then that thought perished, there was a selection of 'human' food, this was probably to help welcome you. You noticed, they had no chips (fries in american), or burgers, but they had a wide selection of pizza and pastas, Zen and Felicia were more than willing to try some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to admit, human, human food is very good, a bit hot for my taste, but good.\" Zen said that complete sentence with his mouth full. Corneil walked passed, snickering, he had a plate of pasta. So he was willing to try human food, but not let humans go to the same school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human, I forgot to ask, what is your name?\" Zen asked, this made you a bit more comfortable, as now, you would be referred to as 'human'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's [insert name here]\" You reply, as Zen and Felicia try not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit weird, but, then again, it would be normal for humans.\" Felicia says. \"Anyway, the next lesson is English/Anthro (they changed it to welcome you), then we have a free period, before last lesson. There, we will probably get to know you a bit more.\" You smile at the fact that a lot of things have been changed for you, you just feel glad that they aren't tearing you limb-from-limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch ends pretty quickly, you, Zen and Felicia are the first to get to Anthro. This class is taught by a hyena know as Mr. C, probably Chuckles knowing his luck. Bad thing for you, Corneil is in this class, and he is sitting behind you...</span></div></div>",

Fortunetly for you Corneil is the only herbivore in the class but he was sitting behind you.  From the sound of his snickering from behind you and zen this could be ugly.  Unfortunetly, even though you were the top in the nation and the most qualified student for this program, you came up third in your class... it was always the damn vocab!  Mr. C hands out the vocab sheet for the next 12 weeks of school and you are amazed that, with the exception of 2 or 3 words on each list, even vocab was easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class, as you know we have a new student in our class. A human student at that so lets just continue on and try to make him feel welcome.\"  Giving this small introduction the teacher turns and writes some gramer sentences on the board.  Suddenly a force struck you in the back and knocks you from Zen's desk and hurtling into the air.  Once again Felicia has the quicker reflexes and catches you before the fall becomes a problem.  Also you notice, as you get raised back to desk level, Zen has an out stretched hand holding a slightly mangled paper airplane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen unfolds it for you and the letter inside is scribbled in an almost impossible to read set of scratches that reads. 'Humain you better not show me up again or eles.  Yuve streatched your stay for to long.  Bee carfel because in the futre yu may just happn into an acsident.'  You look back and Corneil gives you a sly grin and a wink.  Zen crumples the note in an angrey rush and throws it away.  Felicia then deposits you on her desk so now Corneil will have a harder angle to give you trouble. Yet you have a feeling it was going to be a long class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the teacher turns and asks for volunteers to correct the gramer issues, mainly looking at you to show what you know.  Felicia and Zen give you a worried look and Corneil just glares.  You swallow your nerves and raise your hand.  Mr. C gives and almost unseen grin and call \" Good human, would you be so kind as to come to the board and correct as many sentences as possible.  As Felicia raises and goes to the board to make the corrections you tell her to make a large grunt of anger and a hail of medicine sized spit wads fly past you and over her shoulder.  Just when you think you are out of the woods and you make every single correction the teacher made on purpose and a few the teacher didn't catch while writing it one final spit wad flies through the air and hits you point blank in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fall and lose conciousness you hear a cry from Felicia, a roar from Zen and a shout of triumph from Corneil.  Then every thing fades to black.  You stir and open your eyes to a very bright white light and a sigh of relief \"[insert your name here], thank god your okay,\" exclaims Felicia. \"w-w-wheres Z-Zen?\"  Breathing and speaking is nearly impossible.  \" don't hurt your self, you just went through alot and the nurse says your going to be in a lot of pain for the next few days.\"  You soon recognize your surroundings and test your limbs, it feel like an arm and a leg are in a cast and your chest has a lot of pressure on it as well.  The nurse comes in, its an otter, and looks at you sadly. \" you were in such horrible condition when Felicia brought you but i managed to get the bones set and stabilize your condition.  You're going to in those casts for a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comes to you as a blow.... a month?! and on the first day of school.  \" your parents have been notified but it was agreed you would have to be in the care of an anthro until your healed.  Felicia has accepted the task since Zen isn't here so you will be in her classes for that time.\"  At this the otter prompts you and Felicia that you should go to the principals office to meet Zen and Corneil.  Felicial lifts you like and injured young kitten and walks you out of the Nurse's Office.  \"What happened to Zen?\"  Felicia gives you a sad look and says, \" He is defending his actions for attacking Corneil while Corneil plays the innocent student.  You haven't been brought up because the teacher noticed you unconcious in my hands after they went to the principal's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is to much for you to hear.  That ------- Corneil was the biggest pain in the history of the world.  Felicia nears the Principal's Office and you see Zen sitting out side. You struggle to yell his name and he looks up.  There is a mixture of anger, worry, and relief in his face.  \"What's going on,\" Felicia exclaims.  Zen looks down and says...</span></div></div>",

We had a shooting match so to speak, going back and fourth answering questions waiting for the other to slip up.  This was my fault.\"  The gorilla raises an eyebrow to this but stays silent. \"I didn't listen to Zen about staying low and not bothering/angering Corneil about the possiblity that I am smarter than him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a short sigh but continue the story.\"Next on the was out Corneil had grown larger and jumped me and Zen, strangling him and nearly flinging me from his mane, and threatened that unless i stayed out of the way i'd regret it.  He also gave this short decleration/speech about how anthros are better than humans at everything and that i should stay away.  Next was shop... but apart from some dirty looks nothing happened all that much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuggle to continue, partly from nervousness, partly because that spit wad must have blanked part of your memory.  You look to Felicia and polietly ask, \" Please fill in what i miss, my memory's not doing so well this close to the incident.\"  Felicia agrees and you notice out of the corner of you eye that Zen is clenching his paws.  \"...then we went to English and Corneil sat behind me and Zen.  Then.... uhhh.. then....-\" \"Then Corneil threw a paper airplane at ________, knocking him off the desk and i quickly caught him while Zen caught the note.\"  \"it had this small 3 sentence warning about how he'd make mylife living hell if I answered anything in this class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen promptly walks up and give the Gorilla the note for him to examin. \"...Felicia i cant really remember any more.\"  She straitens up and continues the overview, \" The teacher asked for the class to anser the grammer mistakes but no one did.  Reluctently ____ went up to do it.  Corneil started shooting spit wads at us.  Thankfully none hit him at first....

It seems he was expelled for torturing a neighbooring human town and was thusly removed.\"  \"you are free to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all leave the room before exclaiming a sigh of victory, no doubt there would be other herbivores who would take rash actions but Corneil was no longer one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets...\"</span></div></div>",

He\u2019s probably not going to be too happy, either, if his father has to bail him out of trouble.  Corneil might just get the rest of his friends involved in tormenting you now.  Felicia and I are probably going to have to make sure that we pay close attention to your well being.  We might have to get the rest of our friends to help out too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was definitely something to think about.  Then Felicia said, \u201cIt might not be such a good idea for me to keep you for the entire time you\u2019re recovering.  If Corneil always knows where you are he will definitely arrange for things to happen to you off school grounds.  It might be best if we swapped where you stayed every few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a good idea,\u201d said Zen as he suddenly smiled at you.  \u201cI know I would like to have you stay with me a few days and we have a few friends that would like to get to know you.  It would also be a nice way to show you that there are a lot of anthros that don\u2019t hate humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few of us would like help with our homework too,\u201d Felicia laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joined in with her laughter.  It probably would be best to make as friends as possible here.  If Corneil and the other herbivores were going to be a continued problem you were going to need more than just Zen and Felicia to protect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you missed the rest of the school day thanks to us, how about we take you out to eat?

But when she metions your name his ears pivk up a little and he looks up, his dark green cat eyes staring at you, he starts to speak. \"Y-y-you mean he's staying with us right now and i just...\" he stops before he finishes that statement.  \"Im sorry Felicia, i didn't know, I-\" \"don't appologise to me he's the one you should apologise to.\" He once again looks at you and says again, \" I'm sorry about that, i had no idea you were there.\"  You shrug and rely, \" Hey you didn't know and im not in any worse condition, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia's brother looks slightly amazed at your i dont really care relpy but keeps the look from his face.\"Thanks man, my name is Calico if you haven't figured that out yet.  You shake his claw as well, \" Nice to meet you Calico.\"  he hurriedly leaves the room so its only you and Felicia.  She sighs and sets down her bag, 'funny,' you think , 'i never noticed that before', and takes out some textbooks.  \"Your classes gave out homework?\" you query.  Felicia frowns and responds,\" yes my teachers love to give out homework on the first day.\"  You look at the assignments from her shoulder, \"You want me to help you?\"  Her face lights up with gratitude, \"Yes.  Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly go over her math work with her, using her shoulder to see the work over head and using verbal guides to solve the problems.  By the end, apart from a rare hint from you, she is completing the problems on her own.  She slams the book shut with a grin and the gust from the book causes you to lose you balace for a second before you catch yourself.  Meanwhile she is taking out he science work and you recognize it as basic chemistry of gases and continue helping her.  Once again by the end she can, for the most part, do the problems on her own and she finishes off giving a slight press into her neck like a very gentle hug.  She then packs up her things and goes to rest on her bed while you are cupped in her hands resting on her stomach.  Her steady breathing and warm furr slowly makes you drowsy and you fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

You notice her clothes are different so she got dressed the woke you up after being sure that you had enough sleep.  She has been watching over you like a mother cat over her young kitten.  She comes over and picks you up to set onto her should again and heads down stairs.  She quickly grabs a breakfeast/energy bar and heads out the door into the brisk morning air.  She gives you a small piece witch you devoure due to your lack of food yesterday and the piece actually fills you up once you consume all of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both arive to school and its still to dark for school to start but you notice Zen and some others hanging in a group.  Felicia joggs up to them and you greet them all, theres:<br>\r\nAlbert, the crocodile, Theodore, the kodak bear, Claude, the wolverine, and the vixen from math class.  Zen greets both of you and fills you in, \" Me and Felicia have been talking and we got you all together for one reason, to protect ________.  It may come to your attentions that Corneil has been expelled but with his father as the super intendent he will be back and that grudge is going to be much worse.  The pricipal agreed to this club ive formed and what we will be doing and has informed the teachers that this is allowed.\" He turns back and faces you. \" ___________, we are your guardians for your life her at school,  first Felicia, then Albert, then Claude, then Theodore, then Verena-\" 'that must be the vixen,' you think as Zen continues,\" and finally me.  We rotate every week and if needed we will switch to rotation in order in insure Corneil NEVER catches on with who you'll be with.\"  Felicial steps forword and speaks, \"What about confuntations with Corneil?  If he actually takes action and we are alone.\"  Zen thinks for a second then continues, \" Then we have the protect him at all costs, Felicia you can sive change a given body part faster than anyone at the school you'll have an edge Corneil cant counter, since you are the only one who can do that and regular size chage.  I can reach large heights as fast as you can do one given body part and i can get relativly bigger then corneil.\" pointing at his three friends, \"You three can hold a fight as well as I and some of you are slightly stronger or have an advantage. Then there is Verena, the most special of us all.\"  You have a questionative look on your face and Verena sees this and explains, \" I am the only known Anthro that can both size change to a larger size or shrink to a smaller one.  Which means if Corneil corners us i can get to a small size where he cant capture me and i can out run him.\"  This was amazing, you are so amazed it shows through your face and everyone smiles at your shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen speaks up again,\" OK, we know our roles now lets get to our classes.  Good luke Felicia.\"  You all say your goodbyes and head to different classes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instead of size changing class first Felicia heads to mathimatics, you note there is only one herbivore and she gives you a particularly nasty look.  Felicia sets you on the desk and has a seat, the herbivore is the farthest possible away from you which allows you to relax a bit.  The teacher, a sliver vixen, enters the class and she smiles and acknowledges you as one of the class, you see claude is also in this class and he has her peripheral on you two to make sure things are ok.  This time you let many others and Felicia answer the questions, but answering the really difficult ones that no one dared try to answer.  The class ends and Felicia heads to PE, and you have a slightly un easy feeling in your gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia meets up with Zen and they do their work out, the same as yesterday, and you stay a good distance away until its time for cardio work independintly.  Felicia picks you up and sets you on the tray on the treadmill and she gets on and does her endurence run, you still cant get over its 36 miles an hour, and Zen is, once again, doing high resistence on the cycles.  \"See you two at lunch with the others,\" with this Zen leaves while both of you head to third period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts sive changing and you anf Felicia are greeted by the teacher and Verena.  Suddenly Verena recedes from your view and you feel Felicia bend over and set something next to you in her paw.  Its Verena, who is still a good 3 feet taller than you.  \" Hey there, hows it going?\" you greet her ackwardly.  She smiles and responds, \"Fine, and you?\" she sees your casts and looks like she just said some racial slur.  \"It's ok, it doesnt really hurt anymore.  So you can change size in both directions?\"  Her face beams and she responds, \" yes it was a gift i discovered last year when we played hide and seek.  Zen and Felicia gave up when i decided to grow to normal hight, revealing i was hidding behind a sigh post.\"  You look amazed and she smiles.  \"You very good at math as well.\"  You're happy for a subject change and reply, \" It snot that im good its just that i've\"  you slow down trying to word it right, \" I'm not saying your not smart but... well... ive taken that math class a long time ago.\"  The vixen shrugs, \" dont appologise we knew you were far more inteligent in such subjects and it not offensive, I'm glad you beat Corneil and put him in a rough spot.\"  you think about how corneil was, supposidly the best but you easily matched him without even trying while he had to pause on some of them to rethink the answer.  \"Hey why do you still take size change classes if you can already do it?\"  The vixen replies withlittle thought, \" we practice to better control the rate at which we size change and become faster at it.\"  'that explains alot' you say in your head.  The teacher blows his whistle and Felicia's paw gently sets down Verena and Felicia continues to her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer elective is Computer Programing, also known as Computer Science, instead of art like Zen's.  The teacher is a wise looking Giant Panda with a pair of glasses which showed the shimming knowledge and wisdom in his eyes behind them.  You remeber takeing a course or two of this as well and wonder if it will be any different from those.  \"Hello class,\" which is followed imediatly by a responce of \"Hellow Mr. Bing.\"  At this, to your horror, this entire class, appart from Felicia, is filled with Herbivores. Some are even from your PE who hung out with Corneil.  The teacher speaks again as you try to judge whether or not the teacher is friendly or one of those that wishes you weren't here, \"We have a human in our class for a while but try not to focus on him or you may forget the lesson.\"  It hits you like a blow to be treated like an object rather than a student as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next class is Science and the teacher, Water Buffalo, ignors you as well so you give Felicia the answers she doesn't know to respond to the teacher so you can feel some acomplishment.  This class was balanced with Herbivores and Carnivores and you see Albert and Theodore in this clas as well, one sitting in from and on to your right.  The bell rings signalling lunch and the four of you head out at the same time.  It's first lunch and while the others of your club have live cows, you eat a piece of an energy bar Felicia had so you didnt have to think about the cows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory proceeds without a problem as well as Shop.  In shop you did you first small project and, even though it was still not as good as you wanted you made a particullarly craftful chinese puzzle, with working joints in the apropriate hinges and everything, and during second lunch you let Verena and some of the others try it out, you knew the way to do it since you built it, Verena completed it the fastest while many of the other sat puzzle trying to understand the pattern.  Finally English came and went without any difficulties and you once again went home with Felicia and started to help her with her home work and hang out.  You note that by the end of the day, besides the casts, it felt almost like a normal day.  You go to sleep early again earger for the next day of school.</span></div></div>",

Today was as good as it could get and everything suddenly smashed into a ----en wall and went spiralling down and hit a spicky blood covered pit with no way out.  'How could it happen to me?\" was all you thought as you lay mangled on the floor awaiting for that final push to send you over the edge.  You think back to earlier that day.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey Felicia lets hurry to PE and catch up with Zen,\" you call to your anthro friend and she agrees, \" hang on i'm going a little faster now.\"  You clutch a scruff of her spotted fur within her neck hollow where, you found out, you can sit easily and not obstruct Felicia when she wants to run faster.  The wind starts to rush past you giving you that exhilerated feeling like you were, almost, flying.  Felicia slows down as she reaches the door and you both catch your breath and feel you heart skip a few beats and mabey even stop for a second or to.  Corneil is talking with the PE teach, CORNEIL WAS BACK!!!!  felicia slinks over to Zen who is in the corner, eyes narrowed and fists clenched.  \"hes back.\" he coughs a low growl only you and Felicia hears.  \"Remeber you dont have him i do... or thats what he thinks, _______ stay low and remain hidden.\"  You'r so frozen and plae with fear you dont resond, but they know u understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class finally huddles around the teacher as he gives the lesson for today's PE course, \" Alright class, get ready for a completly new idea that Corneil came up with here.\" He gives a thankful nod no Corneil who grunts and keeps his eyes narrowed on Zen, not you, and the teacher finishes, \" We are going to wrestle today.\"  There is a hush as the other students notice Zen and Corneil stareing deep into the other's eyes and can almost feel the heat of their rage twords each other grow.  \"First up, is Zenten and... \" a deathly quiet class only stares, \"Corneil.\"  Zen roars with acceptence and shows a particularly large set of sharp white teeth.  Corneil lowers his head and swings side to side showing off his gigantic horn.  Ther eyes meet but hold for the teacher to start the fight.  Every single student in full fear realises the depth of this anger and gets against the furthest wall possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No size changing is allowed and no killing, when i deam the victor the fight is over.  Ready......\" An even deader silence fills the room, no wind, no talk, hell everyone is even holding their breath.  \"GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZen roars and snarls as he starts a zig zagged charge twords Corneil.  Corneil snorts pure range and lowers his massive head for a charge and begins to move forwards.  Just as the two competetors are about to collide Zen does a giant leap to his right after feinting a left that Corneil follows.  Zen catches Corneil's upper shoulder and makes a cut, although not that deep, at his side.  'Corneil's hide is think' you think as you stare at a huge version of the forces of the natural kingdom battle it out.  Corneil whipps around so fast that Zen hardly gets out of the way in time.  The horn makes a cut, even shallower than Zen's because he got farthest away from the horn, into his chest.  Zen clashes and 3 deep cuts go into Corneil's horn.  The two combatents circle showing that both will be in this for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn, what seems like hours but is only 30 minutes, the battle was still at a stand still.  Corneil had cuts across both shoulders and deep wound in his left flank, one jagged cut across his right eye and some deep scratches in his horn.  Zen looked like he survived being even touched by the worst ones, with on deep cut on his rght leg and scratches across his chest and other legs, well he's on all fours so their legs for now, but Zen was getting the worst blow, exhastion.  Corneil's massive size and one main attack form plus his slow spped made him on the defenseive more often, while Zen had to close in to use all his weapons effectivly.  Zen made one more dashing sprint and leaped, it was higher than all the others, and he spun on the way down, jaws sinking into Corneil's neck.  A gasp, the first sign of life from the class, emerges and before the teacher can call off the event Corneil bets all his weight into the side Zen hangs from, shoves him off, and whips his head arounf so fast, your sure he himself recieved whiplash.  The enormous horn cuts across Zens back from right shoulder to left leg and Zen goes crashing to the ground.  A is struggling to get up, Corneil walks up and places a massive foot on his stomach and pushes down as his horn pushes into Zen's mane.  A whislte sounds halting this hiddeous event and signalling the end of the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia sprints her full, and gets to Zen to help him up.  When she bends over to get Zen's arm around your shoulder you realize there is another hard breath moving her fur.  You looks up to see Corneil staring with black, cold, enraged eyes at you, and you know that Corneil wasn't even satisfied yet.  Just then the bell rings and Corneil suddenly laughs and whispers to you, \" You got off lucky human but you will not live to see tomarrow.  No one , not even a worm like you crosses Corneil and gets away with it.\"  He leaves you and Felicia as she flattens her ears and growls a menicing growl you never heard before.  Felicia gets Zen up and you take him to the nurse who promises to make sure he heals fine for the rest of the day.  Felicia passes by Theodore and stops him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corneil is back and Zen is at the nurse's, he knows i have __________ with me.  You have to take him.\" Theodore only shakes his head in agreement, and like that, you are transfered into Theodore's care for the day.  Thankfully none of Theodore's classes mix with Corneil's and you meet Felicia and Albert in science.  You manage to sit through it and get to first lunch.  As the five of you, disincluding Zen, sit at your table you notice Corneil coming with two of his Herbivore buddies, a Big Horn Ram and a Hippo.  \"Give us the human and we;ll let you make it to the end of the school day.  \"Hey theodore,\" albert calls in a loud enough voice the three Herbivores hear him ,\" is that green eating over confident lower rung of the food chain talking to us.?\"  Albert starts to laugh and Corneil advances but Felicia cuts him off.  \"What's the matter did you UNDERSTAND those words he was saying, you poor stupid beast.\"  Corneil throws a punch which Felicia catches in her enormus grown hand.  The Giant hor ram tries to advance and Theodore cuts him off, and Albert does the same to the hippo.  Corneil lowers his head, glears his eyes and shouts, \" I'm giving you onw last cance, Give me the damn WORK OR I'LL KILL ALL OF YOU!\"  The entire cafiteria is deathly silent.  Felicia just smiles and spin kicks Corneil with and overgrown paw in the chest and flings him onto the heighbooring table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos insues as carnivores and Herbivore fight each other in an all out brawl.   Snarls and grunts echo in the halls and as you stay close to Verena you see Felicia pounce onto Cornel but his massive shoulder catches her and sends her spiralling across the hall and land in a heap.  With a speed faster then in the fight Corneil, picks himself up and charges you.  Verena tries to grab you when a Zebra clears your table and smashes into her.  You start to run when a massive weight smacks you poorly conditioned body across the table you stop before the edge and yell in pain.  Seeing stars you see Cornel standing over you beeming, whats the matter?  not so confident when you big protectors are hear to save you.  He lowers his arm and you roll ou of the way, which results in a extremely painful slide back across to the other side of the table.  You try to see the others but the who hall is errupting with fighting still.  You reach the edge and your lower, cast covered, half your body goes off and you barely are able to catch the side of the table.  The is a huge pounding vibration and your hands slip.  You fall down till you crash on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this happen,' you think, you were amazed how quickly the week has been while Corneil is gone, appart from some shunning durring in PE and Computer Science, and were glad to have time to heal without so much stress.  Today was as good as it could get and everything suddenly smashed into a ----en wall and went spiralling down and hit a spicky blood covered pit with no way out.  'How could it happen to me?\" was all you thought as you lay mangled on the floor awaiting for that final push to send you over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorneil is above you and has one of his massive legs lifted over you, \" This is what happens to inferrior pests who try to get in my way.\"  His leg comes down and you close your eyes, even knowing it wouldn't softern the pain, then a feel like your being picked up and carried across the room.  You open your eyes and see, well, a smaller version of Verena carrying you across the room and out the door, you look back to see Felicia, Albert and Theodore close behind and relativly unhurt.  You are glad to have had suck great friends and as you try to whisper thanks you black out.</span></div></div>",

I understand your our guest for this week?\"  You agree, \" yes and i hope that math lessons are only given on school hours not afterschool ones.\"  Both and verena and her mom laugh at your joke.  \" hey mom i was going to take him to my friend;s house.\"  \"ok just be back before night.\"  With that you were off.<br>\r\n *                       *             *                       *                              *<br>\r\n\"Corneil, the Zebra has visual on the vixen and he is following them.

The dragon sees your face in thought and elaborates, \" I informed Felicia of Corneil's father's position, I warned Zen about Corneil's return, I warned ALL of them about Corneil's plan at lunch  and I rescued Verena from the Zebra at lunch... although that was the trickiest part of them all.\"  You take in every word the dragon speaks and take to heart the enormity of this anthro's help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's true,\" spoke Verena, \" I ran into Dagolith one day when i was exploring my size shrinking.  I ran into the hole in the house and got lost in the dark.  He helped lead me to this room and we talked for a long time.  I came back when he asked me to so i knew about Corneil's planned ambush.  He also has a greater purpose in your safty like all of ours,\" she was refering to Zen and the others.  Dagolith took up where Verena stopped,\"  I used to be the advisor for the Ocelot who was superintendant to the school and charged with your safty.  Corneil's father doesn't know i exist but i have the entire second floor of the school reserved to me.  But now all our tasks are much harder to insure that your safe passage through high school insures a greater bond between humans and anthros.  But now i have news of Corneil's next plan...\"  You and Verena listen clostly to what Dagolith has to talk of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both take to heart what your tasks are while noting what you have to tell the others.  \" Leave through this door, they don't know where you are and have given up by now.  You both leave and it suddenly hit you that while you listened to Dagolith he never once opened his mouth to speak, but you knew you heard his voice.</span></div></div>",

Being at the peak of the Anthro race they are said to have an intelligence that matches a Human's hands down.  Their ability to sizechange is mastered at birth and are renowed to have the ability to grow to gigantic sizes, size change key points of their body, and even to shrink if they felt like it.  Although not all of their capabilities are known it has been proved that their color of scales dominates their base characteristics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed: The Red Dragon has a stocky built body and cannot stand on two legs, despite being an Anthro.  It also doesn't have any wings.  It is one of the most aggressive Anthro's around and make great war generals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue:  The Blue Dragon looks more serpantine then the Red Dragon.  It has four legs and almost resembles a Chinese Dragon.  It is more passive then the Red and sticks to wisdom and knowledge.  This Anthro usually is a Diplomat in times of peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen:  The Green Dragon is a thinner build with a narrower snout than the Red.  Greens are both passive and Agressive depending on how they feel.  They are comonly found supporting either the Blue or the Red Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack:  The Black Dragon is a mystery.  See White Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite:  The White Dragon does not exhist unless the Black Dragon exhists.  Both are exact opposites and are depicted as one side of the Ying-Yang.  Their true form is unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold:  The gold dragon also has different forms but seems to embody traits of all dagons except the black and white.  The Gold is noticeable for being the best diplomat and Stratagist in all Anthro community.</span></div></div>",

Before he has a chance, you grab his outstretched arm and twist it behind his back, taking out his knees as you proceeded, he started to come at you with his other hand, which you grabbed and pinned just as well. He was totally pinned, you grabbed a piece of near-by string and tied his arms together, and then his legs, he couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's next?\" you say, the other herbivores begin to retreat except a few brave enough to face you and your friends. Your friends managed to scare off the few remaining herbivores without harming them. In the meantime, you had to get Corneil taken care of. You switched to Gerwalk and used its arms, vertical thrust, and stability to carry Corniel to the Principal's office where you explained what occured and then took him to the nurse.

You look through the database and find the cyclones, apparently, there are many variants for many tasks. You ultimately settle on a smaller hybrid craft carrying a micro-replicator on board, you have it materialized and see a small board materialize. As you step on it, your neural link connects with the board and a 3D hud appears in your vision, a new experience, but you reason it is a flight set-up. This board has multiple forms just like the vari-tech fighter, as you meddle in the hud, you find the replicator systems and discover the board can act as a flying skateboard, skates, a jetpack with jet boots, a \"solar\" surfer, and for some reason, a phase cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now that you know what it does, you wonder how fast can it go, as your wondering, the board leaps into the air and onto your back, spinning off many pieces and then connecting to them, when its finally finished, you have a sleek wing on your back with a booster in the center, connecting to a set of boots and a set of goggles and gloves. As you continue your wondering, the HUD gives you directions to walk over to a catapult like device and kneel down, as you do so, you notice the knee and elbo pads. Then, on-screen it shows what will happen, and suddenly, you know everything about it, as if it placed it into your mind, a scary thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what the heck could you lose, you begin a set of pre-flights and have the catapult launch you, as you fly forward, you see the engines part and  you go flying out between them at what must be at least mach 1. You soar out and take flight, nearly ramming into Zen who quickly dives to the right, you quickly bring yourself to a stop and fly over to Zen, he stairs down at yo in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well know, when'd you get wings?\" Zen asked teasingly as you landed in his open hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found in the Vari-tech's shuttle bay\" you answer, looking at Zen's surprised look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both here the stampede of Zen's siblings and know its dinner time, dinner is un-eventfull.</span></div></div>",

As you dart along at a relatively slow pace for the anthro's you here booming noises behind you, using the neural link you acess the jet-pack's sensors and a rear-view to discover its two titan boys, Zen's younger brothers, though certainly not little compared to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe varietech is behind them hovering, so if things get bad, at least you've got a method of rescue. Heading down the hall you notice the two are aiming for you like kittens loose on a fly. There enormous threat was enough of a threat that enough was enough, though first of course was the verbal warning before it was enforced by hot lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling onto your back, you climbed upward and then bent upward, keeping your legs straight ahead so the back-booster gave you lift and the boots kept you ahead of the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Mind NOT trying to step on me?\" You yelled, a tad angrily than you'd meant, but there was enough trouble with the herbivores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" both kids say, though from the sounds of it, they weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than wait to find out, you roll onto your back again, ramrod straight and pick up the pace for the stairs, arcing up, rolling on your side and shooting through the railings, as the wall cut off to be replaced by a bit of railing so this area looked over the entrance. Once through you did a quick roll headed for the open door, you shot out and into the neighborhood seeking the hokey game quite likely already under way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding your friends in the culvesac you discover you were right, they had already started. Rather than interrupt, you have the fighter land on the sidelines and await your orders for now, though it was to alert you to any threats to itself and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you buzzed down onto the game like a little fly, just barely avoiding being nailed by your titan friends, their hokey-sticks, and the puck itself. You laughed to yourself as no-one noticed your presence, at least for now, so you hung out buzzing around the game watching from the air.</span></div></div>",

A series of schematics appeared before your eyes, there was another configuration of the cyclone, one that'd combine it with the glider/jet board. \"Perfect!\" you said, luckily quiet enough that your friends didn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you cut out the vertical thrust, sunk and then brought the engines back up in a full-speed dash to the varietech. Far above it you sent the signal for it to launch the cyclone, this one was in a different configuration and launched out of the shuttle bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came out flat looking like an over-grown hover-board and shot towards you. Then, it suddenly broke apart into a hundred pieces each one coming over a part of you and expanding into part of an armor suit, making you look a great deal like some of those super-heroes from comics back home, at least the regular people who built armor to be super.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyes now had a fortune of data being projected onto them, you saw power-readings, weapons statuses, flight data, shield readings, structural readings and more; a comic geeks dream. And your opportunity to test the new suit came right at you in the form of a proximity warning, the sensors of the new battle-suit read out the puck heading right for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you concentrate on the weapons and a nice, long energy sword forms out of  your hand, about a foot lock to the Anthros, and perfect for handling an approaching puck. As it approached you brought up your arm and braced yourself leaning forward with the aft booster ready for full power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM! You smashed it and were knocked back a few ft. but hey, you hadn't remembered to fire off that aft booster. Your friends looked around wondering what had sent that puck back their way, and at that faster than they'd sent it yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to surprise them, you decided to jettison the new armor for now and re-combine later. It fell off and re-formed below in its original form, which you now got a better look out. It had two large boosters/cannons in its back and the wheels came off of those with the body forming a delta-wing around it, it in fact would've worked fine as a hover-board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the animals neared, you flew up to meet Zent, \"Hey everyone,\" you say, \"having fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Zen replies, \"how the heck did you manage to shoot that back? Without the varietech?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this\" you reply, signaling the booster-cyclone to take off and re-combine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before it splinters apart and forms around you, the boosters attatching to your back and angling off, the tires on your legs, a helmet replicating over you from a rounded part. The new information came in front of your vision, and more, it had now started scanning your friends, outlining them and from your memory marking them all friendly, though it did still seem to have formulated an escape path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Armor suit\" you explain, \"made out of a cyclone, it seems to have been built for this and has numerous configurations, a lot more than anything else I've found yet.\" With a thought you have the helmet retract, at least for now to talk face to face, \"I used an energy sword to send the puck flying, though this has a lot more yet.\"</span></div></div>",

When she seen him though she said he need a hospital. So she called 911, and with in minutes an ambulance was there to pick [Your Name] up. When we got to the hospital we needed to wait a little while because a human doctor needed to be called in, but when the doctor arrived he started to examine [Your Name], but he was too late. [Your Name] had slipped into a coma. The doctors had him put on life support, but they weren't really giving him any benefit of the doubt. They said that if his vitals turned for the worst that they would unplug his life support. Luckily his vitals have stayed the same for now at least. I just hope he pulls through, even though the doctors keep saying he won't make it. I have faith and so does  Verena,Albert,Theodore, and Zen. I can't help but feel like its my fault though. If I hadn't let Corneil throw me across the cafeteria I would have been able to save [Your Name] from harms way. I just really hope he pulls through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Present Day-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Still in Felicia's Perspective)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been 4 months now and I'm so worried. Everyday I he'd to the hospital and stay their till visiting hours are over, or I pay one of the nurses to let me say the night in [Your Name]'s room. I'm just so scared and I feel so guilty about the whole thing. I shouldn't have jumped at Corneil and let him throw me. It was stupid of me. It's a good thing Corneil got lock up for assisting a fellow student, or else I would be paranoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Felicia! Are you okay? It looks like your in another trance.\" Albert said interrupting my train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah what's up with you? Are you thinking about [Your Name] again?\" Asked Verena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... Oh sorry guys... Yeah I can't stop thinking about him... I'm just so worried about him.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we all are. If you want we could go see how he is doing.\" Said Zen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that would be great if we could.\" I responded. It helps me deal with the current situation when I check on [Your Name]'s condition I thought to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later we arrived at the hospital and [Your Name] was still there. His condition was still the same. He was still in a coma. Still lying in bed. It brought a tear to my eye seeing him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Felicia he'll make I know he will.\" Said Verena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he's a tuff little guy.\" Albert said trying to reassure you like Verena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my fault though if I hadn't jumped at Corneil and let him throw me away from [Your Name] he would be like this!\" You yelled.

Please review the syllabus on your own time, as we do not have room in the schedule to waste. This semester will mark the final part of your comprehensive studies on leputian-type energy transformations and Z-X axis extradimensional quantum variations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComprehensive studies on what? <i>What</i> did he say? You think, your mind incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will begin on chapter 4, as chapters 1 to 3 should be old material,\" the walrus drones, not breaking his monotone stride. \"As we already know, leputons initially reside in ZZ-axis space as chelysons, where they are passed through a Fettchen-Boar funnel and activated before synchronizing with molecules in a counter-preditive manner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly feel your stomach worry into your pelvis as you see him turn around without further explanation, rapidly jotting down rapid-fire symbols for proofs and mathematical formulae that you've never seen before. You try to copy as much as you can, but are constantly forced to choose between what he says and what he writes for your note-taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...which, using Macropian's Constant, gives us this formula here. Now, notice this variable here, an XZ-position with a gravitic leputon-chelyson bind, which we're going to unpack- it consists of....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lecture goes on, you can feel the blood rushing out of your face as worry turns to panic. Every third word in every single sentence is one you've never heard of. It's almost like you're in a language class instead. This can't be real, you think to yourself as you shake your head disbelievingly. Surely others here in the class must be thinking the same as you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Zen, and feel a stab of betrayal as you see a look of clear half-lidded boredom in his eyes. His eyes are fixed on the board,  but not only is he not scared of this class at all, it's barely challenging him. He yawns, briefly exposing two rows of fangs as long as your arm, then writes a few passive notes. He's not alone- as you look around the classroom, you can tell his is a popular sentiment. A collie seems to be writing down notes furiously, but in front of her a panda rubs his eyes to stay awake. An iguana balances his pens against each other. The gazelle next to you scrolls through her phone, completely indifferent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there you sit, in your toy desk, surrounded by titans, completely and utterly lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-which gives us a total answer of 5.342 microtons per n-motion. And remember- you will be asked to show your work for *every* problem you get,\" Dillident finishes evenly. \"Did everyone get the same answer? Raise your hand if you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a slight <i>whoosh</i> through the air, and as you look around, every anthro in the class has a paw, claw, or hand-analogue up. You raise yours tentatively, afraid of judgment for falling behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Dillident burbles in neutral satisfaction. \"Now, we move on to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelplessly abandoning the class as it is being taught, you lower your hand and turn back to chapter one of the textbook, figuring you might as well start catching up- and there, as you slowly mouth the title of chapter 1 to yourself, your stomach settles from panic and alarm to full-blown dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brief overview of quantum mechanics.\" As introductory, prerequisite material. As chapter <i>one.</i> And, as you look through the textbook soberly, easily making up the first 130 pages, in size 1 font or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, you slump in your chair. There's no other conclusion to make: you're completely and utterly out of your league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class passes in the same incomprehensible blot of of a presentation as the first ten minutes. As the class bell rings and your giant classmates fill the air with shuffling, stomping movement to pack up and leave, you close your notebook with a terminal <i>thud</i>, looking forlornly at the board ahead. \"Study chapters 4 and 5, and practice problems 6 through 24. And be ready for a mini-quiz next class!\" Dillident calls out before anyone leaves, as he turns to the board. Dillident is wiping it down already, and you didn't even copy down half of what he'd written, let alone what he'd said. You are completely off-guard when Zen's paw swoops under you and knocks your knees out, letting you fall into his firm brown-padded palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy points!\" Zen scoffs confidently as he shoulders his bookbag and walks out.<br>\r\n\"You... you think so?\" You say, trying not to betray your insecurity.<br>\r\nZen waves his hand dismissively. \"Oh, please!  Chapter 1 isn't even proper science, these mechanics are just building on stuff they taught us in <i>size-changing</i> class back in elementary school when I was a cub. Chapters 2 and 3 are all about the nature of where we get our extra mass from when we shape-change. We went over it so many times in middle school that it's practically rote at this point. Easy pass if ever there was one.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, Zen! Hold up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are spared the mercy of a reply in the conversation as Zen is interrupted by a waving snow leopard approaching you both. He and Zen clap hands twice in a brotherly secret shake. \"Kirden, nice! Kirden, this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and wave at his face as he smiles back in excitement, a gorgeous spread of black spots against light-grey fur, but you don't catch what he's saying because you're too busy thinking about the science class from hell you just went through. It wasn't just a matter of the science being way over your head- if what Zen had told you was right, and looking at the rest of the class seemed to confirm it, then that stuff was their average, possibly even elementary, and it was waaaay over the head of anything you'd heard of on Earth, let alone studied. They learn quantum mechanics as <i>cubs?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around you at the passing students- a lemur in a skirt, a male bunny in some skin-tight exercise gear, a pony covered in gaudy prep attire, a horse in casual shorts, shirt and sandals. You then look up at Kirden and Zen, distantly aware of them laughing at some joke you didn't catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's always been surreal, being around giants so casually stronger than you, but knowing they're casually smarter than you too only enhances the distorted, dreamlike quality of it. You feel like you're in a nightmare, like a bug in a pantheon. They haven't changed their sizes, but now they don't have to. Now, you feel much, much smaller, all on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only hope you can bridge the gap.</span></div></div>",

You all swarmed around the bland sustenance like ants, although you were much more insignificant than an ant.

You note that the desks are arranged in a circle, letting you see all the different kinds of anthros clearly.  Most of the ten teenagers are furry, but some are scaly or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the lid of your cage lifts, and you are scooped up in your owner's paws.  The kind anthro fox walks among the students, who often reach out to pat you, as she addresses them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to the second half of Human Care, everyone.  As you can see, we will be working with a live human now, instead of figurines, so everything you learned earlier this year must be practiced when handling him.  His name is Dusty, and he's been living with me for one month.  He can talk, but he is very quiet and will only talk when he is very comfortable with someone.  Otherwise, you will all find Dusty to be affectionate and loyal, as long as you act respectfully back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being scratched playfully on the head by a giant lioness anthro, your owner travels back to her desk, where she shrinks you down to three inches tall and places you in a cage with a cushy bean bag inside.  You know that you will be spending lots of your time with the students, and from the way that nearly all of them reached out to pet you, you feel like you are going to enjoy being in this classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master continued talking to the students.  \"For the second semester, there are no tests or essays, only hands-on projects.  Twenty five percent of your grades will come from group in-class projects with Dusty, and seventy five percent will come from one-on-one projects with Dusty.  These one-on-ones will happen every day after in the order we have decided on at the beginning of class, and each of you must attend all three of your assigned dates, or you will be dropped from the class.  In order to earn your human ownership licenses, you must score at least a ninety overall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not know what it means to have a one-on-one.  Will this mean that your owner won't be there to protect you if something goes wrong?  Suddenly, the cage door opens, and you are caressed by soft black fingers.  Surely your master won't allow any harm to come your way.  The friendly digits lift your fragile frame up and place you in a padded palm.  Your master carries you into the center of the circle, where she begins her first lesson with you.</span></div></div>",

You are first lying in her palm, then her whole hand, then in both hands, and finally cradled in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you are all aware class, humans have the amazing ability to change size at another's will.  Can anyone tell me what is so special about the size Dusty is right now?  You see many anthro arms shoot into the air, and your owner chooses an anthro iguana boy.  \"That is the largest size that humans can get to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Iggy.  Remember that if you try to make a human larger, it will only put strain on its body and cause it much discomfort.  Now, can anyone tell me the smallest size a human can be?\"  Much fewer anthros raised their paws or claws this time.  \"Yes, Gladys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One quarter of an inch?\" the anthro capybara girl.  \"Sorry, that's wrong, Gladys, but you do make a good point that I will mention very soon.  Actually, there is no smallest size that a human can be.  Allow me to demonstrate, but keep in mind that this should only be attempted by or with the help of a professional human handler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly become very fearful as you seem to collapse downward.  You suddenly stop at one inch, and your master carries you to the tip of one of her black fingerpads before you continue your descent.  Inches become feet, then yards, then miles as you find yourself on a barren wasteland of blackness surrounded by fur many times thicker than trees.  You fear this size greatly, it is even smaller than the size you have lived at most of your life.  Fortunately, you remain that way for only a few seconds before you quickly shoot back up to a more substantial quarter inch.  The powerful black finger tilts slightly, causing you to roll safely into your owner's waiting palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, it is very easy for an overly enthusiastic anthro to shrink a human to unimaginably small sizes.  However, you all surely noticed that the human disappeared from view, and this is why a quarter inch is set as the minimum recommended height that humans be kept at.  Now, what two things control the shrinking of a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, every one of the fifteen anthro teens raise their hands.  Your owner calls on the anthro lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desire and focus.  Humans shrink whenever you want them to as long as you think about them shrinking hard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, Leona, I couldn't have said it better myself.  Now, would someone like to come up and practice shrinking and growing Dusty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did everyone raise their hands again, but they all seemed very eager to shrink you.  You hope that whoever participates isn't overly enthusiastic, because you really don't want to become that small again.  You are hoping a little for Leona, because she seemed to be the most friendly when petting you.  However, the teacher picks someone else.</span></div></div>",

By the look of her large pupils in her eyes and fuzzy nose, you reason that she is a fruit bat.  Her huge wings are relaxed and folded over her back and lower body like a cape.  You note that her stiff oversized bat ears have many earrings that are larger than you at your current size.  Your master gently empties you into Stella's waiting palms, which are covered in very soft chocolate-brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stella strokes your body gently with a black painted claw over three times your size, your owner instructs her through the process.  \"Okay, Stella, first I would like you to grow Dusty to one foot, the maximum size, while putting as little strain on his body as you can.\"  Her huge eyes seem to peer into your soul as she focus on your growth.  You slowly start to fill the bat's soft palm, but you notice that the left side of your body feels a bit heavier than your right.  This feels very weird, so you start to sway a bit in discomfort, clutching your slightly warped head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, did I hurt him?\" cried out Stella, immediately stopping your growth.  As your body evens out on its own, your fox master comforts Stella.  \"You're doing fine for a first time, Stella.  Try to focus more on how large you want him to be in the end, not necessarily on the growth itself.\"  Once again, you started growing, and this time it went much smoother; almost as smooth as if your owner had done it herself.  You did not even feel the strain that your master was talking about.  You now found yourself supported in the fruit bats arms, which are much bonier than your master's, but not uncomfortable.  Stella seemed to be a bit fearful of your safety and rested your head in her palm as if it was as fragile as a soap bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work!  Now try to shrink him back to one quarter inch.  It's okay if you go too far on the first try, this is very common.  Just make sure that you are supporting his body in one hand and you will not cause him any bodily harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her teacher's words, Stella looked quite nervous, as did you.  Now you are sure that you are going to end up at a scarily small size, and Stella seems very fearful of hurt you accidentally.  You feel yourself shrink in tiny bursts, which make you slightly dizzy.  After reaching four inches, you are scooped up into the soft brown palm once more.  Stella looked on the verge of tears as she focused on keeping you shrinking safely.  You shrink smaller and smaller, yet the fur of her hand does not grow coarser.  Once as thick as her little finger, you suddenly start shooting down faster, and Stella cries out in fear.  This frightens you as well, and the slight twitch in her hand causes you to fall over in a small heap.  You curl up a bit, fearful that you may fall, but you are still safe, even though you are much smaller than a quarter inch.  You hear loud clapping coming from the other students and heavy panting coming from the fruit bat, but you do not look up, since you do not want to know how small you are.  You then feel a familiar black pad against your back and you grow to one inch before returning to your owner's safe paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, Stella, and you really did not do bad at all.  If you can stay calm and focused when changing a human's size, I'm sure that you could be an expert someday.\"  Stella managed to crack a smile at you and your owner before wrapping her wings a bit tighter around her skinny body.  Suddenly, you hear a loud ringing, and you figure that the class must be over for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's all the time we have for today; I will see you all tomorrow on Tuesday.\"<br>\r\nYou see fourteen of the fifteen young adult pack up their things and leave the class, but one of them remains.  You suddenly remember that you are supposed to have one-on-ones with a student every day, but you still do not know what that means.  Whatever it is, the student on the first day is...</span></div></div>",

Oddly, you are not nearly as afraid now as you thought you would be.  Your master brings you to your desk and starts to talk about what a one-on-one is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Dusty, you have a very important job.  First of all, you will be going home with Stella overnight and returning to me in the morning.\"  You start whimpering now, because you love your master so much, and your master consoles you with a finger pad.  \"I know, I know, I will miss you too.  My students are all very nice, though, and I am sure that you will like staying with them.\"  You return your love to your master by giving her finger a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, on this first day, Stella will be treating you as a normal human pet, with nothing special like the other two one-on-ones.  However, it is your job to pay close attention whenever Stella does something with you.  You will tell me how good of a job she did caring for you Tuesday morning, and I will determine her first project's grade from what you tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master lowers you into your traveling cage, designed for a one inch human and colored bright red so it cannon get lost.  Stella comes to your owner's desk and picks up a sheet of paper.  You wish you could read what was on that paper!  After stuffing the paper into her bag, she picks up your cage next.  Even when you are safe in your cage, the fruit bat still handles you like a priceless treasure, her movements slow and purposeful as her brown furry palms cup around your cage.  Through the thin body fingers you wave goodbye to your master, both sad and excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you were one hundred feet in the air as Stella flapped her black wings through the afternoon air.  Her huge eyes were directed forward, but very often glances back at you whenever you make the slightest movement.  You feel very safe with the young bat woman, and only wish that she was more confident in her ability.  You suddenly see her heading for a tall apartment building, and she descends as smoothly as she can before landing right outside the penthouse.  Drawing a key larger than your cage from her pants pocket, Stella unlocks the door and steps into the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are astounded by the new sights and sounds.  Stella starts by walking to a bowl filled with nice smelling colorful objects you have never seen before, and plucks a red one and takes a big bite out of it.  You realize that this must be fruit.  You have never eaten such a thing before; your master feeds you canned human food, and you only ate bread and water at the pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other room, there is a chubby fruit bat man with graying fur hanging from a pipe on the ceiling.  \"I'm, home, Grandpa!\" Stella calls out to the sleeping fruit bat before heading off to her room.  Placing your cage softly on a desk near her bed, she takes the sheet of paper out of her bag and starts to read it.  Her wide pupils seem to go wider as she reads what must have something to do with taking care of you.  After a few minutes, she places the paper down and pops open your cage with a black painted claw.  As gently as ever, you were lifted onto her palm, and with intense focus in her eyes, you grow to eight inches.  As you look into those huge bat eyes, lying in her velvety soft hands, you wonder what Stella is going to do with you.</span></div></div>",

You know that Stella wants to shrink you correctly this time, based on how upset she was that she overdid it in front of the students.  She seems much calmer now as you shrink an inch every few minutes; perhaps Stella was nervous because she was in front of a lot of other students.  You are gently stroked by Stella's seemingly weightless black claw as you descend.  All the while your student partner never ceases in comforting you with her words.  \"Don't be afraid, little human, I won't hurt you, not ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery lightly, you are slid into a single hand as your body diminishes.  Stella keeps her huge head close to your body, her wide pupils unmoving and unblinking.  As you approach one inch, your growth starts to slow even more.  Stella's soft speech turns to a faint whisper, her warm breath blowing gently against your face.  Her luxuriously soft brown fur starts to rise noticably around your legs as you shrink, and her large claw that once patted just your head now lightly rubbed your whole back at once.  And then, all of a sudden, the shrinking stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, tiny Dusty, you did a great job!\"  Stella seemed to be congratulating herself more as she admired your quarter-inch body lying in her palm.  Slowly, you rose upward as Stella lightly cuddled you against her cheek.  You are very proud of Stella and only think that she is still too gentle with you.  You decide to reward her by returning her cuddle as best as you can, embracing her soft cheek with your whole body.  You think that she gets the message a bit, since her palm presses down just a tiny bit harder, though your owner's hugs are still much firmer and enjoyable than Stella's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next hour or so with Stella in her room as she writes things down on lined paper and flips through thick books.  Your fruit bat pal keeps you on her furry shoulder, often pausing to give you a little pat with her finger.  You do not know what she is doing with the papers, but the way she is treating you reminds you of some stories some of the older humans told you about in the pound.  They claimed to be \"lap humans\" at some point in their lives.  Such a life sounded enjoyable but would likely be boring if it lasted your whole life.  Apparently, some anthros keep humans just to pet and pamper all the time.  Personally you enjoy a more active lifestyle.  Every other day you go with your master on a walk to the park, which is equivalent to a few miles a day.  She also taught you some games, like rolling a marble between you and your fox owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my homework is done now, Dusty, so I guess that it's time to check what I should do now.\"  As she gets out her sheet of paper from Human Care class, you have a familiar feeling in your tiny tummy.</span></div></div>",

Stella giggles very softly, and says, \"Of course, silly me, I have to feed you!  You can eat while I do, okay?\"  You still do not feel comfortable talking to Stella, but you do respond by hopping into her open palm, which is as comfy as a mattress.  Stella grows you to five inches before opening her door and heading to the table with all of the fruit on it.  Unexpectedly, at least to you, the older fruit bat is sitting there waiting, and speaks in an odd European accent to his granddaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!  Kids these days get too much homework!  Now, Stella, I picked up some durians and some grapes...,\" the elder bat suddenly stops as his eyes widen, reminding you remarkably of Stella herself.  \"Where did you get that human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella looks down at your confused face, and then back at the other bat.  \"He's my project for Human Care.  His name is Dusty, and he needs to eat like us, so I was going to feed him some grapes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder bat did not look too happy.  \"Well, I don't get what's so special about humans nowadays for them to be a topic in school.  Back in my day, humans were just pets that little kids kept around.  Most kids your age would be more interested in a boyfriend or a girlfriend.  Did I ever tell you that your grandma had a soft spot for humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did, Grandpa,\" said Stella, a bit annoyed.  You are a little sad; you would have liked to hear the story of an anthro who loved humans.  Setting you on a tablecloth opposite from her grandfather, Stella took out a long knife and started carving an huge, spiny, tan fruit that smelled very odd.  You hope that you are not going to eat any of that fruit as she passes half to her guardian and placed the other half on her plate.  Thankfully, she reaches back into the fruit basket and takes out a small green fruit that must be a \"grape\".  Stella places the grape next to you and gives you a little tickle before she starts to politely eat her \"durian\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find it very hard to pierce the skin of the grape.  You try biting it, but it is too smooth and your teeth just slide off.  You start to moan, which causes the grandfather bat to look a bit annoyed.  Stella seems much more understanding, and pokes a small hole in the grape with one of her black claws.  Surprisingly, a lot of juice comes out and sprays your whole face.  You lick your lips, and you realize how delicious the grape really is.  It has a taste that you have never witnessed before, coupled with a slight tartness.  You squeal in delight as you bring the grape to your head and rip off some of the delicious pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your Dusty has a sweet tooth, Stella!\" the old bat laughed after swallowing some of his durian.  Stella laughed with him.  So, this flavor is called \"sweet\".  You will definitely want to talk to your master about this delicious taste tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue wolfing down your grape, you see Stella has finished her durian half.  She grabs a handful of grapes and starts popping them in her mouth.  You thought it was neat that you were eating the same thing as an anthro; your master would never touch your canned human food.  Eventually, you start to feel very full, and your grape is only half eaten.  You decide that Stella can have the rest, so you carry the green fruit to her finger and poke it a bit.  \"Why, thank you Dusty, that is very kind of you!\" says your temporary owner as she slurps up the last of your grape.  Wiping her mouth with a napkin, she picks you up and starts to carry you away.  \"Okay, Grandpa, now I have to clean Dusty; its in the instructions Miss Vixen gave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon find yourself in Stella's washroom.  There is a bath/shower combo and a sink; nothing out of the ordinary.  However, you do hope that your real master told Stella that you can't swim and need to be washed appropriately.  Pets don't wear clothes, so you are ready to be washed whenever Stella is.  You notice that she is reaching for a...</span></div></div>",

You are very impressed that the bat knows how you need to get cleaned: at a large size so you do not get swept down the drain.  Dampening the sponge a bit, Stella grabs an equally large bar of soap and starts to work a fine lather.  Finally, she starts to clean your sticky, grapey body.  Her touch is still extremely gentle; the sponge barely touches you, but you are getting covered in suds.  Soon, you are completely encased in bubbles and cannot see, but you feel the bat student's long slender fingers rub your body.  Each of your limbs gets scrubbed between two brown fingers, and your chest and back gently massaged by three.  Stella is especially gentle near your most sensitive parts, touching them more lightly than you thought possible for someone so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel like you are shrinking, and the palm you are in opens up a bit more.  Through the bubbles you can make out the sponge again, and before you know it you are rinsed by a cascade of warm water as your student owner squeezes the sponge.  All of the bubbles wash away, now replaced only by damp brown hand fur.  You are set down on a hand towel and completely wrapped loosely in its folds.  You are dried fully, as are Stella's hands, which return to pick you back up.  Feeling clean and warm, you snuggle a bit against the bat's warm palm as she carries you back to your cage.  She shrinks you to one inch and places you inside, then returns to her washroom, probably to clean herself now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmness, the friendliness, the expertise, you think about how well Stella did taking care of you today, and definitely hope that she gets a very good grade based on what you tell your owner.  The only flaw was that she could have been a little firmer when handling you.  Right now, the safety of your little red cage, the little cotton ball that supports you in the cage, and the sound of rushing water coming from the washroom makes you feel sleepy.  You fall sound asleep, and do not wake up until Stella lightly taps on your cage.</span></div></div>",

Slowly getting up, you accept the breakfast and take a bite.  \"I hope you like orange, Dusty!\" said Stella as she gently gathered your cage in her hands.  As you start to leave and Stella waves goodbye to her grandpa, the sweet tang of the orange fills your mouth, making you feel more awake.  Stella's ride to school is very smooth, and the crisp morning breeze wakes you up more as you finish the orange piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Stella lands, your ride gets unexpectedly bumpy as the fruit bat runs into the school and down the halls.  You can tell that she is trying to be as steady as she can, but nobody can be perfectly gentle while running.  You wonder why as Stella bursts into the classroom, where you see your beloved owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Vixen, I'm so sorry I'm late, its just that my grandpa needed me to clean up a mess in the kitchen this morning, and I didn't want to hurt Dusty by flying too fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Stella, everything is fine, now just give me Dusty and I will see you this afternoon.\"  Stella gently placed your cage in your master's hand, and your world changed from chocolate brown to jet black.  As quick as a wink, your bat friend was gone, and now you and your owner are alone.  Opening your cage and placing you on your bean bag, your master addresses you.  \"Well, Dusty, you look very happy today.  I know that you don't like to talk, but I need to hear what you think about Stella.  You can take your time if you're not ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou surprise your owner by speaking right away.  It always surprises your owner whenever you speak to her; its as if she can't believe that someone other than an anthro has the ability to talk.  You tell your master all about how gentle and caring Stella was, how she fed you fruit, and how she remembered to wash you correctly.  You also mention that she was just a little to bit too careful when handling you and would have been better if she was more intimate with you and confident in herself.  Your master jots all of this down on a giant sheet of paper, and, of course, you can't read a word of it.  However, you know that Stella is getting a high mark by reading your master's facial expressions while you speak.  Her fox mouth was curled into a smile the whole time, and made many \"aww\" sounds while you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the morning and the start of the afternoon were pretty uneventful.  Your master spent a lot of time in what she called a \"teacher's lounge\" and often brought you with her while she worked on writing on papers and drinking coffee.  You were brought to six inches high for lunch, which consisted of your human food, which doesn't seem nearly as exciting as fruit. You do get some exercise when your master grows you to nine inches and walks you back to the classroom.  Before class starts, your fox master lovingly plays the \"bounce\" game with you, in which you shrink to six inches and are bounced lightly on your master's furry knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you are back in one of your cages as the familiar students come back.  You smile when Stella enters, looking much more relaxed than she did this morning.  You wonder what today's lesson is going to be.</span></div></div>",

Therefore, it is very important when dealing with a human that you repeatedly let the human know that your its master and has to obey you; otherwise they might take advantage over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a little frightened of what your master is saying, but you know that your master has never hurt you, and therefore definitely won't teach the students to deal with misbehaving humans through shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, class, can anyone tell me some acceptable ways to deal with a human after it misbehaves?\" asks your master, picking up a white stick in her paw.  All of the students raise their arms, and Miss Vixen calls on the iguana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spanking,\" says Iggy, without batting an eye.  However, you wince at the word; you have never heard it, but it sounds nasty.  \"Yes, Iggy, spanking is one way, but recall that the intentional harming of a human should only be administered in the most extreme of cases.\"  Your master writes some unintelligible words on the blackboard before calling on another reptilian, this one resembling a serpentine dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confinement,\" replies the Eastern dragon girl.  \"Very good, Xi Lin, that's one of the more effective ways to deal with a misbehaving human,\" says your master.  \"Recall that humans are very social creatures, so leaving them in their cage is very likely to teach them rules.\"  You notice that fewer anthros are raising their hands now, as the teacher now calls on Hogan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans learn best through demonstration and encouragement.,\" snorted the anthropomorphic peccary.  \"When a human misbehaves, the owner is responsible for making sure that the human understands that what it did was wrong, and should then show them how to make it right.  Once the human has realized its error and corrected it on its own, the owner should be supportive and reward the human, so it will be encouraged to behave right.\"  You are impressed at the hog-like male's knowledge, but the other students just seem to stare at him and roll their eyes.  You guess that they think that Hogan is trying to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your teacher finishes writing on the board, she popped your cage open and plucked out your three-inch frame.  \"Now, suppose Dusty just threw his food on the floor.  Can someone show me how to properly discipline Dusty?\"  Once again, all of the students are eager to interact with you.  You are hoping for Stella, because she would definitely be gentle with you.

For some reason, you were expecting his hand to be ice-cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Iggy starts to lower his other palm towards you, your owner speaks, \"No, Iggy, I want you to use the technique of demonstration and encouragement.\"  Iggy sighs, and starts to speak sternly.  \"Dusty, you naughty human, don't ever throw your food on the floor!\"  His huge pointer finger is wagging at you, and you are frightened that you will get impaled on that sharp claw.  \"Now, I want you to pick up that food right away!\" the iguana shouted, pointing to the floor.  You are lowered to the floor a bit jerkily, but since there is no food there, you don't know what to do now.  You look at your master, who in turn gestures for you to look back at Iggy, who towers over you now and looks a bit menacing when he bends over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iggy, you need to show Dusty what to do with the 'food',\" you hear your master whisper to the giant iguana.  Iggy gets down on one knee and pretends to pick up something in his claws.  \"This food, Dusty, I want you to pick it up off the floor yourself now and throw it in the garbage can!\"  After Iggy puts the imaginary food down, you hope that you are doing the right thing when you go over to where the 'food' is and lifting it over your head.  Suddenly, two claws close on either side of you and lift you up to the top of the garbage bin.  You wait for something to happen, when Iggy says impatiently, \"Go ahead, throw it in.\"  He then seems to have a brainstorm, then makes a throwing motion with his other hand.  You try to imitate him, making that motion towards the bin.  You know that you have done something right when you here polite applause coming from the other students and your master.  Iggy gives your tiny head a little pat before dumping you back into your master's waiting paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that class was over, you start to wonder what will happen today.  Yesterday, that nice bat girl kept you, and you hope that the projects happen three days in a row per student so you can be with her again.  However, Stella was also the anthro that demonstrated shrinking yesterday.  Since Iggy demonstrated today, there was a chance that he would be your keeper for the rest of the day.  You don't want that to happen, since Iggy acts roughly and scares you, even though you don't really think he will actually hurt you.

Then you're going to spend a whole afternoon and night with that rough teen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make your fears worse, the last two students who're leaving the classroom are chatting together on the door in a low voice, but not low enough to not be heard: \"Poor Dusty, he's going to be alone with Iggy...\" \"Yeah, poor little creature, who knows what could happen to him in the hands of that jock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIggy, hearing those words while he's writing on some papers, snorts toward his two classmates, who hurry out of the room.<br>\r\nThey looked nervous at the idea of having Iggy angry at them, that doesn't speak well, in your opinion, about the iguana's behaviour. How have the two students called him? A word like... \"jock\"? What's a jock, you wonder. That's one of the many words you still don't know... It suddenly dawns on you that Iggy seems to be the tallest and biggest student in his class, could that be the meaning of that strange word? You suppose his size and strength are actually involved, but there must be more... judging by how Iggy and his classmates acted, a jock should be nothing good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver in fear at the idea, and your owner feels your uneasiness, because she gingerly lifts you before her muzzle, talking to you in a comforting voice. \"Don't worry, Dusty, I know Iggy can look mean and scary, but he's actually a kind boy, he's just too used to handle things in a rough way. Considering that you're just a little helpless creature which needs help and protection, he certainly is going to treat you very gentle... am I right, Iggy?\"<br>\r\nShe turns toward the iguana with a frown, and Iggy nods, a little absent-minded, that doesn't calm you down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unlike you, your master seems convinced that you aren't in danger, and after a few minutes you find yourself shrunken again to one inch, locked in the red cage and carried by Iggy's titanic hand, whose sight is enough to frighten you.</span></div></div>",

If it wasn't for the cottony padding, you'd be covered in bruises.  His scaly hand is also completely concealing your cage, which means that you can't tell where you are going either.  You are not sure, but since the young iguana man doesn't seem to be going into a car or anything, he might live at the school.  Your master said that most students live in places around the school called 'dorm rooms', and if that means that you will spend less time traveling in this way, you hope that Iggy reaches his dorm room soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip indeed is pretty short, and you assume that you are right.  However, you have no time to recover from the journey, as Iggy immediately pops open your cage and dumps you onto his huge green palm as soon as you get there.  You start to feel yourself grow, and eventually your body starts to feel tense and achy as your temporary owner overzealously keeps your body trying to grow a bit past one foot.  Now your body is squeezed in a great reptilian fist, and Iggy is staring at you with an unusually happy look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, now I can have a good look at you, Dusty,\"  says the iguana in a taunting kind of voice.  Two large claws pinch your arm, and as he compares how flimsy they are compared to his, you feel very uncomfortable.  You squirm around, trying to loosen your captor's grasp, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Dusty, don't move a muscle,\" commands Iggy in his frightening stern voice.  As you feel your arm start to bend the wrong way, you desparately pound on one of his knuckles with your free hand.  The iguana does not loosen his grip on your body, but he does release your arm.  However, he sounds furious now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dusty, no hitting your owner!\" he shouts.  \"If you aren't going to do what I say, I'm going to have to teach you a lesson!\"  You immediately start to shrink very quickly; in only two seconds you reach three inches.  Iggy lays your body face down on a wooden surface, pressing your whole upper body down with two huge fingertips and pinning your legs with a third.  Then, you experience a horrible pain as something hard comes into contact with your rump.  The pain comes back a second time, and your howls of pain are muffled by the wood surface you're being pressed against.  The third strike is the most painful, probably because your bottom was sore from the first two strikes.  Now that you finally realize what 'spanking' is, you wish that you never have to go through it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fingers lift off of you, but you stay face down, fearful of looking at Iggy.  \"Get up, Dusty,\" speaks the frightening voice.  Despite your soreness, you get up anyway, not wanting to anger Iggy any more and get more spankings.  You look up at Iggy, who speaks softer now but still sternly.  \"Now, we'll try this again.  I just want to look at what I'm dealing with here, and if you don't resist what I do, then you won't get hurt, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not dare speak to Iggy, but you do walk closer to him in hopes that he will get the message.  Sure enough, you grow to one foot once again, this time not experiencing nearly as much pain caused by overgrowing, and Iggy closes his scaly fist around you once more.  You hope that Iggy will at least keep his word and not hurt you if you try to cooperate.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, he has no intention of snapping it off, and after a few seconds he moves on to one of your legs.  You feel a little bit like your going to your vet, except Dr. Purr is much gentler when handling you.  You wonder if Iggy has any interest of being a human veterinarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess your just a total wimp, then, Dusty,\" spat Iggy as he shrunk you to half an inch.  You are worried that that means you have a dangerous disease, but by the way Iggy is acting, being a 'wimp' is hopefully not a serious condition.  Tossing you into your cage and shutting it tight, Iggy gets up and leaves you alone in his dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel very neglected after a few hours without company, even the company of a kind-of mean iguana.  Iggy did not do a very good job of caring for you so far, at least you think.  You are barely big enough to not be able to slip through your cage bars, so you can do nothing until Iggy comes back.

Iggy is not being a very good master at all, and you are going to have to tell your master all about this tomorrow.  Hopefully, she will expel Iggy from the class if he is this irresponsible.

You whine audibly, hoping that he will give you something to eat before he falls asleep, but Iggy just grumbles and buries his scaly head into his pillow.  You search the cottony folds of your cage, and manage to find a few minute bread crumbs and devour them greedily.

Immediately, she sensed something was wrong.  \"Oh dear, Dusty, you look so pale and thin!

She unexpectedly gave your three inch body a little kiss before bringing you to the other students, an unusual uncomfortable experience given her oversized buck teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Dusty, see you survived the day with Iggy,\" whinnied a zebra boy, his mane dyed many shocking colors.  \"I know, Zack, he's one lucky human!\" Gladys agreed, cuddling you in her arms.  \"Must have been torture, little dude,\" replied Zack.  He stroked your body with a thick hooflike finger, and you enjoyed the sympathy of the anthros surrounding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladys, let me inspect Dusty to see if there's any damage,\" offered Hogan.  The large rodent's nimble paws appeared to shrink as you sprouted a few inches, and she placed you in the peccary's large trotters.

He's better off than I was when I crossed Iggy three weeks ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a soft golden padded paw grabbed you and cradled you as Leona tried to console you.  \"Aww, I feel so sorry for you, little Dusty.

Don't you feel sorry for what Dusty has gone through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pit bull stuttered in a deep voice, \"Um, yes, yes, sure, of course.\"  He looked pretty nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a bit upset, Wilbur.  Maybe you'd like a turn holding Dusty?\" Leona asked.  She approached the dog with you thrust out, and the pit bull backed away, staring at you.  \"No thanks, I'm fine, really,\" he said before letting out a little canine whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you say so,\" the lioness answered, handing you over to Stella instead.  Stella smiled and beckoned everyone over.  As they watched, Stella focused and started shrinking you.  You ended up at exactly one quarter inch without experiencing any ; Stella wanted to show her prowess with size changing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Stella, you've improved a whole lot!\" said Hogan and Gladys, almost at the same time.  Stella petted you with a huge brown finger, and you hugged it back to congratulate her.  Almost everyone awwwed in unison; that is, everyone except Wilbur, who had a look of slight disgust on his fanged face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master suddenly came to the group and picked you up.  \"Your time with Dusty is over, though I must say you all did a great job with him!\"  She grew you to one inch and poked you into your traveling case, before handing the case to the anthro that was keeping you today.</span></div></div>",

You hope that she doesn't accidentally injure you if she's going to be overzealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she knows to carry your case still as she walks out of the classroom.  This time, you know where you are heading, as you can see the huge rodent climb a set of stairs and walk through hallways until she gets to her dormroom.

You don't know why she is there, but Gladys seems to know, and approaches the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhonda, look who I brought!\" she cries out in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call you later,\" the weasel woman said as she shut her phone.  \"What is it now, Gladys?  Can't a roomie have a little privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Rhonda, it's just that I wanted to show you Dusty, the human I said I'd be taking care of today.\"  The capybara flipped your cage open and took you out to show Rhonda, after which the weasel anthro said:</span></div></div>",

Gladys ignored Rhonda and took you into the kitchen; it was time for you to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if humans eat meat, just try some.\" She held out a little bit of 'steak', this had an interesting taste, and was much better than the 'human food' your master gave you. You nodded and patted your stomach, this said you liked it. You were a bit too scared to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So humans are omnivores! Wow! Okay, time for a wash.\" Gladys grew you to about 9 1/2 inches, she was a bit scared of overgrowing you. She gentle caressed you with the sponge, this was almost the same as the way your master does it, except she did your hair in a different way, she got this fine-toothed piece of plastic and ran it through your hair. You liked this sensation, you will tell your master about this, Gladys called it combing. You couldn't make a signal which means 'I need to go', so you decided to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, Glad-is, I need to go to the toy-let.\" You asked her, she stood in shock, you spoke to her! She applauded you, then took you to a little box, similar to your owners and she looked away at what you were doing. When you had finished you signalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Dusty, I guess you speaking to me was a one-time-thing, huh?\" She seemed depressed, but she might make you talk in front of Rhonda, this time she might squish you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get that hew-man outta the kitchen, I need to eat, and if he isn't outta there when I'm in there, it's human sandwich!\" She seemed angry, Gladys shrunk you to an inch, and put you in the cage, she quickly, but gently, bought you into her room, this consisted of a bed, a desk, a computer, a lamp and a window, there were a few books on the desk, though you had no idea what they were about. She got out a marble and you knew the games your master had taught you, but this one would be completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Dusty you see this marble, well, you have got to roll it into this goal *she shows you her fingers making a |-| formation*, but my finger *she shows you a | inbetween her fingers* will be protecting the goal, so you got to have accuracy.\" You seemed to understand the rules up to the point of 'accuracy', you got handed the marble and the game began, you would get it in about 30% of the time, her finger was very quick, but this game was fun and exercising. Rhonda walked in, she seemed very angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAS THE HUMAN HAD SOME OF MY STEAK!?!\" Rhonda bellowed, this shocked you, and you remember eating some of this 'steak'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bought it, it isn't yours, I think Dusty should have a portion, even if it is only 5 millimeters tall.\" Gladys seemed to know what she was saying, but Rhonda took a swipe at you, just missing. She, then, attacks Gladys, it hits and she begins to bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron-duh, do not at-ack Glad-is, she did-unt do noff-in, it was my I-dee-uh.\" Your sentence was slow, but correct. Rhonda seems furious, a creature, one inch tall who can not pronounce simple sentences, was telling her what to do! Rhonda grabbed you, you squirmed as she flicked you, that amount of pain was excruciating, she then started kicking Gladys, you bit Rhonda on the finger, she squealed as she dropped you, and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you were caught by Gladys. She seemed content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dusty, you shouldn't of bit Rhonda, but you did try to protect me, therefore I shall not punish you.\" This made you glad. Gladys grew you to 8 inches, examined you, poured some 'healing' products on any cut, then placed you, carefully back into the cage. You fell asleep a short time after Gladys.

Fortunately, it is the gentle face of Gladys that greats you in the early morning light.  \u201cGood morning Dusty, I hope that you are doing well,\u201d said the capybara girl.  Her voice sounded so sweet right about now, but you could not tell if she seemed so sweet because of how Iggy had acted the other day and how Rhonda had treated you yesterday. The important thing was that she was not trying to kill you and she actually had a small plate of food in her hands.<br>\r\nThat plate looked like it had foods for something your size even though most of it was unfamiliar to you.  It looked like Gladys was not the type to feed you human food just like Stella.  \u201cSince you had such a rough day yesterday I figured you deserve a little treat, but no more biting,\u201d Gladys scolded.  You shake your head in acknowledgment of her scolding and she places the little plate of food in your cage.  It is still a little large for you, but that was only a good thing in your mind.  There was no meat available and you guessed that was to avoid another incident with that ferret girl.<br>\r\nThere was a wide assortment of fruits available to you.  All of them looked good.  Gladys may have been able to eat everything on the plate in one gulp, but it was a feast of tasty looking fruits to you.  Each fruit was one nice juicy surprise after another and you dug into the plate with a good deal of enthusiasm.  Gladys just smiled at you as you ate and made little noises that you had come to associate with the anthros when they think that you are doing something cute.<br>\r\nGladys waited patiently for you to finish your breakfast before making sure that you received a morning cleaning.  After that she just spent the morning cuddling with you and heaping a lot of attention on you.  She really was a sweet girl and you wondered what would happen if you told your master about what Rhonda did to you.  You would not want this sweet capybara to get in trouble because of someone else, especially because of someone like Rhonda.  Gladys seemed to be doing a good job of making sure that you and Rhonda were never in the same room, but she still shouted out the occasional complaint about you.<br>\r\n\u201cYou better not have been feeding that little runt any of my food again Gladys,\u201d Rhonda yelled from the kitchen.<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Dusty and I only gave him some of my fruit so just calm down,\u201d Gladys replied.<br>\r\n\u201cI could care less what its name is as long as it doesn\u2019t eat my food,\u201d Rhonda yelled back.  Things pretty much went on like that for the entire morning.  Gladys was nice enough though.  She even made sure you were close by as she prepared for school just in case Rhonda should take offense to your presence again.  It made you happy when you heard the ferret depart and you had to wonder how such a bitter creature could live in the same place as a nice one like Gladys.  When Gladys was finished getting ready she shrank you down to an inch in size and placed you back in your cage.<br>\r\nShe made it to class with time to spare despite all that time she spent with you in the morning.  When you were returned to Miss Vixen you could tell that Gladys was a little worried.  She must have been thinking about what you would say happened with Rhonda.  You were still wondering what you would have to say about Rhonda.  That was one dangerous ferret and you were going to have to stay with her again so it might be a good idea to say something about her to your master.  Then again, you really did not want Gladys to get into any trouble either.</span></div></div>",

It was too loud for you and you held your ears. Damn, teenagers are loud. After a minute or so, the noise died down and the whole classes attention was focused on the can of food on the table you're on. It was the human food can and it was open. You could smell the slop inside, the tasteless slop you're fed. It had a sweet smell, like it was filled with something sweet. You were taken out of your cage and placed next to the can, your master writing things on the board. You felt very nervous and bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class, Human feeding is an essential way to raise a Human. Humans can eat food like us, but only for special treats. Meats are not allowed in a Human's diet, they mess up their digestive systems and ruin their behaviour patterns. fruits are allowed in a Human's diet, but too many will make the Human hyperactive and edgy. Vegetables are allowed in a Human's diet, but only on special occasions, such as Christmas or Easter.\" You had never heard of 'Christmas' or 'Easter', at the pound, you were only fed bread and water and taught by the older Humans how to speak. The pound owners would never speak to you, not to any Human, only to the people who bought you. They didn't even say goodbye. You have never heard of 'Vegetables' either, maybe they were the ingredient to the human food. Your master kept on talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you should know <i>never</i> to feed a human fat foods or carbohydrates, except bread, they make the Human sick and fat. The only food you should be feeding a Human thrice a day is human food, it is safer for the Humans' systems. You see how behaved Dusty is, he has been fed on human food the past month I have had him.\" Your master had finished and was getting out some work sheets for the class. \"These are just little tests to know your knowledge on a Human's dietary system. Oh, and remember this time next week, we will have a professional human handler in to teach you some tricks to teach humans.\" You wanted to learn tricks, but you didn't want to get them wrong and disappoint your master. The remaining fifty minutes of the lesson was silent and you felt uncomfortable sitting there, next to the food with incoherent scribbles on it the shapes were: h-u-m-a-n-f-o-o-d. You looked at the board, there it was written again. Then you remember your master saying 'human food' when she had written it down. Maybe that's what the scribbles meant. You tried reading around the class, a lot of the posters and artwork had h-u-m-a-n written on them then some more scribbles. You couldn't get your head around it before the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out at the class, leaving, gathering their stuff and scurrying out. Each of them muttering about the test.

You wonder how you are going to maintain control of your students.  The small ones should still be tall enough to make your own home seem smaller than a doll house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you get a good view of an anthro playing in her yard as you drive along.  It is an intimidating thing to see a massive raven child playing with a ball while her even larger father sits on a porch watching her play.  You have a couple of second thoughts about teaching at your new school, but you quickly stuff them away.  This needs to be done and you have to start with the young.  The world simply can\u2019t keep going on the way it is, with the anthros and the humans living separately.  Everyone was going to have to learn to live together eventually or only bad things could happen in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are happy you do not have to drive too far into the anthro community though.  It seems like it would be an accident waiting to happen if you had to drive through this giant neighborhood.  And it would take an incredibly long time to drive to the school.  The school was only two miles from where you currently were to the anthros, but to you it was about 600 miles away.  Even if there was never any traffic on the road, the thought of which really scared you, it would take a few hours to get to school every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you had to do was drive to the principal\u2019s house which was right next to the raven child\u2019s house.  The drive up the driveway took longer than you had expected it to, but that was the only complication.  Next, you followed the instructions you had been given and drove along the sidewalk to the steps leading up to the house of your new school\u2019s principal.  You were not expected to climb up the steps to the house since it would take you the better part of a day to climb those steps even if you knew how to climb those steps.  On those steps was a little button meant for you to press.  You had been told that the button had been wired to the principal\u2019s doorbell and that he would be here to answer it when you arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little nervous as you pressed the button.  This would be your first time meeting an anthro up close.  Even the size of the raven child had been enough to intimidate you from a distance.  Now you were going to meet a full grown anthro and be handled by that same anthro.  You had also heard he was tall even for an anthro.  The sound of the doorbell ringing sounded like one of those huge church bells and it was easy to tell when the principal approached the door.  There were small tremors in the ground even before you heard the gigantic mechanisms that made up the lock on the door moving.  Then the door whose top you could not see swung open and you were greeted by the smiling face of an incredibly large ocelot.  \u201cGreetings human, I\u2019m pleased to meet you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Humans were used to being the biggest beings on the block, after all, and it was a severe shock to find out they weren't even close to it once you got off good old terra firma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Gordon was in a waiting room that looked like any other. It had white walls with pastel green flowers patterned on the paper, matching chairs that you didn't want to sit in for very long, a modest coffee table with old copies of news and education magazines. There was no one else in the room, not even the secretary. She had gone to make sure that Chlik was ready to receive company. Neither of them had any expectations that someone would show up in her absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He sat there, on one of three chairs in front of the coffee table, purposefully ignoring the magazines. All of them featured the aliens prominently on the cover, either in photographs or in artist's renderings. And all of them, consciously or not, emphasized the vast difference in size. One featured a being that looked like a perfect blend of man and fox leaning against a building and smiling roguishly at the photographer. Another showed a human being craning his head back to look up past the frame of the picture. He was next to an enormous, furred foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The articles inside would talk about the aliens and their impact on human culture since the arrival. Cities were being refitted to allow them to visit, movies and television shows were scrambling to add them to casts, the world's governments were scrambling to put up a united diplomatic front to a cosmic civilization that just became a reality for them a year ago. This didn't even mention the vast scientific, philosophical and theological debates that were storming through their respective communities. These were perhaps the most uncertain times in human history. One thing, however, was for sure \u2013 nothing would ever be the same, and humanity needed people to step up and be the trailblazers that were so desperately needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Gordon considered himself just such a man. When the call went out for humans to travel the galaxy and become a part of the very first knowledge exchange program between Earth and other planets, he was one of the first to sign up. The screening process was intense, and it took the better part of a year to make it through. All the pain and effort had lead up to this moment, however; he was about to meet his very first alien, something that only a few thousand people had ever done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The door to the meeting area swung open, and the secretary entered. She looked around briefly before she found him. \u201cGordon,\u201d she said, and gave him a rather shy grin. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He looked her over once, and deduced that she hadn't had much contacts with aliens either. You can always tell, he'd learned, by the flushed faces and slight breathlessness people always had from the encounter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cAs ready as I'll ever be, I guess.\u201d He smiled back, sure he must have looked nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The secretary nodded. \u201cThen Chlik will see you now. You remember the protocol?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cOf course.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cExcellent. All you need to do is step into the decontamination room, wait five seconds for the light above the door to turn green, and then step forward. You'll step out onto his table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Gordon nodded. \u201cGreat. Thanks so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The secretary ducked her head and stepped aside. \u201cNo problem, Mr. Shumway. Enjoy the meeting, and buzz me any time if you need anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He stepped into the decontamination room, his heart pounding. The door shut behind him, and the entire room buzzed. Five seconds later, millions of nanites had removed all harmful pathogens from his body. Just one of the many breakthroughs in technology humanity has enjoyed since the aliens came. The light turned green. He took a couple of deep breaths, and tried to steady his hand as he reached for the doorknob. He gave it a short twist, and it swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A vast concrete surface spread out before him, extending from the door for about fifty feet. It looked off to him for some reason, and he couldn't quite figure why until he noticed the oversized silverware scattered about. There was a plate the size of a carousel off to his left, and a matching teacup to his right. There were forks and knives the size of small hills scattered close to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cHello,\u201d thundered a voice inside his head. Even though he had been trained to expect this, he jumped. He hadn't even noticed the alien yet, but it already knew he was here. Something outside of his field of vision moved, and the table darkened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Gordon looked up to see the biggest...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can always understand a concept, theoretically. The sun is extraordinarily hot for example. Nazis are evil. And aliens are usually very large. We learn these things as more or less universal truths. When we come face to face with the reality of these facts, however, it always ends up surprising us how true these truths really are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Chlik was very, very large. The enormous teacup to Gordon's right was about the right size for an immense hot tub, and the rabbit-like alien could only fit one furry finger through the handle the human was sure he could fit his entire body through. The waiting room and meeting area was on the sixth floor of a skyscraper that had been retro-fitted for alien contact, but he found himself face to face with the bottom of a truly gigantic chest while Chlik was sitting down. If the giant got up, he was sure that he'd be staring at thighs wider than some buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     For that brief moment, Gordon had forgotten all of his training. He had been told about this, that he should expect awe to wash over him, that his mind would go blank just like this, that his jaw would go slack without him even realizing it. His heart would start to hammer in his chest. He would feel the wild, instinctive need to run, his brain hijacked by the lizard-like portion only concerned with food, sex and survival. These facts had been hammered into him again and again during his training and screening, reinforced with the pop culture articles he had read, cemented by the more scientific studies. And yet, here he was, experiencing it despite the defenses and workarounds he had developed. He could only look up and stare while his mind cast about for something, anything that would help him cope with the situation he found himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The alien, for his part, seemed perfectly content to wait for the human to gather himself together. He looked down at Gordon with clear amusement, whiskers as thick as bridge cables bobbing around a disarmingly cute (there was no other word for it) pink nose. His eyes were large and brown, spaced a bit far apart, his ears sail-like appendages that could probably hide small houses underneath them. The parts of him that weren't covered by clothing were covered in a layer of thick, tan fur. When Gordon could manage to look up that far, Chlik smiled, revealing those ubiquitous wide, flat buck teeth. He was a cartoon character made real and blown up to ridiculous proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Chlik's choice in wardrobe only added to the surreality. Most of him was covered in a suit that looked like it had been inspired by a Dickens novel \u2013 a starched, tailored white shirt underneath a grey herringbone vest, which itself was underneath a black jacket. The material, which seemed to go on for acres, actually stretched and strained around the alien's barreled chest and wide shoulders. The intensely civilized shell covered something powerful, mind-bogglingly physical. Once Gordon's brain had flushed itself of most alarms and reason began creeping back in shamefully, he found himself struck by the strange juxtaposition. Besides his overwhelming size and power, the alien gave no indication of being a danger. He merely fixed him with that amused, benevolent grin, waiting patiently for his greeting to be returned. He hadn't even moved since Gordon had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Even still, it took a few more moments for the human to be able to hear himself over the beating of his own heart. He nodded, slowly, and swallowed hard just to make sure his voice wouldn't waver. \u201cHello,\u201d he said, hoarsely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Chlik nodded, slowly. \u201cHow are you?\u201d His voice was quiet but bassy, his tone light, conversational, genial. He was obviously trained for this moment as well. He was doing quite a bit better with remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cI'm fine.\u201d Gordon had said it before remembering he was supposed to think it. He repeated himself mentally. \u201cI'm just fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The giant rabbit chuckled and nodded again. \u201cVery good. I am fine as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      It was odd to Gordon, hearing the voice inside his head while Chlik's muzzle did entirely different things. Right now his nose was twitching rapidly, pointed down, no doubt taking in the human's scent to help him read the shift in mood. Those tremendous brown eyes were pointed in his direction, daunting in their size, reassuring in their tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cI have to admit, you're a lot bigger than I thought you would be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Chlik laughed, a high chirp that nonetheless rattled the windows and table he was standing on. \u201cI get that a lot. We've been working on holographic models that might better prepare you for the difference in scale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cThat would be lovely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cYes, I'm sure it would be. Though it's always amusing watching the looks on your faces for those first few seconds. It sets the tone for the rest of the <br>\r\nconversation, and lays the groundwork for our working relationship. We like having a slight upper hand in these things.\u201d Chlik finally removed his eyes from Gordon, flicking to the teacup and back to the human. It was a subtle request for permission to move. The human, surprised, nodded, and the rabbit deftly lifted his enormous teacup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Gordon didn't quite know what to make of that. He admired the honesty, but he wasn't sure he liked the tone it pointed to. Was this how they were seen? As amusing little things that were easy to manipulate? Maybe this was the alien's way of sounding him out, getting a better idea of his personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cI suppose that's true. You are on our turf, after all, and I understand how daunting it can be to get used to a completely new civilization and set of rules. It can't be easy having to be so careful all of the time.\u201d When in doubt, go with the answer that's most compassionate. He couldn't resist getting in a subtle dig though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Chlik smiled and nodded, taking a long draw from his tea before setting the cup back down. \u201cExactly so. The clothes are a little tough to get used to as well.\u201d He stuck a thick, furry finger down his collar for emphasis. Now Gordon laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cYou don't wear clothing?\u201d He was intrigued; this was something they didn't really talk about in training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The giant shrugged. \u201cNot quite so many. We care about modesty, as you do, but anything more than the most basic cover is unnecessary at best, impractical at worst.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Gordon thought about that for a moment. The aliens gave off an awful lot of heat \u2013 the human felt his temperature rising just being near the enormous rabbit \u2013 and he could only imagine the thick coat of fur kept him well insulated. Considering that their home planet was quite a bit cooler than Earth, he could only imagine that the giant was baking inside that suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u201cIf you're uncomfortable with what you have on, there's no need to be modest on my account. Take off what you need to, I won't mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Chlik grinned broadly, his buck teeth looming over Gordon. It would have been cute if he hadn't been so close and so large. \u201cThat's very kind of you. I...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I would love to take off my jacket and collar, at least.\" Chlik made a move to unbutton his coat, then looked down to Gordon. \"You truly don't mind, do you? I appreciate it if you're only being polite, but I would prefer you to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon blinked. Why would he prefer for someone to bake in a suit they obviously weren't built for? \"No, it's really OK. If I have a problem or anything, I'll let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant rabbit breathed a sigh of relief that blasted Gordon's hair back, even where he was. It smelled of tea, mostly, but also sweet-grass. He was surprised that it was as pleasant as it was -- he was expecting aliens in general to be a lot smellier than they were. Like real animals, perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChlik quickly shuffled off his coat and flopped it over the building-sized chair he was sitting in, then made short work of his starched collar. That he laid on the table a fair distance away from Gordon, but his paw blotted out the light for a brief moment just the same. The giant sat down again with a long, relaxed sigh that melted into a table-quaking rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you how good it feels to be out of that stuffy jacket. I thought I would bake alive in there.\" He grinned down at Gordon, slowly putting his other hand on the table. The alien was well within striking distance, something that the human had never considered before. With nothing more than a quick movement, Gordon's life could be over. \"Thank you again for allowing me to be so informal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\" Gordon grinned back at him, trying to make his heart stop beating quite so fast. \"If we're going to be working together, we're bound to be informal sooner or later, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Chlik rumbled, reaching to grab his teacup. The giant rabbit had been using exaggeratedly slow movements up until now, but his fatigue with being careful was already starting to show. A forearm covered in thick white fur whipped by Gordon's spot on the table, buffeting him with a stiff breeze. It was as big as an 18-wheeler if anything. He couldn't imagine how much it must weigh. \"I suppose we'd better get down to business, then. Obviously you know you're being strongly considered for the position. Otherwise you wouldn't even be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon blinked. \"Actually, no. I knew I had a good shot at it. This is my third round of interviews. But I thought there was still a pretty big pool to wade through before the company had made their decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChlik winked at him over the rim of his teacup. \"You're the first of only three humans I'll be meeting today. They wanted me to see you ahead of the others so that if I like you we can cancel the other appointments and not waste anyone else's time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon's heart leapt up into his throat. \"I...see. That's pretty thoughtful of you. And the company.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit chuckled and shrugged. Gordon could see the fabric shifting around impossibly-sized muscle and fur that must be thick enough to wade in. \"We're nothing if not efficient, Mr. Shumway. Given the considerable effort involved in establishing contact between our two races, we've had to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. I can only imagine.\" Gordon smiled and looked at the platform he was on. Chlik was essentially sitting on a retro-fitted building inside a vacant lot designed for just this purpose. There were so many new laws, so many protocols, so many advances in technology that had sprung up just so that he and this visitor from another planet could meet this way. And it was only the tip of the iceberg. If he was allowed into the teaching program, he would have access to so much more. It really would be beyond his wildest dreams. \"What I can't imagine is how you guys make the program work with the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChlik's ears perked. \"That's another matter entirely. If you think I'm big, you'll be shocked by the Elentine. We...are even smaller to them than you are to us, and that's saying something. Our scientists believe that they're essentially an ancestor race, unevolved versions of ourselves. Much like your monkeys are to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've ever heard it described that way. Do you mean to say they're unintelligent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChlik chirped. \"Good heavens, no. I don't mean that at all. They're quite...sentient, I believe is the word that you use. But their technology is quite a bit behind ours. It's quite a bit behind even yours. We know quite a bit more about mechanics and physics, but you know so much more about botany, biology -- what you refer to as the life sciences. And that's why we need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon nodded. He had heard this before. \"Right; I'd be the one who taught the Elentine about basic biology, botany, chemistry. All of the sciences that dealt with the small stuff, you would say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant rabbit chuckled. \"Just so. And we would take care of the stuff that they could...well, perhaps practice on their level. They're more inclined to believe you over us because you're so much smaller.\" His ears dipped a little, and he smiled again. Gordon could just see his oversized front teeth between his lips. \"If you'll pardon me for saying so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little weird, though, don't you think? Just because we're smaller than all of you doesn't mean we would necessarily know a lot more about atomic particles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChlik nodded. \"This is true -- correlation does not imply causation. But you have to admit, it's a lot easier for you to notice something imperceptibly small than it is for us. And certainly for the Elentine. They have neither the technology or the deductive capabilities to understand the concepts of microbiology. It will be my job to give them one. It's your job to give them the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon couldn't help but grin. \"My job. Does that mean I've officially been hired on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChlik perked his ears and grinned right back at him. \"Yes. Yes, I suppose it does. If you'll see the secretary inside, I believe she'll have the necessary paperwork waiting for you. We'll meet at the launching site in two weeks' time after that, and then we're off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human whistled. \"That's a pretty tight timetable to get my affairs in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChlik's ears dipped. \"We assumed that most applicants who've made it this far would have started their preparations already. It'll be quite a long trip, so we'd like to get started as soon as possible. The window for the most favorable launch conditions is narrowing quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Still, Gordon's mind whirled. This morning he thought it'd be another month of interviews at least before the company had made a decision. Now, he's gotten the job and will have to leave his planet for the first time ever in two weeks. Who knew when he would be back? The contract was for a full year, but he could easily see himself staying on much longer than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations to you, Mr. Shumway.\" Chlik moved his paw slowly and extended a single finger about the size of a felled tree. \"I look forward to working with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon took the digit in both hands and shook as vigorously as he could. \"Thank you very much, Chlik. The pleasure will be all mine, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant rabbit nodded, then turned his attention back to his building-sized tea cup. Gordon turned around and headed back to the office. He could scarcely believe what was happening. He would be one of the first humans ever to live on an alien planet.</span></div></div>",

The average-sized planet is called Earth and is inhabited by humans, (well DUH!). The larger planet, (how much larger depends on the size of the inhabitents), is called Phayenos, (fA-yen-Os), and is inhabited by large creatures known as anthros. <br>\r\nBoth the Earthlings and the Phayenosians have known about one anothers existence for a long time, but were too nervous actually interact with each other. That all changes when Earth receives a message from Phayenos requesting a human child be brought to Phayenos to attend a year of school. They hope that this will bring an end to the uneasy, false peace between the two planets and accomplish true peace through harmony. The Earthlings agreed and chose a child to send to Phayenos.

Everyone laughs at the joke. Turns out that was too small. A couple of creatures come out a door almost the size of Saturn and begin running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne seems like a human-shaped alligator, and by the clothes is dressed like a young boy. The other a rather normal-looking monkey girl, except for having two tails and being all purple. They both become fascinated by the little balls they see.

The surface does resemble that of your home planet, although everything is extremely large, of course.  You notice that as your descent start to slow, your rocket is headed for a landing site right on the roof of a tall building, where an enormous coyote anthro is waiting.
