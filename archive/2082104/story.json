She lived on the fifth floor of Dickinson Hall, room 504.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three came over, the door was left open for them and one of them called out to the girl, \u201cHey, Rebecca!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette was sitting on the other side of the room by her desk on her laptop with her back turned to them. As she swiveled around, she replied with a bright smile, \u201cOh! Hey guys. Come on in.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Saturday - 11:58 AM</b><br>\r\nRebecca woke up, feeling awfully lethargic. She found herself lying on her bed, wearing what she wore yesterday. She slid out of bed, standing in her room on her bare feet and rubbing her temples with her palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happened last night?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t remember. Glancing around the room, she didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary; it wasn\u2019t like she had been robbed. Her laptop was still left open on her desk, being charged by an outlet. Everything felt hazy last night. She remembered inviting three guys over, and upon checking the messages on her phone, she could confirm that wasn\u2019t just a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to take a hot shower and move on throughout day as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Saturday - 8:10 PM</b><br>\r\nHaving eaten dinner, Rebecca was in her room alone, browsing the web on her laptop until her phone buzzed. Cocking her head to view the screen, she noticed that it was a notifying her about a new email in her inbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her laptop, she logged in to her personal email account. The title of the email just read as \u2018You should watch this\u2019. The body of the email simply read: \u2018I think you should see the attachment, Rebecca.\u2019 There was a zip file attached to the email. She downloaded it, unzipped it, and found an mp4 file. She opened the video file that\u2019s named \u2018Rebecca\u2019s_Punishment.mp4\u2019, and the first thing she noticed was that it was over an hour long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut immediately, her eyes widened in horror. Her heart sank. The first few frames already depicted the scene to be in her own room with a naked girl lying flat on her back against cold, hard floor with her wrists and ankles splayed out and tied to the legs of the beds on either side of the room. A strip of duct tape was placed over the girl\u2019s mouth, and she seemed to be weakly struggling against her constraints. The shaking of the camera suggested there was a third person filming it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she skimmed through the video, almost the entirety of the film was of the naked girl screaming through her gag and squirming as two guys were groping and tickling her. One would tickle the victim\u2019s armpits, breasts, and midriff. The other would tickle the victim\u2019s bare soles. The nude girl in the video had her face beat red, and tears were rolling down her face past the halfway mark in the video.<br>\r\nRebecca winced at the thought that the girl in this video was her. This video was the void in her memories, the missing fragment from last night. This was what happened last night that she had forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone buzzed, causing the youth to flinch. There was a text message sent by an anonymous sender. As she picked up her cellphone, she viewed the content, only to find a picture of her nude in her room. Judging by the context, this picture seemed to have taken place today when she was looking for clothes to wear after a shower today. How did this picture come to be? The angle of this picture seemed to suggest that it came from her laptop\u2019s camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the attached image was a message that read, \u2018If you don\u2019t want the videos and images of you posted online, \u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It'd be a fifteen minute walk from Dickinson Hall to Gamma Beta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Saturday - 8:12 PM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will she do?</span></div></div>",

Even though it was nighttime, the risk of being seen was too high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca left her room, locked the door, and took the stairs down to the first floor where she left through the front entrance. As soon as she made it outside, she began running on her sandaled feet towards her destination, constantly checking the time on her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Saturday \u2013 8:29 PM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing and puffing, the brunette had made it to the large two-story house with lights lit through the curtained windows. She knocked on the front door, and soon, footsteps could be heard approaching from the other side. When the door was opened, a young man stood before her before asking, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Rebecca explained with hesitation, wondering if she got the wrong place, \u201cI was told to come here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Are you Rebecca?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but we told you to come here topless,\u201d he checked the time on his own phone, \u201cIt\u2019s already 8:30 PM. We will have to post one of your pictures online. Why don\u2019t you come inside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The brunette felt her heart race. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man smirked, clearly enjoying her panicked expression. \u201cTell you what, you can either go back to your room to start over and fix your mistake, or you can come inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStart over? She had already come this far. A walk back and forth would sum up to a total of nearly an hour. But if she simply walked in right now, a photo would be released. And if she didn\u2019t do anything at all, presumably, everything will be released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">With one glance at the damsel, what came to mind was innocence. A light-skinned, slender body with voluptuous breasts that could easily spill right out of her pink crop-top. Her monochromic top had thin shoulder straps \u2013 perhaps a centimeter wide, and her arms and midriff were bare. She wore a pair of matching shorts with bowtie-laces in the front, covering just a few inches of her thighs. Smooth, flawless skin as the far as the eyes could tell upon tracing along her bare slender legs until a pair of pink sandals sheathed her small feet. Her long, straight, glossy brown hair was let down to her lower back. Light-brown pupils, her large eyes were gentle and kind, innocent and sweet. She had a small bowtie on the right side of her head. She was the personification of innocence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Rebecca Endyke, an eighteen-year-old freshman who just started her first semester in the University of Azmar. She was accepted into the College of Dance and Music, and she was majoring in Dance. The brunette was a part of the Dance Team that had their first performance on stage, giving her a debut on campus. Her popularity began to form the moment hundreds of students laid their eyes on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innocent, sweet girl started to meet all sorts of new people outside of her class, but one day, a few older students, who she had just met, asked if they could come visit her room. Naively, Rebecca accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/iIar33s.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/iIar33s.png</a></td>",
