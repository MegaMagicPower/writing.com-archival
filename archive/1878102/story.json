It was a bright, beautiful April morning.  Malon sat up and rubbed her eyes.  Lately she'd been suffering from a lack of sleep due to Ingo's unfair working hours.  The tired ranch girl scuttled out of her bed and stepped over to her dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what should I wear today?...\". Malon asked herself. She opened the middle draw and dug through her clothes.  Most of her dresses were from when she was a child, and while she didn't ever where them, she would rather not throw them out.  This did make it a little difficult to navigate her draws though.  Malon continued to dig through her dresser until she found one of her favorite outfits. \"I guess I could just wear my nice dress today.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon walked over to mirror in the bathroom and began changing.  She slipped off her night garments and stepped into her white dress.  Once she finished dressing herself, Malon switched her focus on her hair.  She spent a good amount of time combing it down desperately trying to do away with her bed head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I look alright.\" Malon told herself once she finished fiddling with her hair.  \"But I swear, If Ingo makes me clean up the horse stables today, I'm going to lose it.  I've already lost enough of my clothes because of the scumbag and his chores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*This day started out like many other days for Malon.  During this time she was 19.  Even though she was technically an adult, she still had to listen to the boss (AKA Ingo).  It had been a little more than two years since the hero of time had slain Ganondorf and saved Hyrule.  It was a same that Link had to leave.  He was pretty good looking. Hyrule is in a peaceful state and has recovered from Ganondorf.  Malon is still doing what she's always been doing.  Working on the ranch and farm.  Even though she had spent the better half of her years working in the ranch, she still had to take orders from Ingo and Talon.  It is because of this that Malon usually gets stuck with the worst jobs.  She has always hated this.  It doesn't make a difference to Ingo and Talon that she's an adult now.  Malon is always getting stuck the same kinds of jobs that she'd been doing since she was like twelve.  She hates being treated like a kid.  Especially since she was easily the hardest worker on the ranch.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malon, hurry up!\"  Ingo shouted through the wall. \"There's work that needs to be done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know!!!\" Malon shouted back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young rancher slipped on her shoes and ran outside to start her morning chores.</span></div></div>",

Ingo shouted as he noticed Malon come his way.  Malon finally snapped back to reality a few moments too late and collided into Ingo. The old rancher flew a couple of feet back and landed on his head as the milk he was carrying crashed onto the floor.  Malon also got hit hard and landed on her sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MALON, what in the world are you doing?!?\". Ingo shouted at the young rancher as he picked himself up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to hurry because whenever I don't, you flip out at me. Kind of like how you are now!!!\" Malon shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only did you break a good amount of our Lon Lon milk, but you also knocked me into the pavement.\". Do you have any idea how hard it is get that milk!?!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon started to get really angry at Ingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, I do know how hard it is to get that milk, because I milk the cows every morning!! Along with a thousand other chores.  And all the while you get to spend the morning relaxing.  Do you know how hard it is to do the work I do!!!???.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, You only have the simple jobs, You couldn't handle the kind of work I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, the work you do is fancy and clean.  You barely have to move to complete your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so you really think you could handle the kind of work I do eh.  Well it so happens that I was going to make a very important delivery today.  But since you claim to be so mature, you can do it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I will.\" Malon said.  \"And it's going to be as easy as crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, prove me wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but what exactly am I suppose to be delivering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple bottles of this very important liquid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngo handed Malon the bottles of the mystery liquid and started to walk off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and the direction are on the map attached to one of the bottles.\" Ingo said as he dissapered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff, this is going to be a cakewalk.\". Malon said as she left the ranch.</span></div></div>",

I swear, iif this stuff is alcohol, I'm going to kick Ingo's butt.\"  Malon stopped walking and thought about checking the liquid.  \"Ingo never said I couldn't check to see what I'm delivering.  Besides, it couldn't hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon sat down and unscrewed one of the bottles.  When she got the cape off, she saw that the liquid inside was a clear, odorless liquid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this, IS THIS JUST WATER!!!???!!!\" Malon screamed.  \"I hate Ingo, how is water some kind of secret liquid.  He has a lot of nerve sendin me off to deliver water.  Does he really expect me to walk more than 20 miles to give someone something that falls from the sky.  What a JERK!!!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon sat down on a rock to decide on what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I just go back, or are they really going to expect me to deliver this? Maybe the test is realizing that it's just water to show you're not gullible? Dangit, I'm so confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, Malon noticed that she was feeling kind of patrched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I'm getting kind of thirsty.  I guess I could just drink this water, Although Hyrule town isn't that far away.  I could just get a drink there.</span></div></div>",

The cap pooped off and Malon took a closer look at the liquid.  \"Yep, this just looks like ordinary water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young rancher walked over to a rock and sat down on it.  She kicked off her shoes and took a sip of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Gulp) (Gulp)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid tasted like normal water, but it had a very small sweetness to it.  When Malon finished her sip she realized that the drink might not have been water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap,\". Malon whispered in a panicked voice.  \"I don't think this is water.  This was way to sweet.  Maybe it's the juice of a rare fruit or maybe it's some kind of valley water from a far off land.  Oh man, I hope this isn't actually some rare delicacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon finally snapped and started losing it.  \"AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!  Why would anybody make a drink that looks like water!!!??  Why couldn't this have been purple or red!!!??? Why would anybody make some kind of rare liquid look identical to water???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Rancher felt a little light headed.  (And not just because of all of her screaming.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh, What was in that drink??? It didn't taste alcoholic or anything.  So why do I feel so weird.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon laid down on the rock and closed her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll just take a quick little nap....\". Malon told herself as she fell asleep....As Malon slept, she started to change. As she laid on the rock, she started to get smaller.  Her hips grew thinner as her breast began to shrink. Her hair became less full, and her dress started to sag as it was far to big.  It was quite apparent that Malon was getting younger, but how young did she become? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Malon slept, she had shrunken down into her former 14 year old self.  While she didn't look drastically different, she was noticeably shorter and had smaller boobs.  Her clothes were much to big for her and sagged down a little bit.  Despite all of this change, Malon was still peacefully asleep dreaming....Later in the day, Malon finally started waking up.  She sat up with her eyes still partially closed.  She began to rub them as she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"(Yawn)...Ugh...how long have I been asleep for?\" Malong said.  She started to fiddle with her hair to make sure that it wasn't messed up.  It seemed that she hadn't yet realized that her voice was a little bit higher than usual.  \"So, I guess this IS the kind of work Ingo does all day.   Sleep while everyone else is handling the rest. I really like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Malon started to get of the rock, as she went to step down, she tripped a little bit and almost fell.  \"Hugh, I don't remember the rock being this tall.\" Malon said as she looked back at the stone.  The young rancher walked a couple of feet back towards her shoes.  She was finally starting to notice that something was strange, her dress was giving her a whole lot of trouble.  It kept on sliding down.  \"Hmm, I must have stretched out my dress in my sleep.\" Malon said trying to make sense of why her dress was obviously to big for her.  Although she knew that something was up, she tried to ignore it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Malon crouched down to her shoes and slipped one of her feet in.  The shoes didn't feel very right.  They seemed to spacious.  Even when Malon tied them they still didn't fit right.  \"What in the world is going on!!!\" Malon screamed.  \"My dress is to big, my shoes are to big...did I shrink or something?\"  The second Malon said that half sarcastic phrase, she couldn't get the thought of it out of her head.  \"Shrunk...shrunk...no that's....or is it....maybe, I...ummm.\"  Malon was starting to get a little scared.  \"No there's got to be a more practical reason for why this seems to be.\"  Malon told herself, although, not believing a single word of it.  The regressed girl was starting to get worried.  She just had to know what was going on.  \"Well, lake Hylia is near by.  I could just go there and check my reflection, that way, I can prove that this is all in my head.\" Malon convinced herself...(Well, kind of).  The young rancher stood up an walked over to the bottles of \"water\".  She went to pick them up but stopped herself for a second.  \"I wonder,\" Malon thought, \"Could this have something to do with the water?...\"   Malon shook the thought out of her head and picked up the \"water\".  \"Yikes, I don't remember this stuff being so heavy.\"  Malon walked over to Lake Hylia, stumbling a few times because, well....her shoes and dress were WAY to big on her.  </span></div></div>",

Maybe the hero of time has already stop the evil Ganondorf, or maybe Ganondorf is still around but hasn't really done much to directly affect the character chosen.  Either way, Your character is just enjoying another peaceful day when she is affected by something or someone that has made the main character much younger and much cuter.  Now the main girl chosen will have to deal with these new problems and conflicts that will arise along with there new younger bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story will preferably be told in third person...I think.  The main character will only deal with Age regression.  Maybe they can deal with the issues that stem from this like a potty problems, and babyish habits, but I do not want any other forms of TF or any other fetishes.  Also, I don't want any gay or lesbian stuff in it.  It's not that I am a homophobe, it's just that I'm a little grossed out by some of it.  I also don't want any sex in it either.  Or rape.  I want it to be suitable for pg 13.  I would also like the female characters to mainly be from ocarina of time.  Also, I don't want too many character options.  I just want a few good options for long stories, instead of a cluttered mess of options with little content.  Speaking of content, I would like the chapters to be fairly long and well written.  Nothing rushed. I also want good grammar and spelling.  I want this to be a good story so please add chapters if you have good ideas.  If the story does well enough, I might add more characters.  I don't want any of the stories to end either.  To sum things up, I want this to be a good story.  One last thing, don't make the characters have to much mental regression. A little bit is fine, but it's a lot less entertaining if the character isn't worried about these changes.  </td>",
