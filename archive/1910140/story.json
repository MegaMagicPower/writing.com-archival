            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much as she loved working at the bookstore, even part-time, Bex had to admit that her mind wasn't entirely on the job today. Tuesday night had been fun, but Jamie hadn't called since, and she was starting to worry. Bex really wanted to see where things could go, but maybe Jamie was looking for something that produced a few more immediate fireworks? Or maybe Bex should call? Jamie might be leaving it up to her to determine whether there was a future to be pursued. Maybe. If there was still nothing by this evening she would give it a shot. Probably.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" a man's voice brought Bex sharply back to reality. He was hovering next to her, clutching a dictionary and a slim book of poetry. \"Could you ring these up for me? I'm afraid there's no-one at the desk.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh! Of course, sir. I'm sorry for the wait, I hadn't realised there was no-one there.\"<br>\r\nBex hurried over to the main desk of the shop and quickly processed the man's items.<br>\r\n\"That will be twenty-one ninety-seven, sir.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" The man rummaged in his wallet for a moment, then sighed.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I must have pocketed the twenty separately. So sorry- could you hold that for a moment?\"<br>\r\nHe thrust his wallet at her, and Bex took it as he ransacked his coat pockets for the banknote. It wasn't a terribly well-kept wallet, and something on the bottom of it gave her a sharp scratch as she closed her hand around it. The man was finished in moments, though, and quickly paid his bill.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\" Bex would have added \"see you again\", but he was already making his way out of the door, clearly in a hurry to get somewhere. At least that gave Bex the leisure to have a look at her hand, which was beginning to sting quite a lot. He'd actually drawn blood! Bex felt a stab of annoyance. If the man could afford to buy a dictionary, he could afford a new wallet. No-one wanted a sharp-edged wallet, no matter how well it discouraged thieves. Irritated, she sucked at the cut as she walked to get a plaster from the first-aid kit in the back room. She wasn't the sort to stay angry over little things for long, and once the sting faded, she half-forgot the man altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an uncommonly busy day for the usually quiet bookstore, and by mid-afternoon Bex was starting to feel a little weary. She decided that that was probably the reason for the slight ache between her eyes as well. During a lull she caught herself calculating the minutes until they would close up and she could go home, and quickly stopped- she knew thinking like that would only make the time go by slower. To distract herself, she wandered over to the second-hand shelves and started placing some recent acquisitions in appropriate gaps.<br>\r\nAs she worked, absorbed in creating the right effect with the books, she began to feel a prickly tickle make the rounds of her nose. She ignored it for a while, occasionally pushing it away by pressing her tongue against the roof of her mouth. This tickle refused to be denied her attention, however, and perhaps two minutes after the first pricklings, she was forced to take a couple of steps back from the bookshelves, fumbling in her pocket for her little white handkerchief. Pulling it out, she plunged her nose into it just in time.<br>\r\n\"<i>Hatishew! huh-uh-isshhew!</i>\"<br>\r\nThe tickling relieved, Bex looked suspiciously at the books in front of her. They didn't look that dusty, and the shop was usually pretty clean, but... She would have to remember to come around this section with the duster again. It could wait until tomorrow, though. She didn't feel up to the stretching and bending involved this afternoon, and besides, there was only about an hour left before closing time.<br>\r\nIt might be able to wait, but then so could the rest of the volumes to be shelved. As Bex moved back into the central area of the shop, Mr Grace, the bookstore's owner, gestured to her to come and take his place at the desk. This wasn't unusual near closing time- that way he could handle all the little bits of business that needed to be finished before they shut, while she dealt with last-minute customers. A small child buying a book on flowers for his mother and a young reptilian woman looking for a book of love poetry later, a man with a chestnut ponytail asked her if they had a copy of <i>A Time to Uproot</i>, the fourth book in the <i>Naomi's Grief</i> sequence. Bex remembered that she had unpacked a copy that morning, and fetched it from the back room for him. But just as she set the book down in front of the customer she was overcome by a fresh, vicious irritation. This one would brook no argument, so, voice quavering uncontrollably, she managed to stammer out;<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sir, if you could hold on just a muh-mom- mom<i>ehh</i>nt-\" before she twisted her head to one side and sneezed \"<i>heh-chiieew!</i>\"<br>\r\nHer sneeze was high-pitched, but gentler than she had expected, given her lack of control over it. It hadn't entirely dealt with the ticklish feeling, but, giving her nose a quick wiggle, she found that she could easily subdue it. Turning back to the customer, she said;<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, sir.\"<br>\r\n\"Not at all. Bless you.\" She thanked him, although she noticed that he did look a little repulsed. She usually managed to cover her nose and mouth, partly because she knew she could sometimes show a disturbing amount of teeth when she sneezed, but this one had been so sudden that she hadn't had time to think. Fortunately, her fur concealed her blushes well, and she quickly rang up the man's purchase.<br>\r\nAs she counted out his change, however, she began to realise that she had been mistaken about how easily the remaining irritation could be contained. Every time she breathed in it grew a little stronger, until it felt as though she had a tiny pigeon lodged in her nose, fluttering its wings with each inhale. Hoping that holding her breath would buy her the time she needed, she handed the customer his change and reached for her handkerchief again. With the little cloth square safely in hand, she allowed herself to breathe out slowly. Apparently, this caused the tiny pigeon to go wild, fluttering up and down the length of her nose in a blind, ticklish panic. Bex clamped the handkerchief over her face as the itch took over, jamming her eyes closed and reducing her breathing to desperate tickly gasps.<br>\r\n\"uh! huh! <i>heh!</i> hi!-hi!-huh... heh-heh-heh-hih-<i>heh!- hehhhCHIIIEW! hisshiew!</i> heh. h-<i>iisshew! hetishew!</i> ah... ha- eh- <i>ah-! HATchew!</i><br>\r\nThe fit finally released her, and Bex had to take a moment to catch her breath before she could even open her eyes again.<br>\r\nThe man was still there, looking distinctly uncomfortable this time. \"Bless you.\" he said again, then turned and was gone before she could even apologise. She blushed again, deeply embarrassed. At least his absence meant she could blow her nose without worrying about anyone being disgusted. It felt unusually in need of it, even for a fit like that. Something was definitely a little off, Bex decided.<br>\r\nFortunately Mr Grace put up the Closed sign just a couple of minutes later, and Bex was free to go, picking up her bag and coat on the way out.</span></div></div>",

He rounded the next corner and bumped into a strange fellow, knocking him back a couple of steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bout that? You okay?\" Stone asked, unfazed by the blow and still jogging in place. Once he was sure the stranger was okay he continued on his running path around the large apartment complex that Stone lived in. About a minute later he felt a light tingle up in his nose. He ignored it at first and continued on his way, sniffling and snorting at random moments to keep it at bay. Eventually he was forced to stop and rub and scratch his nose with his clawed fingers, bringing a slight bit of relief from the tickling tingles. He made it to the door and made his way to his apartment, nose tingling and running against his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone made into his room, sniffling and scrubbing at his nose when he couldn't hold it any longer. \"HeH'Choo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone shook his head and hit the showers, washing away the sweat and dirt from his jog and prepares to start his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does stone go?</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t plan to spend his life there, though. If you worked there too long, the constant dust would get into your system. Some of the older foremen walked around sounding as though their lungs were made of brown paper. No, that wasn\u2019t the life Stone wanted for himself.<br>\r\nStone clocked in, and the secretary on the desk told him that he was assigned to work the Chaff Belt that morning. This involved watching the steady stream of waste- seed husks, leaves, twigs , and indeed, chaff, on the belt, and picking out anything that couldn\u2019t go through the grinders at the other end- metal, plastic, anything inorganic, really.<br>\r\nStone took up position on the belt opposite his friend Billy, a cheerful middle-aged man with a well-kept beard. They chatted for a couple of minutes before the first sacks of waste began to be poured out and the conveyor belt between them whirred into life.<br>\r\nIt hadn\u2019t rained in a couple of days, which meant that there was already a fine layer of loose dust coating the plant even before the various hoppers and mills set about adding to it. They had been working for about an hour when Billy drew back from the belt and scrunched his face into his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Hetishoo! Blamed dust.\" He glanced up at Stone, on the other side of the conveyor belt. \"Bothering you too, buddy?\"<br>\r\nStone nodded, already deprived of speech by the irritation which had claimed his nose as its own. He raised an arm and scrubbed at his face, but only succeeded in intensifying the ticklish feeling to the point of-<br>\r\n\"HaHtchoo!\"<br>\r\n\u201cGesundheit.\u201d<br>\r\nStone nodded thanks to Billy, and rubbed at his nose again.

A new delivery of pistachios was being received into the hoppers, and the dust cloud that they were throwing up was tremendous. The shape of his head defended Stone's right nostril from the worst of the dust that reached as far as his workstation, but his left nostril was not enjoying it at all. It felt as though a heavy ring of dust was building up just inside, and his nose was beginning to run again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone reached a claw into the offending nostril and scratched, but that just made it feel as though there was a swirling dustcloud right\u2026 inside\u2026 his\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEH\u2019Choo!\u201d Stone sneezed violently down at the conveyor belt, surprising himself with the amount of spray that this produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBless, dude.\u201d said Billy, reaching for a ring-pull in amongst some dried leaves, seemingly unperturbed by the small droplets that transferred themselves onto his safety gloves.  Stone gave him a sheepish grin, sniffing in an effort to clear his nose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly shrugged. \u201cNo problem, Stoney. They sneak up on you sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Stone agreed. That left nostril still felt closed up. He sniffed again, before giving up for now. This was getting annoying. He was never this bothered by the dust- that was one of the reasons so many reptilians worked here. Their bodies had originally been adapted to sneeze out  salts created by their digestive processes, and while that no longer really happened, most reptilians were still less sensitive to minor irritants or allergens than humans. Tolerance levels varied, but Stone rarely had a problem until the dust reached such a level that masks became compulsory. Certainly not at these levels. What was <i>wrong</i> with him today?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been standing at the bus stop for at least 10 minutes, and her short temper was starting to get the better of her. Trying to distract herself, Jenny ran a hand through her pink hair, and then she pulled it up into a ponytail. The short young lady managed to keep her mind occupied for a few minutes, and finally she saw a bus appear in the distance, headed for her stop.

Crossing her arms in a huff, Jenny turned back to the bus and waited for the doors to open. As she climbed the stairs and chose a seat, the young woman felt a strange, tickly sensation in her upturned nose. She sniffed loudly, rubbing her finger under her nostrils for a split second.

She immediately sat up a little straighter to make room for her friend on the seat next to hers.<br>\r\n\"Hi Tiffany. what's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Not much. College is pretty dull, work's pretty busy. Only two weirdos this morning.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're really bucking the average these days, Tiff. So, come on, what were today's like?\" Jenny smiled. Tiffany had been working shifts in a coffee shop lately, and Jenny liked to hear about her more unusual customers.<br>\r\n\"Well, weirdo numero uno wanted six syrup shots in his coffee, and when I made it for him he was all \"What, no comment? Six syrups, you got nothing to say about that?\" and whe I was all \"nah, not my job to question how you want your coffee\" he straight up reached over and tried to full-on hug me.\"<br>\r\nJenny smiled \"Not always a bad thing, Tiff.\"<br>\r\n\"He smelled funny, Jenny.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah. Commiserations, then.\"<br>\r\nTiffany sighed theatrically. \"Worst part is, I reckon he'll come back 'cause he was going on about finally having found a server who <i>gets it</i>, so I don't...\" But by that point Jenny had stopped listening, because the tickle was back, and it seemed as though this time it had decided to hang around at the back of her nose for a while, promising an explosion in the future, but not delivering just yet. It was sufficiently irritating to keep Jenny from following Tiffany's stories with her full attention, though, and she kept wrinkling her nose in the hope of coaxing it into either going away or getting on with it. This tickle wouldn't be rushed, though, and even when it began to spread, it did so at a snail's pace. Jenny felt her breath involuntarily slow and deepen, and it was getting harder to keep her eyelids up, but relief still felt a long, long way away. <br>\r\nBy the time the tingling sensation began to tease the edges of Jenny's nostrils, even Tiffany had noticed something was up.<br>\r\n\"Jenny?\"<br>\r\nJenny held up a finger, illogically scared of scaring the tickle back into the recesses of her nose. Tiffany fell obediently quiet, and the only sound left in Jenny's head was her own breathing, impossibly loud. As she kept breathing steadily in and out, letting the tingling grow, she felt her nostrils begin to flare in time with her breaths. Once. Twice. Thr-<br>\r\n\"HA-CHIEW!\" Jenny sneezed, her whole body jerking forward with it. Not finished, the tickle surged through her again, utterly irresistible. \"HhhhieecHEW!\" Jenny's head flew forwards again, this time coating Tiffany in a thin film of spray.<br>\r\n\"Eew! Jenny! Cover it up for once, girl!\"<br>\r\nTruth be told, Jenny was a little embarrassed, but she wasn't about to admit it to Tiffany.<br>\r\n\"Oh, get over it, Tiff. It's not hurting anyone.\"<br>\r\n\"It's not exactly polite though. And you've got to admit, it's kind of gross. I've got tiny bits of you all down my arm.\"<br>\r\nJenny giggled.<br>\r\n\"Alright, fair point, Tiff. I'll try to be more careful.\"<br>\r\nTiffany smiled back, showing that she wasn't really that bothered by it. Then she glanced out of the window and pressed the button to indicate she wanted to get off at the next stop.<br>\r\n\"Now <i>I</i>\" \"have to change for class this afternoon. Catch you later, Snottles.\"<br>\r\nAs Tiffany stood to go, Jenny called out, \"Hey, Tiff.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Tiffany turned, leaning back over the seat. Jenny leaned in and whispered,<br>\r\n\"I think you might have some of me down your top as well.\" before leaning back with a wicked grin.<br>\r\n\"Eew!\" Tiffany wiped feverishly at the exposed skin above her v-neck. \"<i>Gross</i>, Jenny!\"<br>\r\nJenny just laughed as her friend hurried to get off at her stop.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s totally cool if you\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t, it\u2019s just that Kieran\u2019s having one of his parties and I have work tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\nJenny tutted.<br>\r\n\u201cSee, this is why you need to get a place of your own. Or at least find someone who occasionally consults you before they make plans.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Kieran\u2019s not so bad. He just\u2026 forgets to consult his brain sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Um, excuse me?\"<br>\r\nThe voice jerked Jed out of his daydream. A nervous looking man was standing next to him, clutching a city A-Z.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to be a bother, but I'm trying to get to Featherstone Gardens, and I just can't work out...\" the man gesture helplessly towards the bus-stand nearby. Well, Jed's bus wasn't due for another ten minutes at least, so there could be no harm in helping the guy out.<br>\r\n\"Featherstone Gardens is actually pretty close. I reckon you can get there just as quickly by walking, if you wanted to.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, really? Thank goodness. Um, I marked the place-\" The man fumbled with his map-book. Finding his place, he held it out to Jed.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, so if Featherstone is here, then...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright.\" The man was standing a little too close for comfort, but Jed decided to put up with it in favour of ending the interaction quickly. \"We're here, halfway down Parkhurst Street.\" Jed placed his finger on the map to illustrate his point, drawing it along the printed street to show the direction that the stranger should take. \"If you carry on down here- in that direction\" he pointed to his right- \" Then turn right into Cornwall Street, and it should be fairly straightforward from there.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, thank you!\" The man seemed to be a little <i>too</i> happy, but Jed gave him a smile and fortunately he took his cue to leave. The pink-haired girl at the bus stand shot him a sympathetic glance, and he returned a much more genuine smile to her. She was actually pretty cute, and he might have tried to start up a conversation if her bus hadn't chosen that moment to arrive.<br>\r\nLeft to wait for his bus on his own, Jed slipped back into daydreams until he was distracted by an odd prickling sensation somewhere between his nose and throat. He cleared his throat a couple of times, trying not to attract too much attention, but the feeling remained. Oh well. It was distracting, but not too bad. He probably just needed a drink or something.<br>\r\nThe bus finally deigned to turn up, and he made his way to a window seat near the back. It wasn't too busy at this time of day- a couple of elderly people with shopping bags, two giggling teenage girls, a harassed-looking mother and a few college students. He listened idly to the girls' conversation for a while- apparently a mutual friend had somehow acquired an ill-advised tattoo- before his body decided to act out again.<br>\r\nThe tingle at the back of his throat blossomed and sent out a sudden tendril into his nose. Still not wanting to draw attention to himself, Jed settled for swallowing hard in an effort to ease the irritation. For a moment, he thought it had helped, then a stranger and stronger feeling swept through him. His nostrils flared, and before he could do anything about it, he gasped;<br>\r\n\"hh-<i>h-hih</i>-\" <br>\r\nthen suddenly had control of his own breathing again. One of the girls on the back seat giggled, and Jed told himself it was stupid to assume that she was laughing at him. She probably hadn't even noticed. Feeling a slight heat rising in his cheeks, he shifted in his seat,staring steadily out of the window.<br>\r\nHe rubbed his nose with one index finger, and what was left of the feeling subsided. Thank goodness for that at least. There wasn't really anything that he could put his finger on without sounding silly and paranoid, but he had a definite sense that something weird was going on. Still, all that was wrong at the moment was an odd itch at the top of his throat, so hopefully he could at least get this journey over with without giving the girls anything more to laugh about.<br>\r\nHis body seemed to accept this compromise, and he got off at his stop, careful not to look at either of the girls as he got off at the little row of shops, just a five-minute walk from home.</span></div></div>",

To infect the world with this virus and bring it back into power. But no one really knows why? Maybe he just wants to see someone suffer, sneeze, cough, and blow their nose. Or maybe he is just as mad as a mad scientist can be. That is for you to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the virus has been spread to his victim you will then take on the role of that victim and suffer the side effects of the cold, which include sniffling, sneezing, runny nose, and any other symptom you wish the victim to suffer. Afterwards you may change the character once the disease has been spread via sneezing and take over from the newly infected character.</td>",
