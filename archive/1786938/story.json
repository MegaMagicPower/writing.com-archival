Suddenly, you hear loud frantic booms coming from behind you, getting louder and louder. You know who it is and refuse to look back out of fear.

If that doesn't sound too appealing to you, I could hand you over to a flight attendant and let them help you.

This would maximize her command fees and additional salary. This was very rare and reserved for an especially favored slave-soldier, usually one desired by his Master, the Regimental Colonel, as a Concubius (basically a concubine, only male) or even more rarely as a husband.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful. You were mainly just trapped there in between Lydia's bra cup and her breast, not able to do much. After shrinking you've felt like you've had a long day and eventually go to sleep. The next thing you know you wake up in a rather large room, especially to you since you're tiny. You quickly jolt up to observe your surroundings. It seems like your in a giant bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you've finally woke up?\" You heard a loud yet friendly voice. You turned to see Lydia walk into the room. By the looks of things, it seemed like she had just taken a shower. \"Sorry for leaving you here by yourself, I was just getting a quick drink. I suppose that was slightly careless of me. My daughter could've gotten to you after all, or maybe you'd try to escape again?\" She teased looking down at you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, it's fine Ms... i mean Lydia.\" You said nervously looking up to the giant woman. She chuckles at your nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now.\" She says lowering her hand gently grabbing you, laying you flat on her palm. \"You must be hungry. How would you like a snack?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that would be nice, but what about your daughter?\" You ask still nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about her. She's usually in her room doing whatever it is she likes doing. Even if she goes downstairs and See's you, I won't let her get to you.\" Lydia says trying to reassure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Ok, I trust you.\" Lydia simply smile's, she wraps her hand around you just to make sure she doesn't drop you and walks down the stairs of her large house to get to the kitchen. As you are within the giantess's grasp you begin to think about your life, old and new. You had your own personal goals and objectives you wanted to accomplish and had your family who will probably think you're dead by your disappearance. As for your new life, you're now tiny and a pet to a giant woman. You're not sure if Lydia would just give you back to your family, she seemed pretty content with keeping you as a pet. She also seemed pretty nice and she did promise she would take good care of you. But still, you couldn't help but to miss being normal sized. She eventually arrived at the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what would you like to eat?\" She asks enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know. Food isn't really my size any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I suppose it is a little bigger than you now, huh?\" She teased. \"How about a grape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure.\" You respond. She opens the fridge and gets a small grape for you, from where she stashes some of her fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" She says as she drops the grape on her palm for you. You pick it up, examining it. You eventually just dig in. You soon finish your meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know something? You seem a little down, something wrong?\" Lydia asks examining you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I... I just miss being my normal size and my family. I had my own personal goals in life and now I'll never get to accomplish them!\" You say holding back your tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Lydia respond?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(PS thanks for the Gp's!)</span></div></div>",

I wanted to have a successful career and maybe get married one day! Now I'm stuck at this size being the pet of some woman I don't even know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia snuggles you against her cheek and gently rubs you up and down on her soft skin. You feel so hopeless and alone that you can't help but snuggle back while letting out all your tears. As she snuggles you, Lydia slowly walks back up to her bedroom, her soothing footsteps help you calm down . After Lydia makes it to her room, sits down on her bed. She gently pulls you away from her cheek and holds you in her open palm close to her face while softly stroking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be ok sweetie.\" Lydia said soothingly. \"It could have been a lot worse you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" you say, still crying a little. \"How could it have been worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" says Lydia. \"Anne could have kept you hidden from me, and would have most likely have not been so gentle with you. Or some other woman could have found you and made you her sex slave. Or even worse, you could have been stepped on in the busy airport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at all of those scenarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose you're right\" you say, wiping the tears out of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be honest with you, I'm guessing there's no way you can be unshrunk.\" says Lydia with sympathy in her voice. \"But like I told you before, I will take good care of you and keep you safe. Since you're stuck like this, having me as your owner is the best outcome you could have hoped for. You're stuck with a woman who thinks you are the cutest little thing and wouldn't dream of hurting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in Lydia's palm as she continues to gently pet you. You know that she's right, there's no way to find out how you got this way let alone return to your normal size. You know that it could be a very long time (if ever) when you return to normal, and Lydia has treated you well so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.\" you say sniffling. \"I feel a little better. Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Lydia says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you keep holding me like this for a while?\" you ask shyly. \"It's really soothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, of course sweetie\" Lydia says lovingly. \"I can't have my little guy feeling sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia holds you close to her chest and cuddles you against her breasts while softly petting you. You snuggle up against her and you see her looking down at you with a beaming smile. The more Lydia snuggles you, the more safe you feel. In the back of your mind you think about how much you want to return to your normal size, but for the immediate present you feel content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You do feel exhausted and it would be nice to get some sleep. Lydia gently cradles you in her hand and walks over to her dresser. With her free hand, she makes a little bed out of her panties, socks, and nylons in her top drawer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go sweetie\" Lydia says, gently putting you in her drawer. \"I'm sorry it's not much, but I wasn't planning on bringing home a tiny man today\" she chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.

Lydia then closes the drawer leaving you in darkness. As you fall asleep, you reflect on the mixed feelings you have on your current situation. On one hand you feel grateful that this woman is treating you so kindly and you didn't end up becoming a toy for her daughter. On the other hand, you feel embarrassed being treated like a baby/pet. You still see yourself as a grown man even though you're only an inch tall. After about an hour you eventually drift off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what doesn't seem like a long time, you are startled awake by someone opening the drawer.

She's paying absolutely no attention to you. You desperately try to loosen yourself from this bind, but to little avail. You kick and cream, but she takes no notice. You wiggle your arm a little, which seems to tickle her. This causes her to loosen her grip and suddenly you are free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are filled with joy until you look down at what looks like a six story drop. The bind was what was keeping you from falling. You quickly latch onto her toe with your two hands. Your legs and the rest of your body are dangling over the edge as your arms hold on for dear life. You attempt to push yourself up or latch your feet unto the underside of her foot, but that tickles her and causes her to wiggle her toe up and down. You left arm looses it's grip as the wiggles. You have only seconds until imminent death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well I'll see you in a few minutes.

You fall downwards to the front and before you can climb out, she joins you. At first her toes slam you against the front wall, and then slowly slide you underneath them. With the smell and constant pressure, you don't think things could get much worse, but then she gets up and walks. Each step pushes her weight on top of you and soaks you in her sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she take you directly to see her friend or does she take a detour first?</span></div></div>",

Though unlike a real barracks, you have it all to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl explains that carrying you in her pocket on a day-to-day basis is too risky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when I need arm candy with my friends in the know, you'll be sure to receive a deluxe ride in my pocket--that I can promise you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you ponder your opinions. She's obviously infatuated with you. If you can make the relationship sexual, then surely she will see that you need to be even bigger than her thumb. But if you hold off on it for awhile, you can partake in her socialization with other giantesses and perhaps learn enough for a more reliable plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl had heard that tinies made good hand and foot valets. They could trim nails, moisturize palms and heels, clean shoes of all sorts and polish formalwear gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

And the security women whose uniforms have ties scare you\u2014specifically you\u2019re afraid an accident with a tie could knock you on your ass or send you flying!

To your surprise, she shifts her bra to make sure you have enough room to be comfortable. You find yourself nice and snug between Megan's bra and nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy honey?\" You hear Megan say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is actually very nice\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're so sweet\" replies Megan. \"I'm glad you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lifted you up and gently placed you on her hand. She lifts you up to where you\u2019re leveled with her giant face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a cute little thing\u201d she says as she gently pokes you in your lower chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re just staring at her, with your face as red as a tomato from the humiliation you feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww Megan he\u2019s embarrassed\u201d Camille says in a babying voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is the cutest when he\u2019s scared or embarrassed\u201d Megan said with a smile. \u201cYou should have seen him when I removed his clothes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, I wish I could have\u201d Camille says whilst looking at you with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille then proceeds to give you a long soft kiss. Her lips cover your entire body but she\u2019s careful to not  kiss you too hard to where you can\u2019t breathe. It actually feels nice. She eventually stops and you\u2019re covered in a thin layer of saliva. She giggles and wipes it off with some tissue that was sitting on the coffee table. Then, out of nowhere Camille asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I keep him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Camille is wearing a long blue dress that exposes her cleavage, black high heels, stringy silver earrings, and a long pearl necklace that goes down to her waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou-you look gorgeous!\u201d You say still stunned by what you see. \u201cAnd classy\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille picks you up and cups you in her hands and gives you a long soft kiss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll aren\u2019t you a sweetie\u201d she says still holding you in her hand close to her face. \u201cAnd such a gentleman\u201d she continues as strokes you with her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush as she complements you and pets you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you dressed up for\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I like to dress up from time to time.\u201d She explains. \u201cPlus I figure since I\u2019m dating again I should dress up when we have romantic evenings and stuff\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her words. You see that she really likes you and cares about you. At the same time, the thought of getting back to normal is constantly in the back of your mind and it\u2019s clear Camille has no intention of helping you return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell honey I need to change and pay for all this.\u201d She says winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamille slowly takes off the dress and shoes. She\u2019s only wearing her bra and underwear and you can\u2019t help but stare in awe at her. You look down to see that you have a rather noticeable erection, even at your size. She looks at you and smiles. You bashfully look away. Camille leans in close to you. So close that you can feel her hot breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, don\u2019t worry honey.\u201d She says playfully poking your erect penis. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be embarrassed. It\u2019s nice to have a boyfriend who thinks I\u2019m beautiful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she continues dressing, scoops you up and puts you back into her purse and she prepares to leave. As you are lowered gently in to her purse you realize you\u2019re starting to develop genuine feelings for Camille. You think she\u2019s beautiful and she\u2019s taken care of you so far, plus she took you away from Meagan who would have certainly humiliated you. Then your heart sinks as you realize your only supposed to be on loan you Camille. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when Megan wants me back?\u201d you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks out of the changing room towards the checkout, you notice she forgot to zip up her purse. It\u2019s wide open and someone could easily see you. You don\u2019t want to tell Camille because you figure that would risk getting detected. You look up to see she is waiting in the check out with her new clothes in her hand. All you can do is hope nobody sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly there's a rush of light that floods your prison and a hand swoops in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you about to find out your fate?</span></div></div>",

You start to climb, but this seems to only tickle her more and making her flinch. It's hard enough climbing but even harder when your wall keeps moving. At one point, you reach up to one hold and as you're hoisting your body up, she figdets, and you slip. You're legs and your other arm both slip from their spots, and you're left dangling from your arm. You know you have only a few seconds before you drop and must decide what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your dilemma, she asks, \"Are you ready to obey your new Mistress?

She places you on her lap as she pulls her socks off and leans puts her feet back on the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, do you swear to be my slave?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you hesitantly answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To serve me in any way I desire and be punished for disobedience in any way I see fit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that wasn't too hard was it.

Only a few inches away lies the sock that you had been trapped inside. It's stench is enough to want to make you barf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, tell it your sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it like you mean it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now give it a hug,\" she said with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by give it a hug?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obey me or you'll regret it,\" she ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went up to the foot, which seemed to look back at you expectantly. You wrapped your arms around the lower part of the sole, not going all the way around, but the furthest you could and gave it a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now a sympathy kiss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO IT!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached your mouth up to give it a kiss. It was hard to do as it smelled like salt. You closed your eyes, puckered up, and give it a little peck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of kiss was that?! I couldn't even feel it! Try again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did the same thing but held the kiss for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't feel that one either. No kiss is proper without tongue!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you pushed against the sole and stuck out your tongue, licking up and done. She groaned in pleasure and delight. You weren't sure which she liked better, the feel of your tongue on her foot or her power over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly realize and back away as far from the smelly foot as you can.

You\u2019re so excited to get your diploma and start your new life as a college graduate. Just as the president of the University is about to hand you your diploma your vision goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, you wake up and you\u2019re in pitch blackness again. The aircraft had landed in New York and the sudden jolt of Jade grabbing her suitcase ruined the wonderful dream you were having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re snapped back into reality and fear begins to set in as Jade takes her luggage and starts carrying you through the airport. You\u2019re absolutely petrified thinking about what\u2019s going to happen next and how you\u2019re going to be used by this model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Worse ride ever, you think to yourself. You untie your leg that is wrapped around a bra strap and you're thankful the clothes are freshly washed at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag begins to unzip again and light comes into your dark tomb. A manicured hand comes inside aiming right for you and grabs you with no struggle. Jade holds you in her fist as she says goodbye to her chauffeur and you bounce around her palm. There is a loud thud as she passes her suitcase onto someone else and it sounds like there are hundreds of voices in different languages from outside your new prison of the supermodel's sweaty palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heels begin to click again onto a hard floor, an elevator and are muffled by what sounds like a carpeted floor. You hear the sound of her mumbling numbers and pressing the buttons on a keypad. All this traveling, you think, she must be getting close to her destination. You can't take much more of this being dragged around like a keychain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade yawns and her palm opens suddenly, dropping you onto a nightstand in what looks like a dimly lit hotel suite. You've never been in a 5 star room before so you take a moment to admire the sleek modern look of the place before Jade bends her body and fills your view with her attractive sinister smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a good job traveling, little guy. Nice to know I can just scoop you up without getting too much trouble from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supermodel pops off her high heel and sighs, laying onto the bed. The cozy mattress is silent to normal ears but at your size, you hear the material taking in the giantess model's body and the impact makes you fall back a little. Jade begins to untangle the braided portion of her hair to let it fall down her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're mostly here for work but if you're good, I can make this trip very enjoyable for you!\" Jade grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need me to do?\" You say with some dread in your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnding up with a hot supermodel while she works isn't what you had in mind for a vacation but it is better than trying to survive being stepped on in a busy airport.</span></div></div>",

She doesn\u2019t want to risk anyone seeing you. She zips up her purse but leaves it a tiny bit open to allow fresh air in and she starts walking.

Eventually, you find a nice piece of cloth to lay on that isn\u2019t in the direct path of anything that could crush you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman keeps walking you realize you\u2019re leaving the airport. You hear her getting into her car. She sets her purse down on the passgener seat. As she drives you can\u2019t help but worry about what\u2019s going to happen to you. She seemed pretty excited to have possession of you and said that she wanted to keep you. So you were relieved that she probably wasn\u2019t going to kill you. Still, you wondered what she meant by always wanting a tiny man. You hoped that she didn\u2019t have any menevolent plans for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after about 30 minutes of driving the car stopped and you felt the sudden motion of the woman picking up her purse with you inside. After you feel the purse being set down on a hard surface a sudden rush of light comes in as she unzips it. She looks down into her purse and sees you. A sweet smile comes across her face as she reaches in to grab you. Her giant fingers wrap around you and scoop you up in her hand again. When she opens her hand you\u2019re somewhat startled to be looking straight at her giant face. She cups you in her hands and smiles down at her captive.<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there, cutie.\u201d she said \u201cdid you enjoy the ride in my purse? I hope it wasn\u2019t too uncomfortable\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, it was fine\u201d you say still intimated by her size. <br>\r\n\u201cGood, I would have hated for you to be crushed by my makeup\u201d she said with a playful wink. \u201cDo you have a name little guy?\u201d<br>\r\nYou tell her your name and she continues smiling at you in her cupped hands<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Emily\u201d she said with peppy voice <br>\r\n\u201cWell Emily, can you tell me why you shrunk me and what is going to happen to me?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m part of an organization who shrinks people to sell on the black market usually to facilitaties where people can rent tiny people as toys or to private collectors. However, since I let you see my face when I caught you, my boss said we couldn\u2019t sell you because you\u2019re not supposed to see who captured you. Because of this my boss told me that I could have you. I have to admit, I did that on purpose because you were just so cute and I wanted you for myself.\u201d With that she gave you a playful poke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to comprehend all what she just told you you managed to say in a nervious voice \u201cw-what are you going to do to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Emily started to say in a flirtatious tone \u201cI was thinking you could be my...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You opened your mouth to beg but just as you did Emily's grip on you released and you plummeted downward. With a wet smack you slammed onto her massive tongue, you scrambled to escape her mouth but her lips slammed shut in front of you. The massive tongue rose up beneath you and you heard Emily moan in pleasure as she thoroughly tasted you and tossed you around her mouth with her tongue. You don't know how long it was that Emily's tongue manhandled you around her mouth for her pleasure, but it did eventually come to an end. The tongue slammed you against the top of the giantess's mouth and slid you into the waiting abyss of her throat. You were drawn into her throat, kneaded downwards by her muscles. After a journey that certainly felt much longer than it must have actually been you plopped out of her constricting throat and into her stomach. It was pitch black but you could feel the fleshy walls and ceiling of your living prison, soon to be tomb. You threw yourself at a nearby wall, screaming and thrashing.

Even more so, you wonder in fear where you\u2019re being taken to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you realize that whoever  you\u2019re being sold to lives really far away as the flight is already over six hours long. With nothing to do but wait you try to get some sleep. After another hour you eventually doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what didn\u2019t seem like a long time you are woken up by a sudden thud. You soon realize that you\u2019ve landed. Feeling nervous about your inevitable fate you quiver in fear as you hear baggage handlers removing bags from the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t long until they get to your bag and you\u2019re hoisted onto a truck bound for the baggage claim. You feel your world shift once again as you are placed on another conveyor belt which you assume is the baggage claim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you guessed correctly when you hear the familiar muffled voices of Kathleen and Emily. There\u2019s a sudden jolt as Emily grabs her suitcase off the conveyor belt. As you\u2019re being carried through the airport you can hear the loud booms of Emily\u2019s and Kathleen\u2019s footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a loud speaker in another language. You\u2019ve always been good with languages and dialects and you realize you\u2019re in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You take a good look at the giant woman who shrank you from in her hand, even with her fist closed. The woman looked like she was in her late 20s and had bright blood red hair. She wore a pair of blue sunglasses and had a tattoo of some sort over her left eye. She was also very fat, you'd say at least 400lbs with a bulging belly that made her pink tank top look painted on and a massive butt that looked as wide as she was tall and was covered in black pants. The giantess takes you to a corner where nobody could see either of you and opens her hand as she smiles down at the inch high shrunken man. \"Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum.\" She says with a giggle. You look at her and groan. \"Sorry,\" says the fat giantess. \"Couldn't resist.\" \"Why are you doing this to me?\" you ask. You then grunt because the giantess puts one of her fingers over your mouth and smirks as she wiggles her big butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh, uh,\" says the giant redhead. \"I'll tell you in due time. But first we have to get to our spot. The giantess reveals that she has several purple and polka-dotted carry-on bags and giggles as she lifts one up and unzips it. You look in worry and then the giant lady tilts her hand, causing you to slip and fall screaming into the bag. You land with a grunt on several shirts that looked too tight to fit on this giant lady and look up to see nothing but her smug face looking down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've fallen into her carry-on bag, the giantess zips you in and takes her luggage away as she hums to herself. You look around the mess of clothes and see that with the place zipped up, it's almost too dark to see. You can see several books the woman brought, all of which by big name authors as well as what looks like a rather large makeup kit. What you don't see is anything that could've been used to shrink you. You're guessing that she most likely wouldn't keep it in the same place she would keep a shrunken victim, if she even still had it on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel motion and hold on tight to one of the giantess's shirts as the carry-on bag you're on is placed with the others on a cart. You hear rolling and gulp before the luggage is put away in the cargo hold of the giant woman's plane. It isn't long before you hear an engine sound and the plane takes off. You've rode in planes before but always as a passenger. It was a scary thought that you were an inch tall and riding in a giant woman's suitcase. Speaking of which, that obese scarlet-haired giant was already in her seat (or rather <i>both</i> her seats given how large she was) and calmly listening to headphones as she is no doubt thinking on what she's going to do with you next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait in the bag with the giant woman's clothes, you begin to wonder to yourself \"This woman shrank me,\" you think. \"A total stranger, yet that big cow shrank me so small she could carry a dozen of me in her mouth. But why did she do it? Heck, how did <i>she</i> shrink me? Who is this giantess?\" You sit down on a novel that had to weigh as much as a phonebook and think of three possibilities on who this monstrous behemoth lady was and what she wanted with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this woman is a witch,\" you think to yourself. \"Maybe she's a sorceress, perhaps hundreds of years old, who shrank me with a powerful magic spell. Oh my. If she <i>is</i> a witch and she's <i>that</i> powerful, maybe I'm not the first of her victims. For all I know, she could have dozens of shrunken victims in her other suitcases.\" You shiver at that idea but then you come up with another possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But on the opposite end of the spectrum,\" you think. \"That soda I drank earlier tasted funny. Maybe that woman is a mad scientist who created some kind of strange formula meant to turn people like me into insects. Maybe she needed to make sure that it worked and used me as a guinea pig as a plot to take over the world. Oh, I hope that isn't the case.\" You kick back and suck your thumb just thinking about the red-haired giantess laughing as she stomped an entire city, dressed as a queen. \"That would be horrible,\" you say to yourself. \"I hope I'm not right about that theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a spark came to you. \"I did see that giantess wearing a bunch of jewelry. She could be rich. That's it. This giant woman who shrank me, could very well be a wealthy businesswoman. Maybe she runs a big company that just developed a shrinking ray and she chose me to test it out on! That's it. Maybe she's gone into the business of selling shrunken humans, developing shrinking technology for warfare or maybe she's simply planning to shrink all her employees to save on costs.\" You bite your nails. None of the possibilities of who this strange giantess was or how she shrank you sounded pleasant to you and you were afraid of what the giant fat lady was going to do to you when she arrived. You worry so much that you scream and pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you wake you, you hear that the plane has landed and then you gulp as the giant fat redhead lady was walking up to pick up her luggage with you inside. Unbeknownst to you, you were now in...</span></div></div>",

You quiver in fear as you are carried out of the airport to an uncertain fate. Suddenly, the ground changes angles and you are buried in the woman's plus-sized clothing. You quickly deduce you're being put into the trunk of a car when you hear a loud thud from above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the engine of the car roar as you leave the airport. After 20 minutes you feel the car come to a stop and hear the trunk open. Still trapped underneath the fat woman's clothing, you feel a jolt as you're carried out of what you assume is a taxi. After what seems like 10 minutes you feel a slight thud as the woman sets her bag down on a seemingly soft surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear the bag unzip, but your vision is still impaired thanks to being buried under the contents of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoo-hoo! Where are you little guy?\" the giantess says tauntingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay still, refusing to present yourself to her. The woman begins to dig through the bag, looking for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are!\" She says, scooping you up in her cubby hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman recklessly sits down on the bed. You can help but notice the nose the bed makes when she plops down. You swear the bed is about to break. The woman opens up her hand and you realize you're in a luxurious hotel room with an incredible view of the ocean. You almost forget you're a tiny captive of an obese giantess as you take in the beautiful view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Hawaii little guy!\" says the woman in a cheerful tone. \"If you're done looking at the view then perhaps we can do some proper introductions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words snap you back into reality and you remember that you're a tiny captive at the mercy of a woman with unclear intentions. You turn around to see the woman's billboard size face smiling at you as she holds you close to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Zoey, what's yours?\" the woman asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's hot breath overwhelm your senses with every word she utters. Still, figure that it's in your best interest to respond to her questions. You nervously tell her your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice name.\" Zoey responds. \"Now I'm sure you have many questions, like 'why did you shrink me?' for instance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It crossed my mind\" you say sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't stay in hotels like this due to charity, I am a wealthy businesswoman and you're going to help me with my latest business venture\" Zoey says winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" you ask, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a cup of coffee and a plate full of something, she walks out, distraught by the brightly lit combined living and dining where you have been and sits down at her dining room table to eat. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You start to run away but the woman blocks her path with her giant hand and it quickly wraps around your tiny body and hoists you into the air. The woman brings you to her face and playfully wiggles her finger in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\"What a feisty little man you are.

When she opened her hand again and you looked on in horror as you saw pull out chocolate syrup from the cupboard. For a moment, you thought about jumping off her hand for a quick death. Anything was better than beging digested alive. Unfortunately for you, Zoey was too fast and she plucked you off her palm, holding you by your head and slowly dipped you into the chocolate until all but your head was covered in sticky syrup. Then she lifted you up towards her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye little man, be sure to squirm all the way down to my stomach. I love when my victims struggle.\u201d She said with sadistic pleasure in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she stuck you into her mouth like a piece of hard candy.

The chocolate on your body was steadily washed away as saliva poured onto your helpless body. You began to claw at her tongue trying to get to the entrance of her mouth. Just by sheer luck you were pushed to within an inch of it. With all your might you begin to push your head between her lips. Your head sticks out between Zoey\u2019s lips and you struggle to get free. Does it work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then you hear the sound you\u2019ve been dreading: *gulp*. You begin your decent down to Zoey\u2019s stomach. The muscles in her esophagus almost squeeze the life out of you as you are slowly pushed down.

It\u2019s no use, before long you drop into Zoey\u2019s stomach with a loud splash. You bang your fists and kick against the walls of Zoey\u2019s stomach in a desperate hope of getting out. All it does is make Zoey laugh even more as she pats and rubs her giant belly in satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you begin to feel weak and are longer able to fight.

With a wet smack you slammed onto her massive tongue, you scrambled to escape her mouth but her lips slammed shut in front of you.

You don't know how long it was that Zoe's tongue toyed with you within her cavernous mouth for her pleasure, but it did eventually come to an end. The tongue slammed you against the top of the giantess's mouth and slid you into the waiting abyss of her throat. You were drawn into her throat, kneaded downwards by her muscles. After a journey that certainly felt much longer than it must have actually been you plopped out of her constricting throat and into her stomach.

A tiny man!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAnd so young too!

She must have caught him on her way back and vacation. She sometimes sells me little guys she shrinks when she goes on vacation.\u201d explains Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Today\u2019s my lucky day! I think I might want to buy him\u201d says the woman. \u201cWould you mind if I took him out of his jar to examine him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d replies Sarah. \u201cJust be careful with him. His type aren\u2019t common. Especially young ones.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart starts racing as the lady removes the lid and slowly tilts the jar. You slide down onto the palm of her hand. The woman sets down the jar and slowly lifts you up to her eyes. As she lifts you, you see she\u2019s wearing a dark blue tank top and a black skirt. She\u2019s wearing stylish, long, black boots, and she has above average size breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there cutie\u201d the woman says in a somewhat babying voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously tell her your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, don\u2019t be scared little guy\u201d she says in a soft tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then starts petting you with her index finger. You can\u2019t deny it feels nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just the cutest little thing!\u201d the woman says barely being able to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you see her lips pucker and before you can move out of the way the woman gives you a kiss. Her lips engulf your entire body and you gasp for breath as her soft lips press against your tiny body. Her lips move back and cover you in a layer of saliva. You are in a state of shock, the woman sees this and giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Mia, would you like to be my pet little man?\u201d she asks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are too shocked to really respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww\u201d Mia says with a fake frown. \u201cWell it\u2019s not like you have a choice\u201d she says smiling at you. \u201cYou\u2019re just too cute to pass up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia then turns her attention to Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take him!\u201d Mia excitedly announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll enjoy his new home.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has to\u201d Mia says giving you a playful poke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to take the jar with you free of charge?\u201d Sarah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia thinks for a moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You realize I\u2019m horror you\u2019re in someone\u2019s luggage. As your eyes adjust to the light again you see you are surrounded by various types of women\u2019s clothing. You look down to see yourself laying on top of a bra, one that looks like it belongs to a woman with large breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can really grasp the full gravity of the situation a giant hand with painted blue fingernails reaches into the luggage and scoops you up. You then look up to see the face of a giant woman staring right at you. She appeared to be in her early to mid twenties and had striaght long red hair. She was wearing a black tank top that exposed her breasts, tight jeans, and from what you see she was also wearing running shoes. She also was wearing a big silver bracelet on her left arm. As her big blue eyes studied you a smile came across her lips. <br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there little guy\u201d she said in a sweet voice<br>\r\nYou\u2019re still in too much of a state of shock to really respond. After all you just realized you spent god knows how long in this woman\u2019s bag and now you\u2019re in the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n\u201cAwwww, you\u2019re such a cutie!\u201d She exclaimed wiggling her finger in front of you. \u201cI\u2019m so happy I caught you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait\u201d You stammer \u201cwhat do you mean caught me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI shrunk you, silly\u201d she explains <br>\r\n\u201cI bought an experimental shrink ray on my way to the airport. I am on my way home from vacation and I saw you and I thought how great it would be to have a tiny guy like you all for myself.\u201d she ended with a light poke at your tiny body. <br>\r\n\u201cThe person who sold it to me also said that the victim would be knocked out for a little while so it gave me plenty of time to put you in my luggage and take you somewhere where I can look at you with being noticed\u201d she added <br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t go with you! I\u2019m in college and I have a family! I\u2019m flying home to see them!\u201d you protest <br>\r\n\u201cToo bad little one\u201d the woman says feigning empathy \u201cyou\u2019re mine now and you\u2019re just going to have to live with that. I\u2019ll take care of you I promise\u201d with that she lifts you up to her mouth and gives you a kiss. Your entire body is covered by her lips and you\u2019re covered in her saliva. She giggled and gently dried you off with her shirt.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d You say in a shaken tone.<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really decided yet, but don\u2019t worry. I have a nice long flight to think of something.\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly a loud speaker announced the woman\u2019s flight.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s us little guy, back into my bag you go\u201d she says in a sing songy voice<br>\r\nWith that she plucks you off her palm with her fingers, drops you in her bag and zips you up. <br>\r\nYou feel the bag lift up and begin shifting again as the woman hums to herself. As you lay on the soft bed made out of her clothes you think about the predicament you\u2019re in. You think that maybe everything will be fine, she seems like a nice woman (but obviously a little nuts) who wouldn\u2019t want to hurt you. You also worry what she could do to you since you\u2019re so small and at her mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman makes her way onto her plane and stuffs her bag with you in it into the overhead bin above her seat. As the plane takes off you ponder your options. The zipper is close enough to try and open and you could make an escape attempt. You then think that there\u2019s really nowhere to go on a plane 35,000 feet in the air. The clothes you are laying on are also very comfy and you\u2019re tired from not being able to sleep the night before and you could use a nap, but this could be your only chance to escape this woman\u2019s clutches.<br>\r\nWhat do you do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe you have always dreamed of being a big person like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubs her finger up and down your back.

Whether you were or you weren\u2019t in the past is by the by but people are big enough to live and move around independently and use people things without help from a big, giant woman.

The fact is you are going to be my pet. You can like it or not like it, you can accept it or not accept it and you can either obey me from the start or I can have fun training you to be obedient. But, whichever way, the outcome does not change. You are my pet from now on and you will be doing whatever I say. And frankly we will get on a lot better if you are positive about the experience. I don\u2019t want a pet who whines about how small they are and demands in vane to be set free. I want a pet who appreciates how cool it is to have a hot gigantic woman looking after them and keeping them safe. And I will get what I want in the end. It is just a case of how much you want to fight before you start to obey me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you say, little man, are you going to keep complaining or are you going to start enjoying being the prized pet of a gorgeous owner?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Leaving her purse unzipped, you look up at her as she unlocks the door and enters her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks in and sets you on the coffee table in the living room and reaches into her purse again with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm coming for you little one\" she says playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are quickly scooped up in her hand and brought to Sydney's giant face. You sit in her open palm looking around her home, you realize it's a really nice one room apartment in the heart of downtown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home!\" Sydney exclaims. \"Since I haven't had time to get you a proper bed, you will be sleeping in my purse for the time being. I figured it would be a good idea since you will be spending a lot of time in the there anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I will be spending a lot of time in there anyway?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be your pet carrier of course! You will be riding in my purse when I decide to take you places.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the same humiliating feeling you did before, now you really do feel like nothing but property. Sydney then starts snuggling you against her cheek again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just the cutest!\" she exclaims. \"I could just snuggle you all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your best to not show how good it feels to cuddled against her soft skin but you can't help but smile a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well little man, we've both had a long day. I think it's time to..\"</span></div></div>",

Where are they taking you? You kept repeating these questions to yourself over and over as you hear the plane take off. The bag your in slides a little as the planes gains altitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must be in the overhead compartment\u201d you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing that comes to your min as the plane reaches cruising altitude is whether or not you should try and escape. It\u2019s not exactly an easy task given that it\u2019s pitch black dark and you can\u2019t see any way out. Even if you\u2019re able to get out you\u2019ll still have to somehow get out of the overhead compartment that you\u2019re pretty sure the luggage is in.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The premise of the story is simple: While at an airport, you blank out and wake up after having shrunk to about an 1 inch tall. \"You\" are a male and in your twenties. The reason for you shrinking is unknown (unless explained in a thread). Feel free to let your imagination take you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's set up some ground rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No male interactions and no toilet (You can have a male bring a shrunken individual to a female, but keep the male interaction very brief, no more than a few sentences. Don\u2019t dwell on it.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Please make sure your post advances the story in some way, as opposed to short pointless posts like \"She smashed you, and you died.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Good grammar is preferable. Not to say, I'll hound you for having a slight mistake, but if there are so many misspelling or grammar, then it's unreadable. Also use punctuation. I don't want to sound like a perfectionist, but these things exist so that the reader can read it easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Use paragraphs breaks. This may seem like an odd rule, but I've seen too many posts in various Interactives write the whole thing as only long paragraph. It's incredibly hard to read as it is hard on the eyes. USE WHITE SPACE! It exists for a reason. Otherwise, readers have trouble following it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you have dialogue, try to make every new statement its own paragraph. That makes it easier to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Make sure to have at least 2 options for each post you make. In interactives the point is to have options, so don't force the reader to go a certain path too often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) I prefer humiliation, feet, vore, mouth play, crush, slave, and entrapment, but you don't have to follow my preferences. Make your posts your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise have fun! Don't get put off by the boring part of establishing rules: it's annoying but necessarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
