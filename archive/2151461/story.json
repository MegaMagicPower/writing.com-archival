She's dozens of years old, but appears as a teenager to other elves, who age at a very slow rate. Marion's older, less ticklish sister, Princess Priscilla, will be the future queen, so Princess Marion is free to live an easy life with no real responsibilities at all, so naturally her family loves to annoy her by tickling her. Princess Marion is very ticklish, especially on her long pointy ears, her tummy, and her small breasts (older sister Priscilla has bigger breasts and Marion is slightly jealous of them). Marion is tall, slender, and has long blonde hair. She typically wears a cute dress and a hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Melanie the Slave Girl<br>\r\nMelanie (often shortened to Mel) is a cute little elf slave. She is over 30 in years, but appears as a kid, thanks to the fact that elves age so slowly. Mel was sold into slavery by her mother to pay off a debt, although she still gets to visit her family sometimes. Mel's owners are an elf couple (Master Archie and Mistress Mia) skilled in magic who use her as a toy to entertain themselves. They cast spells on little Melanie to make her more ticklish or to conjure feathers and hands out of thin air. Melanie is useless for any kind of actual slave work, being a kid and all, so she mostly sits around the mansion until Master Archie or Mistress Mia come by to tickle or humiliate her for fun. Despite this, Melanie actually likes living with them because she came from a dirt-poor family and enjoys living n luxury, even if it means being tied up and tickled all the time. Melanie is short, with slightly tan skin and white hair. She is skinny to the point that she appears underfed. She tires easily and has no physical stamina at all. Melanie has been enchanted with an aura that makes her very, very ticklish all over her body, but her most sensitive spots are her ears, her armpits, and her sides. Melanie isn't allowed to wear much clothing, because more exposed skin means more body to tickle, so her typical outfit is nothing more than her slave collar, a pair of panties, and a training bra.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melanie was in the mansion drowsily reading a book about cabbage farming from Master Archie's bookshelf. Her collar was tied to a post on the wall so she couldn't run away while her owners were out (not like she'd want to) and her raggedy slave panties were slightly disheveled looking, riding up to give the little elf girl a wedgie. Outside, the tired grunting of slave workers on the plantation could be heard, strong elf men and women out in the sun, picking cotton and working the magical machines needed for piking out the seeds. Melanie let out a low yawn, scratched her butt, and picked at her wedgie, finding the panties just a tad too tight on her. She was about to close her eyes when her owners, Master Archie and Mistress Mia came in.<br>\r\n\"Oh! Good afternoon, Masters!\" Melanie said.<br>\r\nShe stood up to bow to her owners, but the leash on her collar got caught on a corner of the bookshelf and choked her. Melanie coughed and lost her balance. She fell flat on her face with a humiliating thud. Archie and Mia laughed at her.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that is classic. Good afternoon, Melanie. Guess what? I learned a new magic spell today! I'm going to test it out on you.\" Mistress Mia said.<br>\r\nMelanie gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of spell did Mia have in store for our young heroine?</span></div></div>",

It should feel like you were reading the whole book in a few seconds.\" Melanie's stared at her mistress. She was happy reading a book page by page. Having learned from the past she kept her mouth shut and waited. Archie picked two books from the bookshelf and handed them to the slave elf who could not help but ask  \"Two at the same time?\" \"Yes, to keep the balance. Stretch your arms away from your body and hold them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slave girl lamely raised her ams. Holding the books with arms stretched drained her strength but she knew that she simply had to comply. Mistress Mia held her hands level, fingers pointed towards the slave elf who stood in her training bra and panties, and took a deep breath. Archie was standing next to her, beaming. Melanie heard her mistress say. \"Litterae eo cerebrum, textum titillare\". Initially the little slave girl thought that the books were coming to life in her hands but maybe it was an imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the sudden sensation of the fabric of her training bra moving over her delicate pale skin was no imagination. \"Teeheee. Tehehehehe. That tickles.\" She shimmied but the feeling only got more intense. \"Now, what is the content of the book in your left hand. Can you say?\" Mistress Mia was impatient.<br>\r\nPoor Melanie did...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mia began chanting a spell.<br>\r\n\"Wha... what's going on?\" Melanie nervously said.<br>\r\nArchie only smirked and handed her a broomstick.<br>\r\n\"You'll need this, little one.\" He said.<br>\r\nA light began to glow and a circle of summoning appeared in the air. Out of the circle, a strange being came forth. It was a bird-like creature, covered in feathers with an orange and black spotted pattern, much like a hyena/bird hybrid. It had long spindly arms with long delicate fingers underneath its wings. Its head was a single huge eyeball with a large dog-like muzzle. It was a tickle elemental, a magical being made of pure tickle energy. It subsisted upon tickling and lived only to tickle. The elemental let out a soft giggle.<br>\r\n\"Eek! What is that thing?\" Melanie said, clutching her broomstick.<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter, kiddo. You have to fight it, and if you don't win you get thrown in the basement dungeon!\" Mia said, with an evil grin on her face.<br>\r\nThis meant Melanie probably wouldn't get fed dinner and be locked in some sort of tickle-torture device for hours on end if she didn't win. The skinny little elf girl was already hungry and the thought of missing dinner made her heart sink. There was no way she would let the Tickle Elemental win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie let out her fiercest battle cry (which was more like a girlish wail since she was such a weak and wimpy little girl) and charged forward. With all her strength, she bopped the Tickle Elemental on the head with her broomstick. The Tickle Elemental did not seem to feel any sort of pain at all. Melanie wouldn't give up easily, though. The little elf girl swung her broomstick again... only for it to be caught by the Tickle Elemental's long spindly arms!<br>\r\n\"Kekekekek!\" The Tickle Elemental said.<br>\r\nIt forcefully ripped the broomstick from Melanie's grip, leaving the little girl defenseless. Melanie had the heart of a warrior, and used her fists to punch at the Tickle Elemental's body. Unfortunately for her, she was a weak little kid and the Tickle Elemental had more strength in its arm than she had in her entire body. The Tickle Elemental slammed its chest against Melanie, knocking her down. It then stood its bird-like legs atop Melanie's  knees and held the little girl's hands down with its arms. Only now did Melanie realize how hopeless this fight was for her. Archie and Mia pointed and laughed at her devilishly. Melanie closed her eyes, trying to think of a way out, but coming up blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tickle Elemental moves its feathery wings toward Melanie's mostly exposed nubile young body.  Where does Melanie get tickled?</span></div></div>",

They have been found in seats, clothing, blankets, sheets, mattresses, and anything else cloth, but that Is not the only place they reside. Once they find a host they can hide in there eyelashes, hair, under their nails, even on their skin. They are virtually impossible to get rid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTickle mites love to tickle humans. They do this through excreting chemicals that excite the nervous system and either using their own feathery appendages of the microscopic fibers hanging off of clothing to tickle their victim senseless. They like to use the clothing though, as they find it more affective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they find a victim they wait till they have multiplied sufficiently and are ready to strike. Then they tighten the holes in the clothing item so it is virtually impossible to get off, so they have their tool and strike. They usually only tickle their victim for a few hours but are near impossible to get rid of once someone has them and typically tickle their victims 2-3 times a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople with tickle mites will not only experience tickling from the mites but the chemicals have a prolonged affect that makes them increasingly more ticklish the longer they have them, so they commonly become victims to ticklers around the world, but they get their karma as this is often how they are spread.</span></div></div>",

It consists of magnetic cuffs, a magnetic waistband, a pair of magnetic stocks with magnetic toe rings, an electronicly impulsed tight sweater, and electronically impulsed leggings for each player. Both players have to put on and sync up the devices before the game begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is also four buttons on the waistband, these can be used to choose categories, answer questions, and make wagers for DOUBLE TICKLE rounds. When a question is asked the first player buzzing in gets to answer. If they answer correctly the punishment is inflicted on their opponent, but if incorrect they endure the punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punishment is decided by what row the question is from, 1 through 5. The punishment is the duration of 15 seconds times the row squared and affects the row's amount of regions decided by the opponent. The regions are feet, legs, hips and butt, belly, and ribs and armpits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a player's punishment is decided the magnetic cuffs repel from each other, the stocks, and the waist band to leave the victim helpless, the stocks are constantly on but the toe rings stretch the feet and pull the toes apart. If the feet are to be tickled twenty appendages come out and attack the feet viciously including pinwheels, feathers, rotator brushes, and vibrators. If the legs are to be tickled, the leggings are manipulated to squeeze the inner thighs and above the knees while making lighter sensations as though someone is running their fingers across them or vibrating them all throughout the legs. If the hips and butt are chosen then the leggings knee the hipbone and cause lighter, feathery sensations in the but and privates. If the belly is chosen The sweater acts similarly to the leggings, combining the squeezing and pinching with light feathery sensations, but also contains a feathery, vibrating appendage that sticks into the bellybutton. If ribs and armpits are chosen the sweater kneads and pinches the ribs while using lighter sensations on the armpits and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked a DOUBLE TICKLE question, the players wager somewhere between one to five and then the loser gets the numbers in additions to the opponents numbers. This means that the loser can be tickled for up to twenty five minutes! Also if the number is greater than five the amount of areas is cannot account for that, so the opponent can bank those for future questions. Even though it is focused on tickle punishment, score is still kept in Jeopardy style and a winner is chosen. The winner is unlocked while the opponent is still locked in position for the greatest amount of time the winner had to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tickle Twister is basically the traditional Twister game, played in teams and with a twist. A team consists of two players. For each player on the Twister pad his/her team mate stands next to it, equipped with a long flexible rod with a stiff feather mounted on the top. With this he tickles a predetermined opponent until either the opponent or his team mate on the field fail to hold to their spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquipment:<br>\r\n- Twister pad and wheel<br>\r\n- For each player standing next to the pad, a long flexible rod with a stiff feather mounted on top; flexible that it does not hurt when he accidentally pokes with it. You can build it yourself from a branch of a bush, feather and tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n- Two players per team, one on the pad, the other is the Tickler<br>\r\n- If more than two teams play, it has to be agreed who tickles whom<br>\r\n- only one tickler per player on the pad<br>\r\n- Twister rules apply<br>\r\n- Clothing: T-Shirt or top with a wide opening at the armpits and shorts for ballpark game, not too tight on the thighs. Nothing else. T-Shirt has to hang loose.<br>\r\n- Tickling is allowed anywhere and anytime. Keep away from the eyes.<br>\r\n- Repeated poking with the rod or whipping or pushing leads to disqualification<br>\r\n- Both members of the team losing get a tickling punishment by all other players with the same equipment while doing a back bend or a bridge on the pad for one minute. <br>\r\n - Advanced players may adjust as they please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTips:<br>\r\n- tickle where the skin is stretched<br>\r\n- face excluding eyes makes concentrating much harder<br>\r\n- spots below clothes may be rewarding, depending on situation<br>\r\n- when in doubt go for ears, nose, hips or the inner thighs. Feet may work, depending on position.<br>\r\n- because of the flexibility of the rod you may need some practice before you get the feather moving they way you want it<br>\r\n- for the players on the pad focus on your task and endure it. Your problem.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanda's invitation for her Friday night sleepover included a list of required items to bring along. While some of them could be considered usual for such event with an eleven year old host, others were more peculiar. An old T-shirt for example and a certain type of shorts made some guests assume that they would do something like a dance performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host and her family including her older brother helped her prepare the house, food and games. They had agreed that the parents would visit the sick grandfather and would not return until Sunday, on the condition that her older brother and a girl from the neighborhood would keep an eye on the girls only event. James, who was sixteen, had to study for exams and would retire to the basement to have it quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnusual for Amanda she had spent more time in her room than usual. Her mother was proud of the girl working on her room decoration with a number of long branches and a flurry of feathers she had bought on a garage sale. Who sold feathers, but people did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the afternoon the guests arrived. Sarah and Letitia were the same age as Amanda while Lea was a year younger. Her neighbor Tory was twelve but still acted as silly as Lea did, most of the time. Amanda's mother had insisted to invite Curley, the very shy girl from next door who was ten. Nobody called her Juliet as was her proper name. Curley was more appropriate given her hair style, and because she accepted that name silently. Now all five guests were having juice and cake, talking a lot while munching. The door bell rung again. Kathy entered the house and waved hello to the girls. Kathy was the paid babysitter who would stay over night. James was occupied with his studies and had a girlfriend, so Kathy would not have to fend off a boy while keeping six girls under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they retired to Amanda's room upstairs Kathy stayed in the living room and took her e-reader. She did not notice that Amanda quietly came back and downstairs and opened the front door. Three pairs of feet on socks were silently traipsing up the stairs. It was not a girls only party any more. When Josh and Greg entered the room smiling some of the girls blushed. They had not known about this surprise until five minutes ago.</span></div></div>",

Make ice cubes from water and sink the stones before you put it into the freezer. Use lemonade or juice instead to add more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen frozen solid extract ice cubes and tie the line to the top of the rods. Make sure the ice cubes are hanging a few inches below the tip. Then proceed with the game. Tickle the person on the grid with the dangling ice cube. As the game progresses dripping cold water spices it up. You can let it drip into places you cannot get to directly with the cube...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTickling with a dangling ice cube is funny and safe because it is both a soft touch and cold, but it does not make frostbites on the skin. But beware. People playing Tickle Ice Cube Challenge might scream much louder compared to the feather version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor beginners, draw the ice cube with your rod over long stretches of bare skin. Legs and arms are easiest, the neck is a very good spot to soften a player. Once you have gotten more experience, make the ice cube swing to touch places the player assumed that were safe, like under the T-shirt if it hangs loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe players who have not read this instruction will only realise later in the game that they have signed up for more than they bargained. Once a player is tilted to his back with his hands resting behind him (her), the ice cube can be lowered into the cleavage. If the butt is low try dangling it below the hem of the shorts. At least the cold water will follow gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have used juice the winning team might be allowed to lick it from the skin of the losers...later in the evening.</span></div></div>",

The only initial difference between the Tickle Tights and any other pair of tights is they have toes. The victim will mysteriously find these tights in their own closet and feel the need to wear them as soon as they see them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the tights are put on, they cannot be taken off. They are charmed to stay on that persons body until death, at which point they will vanish and appear in a different closet. The effects of the tights do not actually tickle the victim but exponentially increase their ticklishness everywhere the tights are touching. Ticklishness doubles every hour. So, in the beginning the victim may just feel a bit more sensitive or stifle a giggle slipping on their shoes. But in three hours the ticklishness is noticeable for sure. They will have become eight times as ticklish and will be aware of the difference because this is the point where most people's feet brushing against anything, including the insides of their shoes will tickle them. In another hour they will not be able to brush anything against their legs without giggling, the only way to keep the sensations away is to keep their lower body motionless. In another hour they are 32x as ticklish and their own body's circulatory system will cause enough movement to tickle them and giggle slightly, and as soon as the victim twitches they find themselves in a chain reaction of hysteria. The tickling grows worse and worse until in three more hours the victim is 248x as ticklish and the air molecules themselves tickle them. By this point the victim is in and out of consciousness never able to get a word out. Usual by 17 hours when the victim is 131,072x as ticklish their brain is fried by ticklish sensations and they die, but maybe medical technology can find another way...</span></div></div>",
