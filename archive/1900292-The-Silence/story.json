            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alran was invisible, His feet didn't make a noise and his movements were soft but quick. Dressed in a dark grey cloak he covered the distance between the forest and the keeps walls. Black in this kind of mission was useless, He knew that the second he managed to get into the keep the shadow black cloaks the nocte Laminas wore on similar missions would show like white on the grey walls. He quickly reached the walls. He had been watching the walls for days, Looking for a weak link in the shifts of the guards. The guards were on there shifts for 6 hours, between that time was a 5 minute gap, leaving the walls without guards for 5 minutes. He had judged his first day of seven the height of the walls, 28 feet exactly, Very low compared to his past contracts. Alran waited....and waited....Finally the guard turned around and began walking away to go wake the other guard to take his post. When out of hearing range Alran drew his grappling hook from his cloak and spun it around before releasing it sending the steel hook soaring up into the air before gripping the castle wall. He gave it two tight tugs from two different positions to test it, and then in a flash he ran his way up the stone wall, pulling the rope as he went. In less than half a minute he reached the top and grabbed the ledge before pulling himself over. Grabbing the grapple he released it and threw it through the air into a bush, making sure it hit something light and not a rock which would surely attract the attention of the guards patrolling on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlran silently began moving across the wall, Slightly crouched over to make himself less likely to be spotted but keeping a steady speed. The castle was large, with a 28 foot wall surrounding it with 1 connection of the wall and the castle leading to the third floor. The castle had 4 towers and was in Alran's mind a large rectangular block, each corner having a tower. From the height of the castle and the amount of windows Alran guessed it had a total of 8 floors. He reached the bridge between the wall and the castle and just as he went to turn the corner he heard a <i>Screech!</i> from the rusted hinges on the large wooden door leading inside. Immediately pulled his cloak up and pushes his body against the wall. Blending in with the gray stone and the darkness of Night. \"Time for another boring Night on the watch\" said one of the guards walking by Alran. The guards wore red tunics, Chainmail, gauntlets and half helmets that Alran knew would supply no protection against him. He did not move a single inch as the guards passed, When they were at a safe distance he let his cloak drop and he continued across the bridge to the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a small glass bottle of grease from his pocket he pulled the cork out slowly and then began to drip the grease over the door hinges. Any noise could attract unwanted attention and this grease he had heated up in the embers of the fire he created would hopefully silence the old hinges. After finishing he smiled slightly before grabbing the door and very slowly began opening it. There was still a very slight screech but it was so silent he knew the guards 300 feet away wouldn't hear it. When the door was open just enough to allow him to squeeze through he quickly entered the castle and with the same speed closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlran scanned his environment. the hallways were dimly lit with only a few torches, one guard was sitting on the ground with his head down, from the audible snoring Alran could tell he had fallen asleep. Alran easily made his way down the hallways, up a staircase and down another hall. With only one floor left it was important he reached the top floor. Turning a corner however made his hopes of completing the contract was less likely. The entire hallway was guarded by Knights in Shining armor. Alran knew he could easily defeat them if he was in the open, But in a hallway he had a disadvantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he lost all hope he felt a cool breeze touch his face, slowly turning to the left he saw a window that had not been replaced yet and he smiled. Climbing out the window he looked down and guessed he was a good 7 stories above the ground, looking up he could see the next window not far away, ten feet he guessed. Jumping up he grabbed hold of a small ledge and pulled himself up before grabbing the window ledge and pulling himself inside through the open window. Falling forward he rolled forward to silence his landing and then proceeded down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlran looked down at the Lord sleeping in front of him. He had a bald and clean shaven head, he was overweight and slept in a bed covered in fine silk and fabrics. He was a short man, a typical bastard, He let the people in his fief starve and was one of the 20 Lords in Kalvara, the enemies. Thunder flashed through the window as Alran drew his dagger, The blade had a slight curve and was covered in ash to block the reflection of the steel. Alran heard the thunder 4 seconds later and he knew what time he would strike at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thunder flashed, he waited.....and with a swift motion he brought the dagger down, stabbing it through his chest and into his heart just as the thunder boomed so the quick gasp the Lord made would not be heard. By the next flash of thunder he was gone...the blood of the Lord now staining the bed a dark crimson and his eyes glazed over indicated his demise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marco laughed as he continued sprinting through the village with his two friends Thomas and Alex. Marco had short cut hair with blue eyes. He was dressed in casual clothing to not dirty the fine ones he wore in his fathers presence and he stood 5 feet 7 inches tall. His cloths were grey except for the foot wrappings and hand wrappings he wore which were brown. \"Catch up!, Your slower than a corpse!\" Marco shouted back at his friends while he ran backwards before turning around revealing a 5 foot stone wall and he smiled. Grabbing the top of the wall Marco kicked his legs up while he spun on his hands allowing him to kick his legs over the wall without losing his momentum. Alex and Thomas had been Marco's friends since Marco was adopted by Baron Kanashi, Marco's adopted father. Both Alex and Thomas were the sons of the Trainer Sir Drem. Sir Drem was in charge of training boys into Knights when they turned 18 in Windrock fief. Marco's father the Baron had always been good friends and Marco, Thomas and Alex had grown up together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp turn Marco began sprinting up the road back towards the Castle. The Windrock castle had 50 foot tall and 60 foot wide walls made out of snow stone. Snow stone was a white stone that was harder than normal and common stone and much heavier, it got its name because all the blocks were pure white. The castle itself, made out of the same stone had 20 floors with a total of 5 towers and a courtyard in the back. The castle leaned over the cliffs supply a great view of the Ocean and supplied great protection against a siege. On the Borders of the Fief as well were large 30 foot tall and 50 foot thick walls with towers to scout for any invading enemies. The Windrock castle had 2 tall towers on the sides with 2 similar sized ones near the center and finally a thick tall one shaped like a square in the center where the Baron and he himself lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco put his arms up an shouted \"WOO!\" from his victory, Close behind him followed Thomas and finally Alex who laughed. \"Alright alright stop prancing around like a woman\" said Thomas and Marco laughed. \"Well we're gonna train, want to come?\" asked Thomas and Marco shook his head. \"No, You go ahead though, Im off to speak with my father\" he replied and the two brothers nodded before running off and Marco turned around and began walking towards the main doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Marco decided to go see his father and check on how the fief was doing. Nearing his fathers door he could hear his father speaking to someone. Leaning close to the door with his ear he managed to hear what they were speaking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the contract went well?\" asked Baron Kanashi to Alran and the assassin nodded once. \"Is there anything else My Lord?\" asked the assassin, His voice sounding like that of a ghosts. The Baron knew that Alran had his vocal cords damaged as a boy from some incident but it was best to never ask a Assassin his past, you'll never get the info. \"No, that is all, I will send word to the king about your completion of the contract\" replied the Baron before Alran nodded and then without a noise moved across the room and opened the door revealing Marco crouched down and looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause before Alran handed Marco a piece of paper and with that continued walking. Marco looked at the letter and it simply said <i>Do not eavesdrop when it does not concern you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hello son\" said the Baron and Marco looked up from the note before walking into his fathers office. \"I was actually just wanting to talk to you\" said the Baron and Marco took a seat in one of the Oak chairs infront of his fathers Desk. \"Yes?\" he asked curiously. The Baron wore a bright green robe that was trimmed with gold and the collar was made out of a soft brown fur, He had long brown hair and a full grown brown beard. \"Now that you are 18 I would like you to search for your career, Tomorrow I want you to go to all the trades in the Fief and see what...draws you\" said the Baron and Marco nodded smiling. \"Alright father\" he said before exiting his office.</span></div></div>",

Today he would be looking at all the masters of the trades and there jobs, He had a good feeling about alot of them. First this morning was The head Chef of Castle Windrock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEEP THAT FIRE GOING BOY!!\" yelled Chef Hamkern at Marco who was now covered in ash for doing this for the past few hours. \"You want to be a chef?! How can you cook without a fire!! ha!\" shouted the chef, His face now red from the lack of oxygen from how much he had been shouting at Marco. Chef Hamkern wore a white jacket, white pants and a white hat along with an apron. He was an over weight man with curly red hair and a red mustache. In his hand he held a large wooden spoon that he was sturring a soup with and to his standards Marco wasn't heating the fire underneath it hot enough. \"THAT'S IT!!!\" screamed the angry chef, breaking the wooden spoon  by smashing it against the counter getting Marco's attention before the angry chef threw the handle of the spoon at Marco, Hitting him in the head. It didn't hurt but Marco began exiting the kitchen, His hands up in case the angry chef decided to throw the soup at him too. \"GET OUT OF MY KITCHEN!!\" he screamed and with that Marco was out the door taking the apron off. \"That didn't work out\" said Marco before sighing and heading over to his next skill master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Marco, The first thing you need to learn about fletching is patients\" said Mr Farkon, The master Fletcher of Windrock. \"Fletch me a arrow shaft from this chunk of wood\" said the Fletcher holding up a long thinner chunk of wood that was crooked but could easily be made into a straight and fine arrow in the right hands. Marco took the chunk of wood and the knife the Fletcher held out to him before sitting on a tree stump nearby and he began carving out the arrow shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later Marco was finished and just looking at it he knew he wasn't suppose to be a Fletcher for the arrow curved up at one point and then outward at another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the entire day Marco went through all the Skill Masters, He tried Horse keeping, Which almost got him kicked in the face by a horse, He tried Knight training but he could not keep up his shield well enough and he found himself too slow in the training armor, He had tried Politics but that didn't go well either. Now he sat in his bedroom thinking on what to do. He was to small to be a Knight, the armor slowed him down, Politics were boring, Fletching was nothing he would ever want to do for his life and caring for horses was....well he wanted to keep his teeth. Just at that moment there was a knock on the wooden door to his small room. He stood and opened the door revealing one of the servants who handed him a letter. After thanking her he closed the door and opened the letter to read what was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I noticed you were having trouble finding a career for your life today, If you have not found one please meet me at sunrise tomorrow in the forest on the left side of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Alran.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco kept his eyes on the note for a few moments before smiling at the idea and thought about it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without eating breakfast Marco had requested a Guard to wake him up in the Morning and now just as the sun was rising he was making his way into the small forest to the left of the Windrock castle. It was full of life with the leaves bright green. There were no paths made in the forest so Marco had to push his way through bushes, Lift up branches and keep the insects away. This morning he chose to wear a pair of grey trousers, a grey button shirt and a black vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking around a tree Marco saw Alran sitting on a rock looking into a fire that had a steel kettle hanging over it. Before Marco could say a word Alran had already began speaking. \"You made so much noise a deaf man could have heard you from a mile\" said Alran not looking down and Marco didn't say anything. \"Sit\" said Alran with his scratchy ghost voice and Marco seated himself behind the cloaked man. Alran had short cut black hair that was peppered with a little grey, His eyes were blue and looking at him Marco guessed he stood 5 feet 8 inches, an inch taller than Marco. He wore a shadow black cloak and from what Marco could see he wore tight black pants, a pair of black boots and what looked like a black shirt. Over his hands we wore a pair of gloves similar to gauntlets but black and had no steel on them, These also had some kind of material on the fingers and palms for some reason. Marco noted the many scars on Alran's face, with his usual grim looking expression it gave Alran a very intimidating face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sat in silence for a whole minute before the kettle was ready and Alran poured a green tinted liquid out into two cups, Marco guessed it was tea and when trying his first sip, he had guessed right. \"Do you know what I do....Marco?\" asked Alran and Marco turned his head to look at the assassin who was still staring at nothing in the fire. \"You kill people for a living\" said Marco and Alran shook his head. \"No, I gather information for the Kingdom, I protect the life of the King and I also kill those who pose as a risk to the safety and life of the Kingdom\" said Alran and Marco smiled. \"Meaning you kill people\" said Marco taking another sip of his tea. \"If you want to be a ignorant peasant, Yes\" said Alran and Marco thought for a moment. \"Give me an example of what you do\" said Marco curious if he would get an answer. \"I gathered the battle plans for the Battle of Vallen field from the enemy\" said Alran and Marco gawked at him. Vallen field was the most famous and talked about battle throughout the kingdom from the great war that happened 18 years ago. The Kalvara army had planned to attack from both the front and behind the Kingdoms army, which would have put the war in an entire different direction, However somehow the kingdom found out and used there plan against them, splitting the army up in 4 sections, The battle was a glorious victory. \"I do not just Kill people in cold blood, I only kill if my life is in jeopardy, The kingdoms safety or the life of someone innocent\" said Alran before finally turning his head slightly so his eyes met Marco's. \"Now I must ask you a Question that will determine your entire life\" said Alran and Marco looked at him curiously. \"Could you take a Life, If someone threatened the safety of the kingdom, Could you kill them without hesitation?\" asked Alran and Marco thought about it. \"Its hard for everyone to take a life the first time, But if my life and everyone in the kingdoms was in danger....I think I could\" said Marco and Alran nodded. \"I have a question\" said Marco and the assassin did not say another word, which Marco took as indication to continue. \"Why are you thinking of recruiting me?\" asked Marco and a slight smile formed on Alran's face. \"I've been watching you all your life\" said Alran and Marco looked at him curiously. \"I first noticed your possibility of joining my Organization when you were four, I came to talk with your father one day and I noticed you climbing a large pine, Do you remember? You climbed up to the very top, Most boys your age would have been scared, But no, You climbed up it  with amazing speed for a four year old\" he replied before sipping his tea. \"throughout your life I noticed your agility whenever I was in the castle, You began being able to find proper footholds and always knew the best route to take, that is why I have asked you to come here today\" said Alran and Marco thought about it. \"But I am not the strongest boy, I am not even that tall\" said Marco and Alran smiled. \"Strength is useless, agility and stealth is everything\" said Alran before looking at Marco. \"So Marco, Are you wanting to join The Nocte Laminas?, If you say yes, You will never be able to leave, This will be your life\" said Alran and Marco thought about it. \"Yes\" he finally said after thinking for half a minute and Alran nodded. \"You have till tonight to say your goodbyes and pack your personal things, Meet me in the Castle stables\" said Alran and Marco nodded before standing up. \"One more thing\" said Alran and Marco turned to look at him. \"What kind of weapon do you  prefer?\" asked Alran. \"Sword\" replied Marco before beginning to walk through the forest back to the castle.</span></div></div>",

His birth fathers ring, An accurately drawn picture of him and his adopted father and his adopted fathers prized Dagger he had given him a week and a half ago on his birthday. As he stood in the stables beside Alran who was tieing the equipment down he pulled it out of its sheath and looked at the beautiful blade. It was a gift from the king to his adopted father 25 years ago. Its blade had a slight curve to it and a mysterious purple tint to it. The hilt was black with purple wrapping for grip and in the pommel was a Large beautifully cut amethyst on both sides. His father had told him to keep it safe for it had been his most prized position, running his finger over the blade he could feel it was sharper than a razor and would cut through flesh like a hot knife through warm butter. He felt sadness in his heart that he was now leaving his home so he put the blade away in one of his bags safely. \"Alran\" said Marco and the assassin grunted for a reply for him to ask the question. \"Was it hard when you left your home to become an assassin?\" asked Marco and the Assassin nodded for a reply. Marco's horse in his eyes was a beautiful horse. It had a solid brown coat and a shadow black well kept mane. Alran's in Marco's mind reminded him of a villains horse. It had a shadow black coat with not a speck of another color with its mane shadow black as well and its eyes black. \"Is this the horse I will ride?\" asked Marco and Alran nodded. \"For now, When I get you registered as my Apprentice you will get a horse of the same color as mine\" replied Alran and Marco petted his horses neck. \"Whats your horses name?\" asked Marco and Alran rolled his eyes slightly a little annoyed by the constant questioning. \"Umbra\" replied Alran. \"Is it female?\" asked Marco and Alran sighed. \"Yes, Now, We are ready lets move out\" said Alran and Marco nodded before they pulled themselves ontop of the horses and began riding.</span></div></div>",

They were on there way to the Nocte Laminas' headquarters which Alran said was 4 days ride. As Marco got off his saddle Alran handed him a kettle and a large pot. \"Water\" said Alran and Marco looked at the kettle and pot for a second before grabbing them and looking down the hill at the sound of the stream. \"I'll make the fire, You get water for tea and for our dinner\" said Alran before walking over to Umbra and he pulled a hatchet out of a saddle bag. \"Ill be back in a few minutes, Call if you need me\" said Alran before walking off into the darkness and Marco walked down the small hill till he heard water lightly splash under his boots. Marco bent forward and filled the kettle as well as the pot for what ever they were making and by the time he turned around he saw small sparks flying down onto a pile of wood before a small flame started and Alran blew on it. By the time Marco made his way back up the Hill the fire was blazing and Alran had a metal bar hanging over the fire for the pot and kettle to hang from. Marco hung them and Alran collected dried beef and vegetables including a leek, a Carrot, Garlic and a potato. \"Mince the garlic and Slice the carrot please\" said Alran handing Marco a flat piece of wood to work on while he himself began cutting up the leek and potato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the water in the pot and kettle began boiling he added the tea leaves to the kettle and grabbed the now chopped garlic and carrot from Marco before adding them along with the leek and potato. Shortly afterwords he added the dried beef and some seasoning before putting a lid on it and Marco licked his lips. \"Whats a Leek?\" asked Marco and Alran smiled lightly. It was typical for boys born into privilege did not know many vegetables. \"A leek is similar to a onion, Except it is not as potent and adds a wonderful flavor to soup\" replied Alran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sipped tea for a while, neither of them bringing up a conversation till Marco was curious about something. \"When is my first assignment?\" asked Marco and Alran smiled. \"Not for a long time\" said Alran and Marco looked at him curiously. \"Why not?\" asked Marco and Alran stirred the soup. \"Because, Your untrained, And if I let you do that, you would be dead before the end of the month, Listen Marco, To do what I do is not easy, This isn't like being a knight where you just swing a sword and block with a shield. Many times when you get into a bad situation your heavily out numbered and there is no back up like if you were a knight, No fellow soldiers, You are all alone and I have almost died countless times, My work is dangerous and requires training, So when I think you are ready, I will take you on a contract, and you will deliver the blow\" said Alran and Marco thought about it before nodding. \"Understandable\" he said and Alran nodded. \"Is it true the Nocte Laminas' can turn invisible?\" asked Marco and Alran shook his head. \"Its a simple trick of the eye, I will show you tomorrow if I must, Now, Soup is ready, lets eat\" said Alran not looking away from the fire and Marco nodded before grabbing the soup ladle and the bowls.</span></div></div>",

Marco didn't hear a noise the whole time, it was as if he was alone in the forest the whole time and when he opened his eyes Alran was gone. The Forest was thick with bushes and tree's, Every direction he looked he couldn't see any indication of Alran's path. Marco began walking through bushes that he would have taken and kept his eyes open. Still not a noise, A lone crow cawed in the distance and the fire of there campsite still crackled. A very slight breeze was the only indication of Alran landing behind him before Marco felt the piece of wood slash across both the back of his knee's which caused him to collapse before the wood was slashed across his throat. \"If that were a real blade, You would now be crippled for life if you lived through your neck being slashed open\" said Alran before helping Marco up. \"How did you do that?\" asked Marco. \"Training, Its important\" said Alran before beginning to walk back to the camp fire and Marco followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 3 days Marco and Alran rode through the country side at a fast pace, stopping every 3 hours to let the horses rest. Marco had taken notice over the past few days how much faster Umbra was to his horse. On the second day Marco challenged Alran to a small 200 meter race and Alran had shot past him in no time. Marco had asked why his horse was so much faster that Night and Alran had told him that The Nocte Laminas' Horses were a breed faster than most battle horses so the Assassin could outrun a pursuit if necessary, Marco had also asked if a Nocte Laminas' horse had ever got stolen, He replied with a simple shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the two of them were only a few hours away and Marco was staring with a big grin on his face at the Royal castle. He had never been to the capital and now here finally he was amazed by the colossal palace. It was the tallest structure Marco had ever seen with 12 towers all white with snowstone with dark blue tiles covering all the roofs. The castle was protected by 4 sets of thick walls, The first and the last having a moat and tall watch towers were located on all of them. On all the towers hung the Kingdoms blue flag and over the larger walls hung tapestries. \"Welcome to the capital\" said Alran and Marco smiled. \"So where is the headquarters? in the castle?\" asked Marco and Alran smiled, The kind of smile that made Marco know he would regret asking that question.</span></div></div>",

It looked like it could barely fit a person inside and it looked old and unused. \"No\" said Alran before walking towards the Den and Marco followed. They had left there horses in the stables and had just walked through the forest for half an hour. \"Follow me inside\" said Alran gesturing with his arm before getting onto his hands and knee's and climbing inside. \"is he insane?\" whispered Marco before Alran said \"I heard that\" and Marco cursed silently before crawling in after Alran. Marco had trouble getting into the den and 4 points thought he was stuck. It was a small dark tunnel that curved down deeper into the ground. As they moved down the tunnel it began getting warmer and warmer till the tunnel widened allowing Alran to sit up and jump down. Now that Alran was out of the way Marco could see torches set up. when he exited the tunnel he looked at the now much larger room. The floors were made up of hard dirt along with the walls. Wooden supporters were across the walls and roof to keep it from collapsing and infront of them stood 2 people dressed similar to Alran. \"Welcome home brother\" said the two assassins infront of Alran. One was male and the other female, other than that Marco could not tell what there features were. \"thank you Brother and Sister\" said Alran in reply before the 3 sets of eyes were on Marco. \"This a new Apprentice?\" asked the female and Alran nodded. \"His name is Marco\" said Alran and Marco put his hand out to shake there hands but they didn't even look at it, Very slowly he lowered his hand. \"We will alert Gaius and bring him his new clothing\" the male said and Alran nodded before leading Marco past them and to a latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later Marco was dressed in a Shadow black cloak like his Master and the two of them were seated inside a dimly lit room. The walls, again were made out of dirt and the only furnishing were 2 beds, a small table with 2 chairs and a stool, That had no meaning of being there other than being a stool. Alran sat at the table with a Quill in his hand while he wrote a letter or note, Marco didn't know. The cloak Marco wore was made out of a tough fabric, Marco didn't know what kind but it was light and didn't get in his way often. There was a string inside to keep the cloak closed and a string around the neck to keep it on, Both were tight and Marco was ready for Training. \"When do we start?\" asked Marco. \"Tomorrow\" said Alran and Marco rolled his eyes disappointed. \"We sure take a sweet diddly time eh?\" he asked and Alran nodded. \"Slow and steady wins the race, rushed and overly focused gets a arrow in the side of the head\" said Alran continuing to write the letter.</span></div></div>",

This sword however was different than the normal Longsword that knights in the Kingdom and all other kinds of soldiers had. This sword was thin and shorter with a curved blade in a black sheath. \"What kind of Sword is this?\" asked Marco. \"That, Is a Katana, it is a sword from the eastern lands from a island called japan, In some situations I have cut a warriors sword in half\" said Alran and Marco looked at him surprised. \"Your Joking right?\" asked Marco and Alran shook his head before taking Marco's sword from him and setting it to the side. The Training area of the underground hideout was a large circle with arrow targets on one side and training dummies on another wearing full suits of armor. Alran handed Marco another sword exactly like the previous one except this one had a worn out sheath and a worn out grip. Pulling the sword out he also saw the tip had been blunted and the blade was duller than a butter knife. \"why not use wooden swords?\" asked Marco. \"Wooden swords are fake and useless, There balance is not the same and there weight is completely different\" replied Alran before with a swift motion the sheath off his training Katana soared across the room and hit a dummy in the head. \"Now, We will be hitting each other will full force as if in a real battle, before we get to sparring I am going to show you a few simple techniques\" said Alran and Marco nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 4 hours Marco was taught simple sword slashes, blocks and even counter attacks. As Marco learned them Alran began teaching him proper balance and  what to do in certain scenarios. After the first 4 hours Marco was exhausted and was now looking over his actual sword. His head still red and covered in sweat. The blade shone magnificently, The balance of the weapon was amazing and the sharpness made the hair on the back of his neck stand up from the images that flooded his mind from what a sword like this could do. Alran handed Marco a cup of water and Marco smiled before thanking him and taking a drink. \"Alran, How long will you train me before I am a full member of the Nocte Laminas?, Like you\" asked Marco facing his Master. \"2 years, maybe 3, I will take you out on a contract in a year, In a years time you will take the Oath and be part of the kings army, Now, Enough Questions, we must continue training\" said Alran and Marco Nodded.</span></div></div>",

Marco rode his horse Fumus while Alran rode Umbra through the Night. It had been a year since Marco joined the Nocte Laminas, His first week there he had learned that Nocte Laminas meant Night Blade in Latin and he had learned the history. Alran had taught him well. Every day for 4 hours Alran had taught Marco how to wield a sword with stunning skill, The rest of the day usually was either hand to hand combat, Stealth, Throwing weapons or Bow practice. Marco had learned how to shoot through a knights helmet slit to kill him by sending an arrow through the eye and he had learned how to throw knives, axes and metallic stars with deadly accuracy. He had learned to not ask so many questions and usually there conversations were short unless it was important. \"What kind of tracks?\" asked Alran Quizzing Marco by pointing at a pair of animal tracks in the mud. \"Wolf\" replied Marco. \"What else?\" asked Alran. \"Rabbit, Only passed this way probably 2 minutes ago, The tracks haven't filled with water yet\" said Marco and Alran nodded approvingly before thinking of another quiz. \"Where would the best location to hide from a enemy scout be in this weather?\" asked Alran and Marco pointed upwards. \"Tree's, Knights and soldiers rarely check them, enemies usually cannot climb a tree in this weather\" replied Marco before Alran nudged him. \"And?\" asked Alran. \"You'd hide the horse safely behind thick forest like a large bush, Due to the black coat it would be very hard for the untrained eye to spot the horse\" replied Marco and Alran nodded. \"And tell me, Why is this weather the best for an assassination?\" asked Alran. \"If a enemy guard or soldier discovers you, You can disappear and slit there throat from behind\" said Marco and Alran nodded, a small smile spreading across his face. \"If your hiding in the shadows and you think someone see's you what do you do?\" asked Alran. \"You do not move, keep your cloak hiding you and remain perfectly still, Usually guards don't actually see the person till they move, They may call out that they see you and to surrender but in Reality they cannot\" replied Marco and Alran nodded. \"And why is a throwing knife better than a bow sometimes?\" asked Alran. \"Bows make Noise, knives don't\" replied Marco smiling and Alran smiled. \"Good\" said Alran satisfied with his apprentices replies.</span></div></div>",

Marco lightly stroke his horses muzzle before taking the pot from the saddle and the kettle and walking through the forest a couple hundred feet before walking down a small hill to fill the kettle and pot in the rapidly flowing river. It had become the duo's routine, Marco filled the kettle and cooking pot while Alran set up makeshift seats and made the fire. Marco was wet and tired, He could tell Alran was even though he always did a very good job at hiding it. When Marco returned to the horses the fire was rapidly growing and Alran had already began chopping up the vegetables they had bought from farmers in the previous town and also managed to buy some from the castle kitchen. \"Whats that?\" asked Marco as he added the vegetables into the now boiling water, noticing a scroll in Alran's hands. \"A contract\" replied his Master and Marco looked at it curiously. \"For who?\" asked Marco. \"Sir Voldesvier of the Kalvara Fief Maliak\" replied Alran not looking at his apprentice. \"What has he done?\" asked Marco. \"He tortures Apricum soldiers and assassins if captured\" replied Alran and Marco thought it through. Apricum Kingdom was the kingdom the Nocte Laminas' belonged to, Marco's father controlled the Apricum fief Windrock and Marco throughout his training had learned what Apricum meant, Sunny Place. \"Would you like to come or stay at the camp?\" asked Alran and Marco smiled, Finally his master had asked the question. \"Yes, Ill join you\" said Marco and Alran nodded a small smile on his face before continuing to read and Marco stirred the soup.</span></div></div>",

We have to do it messy and infront of the citizens, The reason being we have to send a message to the Kalvara kingdom that they need to keep there spies out of our land\" explained Alran and Marco nodded. \"Any idea's how we will do it?\" asked Marco and Alran nodded. \"I will find a spot in high ground with a bow while you make your approach to him through the crowd, anyone who gets in your way I will kill, But before I plan that out I need to know, are you ready to take a life?\" asked Alran and Marco nodded before Alran shook his head. \"think it through\" he said firmly and Marco thought for a few minutes. Could he truly take a life? after a few minutes he nodded and Alran nodded back. \"If you hesitate, you will die, Do not fail me\" said Alran before beginning to pack up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEHOLD!, These thieves my good people!!\" yelled Sir Voldesvier to the crowd of peasants infront of him. Sir Voldesvier wore shadow black armor that was trimmed with green. He wore a half helmet allowing the peasants to see his face which was covered in scars from the great war. He was a cruel man who last week had executed 4 innocent men who hadn't cooked his meal to the right temperature. He was a giant of a man, standing 6 feet 8 inches tall, He had long grey hair with a short grey beard, Though old, He was as fit as a horse, In his left hand he held a giant greatsword, which he today planned to execute the three thieves infront of him. \"We are innocent!\" yelled one of the men infront of Sir voldesvier before being decapitated in a glint of steel quickly sending his head flying into the screaming crowd. \"Thats what they all!...\" began Sir Voldesvier before noticing a young man in a black cloak making his way through the crowd of peasants. sir Voldesvier recognized that cloak. \"ASSASSIN!, Kill it!!\" yelled Sir Voldesvier pointing with his left hand and the guards charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco began sprinting through the crowd before running up the stairs just as the first guard began bringing his arm up to swing at him. Marco didn't even try blocking because an arrow zipped through the air and pierced through his armor and into his heart, the same happened to two other guards. Now 3 feet from Sir Voldesvier Marco quickly drew his dagger from his belt before diving through the air with it raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few seconds went in slow motion for Marco. Sir Voldesvier began bringing his sword in a swing to strike Marco down before he delivered the killing blow but Marco was to fast. Marco thrusted his dagger with all his force deep under Sir Voldesvier's helmet, Stabbing it through his neck and having it come out the back. The two of them collapsed to the ground and with a loud thud Lord Voldesvier was dead. Marco breathed deeply and there was an eerie silence from all the peasants before Marco heard a sad little girls voice cry out \"Daddy!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco turned his head to see a little girl, looking only 8 with tears rolling down her cheeks. Marco looked quickly back at the now dead Lord who was now clearly dead before 2 arrows zipped over his head. \"ASSASSIN!!\" yelled the guard before an arrow zipped through the air and found the soldiers throat. \"GET OUT OF THERE!\" yelled Alran from the wall and Marco began sprinting across the stage before leaping off and landing on the ground. Marco sprinted quickly to the wall just as another arrow zipped by him. Marco reached the wall and climbed up a wooden latter for guards before reaching the top and jumping off the wall. They had planned this earlier and with a soft landing Marco landed in the pile of hay before standing up and climbing up ontop of Fumus just as Alran got ontop of Umbra and the two of them began riding.</span></div></div>",

For the next hour and a half Marco talked with his two friends. Both of them telling him about there stories from training and telling him about the history they were taught. Marco also told them about him and Alran's teachings but everything about the Nocte Laminas was Classified and a assassin or apprentice like him would be executed by other Assassins for babbling there mouth, Alran had told him that countless times in the past year with great caution. \"He sounds sort of like an ass\" said Thomas before the three of them heard someone clear there throat behind them, Turning there heads and back the three of them saw Alran standing there, his cloaks hood hiding his face to most of the crowd. \"Uh...well....uh....\" is all Thomas could say his cheeks red with embarrassment before sighing. \"Forgive me Alran\" said Thomas and Alran shook his head. \"The first thing about Knighthood young Thomas, Is to always be respectful, You have just broken that, So no, I will not forgive you for your rudeness, Now, The baron calls the two of you to meet with your father for the feast and I must speak to my apprentice before us too join him for the feast\" said Alran and when the two brothers just sat there staring at him he growled. \"NOW!\" he shouted, his damaged vocal cords making his voice sound even more intimidating and the two brothers in a flash were gone. \"Marco\" said Alran while he rubbed his throat which now ached slightly from the shout. \"Yes Master?\" asked Marco as Alran took a seat in the chair closest to Marco. \"During the feast please do not speak unless spoken too, I know that last year you were the Baron's son and you still are, However you are no longer part of a Nobility family, You are a assassin for the King and for the Nocte Laminas, Therefor, to be formal and not rude please do not start a conversation. I remember last year you could not shut up, However if your father or someone asks you a question, feel free to have a conversation\" said Alran and Marco nodded. \"Alright Master\" said Marco and a small smile showed on Alran's face. \"excellent, Now, I am hungry, i believe you are, So let us go to the castle\" said Alran and Marco nodded before the two made there way towards the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alran did you really have to....make my friend feel bad?\" asked Marco and Alran nodded. \"Marco I'm going to tell you a very important lesson, The only kind of person who talks behind someones back like that is a coward, Nothing more, Nothing less\" said Alran and Marco thought about it. \"That may be hard considering he is your friend, How would you feel if I told the Baron you wet the bed at night?\" asked Alran and Marco gave him a glare. \"I DON'T!\" shouted Marco and Alran had a small smile on his face. \"I know that, But would you lose respect for me?, and would you not appreciate that comment?\" asked Alran and Marco thought before nodding, \"I would lose respect and feel betrayed\" said Marco and Alran nodded. \"Exactly, A man who talks behind others backs is not a man at all, Just a mere child, remember that\" said Alran and Marco nodded.</span></div></div>",

These included the Nobility and the skill masters in the fief along with the highest respected knights in the fiefs and there families or apprentices. Marco and Alran had great seats, they sat on the end of the table on the right side of the baron with Marco directly beside him. \"Hahaha! and the skunk sprayed him in the face?!\" asked Baron Kanashi listening to a Joke Sir Drem was telling and everyone at the table found it humorous except Alran. He was beyond this kind of humor now. After years of training and contracts Alran hadn't laughed in 6 years, He found nothing very funny anymore, it was either idiotic, Boring or long. He found the joke a little entertaining but he did not even smile at it, However his apprentice like everyone else in the room was red faced from laughter and at first he felt a little embarrassed that his advice had simply melted away but now that he thought about it he realized that if he was Marco's age again he would most likely be streaming tears of laughter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Joke was finished Marco finished laughing with everyone else and wiped his eyes before looking at his master who wasn't even looking at him, he looked just as grim as before the joke and he wasn't even smiling. \"So Marco how has your new career been coming?\" asked the Baron and Marco smiled. \"Excellent father, Alran is a excellent teacher\" replied Marco smiling and the Baron nodded smiling \"Good, I am glad your happy\" he said before the servants began bringing in the ale and the main coarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy dark everyone but Marco and Alran were drunk and full and now the conversation around the table was no longer funny, it was downright mean. Alran had strictly told Marco that he was only allowed one glass of wine and for the rest of the night it would only be fruit juice and water. \"Oh yeah? Yeah? Fuck you too!\" yelled the Baron at Sir Drem and Sir Drem retaliated by throwing a half full tankard across the room, veering way off and almost hitting Alran but he caught it and lightly set it down on the table. \"God whats wrong with them?\" asked Marco and Alran sighed. \"You don't remember the previous years because you, yourself were always drunk, its part of the feast, they eat, have a good time then get angry at each other while there nothing but babbling drunk idiots and make up for it over hunting in the morning\" replied Alran and Marco thought about it and it made sense. \"How long are we here for?\" asked Marco. \"When The Baron goes to his room\" replied Alran before  the two ducked again as a club sized bone flew over there heads. \"Enjoying the feast Marco?\" asked the Baron swaying in his seat from the amount of alcohol he had consumed. \"Yes\" replied Marco before the Baron smiled and patted his back. \"Thats great, I should tell you, Since this is such a great day and everyones......uh....being honest....that whole story about your father....is a lie....We told you that to hide the fact that your real father is...\" began the Baron before a small red cloud was spray in the barons face and then a small pouch was thrown through the air all the way across the room dropping the dust down onto everyone. In a second everyone collapsed down onto the ground unconscious and snoring loudly. \"We are leaving\" said Alran firmly standing up and putting a note in the Baron's pocket before at a steady pace exiting the room with his apprentice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was he about to say?....Wait....YOU TWO HAVE LIED HAVEN'T YOU!?!\" yelled Marco before climbing up ontop of Fumus and Alran didn't answer. \"Tell me!!\" yelled Marco and Alran lightly kicked his heels causing Umbra to began galloping and Marco followed. \"What happened to my Father?!?\" asked Marco now furious. \"I can't tell you that\" said Alran and Marco growled. \"Bull shit!, I have a right to know!, As you have said, MASTER! Hiding information that someone has a right to know to is the same as theft!!, Now tell me!!, Please!!\" yelled Marco, The two now outside the town but it was clearly in sight still. Alran slowed Alran before climbing off and Marco did the same before Alran put his hands behind his back and looked up at the sky thinking. \"Son of a bitch\" he whispered, The baron had ruined everything he had spent the last 19 years hiding, But it had to come out some time. \"Marco.....Your fathers still alive\" said Alran and Marco stood there shocked. \"HE IS?!?! where?!!\" asked Marco in shock and full of joy. \"Who is he? Can I meet him? or?\" asked Marco and Alran shushed him by clearing his throat. \"Marco......This will be hard to believe and hard to take but......\" said Alran and Marco waited not knowing what to expect and Alran sighed. \"Marco let me tell you a story\" said Alran sitting down on a rock and Marco sat on one was well. \"23 years ago there were 2 assassins, They loved each other very much, 19 years ago they had a child together, After the mother had given birth both of them had gone on a contract....She was killed and the father was injured, He had failed her....\" said Alran and for once Marco could see tears in Alran's eyes and one even went down his cheek. \"Heartbroken the assassin, now with a baby to look after looked at his life and the career, the secrecy and the risk that one day all those close to him could die, And wanted that boy to have a better life, if there paths crossed and his son wanted to become an assassin he would train him, If not he would always watch over his boy, No matter what, So the assassin gave his only son to someone he knew, someone he liked who could look after his son and give him a full education and full range to opportunity.....And so that one day, The little boy wouldn't receive a letter in the Nocte Laminas Headquarters telling him his father had been killed like he, himself had received as a boy\" said Alran and Marco felt his heart ache from the story, With that he asked the next question. \"what are you saying?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlran looked at his Apprentice for a full 15 seconds in silence before saying: \"Marco, Your father didn't die in the war, He's been alive this whole time......Marco Kanashi....I am your father\" said Alran silently and Marco stared at him with shock and surprise.</span></div></div>",

Both Umbra and Fumus neighed confused with what was going on with there masters and the two assassins ignored them. \"I am sorry...\" apologized Alran but he was interrupted. \"Bull shit!!, All my life I could have been taught your ways, you and me could have done things together, But No!, You just sold me away!\" yelled Marco and that crossed the line from Alran. \"YOU THINK I DID NOT WANT YOU?!?!, I loved you!!, You were my only son god dammit!, I gave you to the Baron so one day Gaius didn't give you a letter telling you I was killed by a Kalvara soldier!!, FUCK!!, Marco I love you!, I gave you away because I LOVED YOU!!\" yelled Alran, hurting his vocal cords in the process. \"Well you could have maybe fucking told me when I became your damned apprentice!!, The past year I've viewed you as my Teacher and my master!!, You and me could have....I don't know!, Fished or some crap like that!!\" yelled Marco and Alran nodded. \"For that I am sorry....I really am, I have always feared you and I would bond and then I would be killed\" said Alran and Marco rolled his eyes. \"I would rather know you were my father, and had bonded with you, as father and son than never know you were my blood father\" said Marco before Alran stood up. \"I am sorry, We must go now, And report to the king\" said Alran and Marco didn't reply just began walking to Fumus. \"We will discuss this later\" said Alran and Marco gave a small nod.</span></div></div>",

She had skin as white as snow with reddish pink eyes and snow white hair. She wasn't very tall the king noticed, She only stood about 5 ft 7 while the king himself stood 6 ft 5. Her hair was long and straight and on her face he could see a Horrible scar that had ruined her beauty whenever she had gotten it. On her back was a deadly longbow with a quiver full of arrows, he saw no other weapons on her but he guessed she had some in her cloak. \"ex-Nocte Laminas\" replied the woman, Her voice cold as ice and as sharp as a razor. The king normally would have chopped her head off for that but since she might be able to assist him he could possibly finally crush the Apricum forces. \"what have you come here for?\" asked the King and the woman smiled before pulling out a folded up piece of paper and holding it out to the king. Taking the paper the king unfolded it and saw a drawn map. \"What the hell is this?\" asked the King and the woman smiled. \"those, are all the unguarded places in the Kingdom, They are not guarded because they are hidden, No one would think to go that way so they never bothered\" replied the woman and the king felt a grin forming on his face. \"what do you want for this?\" he asked. \"I wish to join you, However, I will work alone and hunt down any of the Nocte Laminas that enter your land\" replied the woman and the king thought about it. \"Fine, deal\" said the king and the woman nodded before smiling. \"I'll be in touch\" she said before turning around and walking away.</span></div></div>",

She was stunning! to Marco. She had long black hair that hung on both sides of her face. Her hair was well kept, perfectly straight and clean, Her face was beautiful with bright blue eyes, she stood about 5 feet 8 inches and wore the Nocte Laminas cloak like Marco and the two teachers. However, Looking at her Marco noticed that she did not have a sword and instead had a powerful deadly long bow strung over her right shoulder with a quiver on her back, Marco guessed that was her most skilled weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 Hours had passed and Now, with the two teachers removing there pots and cooking equipment it was up to the two apprentices to go and hunt something since neither of the assassins had any food Left. According to Alice's teacher there was something extremely important they needed to talk about and while the apprentices were busy hunting they were going to discuss it. \"So....Has Alran told you?\" asked Alice, It had been the first thing she had said to him so far, Her voice was kind and soft. \"I found out\" said Marco before Alice put her arm up to quiet him since he had spoken a bit to loud. \"How did you know?\" asked Marco quietly this time. \"My teacher told me, ssssh\" she said keeping him quiet before She slowly began moving forward. In a blur Alice moved her already loaded longbow into position and drew the bowstring back in a blink of an eye before releasing the arrow causing a loud \"THWAP!!\" to echo through the woods. The small rabbit that was bathing in the sun perked its ears up but before it could even move its eye the arrow stabbed into the small creature ripping it off the rock and pinning the small creature to a thick maple tree. \"WOW!, I didn't even see it\" said Marco and Alice smiled at at him. \"It was 60 meters away, its kind of hard to without the right eyes\" she said before walking forward and grabbing the arrow and pulling it out with care, making sure to not deform the shaft or tip. \"Aw he was cute...\" said Alice looking at the rabbit feeling a little guilty but shrugged, He was now there dinner, And he sure looked good.</span></div></div>",

He was riding towards the Kalvara kingdom to assassinate there lead commander, hoping to slow down the Kalvara army from Marching on Apricum. What Josiah did not know was a figure crouched down in the shadows looking at the large wooden spike they had set up earlier all across the field, Knowing the Nocte Laminas would send someone this way eventually. As Josiah rode Chaus they passed a large wooden spike sticking out of the ground and he came to full attention what was going on. A second to late he pull back on Chaus' reins but a spike at already began stabbing into Chaus. Josiah was thrown forward through the air with Lix running towards him with a arrow already in full draw ready for release. Chaus neighed twice before falling limp from his injuries. Josiah stood up just in time to see Lix with her drawn bow and with that he dove behind his fallen horses impaled corpse allowing his old friends corpse to take the arrow. \"Lix you Traitor!!\" yelled Josiah and he heard Lix laugh. \"Traitor?!? The Kalvara greatly outnumber Apricum, They have much more engines of war than us!!, There land is bigger and there population is 6 times ours!!\" yelled Lix back, keeping another arrow ready for her to pull the string back. The grass was 3 feet high, Making her visibility of Josiah low but she knew his techniques. \"Its not about the Odds!, Its about whats right!, The Kalvara enslave people!, You took an Oath!!\" yelled Josiah pulling out a throwing knife, His most accurate weapon. \"The Oath!, doesn't mean shit!!\" yelled Lix back to Josiah before He dove out of his cover and in mid air threw his knife. But he was to late as a Arrow pierced his chest and he collapsed like a bag of bricks instead of rolling onto his feel which he normally would have done. The knife missed Lix's neck by 3 inches, Cutting a strand of hair off but otherwise not effecting her. Lix smiled, Obviously the winner of this fight, She put another arrow to the bow string ready just encase Josiah tried another trick. She approached the gasping Josiah, An arrow brutally showing its tip out of his back. From the blood he constantly coughed up Lix guessed her arrow had punctured his lung, He would die within the next few minutes. \"b....\" Josiah tried saying his last word and Lix went on one knee and leaned closer. \"Whats that? I can't hear you\" said Lix before Josiah spat a mouth full of blood all over her face. \"BITCH!!\" screamed Josiah choking on his own blood. Josiah's blood, Now painting Lix's albino face hid her growing rage before she drew a hatchet from her cloak. \"aaaaahh!!!\" screamed Lix before burying the blade deep into Josiah's skull, ending him.</span></div></div>",

He had been assigned to the North eastern front at one of the few places the Nocte Laminas said the Kalvara would attack and here they were infront of his very eyes. There was about 700 to a thousand all wearing shining armor with black tunics that had the Kalvara coat of arms on the chest. Each step they took was in sync causing a thunder of noise to echo across the field every step. \"STEADY MEN!\" yelled Commander Mathus one of the Generals that would be leading the Charge today. Thomas' heart was racing rapidly from the tension of a thousand enemy soldiers marching, It was equal numbers but still very intimidating. General Mathus drew his longsword and pointed it at the Kalvara army only 500 yards away now. \"For the King, The Royal Family and the Citizens of Apricum, CHARGE!!!\" yelled General Mathus before all the knights drew there long swords and charged full speed towards the Kalvara army releasing Battle cries while the Kalvara did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the two armies clashed Chaos was unleashed in a glitter of a hundred blades and the blood from soldiers. Thomas dove through the air with the rest of the front line colliding in mid air with a Kalvara soldier who did the same. The mans momentum and his weight overpowered Thomas' causing the young knight to be forced to the ground and landing on his back. The Kalvara Soldier had reflex's like a cat and already had a dagger in his hand to stab Thomas but before he could bring the blade down Thomas brought his shield up with all his might and smashed the steel rim into the mans helmet stunning him. Seeing his only window Thomas threw the man off him and quickly jumped on the man before pulling open his face guard on the mans helmet and beginning to hammer his gauntlet covered fist into the mans face. The force of the steel and Thomas' strength was like a warhammer, Within seconds the man was either unconscious or dead, Thomas did not have time to confirm but he had managed to knock most of the mans teeth out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly pushing himself up onto his feet Thomas grabbed a War axe off the ground and charged towards another Kalvara Soldier. Blood painted the field floor, The parts without blood quickly was defiled from a sword. Pieces of armor ripped off of there owners scattered the ground along with a few fingers, Arms and heads. Thomas Quickly side jumped to the left causing the mans slow but powerful strike with his battleaxe to smash into the ground and Thomas used this opportunity to bring his war-axe down on the back of the mans neck severing the brain stem and killing him instantly. Unknown to Thomas another Kalvara soldier ran up behind Thomas and brought his warhammer down on Thomas' left shoulder, originally aimed for his head but a miscalculation in balance luckily caused the hammer to hit his shoulder. Thomas screamed in agony as he felt his shoulder bone break and in a flash he came up with his war axe in his right and brought it down with all his strength onto the mans unprotected head, cleaving it in two and causing the axe to get stuck in what use to be the mans neck. Thomas tore the Axe from his foe's corpse before letting out a battle cry and charging towards another Kalvara about to strike down his ally. He no longer felt pain, The adrenalin in his body fueled his rage and strength as he severed the enemies head from his body causing it to roll off and hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long, The battle was done with the Apricum Kingdom victorious, But they all knew more battles were to come.</span></div></div>",

The Cart was loaded to the max with extra bow strings, Long Bow Limbs, Swords, Shields and War Axes. Behind the escort rode another 6 Kalvara knights but were a good 30 meters (98 feet) behind. Alran did not see this Cart favoring Apricum, Unless of course they stole it and delivered it to the Apricum front lines instead of the Kalvara's. Alran had known the cart was on its way so he had set up a plan. \"It has two outcomes, One, We succeed and help our armies war efforts, and Second, We all die a horrible slow death\" Alran had said to his Son and 2 fellow assassins and they had nodded. \"One of the perks of the Job\" said Marco causing Alice giggle and it brought a smile to Alran's usually cold face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlran watched the Kalvara weapons cart rapidly proceed to his location, The thunder of hoof beats growing louder and he smiled as it got within 2 meters (6 feet 6 inches). At this distance he made his move. In a Flash Alran sprinted into the open and jumped off a large rock he had positioned in that spot earlier in the day and dove up into the air at the driver of the Cart tackling him completely off the cart while he drove a dagger into the mans neck killing him before they crashed into a bush off the path. The second Alran took the man off the Kart Marco jumped from the tree tops down onto the cart. While falling in mid air Marco threw his throwing knife through the air burying the blade into the knights weakly guarded neck. The knight fell off his horse just as Alice fell ontop of it and she quickly grabbed the reigns and rode forward just as the other guards were realizing what was happening. The knight infront of her fell from his horse as her throwing knife buried itself into the back of his neck killing him instantly. Quickly pulling her bow off her shoulder and knocking an arrow into the string she put her feet on the stirrups to get a foot hold before using all her muscles in her legs to launch herself up into the air while she spun around in a 180 degree circle so she was facing the rapidly approaching knights riding with there swords drawn and ready to kill. The second before she touched back down on the horse she released an arrow soaring through the air towards the knights but instead of meeting the steel of the knight's armor it met the unprotected front of the horse in the lead. Either the horse died or simply lost its footing, Alice did not know but in a second Chaos and panic was unleashed as the lead horse collapsed to the ground causing all 5 of the other horses to crash over the fallen sending horses crashing to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the horses collapsed Alran and Lexia sprinted out into the open path wielding there Katana's. Those who weren't to there feet immediately due to injuries or being pinned by a horse were stabbed and slashed by the Eastern razor sharp swords of the two assassins. Only one made it to his feet but a second later he had his left arm cleaved off from the shoulder before his head was decapitated by Alran's blade. Alran and Lexia in Sync snapped there wrists the way they had been trained years ago creating a line of red on the forest floor as there swords were cleaned before they sheathed them and saw as the last guard collapsed from his horse. They had taken the cart exactly how Alran planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They failed to notice The hidden figure holding a bow in the tree tops however.......</i></span></div></div>",

At that second he heard a loud THUNK behind them and half a second later a arrow buried itself direct center in Lexia's back. Lexia fell forward with a scream of agony as every nerve from the arrow up ignited with fire while all the others instantly just died away as if they had been non-existant, Crippling her if she ever were to live from such a wound. Alran knowing it was Lix grabbed the shield nearest to him off the ground and not a second to late kicked his own legs out so he hit the ground with the shield up protecting himself just as a shield slammed into the shield. \"GET BEHIND THE CART!!\" Ordered Alran hurting his vocal cords again in the process but the apprentices already had done so which impressed him slightly but he didn't have time for thoughts like that. \"Get...back!\" managed Lexia through her pain and Alran gave a small nod before moving back with the shield up to protect himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLix, already on the ground approached Lexia who was slowly trying to crawl away, Her motions jerky and most of the time doing nothing since her upperbody was partially paralyzed while everything bellow her stomach was fully paralyzed. Lix kept her bow aimed at the cart as she moved towards Lexia still groaning in pain and clenching her teeth. \"Alran\" said Lix with her cold razor of a voice and Alran began thinking on what to do. The only way he could see his apprentices getting away was if he sacrificed himself, But doing that would be worthless, Lix would have an arrow on its way before Alice could even draw the bow string and Marco probably would not hit her with his knife if he threw it and instead would receive an arrow through the throat. So many possibilities were racing through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L..Lix\" said Lexia her breathing quick from the pain through her upperbody. \"Hello Lexia\" said Lix not looking down. \"Fuck....You\" said Lexia causing Lix to giggle before Lexia used the rest of her strength to grab a pile of dirt off the ground and turn onto her side while she threw it up into Lix's face blinding her with the dirt that got in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go!\" forced Alran, using his voice now being painful while he grabbed Alice's and his Sons wrists and begin running into the tree line. Lix hearing this released her arrow blindly at them and heard a pained cry from Marco as the arrow buried itself into his wrist. Marco stopped for a split second and stared at the arrow and screamed in agony before Alran grabbed his hood and dragged him into the forest cutting Marco's scream off with a choked noise, Within seconds they were gone and Lix now full of rage screamed in anger before turning her attention to Lexia on the ground still alive and awake but with a satisfied smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you think its funny?\" asked Lix and Lexia giggled even though it sent a fresh wave of fire through her upper body. \"Laugh about this!\" yelled Lix jumping ontop of Lexia causing Lexia to go onto her back and snapping the arrow in half and prodding the tip a little bit more against her spine causing Lexia to scream in agony before Lexia looked up at Lix who was putting on one of the fallen knights steel gauntlet. \"Ha\" said Lix before punching with all her strength at Lexia's mouth smashing 3 of her teeth out. Lexia screamed as her suffering became even worse, She knew she would die soon from the wound in her back but knew Lix wasn't going to make this quick. \"Ha\" said Lix again before smashing her fist 3 more times rapidly into Lexia's face breaking her nose and then what would develop into a black eye. Lix then took the gauntlet off and threw it to the side before pulling out one of her knives and then opening up Lexia's robes and clothing. \"Hm....Im going to gut you alive, Some you won't feel, But it will kill you quick so be glad, Then after you die, I will feed your corpse to pigs you vapid cunt!\" shouted Lix before moving the knife from Lexia's breast, down past her stomach and to her groin. \"Alran and our apprentices will kill you\" said Lexia and Lix smiled. \"If they do, its not today\" she said before getting to work on her task of killing Lexia in a horrible way.</span></div></div>",

After it came out Alran looked at Marco. \"This is gonna hurt\" he said before ripping the shaft out of Marco's wrist trying to cause as little damage as possible but since it was just the shaft it did not cause to much. Marco gasped and let out a scream in pain before screaming again as Alran doused the wound in Alcohol before grabbing Marco's hand and poking it with his fingers while Alice wrapped Marco's wrist up. \"Do you feel this?\" he asked and Marco nodded annoyed and his teeth still clenched tightly. \"Good, Wrap it tightly Alice\" he said and Alice nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen done Marco gripped his wrist tightly trying to stop the bleeding quicker before looking at Alran. \"What about the horses and our gear?\" asked Marco. \"Fuck the horses my Master is dead!\" shouted Alice before Marco retaliated. \"Yeah we know that, Im the one who got an Arrow to the wrist!, I wasn't just sitting back and eating a rabbit leg while Lix shot the shit out of us!, We need the horses because it has our food and water!\" shouted Marco and Alice went to reply but was slapped by Alran before Marco received one himself. \"Shut up!\" shouted Alran regretting it from the pain in his throat before both Apprentices stared at him waiting for there orders. \"Complaining wont get us anywhere, Now I know that once Lix is done torturing Lexia she will come after us, The horses are probably going to be killed by Lix or used by her so we have a 50% chance of getting them back but I couldn't careless right now, What matters is we are still alive, But we must move now, Marco try not to use your wrist\" said Alran beginning to walk and the Apprentices followed.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't hard, Heck of alot easier than previous tracking jobs, The blood trail was clear, An amateur could have followed it easily. Lix found a fallen log with a much larger puddle of blood compared to the rest. From the amount of blood Lix guessed it did not hit an artery amazingly but it made Alran's apprentice temporarily useless. Her only real threat was Alran and Lexia's apprentice Alice. Lix let out a sigh as she sat down before pulling the satchel she wore off her shoulder and pulling on the knot that held it closed untying it and then opening the satchel. She pulled out a black wide lidded vial that would allow her to dip an arrow inside. Inside the vial was a black paste that was in truth a deadly poison. Unlike other assassins Lix loved making her enemies suffer the worst kinds of pain. This poison, a Nerotoxin would cause the victim to experience horrible pain and the disability of not being able to move any part of there body, The effects took effect anywhere from half a minute to 5 minutes depending where the arrow hit. Lix usually never got to see the effects because she rarely ever missed, But the times she had it would cause there entire bodies to shake and then stiffen like Rigor Mortis. The natives from the eastern lands where she had gotten the poison described the pain as someone sawing through every nerve in your body with a red hot knife. It was 50% death or 50% life, However the poison would take effect for 3 days slowing down anyone not like Lix. If Lix was Alran she would abandon anyone who got hit with this poison, However Alran was stupid in her views, He would carry the friend who got shot which would slow him down allowing her to gain a critical advantage which would allow her to kill the 3 of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the arrow from the poison she smiled at the sight of it knowing it would be her victory. She heard a twig snap to her left and in a flash drew the arrow on her bow and aimed it but instead of Alran or someone else worth a threat she saw a Kalvara knight. \"Are you Lix?\" he asked and she nodded letting the bow string relax. \"Are you injured?\" he asked and she shook her head, She hated the Kalvara accent. It was the Apricum tongue but at the end of the sentence they raised there voices pitch slightly, It pissed her off that they could bash the language so horribly with it. \"No, its from an assassin of the Nocte Laminas, I want you to take your soldiers and find them in the forest, and kill them\" replied Lix and the Knight nodded. She knew Alran could handle them but what she was hoping is it would ware him down enough to weaken him. </span></div></div>",

After slicing the fabric Marco looked around before sighing. \"I'm guessing we sleep in our cloaks with no fire, correct?\" asked Marco and Alran gave a slight nod before sitting on a log. \"I'll take first watch\" he suggested and Marco gave his nod in thanks before laying down and pulling his cloak over himself as Alice did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later Alran was still sitting where he had sat down, The moon was no longer fully in the sky and the forest was silent till Alran heard rapid snapping noises from someone walking on the wood covered ground. Alran stood up slowly without making a noise and slowly moved off the path of the possible foe moving through the forest. It was to loud to be Lix Alran knew but as they approached he judged they were knights in armor. They approached like a full marching band to Alran's trained ears and within a few moments he could see Torches. \"Amateurs\" whispered Alran. As they got closer he could make out the Kalvara coat of arms on there tunics and he smiled to himself before grabbing his throwing knife and in a blink threw it through the air. It would be impossible to see it coming and it was, before the knights even knew it the front man was already collapsing from a well placed knife buried completely into his neck. A total of 4 knights had entered the forest, now stood 3. Alran in a flash send another throwing knife with his left hand while he drew his Katana with his right and quickly charged out of the bushes. The last 2 knights now drew there swords and with a battle cry charged full speed towards Alran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlran dove forward as both of the knights brought there swords down, barely managing to escape the two blades and in a flash he was up behind them. In one vicious swipe Alran's sword sliced upwards dead center on one of the knights spine killing him in a flash but before he could deliver the next blow to the other the knight spun around and blocked it with his shield before attempting to take a chunk out of Alran with his sword but in a flash Alran drew a dagger and managed to deflect the sword to the side before smashing his Katana hilt into the knights helmet causing him to stumble before receiving a stab from the Katana which Alran pulled out a second afterwords causing the knight to collapse dead.</span></div></div>",

By there faces changing he knew someone was behind him and in a flash he turned around to grab the arm of Lix who had charged at him. With her momentum they both came crashing down causing both of the assassins to drop there weapons, Lix's being half an arrow shaft covered in a poison and Alran's being his sword. Both Assassins began swinging at each other with Alran delivering a punch to the left Lix's jaw before feeling Lix's knee connect with his groin. The two of the rolled, both of them trying to be the one on top hoping to gain an advantage with Lix coming out on top but before she could deliver another punch something hard shattered against her face causing her entire upper body to become soaked from something. The item had been a jar that Marco had picked up that had rolled out of Alran's pocket before Alice could grab one of her weapons to use against Lix. In a flash Lix jumped off of Alran before disappearing into the forest in a blink, being lost by her black cloak and silent moving. Alran quickly grabbed his Katana off the forest floor and looked slowly at the black wall of shadows infront of him but did not see anything. \"Great work, What did you smash in her face?\" asked Alran as Marco walked up. \"A jar of water\" he replied and Alran knew what one he was talking about. \"I got that in a well, Sadly it wasn't something bad\" said Alran before picking up the rest of his equipment. \"The Capital is not very far away, Lets keep moving\" he said and the two apprentices nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLix returned to her campsite and sat down beside her horse before rubbing her face to make sure it wasn't some kind of acid. After a few moments nothing happened to her which she found odd. Licking her lips the liquid had no taste which made her know what it was. \"He smashed a jar of water in my face....\" she said thinking it over before giggling at the stupidity.</span></div></div>",

The horses had been collected from a small Kalvara town a week previously. They weren't as good of a breed as the Nocte Laminas rode but they would do. \"So the king is dead?\" asked Marco but Alran shook his head for a no. \"He's escaping\" said Alran and Marco looked to see where his master was and saw a horse with a man riding it away from the city in the distance. \"I got him\" said Marco and Alran gave him a curious look. \"It might be a fake encase someone tries to follow him, Stay here in case anyone else shows up\" said Marco and Alran nodded before Marco began riding after the Kalvara king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later Marco had gained on him and the king had caught site of him. \"You bastard\" Marco said to himself. He could easily shoot him off the horse with a bow but do to his wrist still healing he knew there was no way he would be able to pull the string back. \"How am I going to take him down\" Marco thought to himself before reaching to his belt and grabbing a throwing knife. He had to get closer to his target and with the constant movement of the horse it was causing some issues. \"Come on a little closer\" Marco said before in a blink the horse slowed down almost to a stop causing Marco to rapidly gain on the Kalvara king before the two of them came side by side each other which Marco now noticed he had a bow in his hands. In a quick second Marco threw the knife just as the king released his arrow. The arrow missed Marco's neck by 3 inches and tore through his hood, pulling it back off his head but Marco's knife was more successful, burying directly between the Kalvara kings eyes.</span></div></div>",
