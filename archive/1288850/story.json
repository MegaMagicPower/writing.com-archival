Above you is a canopy of trees, branches swaying in a gentle breeze. Sitting up, you look at your surroundings in confusion. An unfamiliar, lush forest surrounds you in all directions. You're not sure how you got here. There are some vague flashes in your mind. Something about using some kind of special computer? Maybe you can remember if you stay here for a bit and think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you have no idea what else is in the forest with you. A further glance around shows that the trees noticeably start to get less dense in one direction. A way out perhaps? In the other direction the trees don't get thicker, but you see signs of some kind of tracks. If there are wild animals about, following them might you lead you to a landmark of some sort. Of course, if the animals are predatory... you don't want to think about that.</span></div></div>",

Upon closer inspection the prints are some kind of clawed paws. You're no expert on animals, but the paw prints are pretty large. So a large animal with paws? You hope it's a friendly animal. You can't really guess what pace the creature that left the pawprints was taking, so you just walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trail is long, and you feel like you've been following it for ages when you finally notice some kind of payoff. Sounds in the distance. Pausing, your realize there are two different sounds. The first comes from further along the path you're following. A gentle trotting sound. You're not sure how many legs the thing you're following has on sound alone, so still no idea what you're following, but at least you caught up. The second sound is a rustling, slowing gaining distance from you in the brush to your right. You guessed you spooked something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go after the thing you spooked, just for curiosity's sake, but if you do the animal you're following will get away from you again, and you may waste a lot of time left in the day finding your way back to the trail it's left. On the other hand, if you hurry to catch up the thing you're following, you probably won't be able to find whatever you spooked later.</span></div></div>",
