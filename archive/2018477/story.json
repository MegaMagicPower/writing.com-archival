You grit your teeth and close your eyes so you won't see what's happening to your body. The horrible burning eventually turns to numbness and you feel yourself growing tired. Right before you lose consciousness, you see a very bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Blaziken rubbed his belly after swallowing his snack before he heard a voice call out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaziken!\" A young woman shouted. \"Play time's over, it's time to head to the Day Care!\" The Blaziken responded to his trainer's call, leaping into the air before landing next to her. \"Oh, there you are!\" She happily said before patting her Pok\u00e9mon and the back. \"C'mon big guy, I've got just the perfect Pok\u00e9mon for you to mate with.\" The two then walked off, head for the nearby building that was run by a kindly old couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel really weird as you awaken; groggy, but relieved that dying in that Blaziken's stomach was apparently just a really freaky dream. You also feel like you're floating in a warm liquid. As you sight starts to come back to you, you see the blurry image of something  that looked like a big, white tadpole. When your vision fully returns, you then see that you're floating around in a liquid that's filled with millions of these oversized tadpoles. You then realise that you're one of the things and a horrible realization dawns on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh dear Arceus, I'm a sperm in something's balls!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you panickedly ponder the possibility of the preposterous transformation you've faced, you hear a pair of voices that were muffled by the flesh of whoever or whatever you're in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take good care of your precious Pok\u00e9mon. The two to get along very well!\" You hear an old man say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sir. Be sure to mate with her, Blaziken. I really want that egg!\" A woman's voice speaks, making you realise that your nightmare was apparently real. You had been digested and somehow you had been turned into a Pok\u00e9mon's sperm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a second... did she say mate?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow more and more worried for several minutes before the testicles start to shake, signaling that Blaziken had started to mate with the other Pok\u00e9mon his trainer had dropped off. You try to calm yourself, thinking that this could be your one chance at survival. As you wonder what Pok\u00e9mon you could be reborn as, you remember that Blaziken is apart of the Field egg group in the games, meaning what you could be reborn as were limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shaking starts to increase in pace, you hear the female Pok\u00e9mon moan out her species name.

You're quickly launched out of the Pok\u00e9mon's penis and sent crashing into the Lucario's cervix. As you gain your bearings, you realise that there are millions of other sperm in there with you that'll try to fertilize her egg. On that notion, you dive into the cervical canal. After a few moments of swimming, you make it into the uterus. You journey deeper into the womb until you eventually find what the cell you had been seeking, the ovum. If you still had a mouth, you would have smirked as you charged to the egg. As you started to penetrate the cell membrane's surface, a thought crossed your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Will this Lucario lay an egg like in the games, or will she have a live birth?</i></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">So, you wake up one day to find yourself in some place that is very similar to home, but, it looks different. You realise it is different when you see that there are pokemon roaming everywhere. All different types. But, the question is, are you still human, or are you a Pokemon yourself. You decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story you will have the option of being shrunk, but there will also be a story line where  you are normal size human or Pokemon. There will be no limitations on which pokemon you can be. All existing Pokemon, no matter what tv series season or came series are fine, and I will also allow fan-made pokemon. (ex: Arcticanine, the ice version of Arcanine.) If you do turn pokemon upon arrival, be aware that there can be stroylines where humans will catch you for whatever purpose, be they a trainer or team rocket or anything else. If you are human, there will be the chance to become a trainer, breeder, team rocket, or other such titles humans take. Also be aware that if you are a human, there is a chance a pokemon might outsmart you and either make you it's next meal or have you become it's young by means of transformation. Unbirth is one posibility. This can also happen even if your pokemon already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings I will allow in this story:<br>\r\n1. Unbirth<br>\r\n2. Pregnancy. (you can follow the mother's pov, if the main character is unbirthed for the time being and/or in an egg for the time being depending upon whether the Pokemon mother gives live birth or lays eggs. And yes there will be the selection to end up in a human womans womb, but only if your human to begin with. And once the main character is reborn, you have to go back to the main character's pov.)<br>\r\n3. transgender (This can only be done when the main character is unbirthed or transformed by other means)<br>\r\n4. soft oral and breast vore (Only pokemon are allowed this ability.)<br>\r\n5. age regression (This can happen upon arrival, but you can choose to go younger.)<br>\r\n6. breastfeeding. (This of course and can only be done by pokemon considered to be mammals, so Pokemon like Arboc and Charzard are unable to do this.)<br>\r\n7. babying<br>\r\n8. diapers can be involved if you are a human baby in this story. (Don't go into heavy description about using the diaper, or the chapter will be deleted.)<br>\r\n9. transformation into Pokemon of course. (like earlier stated, this can be achived through means of unbirth. It can also be achieved by means of getting bitten, kind of like if a vampire or werewolf bit you. Pokemon using magical forces, or any other creative means you can think of are also allowed.)<br>\r\n10. Death is allowed if the main character is orally vored and digested, but their soul will be transferred to any unborn children the Pokemon that vored them plans to have. Do not have the story end on a death chapter or it will be deleted.<br>\r\n11. parings of straight couples. So this can be between two of the same Pokemon, but different genders. The main character can also have a partner, whether they are human or Pokemon.<br>\r\n12. Sex, but not in front of young ones, especially the main character if they are just a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings not allowed in this story:<br>\r\n1. Hard vore.<br>\r\n2. anal vore<br>\r\n3. using the main character or other characters as personal toys or toilets.<br>\r\n4.. absorbtion in the breast or womb. (even though I allowed digestion, that is only if they get orally vored.)<br>\r\n5. turning good characters into bad characters (unless you provide an extremely good reason for doing so.)<br>\r\n6. permanent death of the main character. (like stated earlier, any chapters that end the story at death will be deleted.)<br>\r\n7. rape (there will be no forced sex on any character, including the main character.)<br>\r\n8. gay couples. (Do not try and work around this like trying to pair up two characters after one has become the same gender as the the other. Chapters involving gay couples or gay references will be deleted.)<br>\r\n9. Gore and blood (I'm not one for that kind of violence. I'll allow a few bruises and light scratches, but nothing more.)<br>\r\n10. making humans become giant or Pokemon that are not as tall as buildings to begin with become giants<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there are other things you wish to include in the story that was not mentioned, give me a shout in my on-site email and I'll let you know what will be allowed. Have fun with the chapters you add and be sure to provide selections for others to branch off of. Help me get at least 75 chaptersup. Thank you.</td>",
