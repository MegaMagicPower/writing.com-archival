Your body is covered in a golden fur besides a creamy beige just over your tummy. Of course it is a bit distorted by the size of your stomach. To a human you would seem tall for your age, coming in at about five feet, but your species tends to reach over fifteen feet in adulthood. So in truth your actually kind of short. Like all the members of your group you wear a green vest with an attached sash, showing off your badges, and a pair of brown cargo shorts. The shorts are rather tight around your sizable bottom, and you've had a few problems with them splitting in the past. While your troop will be staying near the camp you are not actually visiting it. Rather you will working on your wilderness survival skills. The main skill, of course, being the finding of food. The official visiters to the camp are there to \"help\" you in this persuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look down at the camp a soft breeze wraps around your fur. You have not begun to grow a mane yet but it still causes your fur to ruffle. Your focus is broken as a voice rises behind you. It is the leader of your troop. He is a tall and slim weasal, and his species describes his voice well, but is actually a very trustworthy individual. Looking down at the campers scurrying about he smiles. \"Don't worry, we can pick up some lunch later. For now we need to work on setting camp.\" You nod as the two of you head back to the clearing in which you set your tents and backpacks.</span></div></div>",

Oh, sure, you've been spotted by other people before -it's nearly impossible to stay out of sight in a park area this well frequented- but the sightings were always chalked up to \"dumb animals being frightened off by the scary humans\". Well, that's what the park ranger always says it is; thank the higher power, whom ever it may be, that humans can't go through the woods and properly operate a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyhoo, the campers who do know of you are under the impression that you're a \"residential spirit\" who lives in the woods and only appears in front of those who give it a good impression. That is only a partial truth; you aren't a residential spirit of any kind...at least, you don't think you are. You've been living here for a good while, and despite human arrogance, the head-cheif recognizes that you are best left un-hurt, in every sense of the word. That would be why he built a camp in such a place; plenty of humans, plenty of chances to teach aforementioned humans, and most importantly of all (to him at least), the most chances to punish people without being caught; that's where you come in. As long as you've lived in the woods -which is, again, a good long while- you've had the urge to completely devour those who've done you wrong, be it a falling leaf, or a cheeky, ignoramus of a camper who thinks that with just a small pea-shooter and a backpack he can go out into the woods and make it on his own (you'd be surprised by how many fall under that assumption). Course, those pea-shooters have gotten more powerful lately, and they do hurt for a while if the ignoramus is lucky (they almost never are, though).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn anycase, as said above, you've been living at the camp for a while -the head-cheif was a teenager when you first met him, now he's a grown middle-aged man- but you don't seem to age nearly as fast as those around you, nor are you all that concerned with creating future generations. That's not to say you don't like sex, you just don't really feel like going out and finding a female to breed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat species are you anyhow?</span></div></div>",
