On a cold, stormy night, she snuggled within her blankets sobbing, as if she didn't know what to do next. She then thought to herself, \"Ever since those Rare hunters have been terrorizing the city with magic, Yugi is always busy dueling and fighting one creep after another. He just never has enough time for me lately. I remember all the good times we had together before he started dueling.\" With those thoughts in mind, a peculiar dream stormed through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now realized that she was in this old egyptian palace. The only person there was the Dark Magician Girl. As Tea started to look delearious, DMG said, \"Hello Tea! You must be the girlfriend of the pharoh. Let me guess, he hasn't payed much attention to you lately, now has he?\" \"You're absolutely right, and I am wondering how I can be with him again. You have got to help me!\" Tea begged in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Girl then concluded, \"I know just the thing for you. Take this Millenium item; it is called the Millenium Corset. This item will be able to make you sexier and noticable. Wear it and voila! the pharoh will love you in no time at all. Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tea woke up from her dream, she saw the same  golden item she saw when she was sleeping.

Now it is time to duel!\" Yugi then replied, \"I am glad Tea is able to see this. Thank you.\" \"Whatever punk, you are going down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duel began and Seto Kaiba went first. The cards that are currently in his hand are Blue eyes, Vorse Raider, Sagi the dark clown, crush card virus, and Pegasus's card, Toon Obelisk the Tormentor.

Now Dark Magician, attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast Yugi, when you destroyed my clown, you activated my trap. Now you can't summon a monster that has attack points over 1500.\" Dark Magician was destroyed and that was the end of Yami's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto drew his next card and gave a snicker. The card he has is no other than Toon World. \"Ha, Now I will end this duel. First I will use Pegasus's card, Toon World and then I will summon the almighty Toon Obeliskthe Tormentor. Thanks to its special ability, it can attack right away. Now my great beast, attack!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Thet started with 4,000 life points, Yugi lost the duel. Kaiba then laughed haughtily, Ha ha ha, You see Yugi, I always getwhat I want.

Looks like you can't keep me up there forever. Although I kind of liked it.\" Tea then looked down and said playfully, \"Ah, you're so cute.

The giant Tea certainly felt this much larger load as she lets out a moan, but the breast was yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea starts to occasionally squeeze her boobs together, furthering the heavenly pressure all over Yami's body while blushing further herself. \"<b>Here</b> we go,\" the titaness tells her toy. It took nearly 15 minutes of holding it back, but Yugi ultimately blows a third, mighty blast of cum into Tea's gigantic tits and causes a massive moan, almost orgasmic, from the massive girl.

Then, suddenly, everyone else started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssassin was the first to stop, maybe because he had duct tape over his mouth. \"Mmmmph mmph mmf fmmf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" came Drez's reply through several whooping laughs. \"I think some magic is effecting us and making us laugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!!\" cried out a voice from atop a building that had a roof that seemed to touch the sky and the ground at the same time. The figure jumped down and touched the ground lightly, a cape billowing nicely behind him on the way down and covering him completely once he hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Wizard,\" exclaimed Yami-Yugi, \"and he's full size again!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in the flesh, feathers, horns, claws, slime, scales, fins, and rusty old nails!\" Wizard said with a grin. He produced a map out of his cloak and waved it in front of the party. \"This is the map to Atlantis. If you want it, you'll have to take it from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, most of the gang had recovered from the laughing. \"Alright, can we have the map?\" asked Tristin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't getting it that easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a cherry on top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... cherry... wait, stop distracting me, damnit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku took over from here. \"I'll expose myself to you if you will...\" she said in a sultry voice, leaning over to expose a bit more of her massive cleavage for Wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!

I'll give you a nice funeral if you don't make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea grabbed into the submarine, gripped Badrick, and threw him back to the fight. \"Get in there!\" she snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mam'.\" Badrick replied meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now then...\" Wizard started...</span></div></div>",

Tea was trying to get the device from Thomas. The boys started throwing rocks, two boys took their belts off and started whipping Tea's feet. Tea couldn't turn around to defend herself, Tea couldn't risk hurting other civilians. Tea was in pain from the boys throwing rocks and whipping her feet. The boys wanted to get payback on Tea after disrespecting them.</span></div></div>",

After lying to Tea, Thomas threw a stink bomb at her face and Tea started coughing. While Tea was coughing, the boys decided to play a little prank on Tea. After Tea stopped coughing, the boys had powerful stink bombs waiting for her. The boys began to tease Tea: \"Tea, your feet stink up the whole town, put some shoes on.\" Tea answered: \"Shut up, my feet do not stink!!!\" Then the boys smirk at Tea, and threw their powerful (almost permanent) stink bombs at Tea's huge feet. \"They do now....ha ha ha ha ha!\" The boys hi-tailed it out before the stink from Tea's feet floods the town. \"Oh man, this is the worst day of my life.

The patron walked to the counter and looked at the snoozing old man with a mixture of disgust and contempt. She tapped her foot several times in annoyance of having to wait, until she had finally had enough. She slammed her palms down on the counter creating a loud banging sound, the noise woke the old man immediately and he went tumbling to the ground.<br>\r\n\u201cGosh dang it! You young folks got no respect for ya elders,\u201d He said in frustration from being woken. His anger dissipated when he got a good look at the person in front of him. A lecherous smile formed as he sized her up, long legs, big boobs and blond hair. This babe can wake him up any day of the week.<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something I can help you with Ms\u2026\u201d He said, praying to God she wasn\u2019t a Mrs.<br>\r\n\u201cMai is fine. I\u2019m here because I heard from I reliable source that you have an extremely rare Dual Monsters card called the \u2018Wishes\u2019. I\u2019d like to purchase this card.\u201d Mai didn\u2019t show it but inside she was smiling, this guy was the perfect pigeon. <br>\r\n\u201cAh, the wishes card, very rare indeed. Pegasus only made one card and I have it, you bet. Now I would normally charge 45,000,000 for the card but since I don\u2019t see that many beautiful faces I\u2019ll let it go for a measly 25,000,000.\u201d He grinned showing all five of his yellow teeth, it took a lot of self-control for Mai not to retch at the sight.<br>\r\n\u201c25,000,000 yen?\u201d She said with a raised eyed brow.<br>\r\n\u201c25,000,00 American dollars, but I am willing to bargain with you about alternative payment,\u201d he corrected. Images flashed in his mind of how Mai would look after they had a concession. Mai nodded her head and thought long and hard about it. Then when she had thought of the pros and cons of the transaction she came to conclusion. She unbuttoned her top and pulled it aside flashing the old man. His eyes became as big as saucers and blood dripped from his nose. After a few seconds of showing off her fun bags, Mai closed her top before the old man busted a blood vessel.<br>\r\n\u201cHow does 100 yen sound to you?\u2019 Mai said sweetly.<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhhh,\u201d The old man drooled as he handed over the Wishes card. Mai happily plucked the card from his hand and handed 100 yen over then she trotted out of the store, a skip in her walk as she left. The old man remained frozen staring blankly at the spot where Mai had once stood; it would be an hour before he realized he had been ripped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai congratulated herself on making such a good deal, if only it was that easy to win a dual. Sure, before Dualist Kingdom she\u2019d been know for using her sexuality to distract her opponents, but it had earned her a bad reputation. It drove her crazy the way that people spoke about her behind her back, she was known as a slut, a viewing good and a ho to all the professional dualists. That was why when she had gone to Dualist Kingdom she had sworn a vow of chastity; she would win without sleeping or sexually distracting her opponents. It had started off easily, but then she\u2019d hit a snag, namely Joey Wheeler. God, she just wanted to jump his bones. He had that na\u00efve brainless oaf look to him that was so endearing to Mai. She would love to turn that boy into a real man and why stop there? Yugi had his charms with his bright smile and warm eyes and when the Pharaoh came out, look out. Mai could just image that ancient royal banging her two weeks from Friday. Her urges for sex hadn\u2019t dissolved even when she was under the control of the bastard Darts, only her fantasies back then involved chains, hot wax and a lot of whipping. But she couldn\u2019t act like her old self now or everyone would go back to disrespecting her, everyone would label her another sluttish blond.<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could be myself, but still be seen as powerful and in command,\u201d She said to herself as she walked home. Mai never noticed the Wishes card had started to glow<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled and lowered her body so she could get nearer to the teenager. As for the boy, he didn\u00b4t know whether Mai noticing him was a good thing or a terrible turn of events. In fact, he always had a crush on Mai, he watched her during some of her memorable duels. Because she\u00b4s incredibly sexy, and because she\u00b4s also a strong woman, something that always fascinated him about Mai Valentine.

He\u00b4d never thought she would treat others like that, as slaves, especially him. He was her friend, after all, so why would she do this? Was her desire for power and dominance so strong that she would even treat her friends like garbage? in any case he was pissed as he brought some fruits near Mai\u00b4s open mouth. He swallowed hard as he looked into it. Seeing her huge and sharp teeth as well the dark red colours of her mouth was quite scary, he thought. As he climbed on her lower lip so he could toss the fruits into this intimidating cave, the inevitable happened. A sudden move of Mai\u00b4s lower jaw caused Joey to loose his balance and to fall into Mai\u00b4s humid mouth.<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Mai, help me, I...\" he shouted in vain, trying to get Mai\u00b4s attention. But she had already closed her mouth, making it impossible for Mai to hear his words. Obviously, Mai didn\u00b4t even notice that Joey was missing, probably thinking he tossed the fruits into her mouth and was already on his way to get more fruits for the goddess. But in reality, Joey was in some predicament, as Mai\u00b4s tongue was pushing him and the fruits toward the back of her throat. There was no way Joey could resist the sheer force of Mai\u00b4s muscular tongue, and after a few seconds, he found himself at the edge of Mai\u00b4s throat, inches away from a trip into his friend\u00b4s digestive system. Thinking of a way out of his unfortunate situation, Joey considered grabbing Mai\u00b4s uvula as the best option to avoid getting swallowed, but it was already too late, as he felt muscles forcing him out of her mouth and into her throat. He heard a terrible gulping sound accompanying his doom, but Joey was not someone to give up so easily, as he managed to grab a fleshy fold of Mai\u00b4s esophagus, still somewhere up in her throat, while the fruits fell down the dark tube. He was save for the moment, but it was only a matter of seconds until the muscles of Mai\u00b4s throat would cause him to loose his grip and to fall down into the humid, scary chamber of Mai\u00b4s stomach.</span></div></div>",

The constant shaking and wobbling of the green squishy walls, the loud gurgling sounds of Mai\u00b4s digestion process and the thought of what could happen to him in the worst case should have drawn him into insanity, but Joey was not some coward. He was a courageous man, so he would go through this ordeal without complaining. And he was a loyal friend as well, so he would try anything to convince Mai that her actions are wrong...in case he ever gets out of her belly again.<br>\r\nStanding there at the entrance of Mai\u00b4s intestines, Joey began to think of an escape plan. His first idea was climbing Mai\u00b4s throat, but that seemed futile at the moment, since Mai obviously continued eating fruits. And some of them already entered the intestines, hitting Joey hard on his head.<br>\r\n\"Ouch! Uh, dammit! Gotta get outta here...\"<br>\r\nSo the throat was out of place now, but Joey didn\u00b4t even want to consider the other possibility...the rear exit if you want...He wouldn\u00b4t even leave Mai\u00b4s body if this was his only choice. It would have been too humiliating, and Joey sure has his pride, as he has shown in various duels.<br>\r\nIn the end, Joey came to the conclusion that waiting for Mai to finish eating fruits was the best choice he had. The several acids of Mai\u00b4s tummy didn\u00b4t seem to affect him, probably because he was too small for the enzymes of Mai\u00b4s digestive organs to dissolve him.<br>\r\nOutside, Mai was rubbing her belly with satisfaction.<br>\r\n\"Ah, that was worthy of being the food of a goddess like me.\" she said with a devious smile.<br>\r\n\"Don\u00b4t you think so, Joey?\" she asked.<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n\"Joey?

Well, unfortunately, NORMALLY. No matter how dominant, strong or beautiful Mai might normally be, no one would seriously listen to such a crappy demand. But it\u00b4s a completely other case with a gigantic, Godzilla-like, dominant, strong and beautiful Mai...so words like those could easily intimidate anyone about the size of Joey, who was easily about the size of an insignificant bug. So every single \"slave\" around her shuddered as Mai uttered these words with her powerful and loud voice.<br>\r\nBut all she got as an answer was silence and the noticeable fear of those who served her. She looked at the ground and then around her, but he was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n\"That good for nothing! Looks like he escaped.\"<br>\r\nAt least that\u00b4s what Mai thought at first, because a sudden turn of events opened her eyes to the truth. At that moment, her stomach began to growl loudly, intimidating all the \"slaves\" around her, as it was like a thunder. She grabbed her stomach with her well-manicured fingers, feeling that something in there was not right. And that feeling was certainly not hunger. She felt something pounding at her stomach walls, it did not hurt, but it surely annoyed her.<br>\r\nAnd I guess you know who was responsible for this annoying feeling. That\u00b4s right, Joey was pounding against Mai\u00b4s fleshy and soft stomach walls, having lost his temper again, as he couldn\u00b4t stand the thought of being trapped inside his (supposed to be) girlfriend. He had his typical anime like face as his fists hit the walls repeatedly, and fortunately, his attempts were successful.<br>\r\nOutside, Mai finally realized what that pounding meant, even though she might have been blinded by her lust for power, thus clouding her judgement and her ability to see things clearly.<br>\r\n\"Is that...Joey? Is he inside my stomach?\"<br>\r\nThe people around her gasped at these words, feeling sorry for Joey. So he was the first one to suffer from the fate everyone feared the most.<br>\r\n\"Joey, are you inside my stomach?\" my asked loudly.<br>\r\nAnd Joey was quite happy as he heard Mai\u00b4s voice, asking the question he was hoping for all the time. Now he could only keep his fingers crossed that Mai would be able to hear him.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mai, I\u00b4m in here!\" Joey shouted at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\"<br>\r\nMai paused, and secretly, Joey was hoping for my to return back to normal in terms of her behavior, but his hopes were not fulfilled that quickly.<br>\r\n\"Joey Wheeler, I demand you get out of my precious body! No one must enter my stomach without my permission or without me swallowing him or her on purpose!\"<br>\r\nDamn, what\u00b4s with that stupid word \"Demand\"? Anyway, Joey was vastly disappointed to hear Mai talking like an evil goddess again. So he decided to make a last attempt on trying to convince her that her doing was wrong.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I don\u00b4t want to get out of your stomach.\"<br>\r\n\"What?! How dare you, you little parasite!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe I don\u00b4t want to see you again. The Mai I knew, the Mai I loved is dead. Her true soul has decayed, leaving all but a foul shape, possessed by greed.\"<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n\"Mai, don\u00b4t you see? What you\u00b4re doing is wrong! You\u00b4re not like that at all! You\u00b4re a strong woman, but not an evil tyrant! Don\u00b4t let your lust for power overcome your mind! Mai...please...I...I want my girlfriend back! I want the Mai I love back, the Mai everyone loves!\"<br>\r\nOh l\u00e1 l\u00e1, not bad for someone as Joey.

But this time, Joey gave proof that he wasn\u00b4t as stupid or pigheaded or head-over-heels as most people thought. He want to make sure that his words really hit Mai deep within her soul and that they would cause her to stop acting like one of those clich\u00e9 evil giantesses (some hidden criticism of some stories out there in the community...). So what followed now after his already moving speech was practically the icing on the cake. Walking over the squishy, fleshy ground and taking a deep breath, which was quite disgusting due to the stench inside Mai\u00b4s stomach, he broke the silence and finished his speech. Mai\u00b4s heart beat, which was clearly audible, somehow comforted him and provided him with much needed self confidence, despite the fact that this heart, the heart of Mai, was currently blinded by the shroud of betrayal (of her friend) and devoured by greed. Yet it was still Mai\u00b4s heart, and there was still good in it. She just let this natural reaction overcome herself: exploiting her considerable size. But he would end this nightmare, once and for all.<br>\r\n\"Mai Valentine. I love you. I always loved you. And you know that. But I loved you for what thou art! Mai, I accepted you and your personality, exactly because of my love. And I...I know that you had a difficult childhood. Mine wasn\u00b4t easy as well. But still, despite your problems, that doesn\u00b4t give you the right to act like that and to hurt so many people!\"<br>\r\nTo his surprise, despite the layers of Mai\u00b4s stomach walls, flesh, muscles, bones and skin being around him and practically creating his organic prison, he was able to perceive noises coming from outside Mai\u00b4s body. It seemed that some of Mai\u00b4s slaves were clapping, having heard his speech, once again to his surprise and despite the physical and biological disadvantages.<br>\r\n\"Mai...to overcome your problems, you can\u00b4t let those feelings of domination and power, resulting from your giantess-size, twist your mind and act like that. That won\u00b4t give you satisfaction, and it won\u00b4t make you forget your childhood, and it certainly won\u00b4t compensate for anything. Instead...you can talk with me. I will help you to forget your past and embrace the future. You can count on me, and on Yugi and the others as well. For we are thy friends.\"<br>\r\nWhat followed this speech was silence. And you, the audience, might have went silent by now as well, gasping at those words. Joey Wheeler, a Philistine, a lowbrow when it comes to sophisticated discussions and intelligent speeches, just uttered those heartwarming, honest and true words, all in order to get the Mai he loved back. Maybe Joey always was like that, maybe he just didn\u00b4t show us his true potential, who knows. But no matter how moving his speech was, the most important part, Mai\u00b4s reaction, was still to be expected. And he, as well, as his fellow slaves outside the \"goddess\u00b4\" body, didn\u00b4t have to wait long, as her reaction followed quickly and unequivocal. Mai, who was moments before acting like a vile, foul and evil monster who fell for her giantess size and exploited it by making the people around her suffer, began to sob. She was sobbing so loudly that even Joey could hear it, deep within her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Joey...\"<br>\r\n\"Mai? Mai, what\u00b4s wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m so sorry, Joey! You...you\u00b4re right...I am a monster! I am not worthy of being your friend, not after all I did!\"<br>\r\n\"Mai, you misunderstood me. You\u00b4re not a monster. You managed to let go of your lust for power and domination, and you returned. The Mai I love is back. And that\u00b4s all that counts.\"<br>\r\n\"Joey...\"<br>\r\n\"Please, Mai, free all those people around you. They had to go through too much today, it\u00b4s time for them to get out of this nightmare. And...please forgive that I called you foul and wicked earlier. It was the only way I could reach your attention. The only way of getting in contact with the true Mai you are now.\"<br>\r\nOutside, unbeknown to Joey, Mai was smiling brightly at her friend\u00b4s words. That fool...he surprised her once again. He was not just some happy-go-lucky type, he was actually a thoughtful and dependable person, if these qualities were required.</span></div></div>",

Why wouldn\u00b4t he want to get out?\"<br>\r\nDrez couldn\u00b4t help but smiling at this naive question, looking at his partner Sith, standing several meters behind him. Sith, with his arms folded, knew exactly what Drez was about to say.<br>\r\n\"That girl probably never heard of vorarephilia, don\u00b4t you think?\"<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Sith tried to answer his old buddy without seeming to annoyed at his question.<br>\r\n\"Why is it that you always assume men eaten by girls to be vorarephiles?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...because that was always the case, remember?\"<br>\r\n\"Hm...yeah, you\u00b4re right. But let\u00b4s see.\"<br>\r\n\"Let\u00b4s see? What do you mean, \"let\u00b4s see\"? Wait...you don\u00b4t mean...\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I mean it! Heck, it\u00b4s our job, after all!\"<br>\r\n\"You\u00b4re right, Sith-master.\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm excuse me...\" Yugi Muto himself walked toward the two unlikely heroes (?), obviously surprised about their discussion, like anyone else. Yet he had the courage to ask what the heck was going on.<br>\r\n\"Huh? What\u00b4s the matter, kid?\" Drez asked, looking down at the small kid. Well, Yugi was a teenager, of course, but a little short, unfortunately.<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m not a kid! And who the heck are you?!\"<br>\r\n\"The names\u00b4s...not important. Names are merely a means to deceive oneself. It\u00b4s meaningless before the truth. But if you must know...some people call me Sith.\"<br>\r\n\"Tsk. You don\u00b4t have to be so poetic about your name, pal. Anyway, I\u00b4m Drez.\"<br>\r\n\"And why are you here? What do you want of us?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my...those questions again. Sith, explain it to the boy.\"<br>\r\n\"Certainly.\"<br>\r\nBy now, Yugi\u00b4s friends have joined the short-duelist as well, and to Sith\u00b4s joy, Tea as well.<br>\r\n\"Not bad...quite a lovely sight...she\u00b4s cute!\" Sith thought to himself, seeing the brown haired girl, looking at him with a confused expression.<br>\r\n\"Nice...but her...\"bongos\" are not all that exciting...Mai on the other hand is...va va voom!\" Drez in his typical manner thought to himself as well. Once again, the difference between those so called \"authors\" was visible again.<br>\r\n\"Well, we are authors, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"Authors?\" Tea asked, having no clue what was supposed to be so special about an author.<br>\r\n\"Long story short, we authors decide about your fate!\" Drez interrupted.<br>\r\n\"!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n\"Tsk. See? Now you scared them.\" Sith sighed.<br>\r\n\"You\u00b4re...Gods?!\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn\u00b4t call ourselves Gods...we just happen to be powerful beings, controlling your world in a certain way. That\u00b4s the power...of fanfiction!\"<br>\r\n\"The power of GTS fanfiction!\"<br>\r\n\"???????\"<br>\r\n\"We decide whenever a girl in your world grows, you know. Whenever we want to see our vore fantasies being fulfilled!\" Drez explained proudly.<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what you\u00b4re talking about...\" Yugi said.<br>\r\n\"No need to worry, lad. We\u00b4re here to help you.\" Sith told the young duelist.<br>\r\n\"So now for Joey...\" Sith said, looking up at Mai\u00b4s bare belly, which was rumbling loudly, therefore causing the skin shake slightly. <br>\r\n\"Ouch...it\u00b4s getting uncomfortable in there.\" Drez said.<br>\r\nJust then, Joey\u00b4s voice could be heard faintly, coming out of Mai\u00b4s belly.<br>\r\n\"Hey, everyone? I\u00b4m still inside Mai! Get me outta here! The miasma in there is terrible! And the stench and the fumes are making me high...ugh...!\"<br>\r\n\"So he wants to get out of her stomach. Looks like you were wrong, Drez. He\u00b4s not a vorarephile.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...stupid beginner. Can\u00b4t even stand the fumes of a female stomach!\"<br>\r\n\"Heck, it\u00b4s his first time inside a stomach! Besides, I\u00b4ve seen some fairly nice stomachs, admittedly.\" Sith said.<br>\r\n\"I bet you have. Believe me, I\u00b4m sure you have!\"<br>\r\nSo Sith and Drez knew what to do now. The most dangerous task possible, and yet a cakewalk to experienced people like them.<br>\r\n\"Mai, would you allow us to get into your stomach?\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! ARE YOU CRAZY?!\"<br>\r\n\"No, we\u00b4re being serious. It\u00b4s our job, after all.\"<br>\r\n\"Rescuing people from female stomachs?\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Quite a satisfying job, though.\"<br>\r\n\"And...you\u00b4re sure you\u00b4ll be able to get him out of my stomach?\"<br>\r\n\"Definitely. So, will you allow us to take the path down your esophagus?\"<br>\r\n\"...yes.\" the blond giantess finally said. Mai somehow didn\u00b4t trust them, but there was no other way to get Joey out of her stomach without too much embarrassment and humiliation for the poor teen. Neither the rear exit nor the part that included vomiting seemed to be that promising for Joey. So trusting these mysterious strangers was her only choice.</span></div></div>",

IT\u00b4S BEAUTIFUL! IT\u00b4S JUST LIKE WHEN I...\" Drez wanted to exclaim, but he was quickly interrupted by his annoyed partner.<br>\r\n\"You don\u00b4t have to tell me THAT story all over again, ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey! It\u00b4s an all time classic tale! Involving me entering that certain girl\u00b4s...\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID I SAY?! No womb stories!

Cool your jets!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh man...I surely am into endosomatophilia, I admit that, but not like...that.\"<br>\r\nAs Sith explained his thoughts on that more than strange fetish he and obviously, his partner as well, was \"addicted\" to, he took a look around in their new surroundings. In some ways, it shared a resemblance to Mai\u00b4s stomach, but only a slight resemblance, though. The organic chamber itself was incredibly huge, making the two \"passengers\" inside Mai\u00b4s body seem almost insignificant. The walls of Mai\u00b4s womb had an organic, pinkish color, typical for the insides of a human body, and yet it seemed so strange...unlike anything Sith had ever seen of a girl\u00b4s insides. And honestly, he saw a lot, an awful lot. From the brain to the heart, he explored some girls\u00b4 bodies in the most intimate way possible, all for the sake of the fascination Sith had for these voyages. He didn\u00b4t know why his partner was so fascinated about the exploration of female bodies, but he at least thought his intentions were roughly the same.<br>\r\n\"Say, what girl\u00b4s womb in that \"classic tale\" did you enter, by the way?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must know that it was more than once, but in the one I wanted to tell...well, you know those gorgeous female participants of the DOA tournament?

I\u00b4m not some perv!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. Let\u00b4s just concentrate on our mission. Finding Joey won\u00b4t be a cakewalk.\"<br>\r\nAs both already realized, Mai\u00b4s womb indeed was huge, so finding Joey would not be easy. Or so they thought.<br>\r\n\"Hey, look who\u00b4s there!\" Drez suddenly exclaimed, pointing at a certain spot inside Mai\u00b4s womb.<br>\r\n\"So much for the difficulty of finding our friend here.\" Drez mockingly said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"<br>\r\nAnnoyed, Sith looked at Joey who was...</span></div></div>",

He just hated that part of his job, being inside a girl\u00b4s womb. That place belonged to unborn children, not to body explorers. There are many other, more pleasant places for him to explore inside a girl\u00b4s body, after all. And besides, being inside a womb was somehow offending the host in an intimate way, he thought, even more than being within her heart or her brain. It\u00b4s not that he cared about Mai\u00b4s intimacy, though, she was not exactly a girl he really likes. Sith was someone who preferred girls like Tea, in order to stay in the Yugi-verse. More decent and innocent, yet beautiful girls. So Mai was kinda the opposite of his ideal picture of a girl. Drez\u00b4 preferences, on the other hand, were a completely different case, of course. Sith even thought that he and Mai would get along perfectly fine and would make a nice couple.<br>\r\nQuickly getting rid of those thoughts (and predictions?), Sith finally pulled the trigger, causing them to finally leave their host...or so he wished. Because nothing, absolutely nothing happened at all. No strange beam was emanating from the gun, as Sith had hoped, instead the gun didn\u00b4t seem to work at all.<br>\r\n\"In the name of...?! What the heck does that mean?!\"<br>\r\nAlthough Sith had explanation for the gun not working at that moment, it appeared to him that there was some kind of natural or physical law mankind had not discovered yet (not even by a genius like Thomas Edison...ahem): whenever Sith absolutely, positively want something to happen, whenever it seems he\u00b4s having luck, the complete opposite will eventually happen.<br>\r\nThat happened more than once on his many adventures with his partner, and that was the case now as well.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sith-Lord? What\u00b4s the matter?\"<br>\r\n\"What\u00b4s the matter?! Well, looks like fate hates me!\" he exclaimed, throwing the gun onto the soft ground of Mai\u00b4s womb. <br>\r\n\"Ah, so it doesn\u00b4t work...again.\"<br>\r\n\"Aw, shut up!\"<br>\r\n\"Does that mean we\u00b4re trapped inside Mai?\" Joey asked, with an expression that was a mix of fear and joy.<br>\r\n\"I don\u00b4t know.

But it won\u00b4t be easy, I can tell you.\" Sith added.<br>\r\n\"It CAN be easy.\" Drez mysteriously interfered.<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Think, Sith. We\u00b4re inside her womb, right? So...can\u00b4t we take the short, obvious route out of her...you-know-what?\" he said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"I WON\u00b4T GET OUT THROUGH HER YOU-KNOW-WHAT, SICKO!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, calm down, buddy!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since both Joey and his at times annoying yet straight forward get-the-job-done GTS traveller (what kind of job IS that, anyway?) called Drez were already gone, good old Sith was standing alone on this almost girly pink ground, feeling the flesh moving up and down very slightly beneath his shoes. He couldn\u00b4t help but laughing at that moment, with his favourite insane, Albedo Piazzola like laughter (you know what I\u00b4m talking about).<br>\r\n\"Mwahahahahahahahahahahaha! At last I can do things my way! Hehehehehe! Not the puss--- I mean the I-know-what, but an unforgettable journey! Hahahahahaha! Finally, things are going well for me!\"<br>\r\nYes, yes, so he thought. This time everything seemed to be going HIS way, being able to know the arrogant female duelist better than anyone else, thus from the inside (who would really want that other than him?), instead of escaping quickly but being covered in some slimy, sticky substance in the process. That made him shudder, despite his admiration for women in general.<br>\r\nAnyway, with his stupid laughter finally fading away, he pointed with the gun at himself, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Wow...getting outta here and a nice tour in the process. Sounds great to me!\"<br>\r\nSo he pulled the trigger and was hit by some strange beam, engulfing him completely in white light. Destination: brain!<br>\r\nIt could have been so nice. Everything could have gone on as planned. But we\u00b4re talking about Sith, after all, and nothing ever proceeds as planned when he\u00b4s involved. Maybe the poor guy has a talent for misfortune (otherwise he wouldn\u00b4t have landed inside girls\u00b4 stomachs like a thousand times) or is just not lucky. In this case, however, Sith was drawn yet again into a situation that differed completely from his original intentions. Drawn into another (mis-)adventure...<br>\r\nIt took about a single second until Sith found himself being transported out of Mai\u00b4s womb and to his destination. But...as he opened his eyes and looked around, he saw two strange things, to his great dismay. First of all, his surroundings consisted of pure organic substance, typical for the human body. In fact it was like some loooooong corridor, with him being inside this fleshy tube. He could also see some veins running through the flesh, and some other unpleasant details. He also could not see the \"end\" of the tube, it seemed to go on forever. From that, he concluded that he was not inside Mai\u00b4s brain...but elsewhere, at a completely different place. Now the second strange thing he saw made him feel uncomfortable, to say the least. Both Joey and Drez were standing in front of him, looking at him in anger.<br>\r\n\"Hey...guys...you all right?\" he asked, obviously perplexed and scared at the same time...fearing their wrath, especially Drez\u00b4...<br>\r\n\"All right? All right?! Listen, you jerk, what did you do now?! This doesn\u00b4t look like a brain to me!\"<br>\r\n\"You...you are right, of course, hehehehe...\"<br>\r\nSo, nothing new here. Once again, things went on completely differently from Sith\u00b4s intentions. Indeed, he managed to make some grave mistake and lead the group into trouble. Instead of Mai\u00b4s brain, they were now in some random part of her body, without an exact idea where this strange, organic place was.<br>\r\n\"Well, \"Darth\", what on earth went wrong this time?\"<br>\r\nLooking at the gun, Sith realized immediately what kind of mistake he made, and he was embarrassed to say the least.<br>\r\n\"Oops! I forgot to type in the coordinates! Looks like it took us to some place inside Mai randomly....funny...huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes...very funny...you idiot!!!!!\" Drez said, angered at his partner\u00b4s failure.<br>\r\nJoey, despite his boastful and reckless nature, remained calm, once again overwhelmed by these two guys\u00b4 behavior. Everything started with Mai claiming to be a gigantic goddess...and now he ended up inside his goddess, with an attempt to rescue him turning out to be a disaster, bringing him deeper into trouble...although he had to admit that it felt exciting as he looked at the contracting, organic walls of the \"living\" corridor. Being inside the girl he had a crush on was more fascinating that he thought at first, and so, he didn\u00b4t really understand why Drez was so upset.<br>\r\n\"Calm down, pal! We\u00b4ll find a way out of here, don\u00b4t worry!\"<br>\r\n\"That\u00b4s what you always say...oh man. I wanted to take the quick and easy path, but no...our Sith Lord obviously wanted to screw everything up again.\"<br>\r\n\"That hurts...\"<br>\r\nAnnoyed by his situation, and annoyed by his organic surroundings as well (especially by the rushing sound of Mai\u00b4s blood, as well as the overly loud thumping of her heart), Drez looked at Joey, having a small yet maybe effective plan.<br>\r\n\"Joey, you have any cards with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm...yes, of course! Why are you asking?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe one of your Duel Monsters could help us correct my pal\u00b4s mistake...\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up, ya nincompoop!\" Sith interrupted, something Drez didn\u00b4t care about.<br>\r\n\"So, do you think any of your monsters has the ability to help us get out here faster? Walking through the tunnels and tubes of Mai\u00b4s insides would certainly take a looooong time, you know.\"<br>\r\nThinking hard, Joey thought about every single card he had, examining whether they could be useful or not. After a few moments, he cam up with a result.</span></div></div>",

Mai found it so cute that even though she was a hundred times as big as Joey he still had that same prideful stupidity that made him oh so cute. <br>\r\n\u201cPoor little Joey, didn\u2019t you like my big Goddess tummy?\u201d She said in a baby voice, the tone did nothing to diffuse Joey\u2019s ire.<br>\r\n\u201cNo I did enjoy your stomach, I fell down into your intestines briefly and I saw something\u2019s that will take a lot of therapy to forget.\u201d Joey still had the creeps from seeing piles of semi-digested gunk bigger then him.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange, most men tell me I\u2019m really clean up there.\u201d Mai said innocently enough. Joey blushed and started to sputter when he heard this comment, apparently he wasn\u2019t completely ready for new XXX Mai.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t believe me? I\u2019ll show you.\u201d With that, Mai\u2019s hand dropped down below her waist. Joey took hold of Mai\u2019s middle finger and held on for dear life with his eyes close at the sudden drop in altitude. When he opened his eyes he was staring at Mai\u2019s almost house sized clothed butt. Joey stared long and hard at the large buttocks that were pushing out Mai\u2019s pants almost to the breaking point. He could see the rounded curves of it from all angels. From the tightness of the pants, Joey surmised that Mai must have been wearing a G-strip to prevent her panties lines from showing. With Joey\u2019s full attention on her rear Mai slipped her fingers under her Waist banded and dropped her pants to her knees. When Joey saw the huge ass naked he could almost swear that it was glowing with a heavenly luminosity.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think Joey, am I clean down there? Maybe you need a closer look.\u201d Mai started to reach her hand towards the two perfect orbs; Joey could feel his pulse rise and his blood drop down to his more private region. When his fingers brushed against the delicate skin of the ass, Mai swiftly raised her hand to her face and laughed hysterically at the downtrodden look in Joey\u2019s eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry Wheeler, but you should know that women get off from having their twats and tits touched not their asses. Tell you what if you get me revving up with a good massage to my goodies then I\u2019ll let you jump around my ass crack all day. What ya say Wheeler you man enough to make me happy or are you like so many men, quick to the draw.\u201d Joey looked Mai in her big purple six by six eye and with poise pointed right at her.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make you so week in the knees you\u2019ll need crutches to walk strait.\u201d Mai grinned at that, if Joey was as good at sex as he was at being pretentious, then he\u2019d be the greatest lover alive today.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yugi and all the males around got a bleeding nose as they watched.  Mai began to writhe on the ground as Joey went faster with his massage.

Mai went wild, with screams of pleasure that broke several windows in buildings.  <br>\r\n     \"Joey..you..are..GOoD!\"  yelled Mai.  That was when Mai cummed, and her scream of pleasure was enough to shatter eardrums.  Joey was covered in Mai's cum from head to toe.  He had also cummed.

Mai watched in pleasure as Joey carefully climbed down her breast, taking hold of her firm yet soft boob flesh to ascend down to her throbbing tit. When he was a few feet from it, he dropped down landing squarely on it. For Joey this was a frightful experience, if he lost his grip or slipped he would plummet a hundred feet to the ground with nothing to stop him but cement. What really made it hard to stay on was the fact that he was covered in the sweet, but more importantly slippery cum of his Goddess; also, the hardened rod between his legs didn\u2019t make lying down too easily.  With all his strength being used to hold an airtight grip on the hardened tit, he didn\u2019t have much left over to do anything else, but Mai didn\u2019t care. For Mai her orgasm had left her tits feeling sensitive and tender, Joey\u2019s almost clothesline pin like grip was just what Mai needed to get her second orgasm going. Puffing for breath, Mai\u2019s chest heaved up and down bouncing Joey around on his only source of staying elevated. As he bounced, Joey\u2019s already aroused prick rubbed furiously around the bumpy ridges of Mai\u2019s tit. Needing a little more to reach her second ground breaking orgasm, Mai reached for her left breast that was adjacent to the one Joey had startled and lifted it up to her mouth. Mai then proceeded to suck her own vast teat. While sucking her own tit her other breast bounced around more sharply as Mia\u2019s movements became more errant. Joey would have feared for his life if not for the fact that he was a few thrusts away from his own orgasm, which blinded him from his impending doom. As thou in sync with one another, Mai reached her orgasm at the same time as Joey. Mai\u2019s juices pored out into the street adding the puddle already formed earlier creating almost a small lake. Joey\u2019s orgasm was a little bit less spectacular, a small drizzle of white semen ran down Mai\u2019s tit and dripped a few drops into her already lake of cum. With all his energy gone Joey, now looking like a thousand year mummy became limp and tumbled off his perch. His last thought before exhaustion took hold was that this wasn\u2019t a bad way to die. Mai a little weary herself from coming so hard not once, but twice looked down to congratulate the man that had brought her to heaven and given her the tour not once, but twice.<br>\r\n\u201cWell Wheeler looks like you can back up what you say,\u201d that was when Mai noticed that she was talking to her naked tit. As Joey fell towards his doom, Mai saw her recent lover fall and tried to catch him before his unforeseen death.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She rubbed the sleep from her eyes and welcomed a new day of her gigantism with a loud yawn. By leaning back against a small apartment building she was able to get to her feet and stumble around still half asleep. She was stopped when she felt something crunch under her feet. Blurred eyed she looked down at the crushed remains of someone\u2019s car. Shrugging her shoulders at her careless destruction, Mai stretched out working the kinks out of her body. While stretching her entire body she felt something press into her anus and get pulled inside her rectum. Remembering the sleeping boy who had been in their yesterday, Mai got a wanton grin and let the small object currently lodged inside her stay, after all she had to show Wheeler the inside of her incredible ass for him to really appreciate it. <br>\r\n\u201cHey loyal slaves where are you?\u201d Mai called out to everyone. Three widows from the apartment that Mai had been leaning against opened up and one by one a different person popped. From the first window, Tea and Yugi peeped out with looks that Mai recognized as the look that all boys and girls get after they get their cherries popped. Mai gave the couple the thumbs up; it was always a good thing when couples had unprotected sex. Mai reminded herself to talk to Tea later, she wanted the entire scoop on how little Yugi is in the sack and if having Yami inside Yugi\u2019s head made it a threesome. From the window next to Yugi and Tea\u2019s was the equally naked couple of Tristan and Serenity, although they looked happy they were also casting nervous glances for something. It took Mai a moment to realize that they were looking for Joey. Not because they were worried about him, they were afraid what he\u2019d do to Tristan when he found out he\u2019d banged his sister last night. It was at this time Mai became certain that having Joey inside her was best for everyone. From the final window, the lonely figure of the nameless teen appeared, but even though he was alone he wasn\u2019t looking all that upset. It probably had to do with the three empty bottles of the cum he\u2019d cleaned up last night. Mai had no idea what he\u2019d done with those three bottles, but whatever it was it looked like he enjoyed it.<br>\r\nWhile everyone got dressed and cleaned up any messes in the apartments they\u2019d commandeered, Mai took the time to toy with her anal toy. Every chance Joey got he\u2019d try to scramble towards Mai\u2019s anus and escape the tight and steamy confines of her rectum. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t like the not crap smelling pop chute, it was that on the out side there was so much, like Mai\u2019s tits, Mai\u2019s twat, Mai\u2019s silky thighs. So much to explore and so little semen. When Joey neared the exit Mai would clamp down her rectal muscles and pull him back near her colon. By the time everyone was out, Joey had figured out that Mai was calling the shots and she would decide when he leaves.<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone have a fun night?\u201d Mai asked her assembled party of worshipers. Everyone blushed and found something interesting to look at on the ground. With her party here Mai started to plan out her day. She could gather more slaves and start creating her Maitopia or she could take her current slaves and have a nice picnic and play with her Wishes card for today. Create a new world order or have kinky sex? Decisions, decisions, decisions.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Yes.<br>\r\n      \"Okay, listen up\" said Mai.  \"I'm going to take over the world.

She was currently laying on her 15 block long extra soft futon in the middle of the newly renamed Mai town. She was going to get a bed but her slaves in construction told her they\u2019d have to demolish a few forests first before they had the material. Mai had been very understanding when she heard this; she only ate one of her construction slaves.<br>\r\nOver the week, she learned a very important lesson, the wishes card can only offer one wish a day, making frivolous wishes something that Mai couldn\u2019t afford. She had found ruling of earth to be an easy thing, the only sign of major resistance had come when some country that Mai couldn\u2019t remember tried to drop the bomb on her. Luckily, she hadn\u2019t used up her wish for that day and she had sent her gift right back to its contributor. Now all Mai did to the small resistance was stomp them out, literally. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be the queen.\u201d Mai reached over her futon where Yugi and Tea were sitting and picked both of them up and dropped them right above her billowing breasts. The young couple had remained close after their first night together and had officially gone steady, not that it stopped Mai from taking liberties with the two whenever her wanton desires occurred.<br>\r\n\u201cMinister of clit massage, can you tell me how my slaves in eastern Japan are doing?\u201d Mai asked in the regal voice she had been practicing with.<br>\r\n\u201cVery good my Goddess, they say it will be another day before they complete your personal dildo,\u201d Yugi responded.<br>\r\n\u201cChief secretary of tit licking, how goes the campaign in china of having a statue of me build exactly in my height?\u201d This project was high on Mai\u2019s agenda, how could people far away worship her if they didn\u2019t have a life-sized model to fear and lust after.<br>\r\n\u201cIt goes slowly, whenever they start on the chest it causes the entire statue to collapse because of the immense weight,\u201d Tea said. Mai nodded again, she could understand how that could happen. Mai smiled down at her mini slaves, she would never tell any of her lesser slaves this but Serenity, Joey, Tristan and even what\u2019s his face Kelly or something were her only real friends. Being so big and feared get pretty lowly. For a moment Mai thought about pulling Joey out of her rectum, he\u2019d been in there since her first day as Goddess. Then she reconsidered, he made her feel all gooey inside when he moved around her narrow intestines. No, what she needed was a person her equal in size for at least one night. An idea formed in Mai\u2019s head then; why not use her wish to grow Tea or Yugi? But which one? Tea and her could have some girl time together and maybe show Yugi what two skyscraper sized girls can do or Yugi could finally show her his talents in bed, Tea wouldn\u2019t stop talking about the thing he does with his tongue.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By planting her knees firmly on the ground, Mai would pull herself up until only the head remained inside her, then the process would happen again. <br>\r\nUnlike earlier, this coupling was much more intense and small quakes were rocking the city of Maitopia. To the people of the city this was an obvious sign to return to their homes, barricaded themselves in, and hope to God that this wasn\u2019t the day that Mai\u2019s wanton lust causes the city to collapse.

Whatever it was that was shutting down the reasoning part of Tea\u2019s brain, it was making her do rash and unsafely things. One of which was walking to her boy friends thigh and crawling up it to get a better look at the sex play close up. Tea walked up the thigh, stopping a few feet away from where the thigh ended and the crotch started. <br>\r\nShe could see the massive pillar of an erection being sucked up by the pink lips of Mai\u2019s sex, just before the lips would spit it out and return high above.

The pharaoh and Mai, having nothiced nothing of this,  continued to make love.  Mai's vagina was dripping with her cum, mixed with the pharoah's.  Tea was covered by cum.  That's when a tidal wave of the pharoah's cum washed over Tea.  Tea was gasping for breath, and got a mouthful of the pharoah's delicious cum.  After that, Mai cummed one more time as well, leaving Tea looking like a drowned rat.  The Pharoah pulled out his prick for the last time, and Tea managed to grab it this time. The gigantic prick was still rock-hard when the pharoah rolled over and panted.  Tea was licking the remaining cum on the pharoah's prick.<br>\r\n      \"You know how to please a woman\" said Mai, cuddling with the pharaoh.<br>\r\n       \"That was the best sex I ever had\" said the pharoah.  Mai nodded.  The two giant people kissed one another and was soon fast asleep.<br>\r\n       \"Lucky for me Yugi is still a giant for 21 hours\"  said Tea. \"I still have time to play with this giant prick\"<br>\r\n       The Pharoah's prick was bigger than Tea, even when it was limp.  Tea's eyes examined every inch of the biggest cock she had ever seen.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sticky and extremely horny, Tea pulled her arms away from her boyfriend limp cock and scaled down till her feet reached his recently emptied ball sack. Her feet lightly sank down into the winkled bag of flesh as she gazed up at the fallen tower that was lying before her. For a moment, the thought of raising this behemoth seemed like an impossible endeavor, but Tea reminded herself that she had nothing to lose by trying. Seeing that her wet loincloth would only slow her down, it were quickly discarded leaving the formerly semi nude girl completely bear.  Taking one last big breath, Tea preceded to walk across the fallen membrane to the glistening head that lied at its end.<br>\r\nShe walked strait across the cock feeling the foreskin under her feet and smelling the almost blinding smell of sex. Her brisk walk ended when she steeped onto the head that was sitting almost dead on Yugi\u2019s thigh. Trying to think of a way to awaken the beast, Tea straddled the side much like Joey had last week with Mai\u2019s tit. She leaned forward and stuck her tongue out, getting at the little bit of cum she\u2019d missed earlier. Its musky taste reenergized Tea and gave her a needed confidence; she was going to taste the new stuff.<br>\r\nEven as she licked the head around it's sides, the lips around the cock's opening pulled back slightly and a new dropped formed. Still asleep, Yugi started to moan lightly. Tea started to run her hands along the length of the giant cock, reaching from one end to the other in slow stroking movements. More pre-cum covered her hands and arms, giving her fresh lubrication to grind against the cock. As she caressed the cock, it occurred to her that although her arms weren\u2019t wide enough to grip it entirely around, her long silky legs could definitely reach roughly around. A brilliant idea then occurred to Tea, that made her smile and made her already dripping twat wetter. Wrapping her legs around firmly around the foreskin under the head, Tea pushed her hips up and down. The foreskin was pulled up Yugi\u2019s cock and down it in a stroking manner. This act brought his cock to life fully, blood pumped quickly into it, making rise up with Tea still on top with her legs wrapped around. Tea tightened her legs around her pedestal and watched as she was lifted nearly twenty feet in the air on the world\u2019s biggest prick. Once sturdy, Tea continued moving her hips up and down, pumping her boyfriend into an orgasm. Noticing that her mouth was free, she moved back to the slit. Her tongue may have been the size of a pin to Yugi, but it's hot little caress on the sensitive head of his cock made his sleep moans even louder. The slit was bigger than Tea\u2019s mouth so she easily was able to stick her tongue in and lick along the inside edges getting a little bit more cum for her growing appetite. Pre-cum gushed out and drenched most of her face but she loved every second of it. After she had cleaned the edge of the slit several times, Tea took her right hand and stuck several fingers into the slit.  Her hand pushed into a deposit of still coming pre-cum, she marveled at the gooey sensation as it covered her hand and escaped past the slit.  It was well lubricated and as she slowly sunk her whole hand into it she wondered if the sensation of the wet, soft tissue pressing against her hand was anything like that of what Yugi felt when he fist banged her twat. She pulled out making a wet popping sound as her fist left, she brought her drenched hand down to her own sex and practically rammed it into her twat. She screamed from the intense pleasure from her fist pushing all that think semen into her cunt. Clinging with her hands and wrapping her legs around tighter, Tea screamed like a mad woman at the almost insane sex that was taking place. The scream didn\u2019t jut signal her own orgasm, but also awake Mai who had been slumbering beside Yugi.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mai didn\u2019t see Tea for a number of reasons, for one she was completely nude and her body blended in perfectly with the prick. Secondly, Mai was still drowsy from sleeping and could only see vague shapes, like a hard prick below her. And lastly, she was so hungry for sex she only cared that there was hard meat for her to go at. Most men don\u2019t last two round, but Yugi seemed to be able to put on two very good performances and have enough left over to get a hard-on in his sleep. Mai crawled down to Yugi\u2019s waist and puckered her lips; Yugi was going to get a nice awakening.<br>\r\nTea ridded and humped her massive ride, she knew an orgasm was coming soon and she wanted at whit rainfall to cover her. So preoccupied was she that she never noticed that her light was being blocked out by Mai\u2019s huge face. Tea groaned and buckled against the huge membrane, her nerves were shot from all the pleasure surging through her body. Her dripping twat leaked her juices along the pole creating more lubricate for her body to further use to please herself and her slumbering man. Before she could reach her second orgasm, she felt something big and spongy press down on her. She caught a glimpse of Mai\u2019s big puffy red lips, just before they opened and Mai sucked in the head Yugi\u2019s prick along with half of Tea\u2019s body. When she found herself pinned between Mai\u2019s lip, Tea let her legs come off the cock and start kicking around franticly. Still unaware of Tea\u2019s presence, Mai looked up at the awaken Pharaoh with mischievous eyes. She plunged her mouth half way down his meat stick taking with her all of Tea.<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, Mai!\u201d Yugi screamed as Mai teased his cock with a few light sucks. The small suction had an even greater affect on Tea, who went flying around Mai\u2019s mouth. She flailed around helplessly grapping at the solid cock resting on the tongue under her .Tea screamed and begged for help as she was thrown around like a rag doll.<br>\r\n\u201cMai! Yugi! Help!\u201d She screamed, but no one could hear her. Finally, the sucking stopped and Tea dropped just in front of Yugi\u2019s cock at the back of Mai\u2019s throat. When she looked over her shoulder, her blood ran cold. The black ominous gorge like throat pulsated with life not a foot from where Tea was sitting. The world shook around Tea, she looked forward to see the retreating cock pull out of the mouth leaving her stranded on Mai\u2019s tongue. Yugi\u2019s face framed by Mai\u2019s teeth was the last thing Tea saw before Mai closed her mouth, trapping Tea in the black soaked mouth of the unaware Goddess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cJesus Mai, you sure do know how to wake a guy up.\u201d Yugi had been having this wonderful dream where Tea was giving him a hand job, maybe after his twenty-four hours were up he could ask his girlfriend to make his dream a reality. Speaking of Tea, where was the girl? He hadn\u2019t seen her since he became Mai\u2019s size. For a moment of dread, Yugi feared he and Mai might have crushed the girl in their fit of passion. When he saw no blood stain near by Yugi relaxed, she was probably safe in one of the many empty buildings perfectly safe.<br>\r\n\u201cActually, you were already up when I found you.\u201d Mai stopped talking, something was inside her mouth that was bumping around. She was going to inspect what it was, but Yugi started to talk again and she forgot about it for now.<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa that tongue of yours feels so good, where did you learn how to do it?\u201d Yugi asked. If Tea could learn to do half the things that Mai does, then he wound never have to worry about their sex life getting dull.<br>\r\n\u201cYears of experience are the only good teacher.\u201d Yugi gave a Mai a befuddled look. Mai flashed him her award winning and fear-inspiring smile.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you thought I was a virgin?\u201d Mai asked. Yugi shrugged at the question.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I just thought that, you know, you only showed your sexual side to those you love,\u201d Yugi said with genuine sincerity. Mai laughed at what he\u2019d said, the thing in her mouth bounced around hitting the top of her mouth before falling back to her tongue.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve slept with men for giving me rides, I\u2019ve slept with men on dares, I\u2019ve slept with men because I was drunk, but sleeping with men because of love, not so much.\u201d Yugi looked a little hurt at her comment and looked away briefly, then turned back to Mai with a determined look in his eye.<br>\r\n\u201cSo why\u2019d you sleep with me?\u201d He asked furiously. Mai\u2019s smile changed from being that of a wanton sex fiend to that of a warm caring woman.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I like you Yugi, I like you a lot. Maybe, I need to show you just how much.\u201d Mai\u2019s smile disappeared and was replaced with her opening her mouth in a great big \u2018O\u2019, then she went down again on Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much more I can take,\u201d Tea spoke weakly. She was sore from being ricocheted around Mai\u2019s mouth when the giant had laughed. Her ears were ringing from Mai\u2019s heartfelt speech that was being said on high stereo behind her.  Tea was about to collapse from exhaustion when everything turned sixty degrees. She was flung towards Mai\u2019s mouth with the expectance of being smashed against her rock hard teeth, when the mouth opened and she landed in on the head of Yugi\u2019s squashy cock head. Everything was going to work out, Tea thought as she held on to her ride. If she held on till this was over, she\u2019d be safe from Mai\u2019s hungry mouth. Tea held on, even when the dick passed the tongue and went right down Mai\u2019s throat.  Tea gawked at the slippery pink walls that hugged the cock with such strength. A rumble sounded from above and Tea realized that the cock slit was pointing strait at her, if Yugi blew, she\u2019d be thrown directly down Mai\u2019s throat. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mai listened interestedly as they threw around some ideas like deep frying an entire cow or baking the largest cookie. They were all good ideas but all of them took time and Mai\u2019s metabolism had already burned through the fruit. Seeing only one solution, Mai reached into her cleavage and pulled out her first slave, he\u2019d pulled down his pants and Mai had to admit, if she\u2019d been her normal height he would have been very impressive.<br>\r\n\u201cForget about it slaves, I\u2019ve already my meal.\u201d Lifting the slave over her head, Mai tilted her head back and opened wide, Her grip loosened and the teen went plummeting down. His screams were cut off when he landed in Mai\u2019s mouth and she clamped her jaws shut. His body was rolled around by Mai\u2019s tongue as the blond toyed with her meal. He kicked and threw his fists as he tried to over power Mai\u2019s much bigger and stronger tongue. What really surprised Mai about this whole situation was when she felt something salty hit her tongue; She smiled around the struggling boy at the familiar taste of semen. Knowing that her slave had at least got a small reward for his trouble, Mai tilted her tongue back and let the small morsel slide down her throat. Joey and the rest watched in hushed horror as they saw a small twitching lump go down Mai\u2019s neck and disappeared under her breasts.<br>\r\n\u201cMai did you really just eat that kid?\u201d A very shocked Yugi asked.

She frowned at the horrified expressions on the faces of everyone and started to reconsider what she had just done. Then an idea hit her. The wishes card could resurrect her snack with just a word, but did she really want that? Maybe just for the teen, after all he was a loyal servant. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could feel inside her all there bodies being pushed around in her stomach acids, there weak struggles as they succumbed to death from the burning acids or suffocation.

Everyone had left the street after she had first lumbered onto it in search of her friends. Not a soul was out and the only sound was coming from the distance where people still went on with their days unaware of the all mighty Goddess that had entered the picture. Mai was planning to break the news to them shortly.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat to do now?\u201d Mai pondered as she used a small building as a seat. Crushing in all its windows and leaving a massive butt impression on the roof. With all the power she had she could literally do anything. Turn the entire world into a bunch of willing slaves through a wish for mind control was one of Mai\u2019s first ideas, but that one was quickly scrapped. If people lost their free will then what would be the point of being an all powerful Goddess? Sure, control was nice, but having a world of mindless zombies bowing was going to get old real quick. <br>\r\nAfter taking into account all the options, Mai came to the decision that she\u2019d only use the Wishes card for growth and resurrection for now. Later she could have some real crazy fun, but for now being two hundred feet high was good enough.<br>\r\n\u201cBut what to do now?\u201d Mai asked herself. In the distance, she could hear the busting metropolis; maybe it was time they got to meet the real Mai via a stomping spree. Then Mai saw the Kaiba Corp building a few blocks away, maybe scarring the bejesus out of Kaiba would be fun. As she weighed her options her stomach groaned as its contents emptied into her intestines. Mai looked down at her own body with a weird sense of absurdity, her body was absorbing her friends as she sat here.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry guys, after I\u2019m done having fun I\u2019ll bring you back,\u201d Mai said even though her friends had been dead for over a minute.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That brat Kaiba needed a good spanking, and Mai was eager to do just that.  People around her started to scream and run away.  Mai grabbed a few people and swallowed them whole.  She liked to eat people now.  Mai hadn't considered that people were so delicious.<br>\r\n       When she got to the KaibaCorp. building, she wondered what to do.  She could hug the building, squishing people with her two van-sized tits. But she was more interested in getting to Kaiba.  Mai peered at the very top of the building, where Kaiba had his office. She saw that Kaiba was there, staring at the gigantic Mai.  Mai smiled and reached for Kaiba, breaking the glass.  She easily grabbed Kaiba and pulled him out of the building.<br>\r\n       \"Let go of me you bitch!\" yelled Kaiba.<br>\r\n        \"You shouldn't cuss at a goddess\" said Mai, pulling Kaiba's clothes off.

Mai smiled, enjoying the rich prick beg for mercy. <br>\r\n       After spanking Kaiba, Mai wondered what else to do to him.  She made up her mind, and tossed Kaiba into her mouth.

Mai swallowed.  <br>\r\n          \"Yummy\" said Mai.  <br>\r\n          Mai then saw Mokuba looking at Mai from Kaiba's office.  She reached for Mokuba, and ate him too.

I heard your entire conversation, and countered your monster. As soon as I heard the tongues, I activated my spell card 'Prohibition,' NEGATING your card before the effect could even begin!\" Bakura was flabbergasted and engulfed in a hellish rage. \"YOU TREACHEROUS LITTLE BRATTY SHE-DEVIL! YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!\" Amy was blushing, she strangely took this rant as affectionate words. \"Awwwwww. I didn't know you cared. Now I assume you think that you will be absorbed in my tummy in minutes. But don't worry, I also activated the defensive spell card 'Yellow Luster Shield.' You both will be alive for a looooooong time on there, slowly feeding me and making me sexier by the day!\" Gently massaging her tummy, Amy became very aroused and fulfilled with her meal. Small bits of air exited her stomach in delicate burps, as she saw a plume of smoke near the edge of the jungle. Curiosity drove her to move closely to the smoke, only to find a sun tanning Mai and a bunch of guys and girls partying like there was no ma\u00c3\u00b1ana. Yogi was the first to catch sight of the new giantess, and stopped dancing. Walking up to her feet, Yugi built up enough courage to introduce himself to her. \"H-hello miss. I-I'm Y-Yugi. What's your name?\" Feeling like she is being treated like a true lady now, Amy blushed, giggled and said \"I'm Amy, cutie!\" she winked at Yugi, causing his heart to soar to unreachable heights. Amy couldn't help but ask, \"Who is that in the bikini sunbathing?\" Yugi could answer that easily. \"That's Mai. I'm sure she'll like you!\" Mai heard the conversation and got up to see the new girl on the beach. Both looked and scanned each other's bodies, eventually saying at the same time, \"You look gorgeous!\" Amy felt welcome, the first time in a long time. Tears of joy began welling up in Amy's eyes. Her happiness led to a great question in her mind. \"could I stay with you guys? I have nowhere else to go.\" the guys debated as well as the girls, and reached a unanimous decision of approval. But then, the original search question arose. Joey had the guts to ask, \" have you seen a spiky haired freak witha winged staff and a maniac with a spiky necklace around?\" Amy was happy to answer,\" I have seen them and I have them right here.\" she placed her hand on her tummy, rubbing and patting it in satisfaction. The guys applauded and the girls were whistling in happiness. Amy then said, \"mind if I join you, Mai?\" Mai was happy, replying, \"go ahead Amy! You've earned it!\" with that Amy laid down next to Mai and they began sunbathing again. The sound of music was in the air and the dancing of happy guys and girls continued. Q new friend was made and a new adventure awaited them.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, Mai's hand shot out towards the groaning psycho. Ryan could do nothing as the giantess' hand grabbed him by the collar and lifted him in the air. The strangest thought Mai eger had was surging through her mind. \"On second thought, he does look tasty. Oh well, I guess it can't hurt to try. Ryan shot out of his trance, only to find himself face-to-face with a beautiful, but hungry giantess. For a few seconds, Ryan stared into Mai's eyes, becoming completely hypnotized by her beauty. He didn't even see Mai opening her mouth to take him in. \"Here we go\" was all that Mai said before she began what might change her life as a giantess forever.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ryan's eyes were so focused on Mai, making him easy for Mai to bring him close to her lips. A warm and humid gust blew into Ryan, breaking his spell. Rapidly turning his head a few times, he couldn't see the cause of the gust. It was only after a second burst that Ryan got a clue. Slowly turning his head, he realised his danger. Ryan was staring into the wide open mouth of a giantess; 'she was going to eat him!' Panic and terror raged in Ryan's body, but it was too late. Mai brought Ryan into her mouth up to his waist, then quickly closed her lips, going to suck him in. Mortal terror was dominating Ryan, as Mai slowly began sucking on his upper half, to prevent any escape attempt. All of Ryan's thrashing was starting to make Mai curious. 'I wonder what he tastes like. I hope he's as yummy as he looks!' So Mai rose her tongue to try and lick the flailing man in her mouth. Back in Ryan's point-of-view, he sees a large dark red mass slowly rising and moving towards his face. He begins to sweat profusely around his torso. His body starts to quiver and shake, when it finally happens. The tip of Mai's tongue touches Ryan's face. Ryan cannot help but scream at the top of his lungs, but this is not heard by anyone. All that anyone could hear was Mai's 'MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm' as she tasted Ryan's face. Mai is processing the taste for not even a fraction of a second when her conclusion was made. 'Delicious! Simply amazing! I feel I need more of him in me. I know I'm going to like this a lot!' With this thought, Mai began to suck harder on Ryan, to enjoy his taste AND to satisfy her strange hunger.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back at Ryan's point-of-view Mai's sucking increased, making it both hard for him to breathe, and causing a lot of his blood to stop flowing. After fifteen seconds of this torment, Ryan finally passed out, this would be the last thing he would ever do. Mai sensed the was done, and moved her tongue under Ryan's upper half, savoring his taste and moving further down the unconscious psycho's body, eventually reaching his feet. Mai then hooked her tongue and brought the motionless, but still alive body, completely into her mouth, and closed it, the taste in her mouth made Mai moan in delight. Mai then began working her tongue around Ryan's body, tossing it and turning it to enjoy the full flavor. Mai was a minute and a half into her enjoyment when her stomach growled, demanding her to swallow her captive. Feeling that she worked her little morsel over quite well, Mai swallowed Ryan, and enjoyed the feeling of him sliding down her throat. Mai could feel every bit of Ryan's little trip, ending with a plop, indicating that Ryan was now in her belly. Mai gasped in delight and placed her hand on her slightly bloated tummy, satisfied. A small bubble exited her stomach, and Mai let out a long, but delicate burp, followed by an innocent giggle The guys watched in amazement, desire, and in some extent, lust, while Brian felt as if his heart would shoot out of his chest. Inside of Mai's tummy, small amounts of acid came oozing out of her stomach, and the walls began to move, letting out a loud gurgling, a little sloshing and a few 'blorps' as the digestion process had started on the once feared lunatic.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the midst of Mai's bodily orchestra she patted her tummy and proceeded to lay down in the nice warm sunlight. \"It's alright if i take a nap now, right?\" Almost completely speechless, all the guys could do was nod and say \"Uh-huh.\" Mai was smiling, replying, \"Thanks guys!\" so Mai took care to lay down gently and silently (excluding the sounds of Mai digesting the 9/10's of what was Ryan the maniac), put on hand on her tummy, rubbing it, and the other under her head. Mai then closed her eyes and dozed off. The guys then walked over to Mai and began to cuddle with her. Yugi was on her stomach, Joey was on her chest, Mokuba was using her hair as a makeshift blanket, while the others used her hips for shade. Brian was being a little kinky, resting on her crotch. If paradise was a dream to many, these young men found it on a giantess' body, and they never wanted to wake if it was as it was said to be. But, on the contrary, this paradise they have is a reality that they only dreamed of.</span></div></div>",

It was one week until the Battle City Tournament,  and Marik smiled evilly. It would be one week until he had all of the God Cards in his hand.  He was holding up the Winged-Dragon of Ra in his hand.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    \"Soon...\" said Marik.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Master\" said one of the Rare Hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes?\" asked Marik, frowning slightly at the robed man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Phase 1 of the DMG Project has been completed\" said the Rare Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Execellent\" said Marik.   \"give me the card\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The Rare Hunter handed Marik a card.  The Dark Magician Girl to be exact.  With the help of his Millenium Rod, Marik would make the Dark Magician Girl come to life. Dark Magician Girl would serve him in defeating the Pharoah at the tournament.  It was a perfect plan; get a Duel Monster to defeat the Pharoah.   He put down the card onto the ground.<br>\r\n        The Millenium Rod glowed as Marik activated its dark magic.  In moments, Dark Magician Girl stood where Marik had put the card on the floor. DMG was aaround 6'0\". Funny, thought Marik.  He thought the  DMG would be smaller than that.  Oh well.  Dark Magician Girl blinked and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Where am I?\" asked the duel monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"With your new master\" said Marik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Master?\" asked DMG.  \"Ha! I have no master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"You do now\" said Marik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Nope\" said DMG, smiling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You will do as I say!\" yelled Marik, holding  up the Millenium Rod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Oh...such a pretty little trinket\" said DMG, looking at Marik's rod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Marik smirked and tried to take over DMG's mind.  But it didn't work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"What?\" asked Marik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"I said I have no master\" said DMG.  \"don't try to control a magician\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        With that, DMG started to grow!   She grew and grew until she was 10 feet tall. She had bumped into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Ouch...\" said DMG.  \"later!\"  With that, DMG vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"COME BACK HERE!\" yelled Marik<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  ****************<br>\r\n   Battle City<br>\r\n *****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    DMG had appeared in a park.

It was obvious to anyone with knowledge of the shadows that something was wrong, even the millenium items were not functioning as they should, yet they were still naive to what was trully occuring. Lost in the shadows for eons you had slowly begun to build power within the dark, and slowly the entire realm was absorbing into your very body. It was impossible for you to gauge your size from the darkness alone, and having devoured every last duel monster in the realm there was no reference. However you would place yourself at a few hundred feet at the very least; based on the apparent size of the wiggles in your belly. With your new found size the ever shrinking realm grows more and more constricting, however you have also begun to see a glimmer of the light beyond. With no desire stronger than freedom you give a powerful mental tug to the darkness, and in an instant the entire Shadow Realm vanishes; opening into a world of light. Unfortunatly you had not estimated wether height would play a part in the transportaion, and you quickly crash down to the distant earth. The fall would have been fatal at your original size, but it is simply a tiny drop at your new size; and you quickly rise back up. After shaking off the dust, and crushed people and cars, from your butt you look around eagier to see what there is to do in your new world.</span></div></div>",

Of course the idea was rediculous but its not like he was short on money and it wouldn't hurt to try. To be honest he'd always wanted to do something like that and the website seemed legitimate enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited what seemed like months for it to come although it was only a week, he just couldn't wait. When it finally came he quickly unwrapped it and ripped through the packaging to find a small device that looked to be something like a tazer.

It the very tornament that Yugi and Kaiba fought agianst Marik two years ago... what was that tornament? Oh forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too excited to see the matches first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Due to a falter of an inconvinence... Mr. Kaiba will now be resigning off the tournaments toward a next contender in the following... thus, now making this a triple-threat elimination rules match, in which tyhe winner will get everything they deserve most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lady stood her ground to see the two contenders that were planing to make an impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First contender... Yugi Moto...\" The crowd cheered rentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second contender... Marik from Egypt...\" once more the crowd was becoming excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the third?!\" The young lady got real angsty, at the mere thought of the third contender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes go by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since no one else plans to take the seat to the absence of Mr. Seto Kaiba, I'm now demeaning match to be one on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!! I want in!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Carrina Moeis. I'm 17, and I wish to be part of this tournament feature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than it's settled... Yugi Moto, Marik, and Carrina Moeis... Let's begin the final sudden death elimination!!\" The crowd cheered even louder this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all getting to see an unexpected match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik had 3200 points to go, Yugi was at a close 3500, and poor Carrina... she was about to be eliminated with a mere 600 points left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Ra... eliminate the girl, so that I may get one step closer to Yugi and the Millenium Puzzle!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firey monster was about to unleash a devastaing blow to a barely intact Carrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast Marik!!\" Yugi made a call that saved Carrina from total destruction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negate Attack!!\" Marik stood in shock. \"But why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be the one to eliminate you... anyway, have you ever wondered what she has under that face-down card?\" Yugi responded, as he pointed to a face-down card that Carrina placed earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the side was a card that could've sealed Marik's fate closed... \"Angel Sanctuary\" A card that was more than capable to protect her life points, at the time that Ra was about to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik wondered what that card was for himself, and why she placed it there... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she trying to protect her life points? NO she's almost out of cards to do so... a monster can be a diffrence though, but which?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Marik... MY TURN!!\" Yugi took out a card that also plan to threaten both Marik and Carrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark Magician... Attack Ra now, while he's weakened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician attacks, and he secures a victory over the first to be eliminated: Marik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't riled himself complaining, he felt relieved... more than complaciant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik then walks to Carrina's corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got the card that can finish little Yugi... what is that card that you were trying so hard to protect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Injection Fairy Lily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! You're trying to use a card such as that?! You could've down right eliminated us then and there... Oh, I see.\" Marik laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he then took his steps to the outside exit, he mentioned some final words to young Carrina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got some serious potential there... you and Fairy of yours, I wouldn't waste it on little Yugi here, go ahead... and unlock that... POTENTIAL!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrina woke up from that dream.... she then felt something warm, and pillowy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked upward, and in a suuden appearence... there she was... a giantess in the form of \"Injection Fairy Lily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fairy...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm here, and I'm more powerful that anything your dreams could wish for... why do you think they restricted my power?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Re-restriced?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now it's time to have some real fun.\" Giggled the Fairy Lily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited as she was, she didn't knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInjection Fairy Lily on the other hand had two to go for...</span></div></div>",
