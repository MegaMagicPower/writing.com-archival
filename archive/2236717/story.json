To his right, Nabiki was sitting trying to work out what had gone on between them, and how she could make a profit from it. Kasumi was the last to sit down, as she'd prepared the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking on the role of replacing their mother. She was demure, respectful, and poured out a small cup of tea for each of her sisters, and the guest Ranma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenma, Ranma's father was absent, as was her own Soun Tendo. Some training, or more likely some hair-brained scheme had left the four of them alone in the house. Well, Ranma glared at Akane's pet pig resting in her lap. She was stroking the tiny P-chan, blissfully unaware that the pig was one of Ranma's rivals. However, Ranma was well aware that behind those piggy eyes, was a human intelligence. Ryoga HIbiki. A curse that he had to admit was partially his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSourly, Ranma thought of his own curse, and how that was his dumb father's fault. A chopstick snapped in his hand, and he looked apologetically to Kasumi. Instantly sorry for giving her any more work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of crashing, fists, and battle cries split the air. The only warning they had before the garden wall was vaulted. A ball of fury crashing down left a crater on the lawn. Narrowly missing the Koi pond. The battling melee ricochetting through the paper thin Shoji door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a cacophony of cries, \"Look Out...\" mixing with \"Die...\" and \"Suffer!\". The roiling ball of fighters, still managed to land blows on each of the diners. Before Ranma shattered them apart with a single punch, sending them crashing, and falling unconscious against the sturdy wooden pillar supporting the roof.</span></div></div>",

Then it fell into place, she wasn't frozen in fury. She'd been hit with the same pinching strikes. She was incapable of movement. Alas, Ranma's body was already in violent motion, when he felt his fingers and toes tingle. They turned numb and immobile, as he crashed into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was unable to look away, as her eyes bore into him. His diving deep into the darkness of her fixed eyes too. He felt a flash of empathy, for the most mercantile of the sisters. Having to manage the household budget, ensure that Kasumi had enough money to buy the food, and that Akane was provided for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew the burden of a negligent father, his own having cursed him with a degrading curse. One too shameful to be revealed, on pain of death. He wished he was a man fully, or even a woman, fully and completely, rather than this flip-flop state where he couldn't rely on anything or anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning reserves from deep within, he was able to close his eyelids and draw on his inner strength.

Something cold must've splashed him as he fell across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she processed that, she knew something else was wrong. She could feel the lacy frills of the bra cups holding her bust in place. Ranma made it a point never to choose to wear 'girly' clothes, and these felt very feminine. The extra width and heft to her hips was no surprise, but she felt the chill touch of satin, rather than his usual plain cotton briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes snapping wide, she was rocked by another shock. As she looked down over her own body... No! His own body slumped over the table. He was moaning, and mumbling softly. She took in her clothes and realised to her shock, that she was in Kasumi's body. Wearing, her apron, and looking down at his former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moan turned into a groan, as her old body turned his head, and looked back at her. From the confusion, it was clearly Kasumi, and she was just as startled and afraid as Ranma himself. There was more than a twinge of jealousy, from both as they looked at their opposite number.</span></div></div>",

She'd knocked the simmering kettle over, and splashed her hand in very warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaping in shock, she stared at it. The slender hand, and delicate fingers, capped with a soft pink nail polish. It was hypnotic, he was so used to being restored with hot water that he was fascinated by the feminine hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frozen expression was shattered, as her wrist was grabbed, and she was pulled into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best wash off, the water before it scars your hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDocilely, she followed, still dazed. But, she obeyed, listening to her former body. The chiding tone of her former body guiding her into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were thrust into the warm soapy water in the kitchen sink. The burning heat disssipating, from the injury. She allowed her former hands to rub back and forth, as if being taught how to wash her hands like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the oddness snapped her back to reality. Her hands froze, slipping out of Kasumi's slippery grip. Ranma mentally reviewed her situation. She was stuck, as a woman. Without any hope of restoration, or much of an idea how she'd been swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the soft caresses of her lingerie stole her thoughts back to what she was wearing. Her apron, marking her as the home-maker. The underwear defining her as womanly. Blushing, Ranma realised that Kasumi was more of a success that she was as a man. Kasumi was a womanly woman, while he'd resolutely failed to be a man among men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" She whispered to Kasumi, who she finally realised was deeply uncomfortable in his body. Standing just wrongly, the discomfort clear from her stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreiving her soapy hands from the water, she guided Kasumi's running them under the cold tap. In moments, Kasumi beamed a grateful smile back. No longer troubled by that disturbing piece of male flesh, she was back on more familiar terrain. Her hands running over her clothes, smoothing out wrinkles, real and imaginary. Ranma caught the slight, but definite squeeze, as she confirmed she once more had a bust, waist and hips. She even blushed slightly, realising her bust was fuller now. Ranma-chan though younger was more developed, and blessed with wider hips, and a more padded rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing her time to adjust, she turned her attention to the dishes, washing them, and setting them aside to drain dry. It was satisfying work, and she found herself humming happily along. A shy kiss on her cheek from her former body made her blush too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought struck him, perhaps something could be learned from this. That if he studied life as Kasumi, as a woman among her kind, that she might become a better man among men on her restoration.</span></div></div>",
