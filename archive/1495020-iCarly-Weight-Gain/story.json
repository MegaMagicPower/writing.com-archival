But, there was one problem they were facing: ideas for the show. Carly was sitting by the computer, browsing the web for new and fresh ideas. However, her stomach was growling from hunger. She was too busy looking around, she didn't even have dinner yet. She browsed around the house for something to eat, but there wasn't much. She remembered that Spencer was went out to the market, as well as run a few errands, so he wouldn't be back for a while. So, she grabbed her purse and went to a local McDonald's to get something to eat. When she went up to the register to order, she asked for a large Big Mac meal, 20 piece chicken nuggets, and a large chocolate shake. The man at the register was shocked to hear her order, even she was shocked. She didn't think about what she was going to order, so it just blurted out! A moment later, the employee brought her food out in a bag, and she left. When she came home, she brought out the food, and ate away. She was eating the big mac first, eating like there was no tomorrow. \"My god, I can't be this hungry, can I,\" she thought to herself, as she finished the large burger. She pulled out the nuggets and started shoving them all in her mouth, one by one, swollowing them in one large gulp. As she was eating her fries, she got a large cup and poured both the soda and milkshake in together, and gulped it down, only stopping to take a breath or to burp. As she finished her meal, she noticed her belly stuck out 2 feet out of her shirt. As she saw this, she thought...</span></div></div>",

Soon, the itis caught up with her, as she plopped down on the couch and slept. She dreamt the most bizarre, but wonderful, dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a normal day in her high school, as Ms. Briggs was taking attendance. When she called on Carly, however, the classroom heard thunderous footsteps, as Carly, looking like Mr. Creosote, walked in the room, but not before getting stuck in the doorframes. She was eating Butterfinger Crisps, at least five bars in each blubbery hand. Her stomach was so large that it was an inch away from where she stood to the desk up front. She had large fatty breasts resting on top of it, with three fat chins resting on them. Her butt was the size of two XL storage containers, which jiggled with every step. Her arms and legs were thick as logs. She walked in to sit down, while pushing desks out of the awy with her large gut. When she sat down, the desk creaked as if she sat on someone. While class resumed, Carly was still eating her candy, finishing off the Butterfinger Crisps, then pulling out more junk food out of he backpack; cheese curls, potato and torilla chips, peanut butter cups, twinkies, donuts, etc. Everyone paid no attention to her, as if it was a normal thing to them. After finishing her snacks, Carly's stomach growled in a tone, like a clock chime. Soon, Ms. Briggs stops her teachings and says, \"Well, its that time again. Class, get the desserts out, it's feeding time.\" Everyone in the room brought out assortments of baked goods, such as cakes, donuts, pies, cupcakes, cookies, as Ms. Briggs brought out a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e the size of a small wedding cake. Carly grabbed as much as she could, and crammed it in her craw, smearing icing on her face, eating like she never ate in a year. As she was eating, the class was chanting, \"Eat, eat, eat, eat, EAT, EAT, EAT!\" Still gorging on the desserts, her stomach was bloating up like bread in an oven, splitting her shirt down the middle. The button of her jeans popped off, making her bloating belly droop down on the floor. Soon, it was time for the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. She grabbed it out of Ms. Briggs' hands and just scarfed it down. Soon, it was all over. The bell rang, and...</span></div></div>",

It was the end of the rainbow for her, as everyone in the cafeteria came up and brought her everything from the BK menu(except anything healthy) and she ate it with pride and gluttony. Piles upon piles of fries, box after box of chicken tenders and chicken fries, burger after burger, sandwich after sandwich. And soon, it was all gone, all inside her stomach, as it had stretched out over two feet more than her last feed. But, it wasn't over. Soon, she saw the main mascot himself, the Burger King, came up to her with the infamous pies, Hershey sundae pie and Butterfinger creme pie, in two large trays, as if it's like a pizza pie of desserts. He places the pies on top of her 3-ton jello mound of a belly and she wastes no time eating them, as her stomach grows bigger than before. But it wasn't just her stomach that grew, but her entire body. And not just growing with fat, but she was also growing taller! Still eating, she grew bigger and bigger, hitting her head against the ceiling, growing more rotund as she binges with pies. She didn't care what was going on, she just wanted more of the pies. Still eating and growing, she breaks through the roof, and grows out of the school, demolishing it with her enlarging bulk. As she ate the last pie, she rubbed her super-sized stomach contently, while sitting on the rubble of what was left of the school, being at least 50 feet tall that is. She didn't care about what she did. No more school, no more homework, no more annoying teachers, and more time to eat. And just like that, her stomach growled in hunger. She struggled to get back up, and stomped around town to find food.</span></div></div>",

Her stomach was so large that it almost hit the street, which would knock over cars and trucks. Her breasts, which were larger than watermelons(if she was human sized), rested on her globular gut. Her butt was wider than before, and when she turn around, her butt would destroy a building. She had a fourth chin break through when she ate her previous meals. Her arms and legs were thicker than an oak tree(again, if human sized). She was licking her lips in extreme hunger as she walked around to see billboards and stores that had images and signs of food. She ripped off the rooftops of fastfood buildings, and grabbed food off of the plates of customers, as well as the food in the kitchen, raw or cooked, she ate it. After cleaning out the stores, she took the signs and pictures from the billboards and buildings and ate them. The taste wasn't any good, but she was too hungry to care. As she scrounged for more food to eat, she saw a parade with lots of balloons. She thought, \"Well, they may not be food, but I'll eat what I can find.\" With that, she walked out to the parade, giving the audience a scare, and grabbed the balloon of Snoopy from the Peanuts gang, popped the air out with her teeth, and continued to swallow it whole. Every one, except the balloon holders, ran off as she continued her gluttonous feast. Soon, her growth came around again as she was eating more balloon characters. Her stomach was the only thing growing for the moment, as she was eating like her life depended on it. She was passing 60 feet in height as she grew bigger, over 65, 70, 75 feet and more. Her stomach raised her shirt up so much that it covered her breasts like a bra. Bigger and bigger she grew. As she finished all the parade balloons, her stomach was the size of a zepplin(ironic, eh?), while she stopped growing at the height of 100 feet tall. She rubbed her belly in content as she burped. But then, she gasped out a big &gt;HICCUP&lt;, to which caused her belly to grow bigger, as well has herself in a few feet. Then the hiccups were coming back, louder and quicker. With each hiccup, her body bloated up faster than ever, like a water balloon. Not only that, but she was growing taller and taller, going past 120, 145, 160, and so on!</span></div></div>",

Cars, trucks, buildings, billboards, and tons and tons and tons of people. \"MUST &lt;hic&gt; HAVE &lt;hic&gt; FOOOOOOOOOOOD!\" Carly yelled to the heavens, now over 500 feet in height and as proportionally fat as a blue whale.

Since it's passed the 30 minute wait, it's free. Enjoy, ma'am!\" With that, he gives Carly the food, and leaves, as she takes the food and sets it on the counter. She eats the cheesy bread, enjoying the delicious taste of the fatty bread. Soon, her stomach was pushing out of her shirt, becoming flabbier and more rotund. Her breasts were rounding out and growing slightly. Her butt was becoming a bit more jiggly, as well as a bit bigger. But this was just the start. She went right into the pastas. She decided to eat them without utensils, as she just used her hands, scooping them and swallowing them, then immediantly pouring them in her mouth, maknig her larger attributes grew bigger with each bite of the pastas. Soon, she ate all the pastas, and then she saw that the three root beers haven't even been touched. Her stomach was slightly full, but she though she could have a bit more. So, taking off all the caps, she drank the entire first bottle, gulping down the carbonated beverage. As she continued her soda binge, her stomach was bloating up from the soda, and the carbonated bubbles from it. as she finished the last bottle, her stomach was full to the brim, as if it was about to explode with just one pinch on her pouch. And was it a big belly! It looked as if it was over 9 months pregnant! Carly saw the enlarged stomach, and was astonished and enlighted to see it, as it was the beginning of a wonderful start to her weight gain. She rubbed it, moaning and groaning in both delight, and in a small amount of pain. She continued to rub her stomach, until she saw a few pieces of pasta remaining from one of the pasta dishes. She was a bit reluctant to eat them, but since there was only six pieces of it, she grabbed them all and ate them. So, after the large meal, she went up to her room, and slept.</span></div></div>",

Carly raced down the stairs, casually saying \"hey\" to her brother and grabbing his groceries. \"This.. dog, you've... got to... help me!

That's interesting\" Spencer said, unconsciously agreeing to something crazy again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... wait a minute!

She told me I could choose between soda and photos of Freddie as baby.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So I've always known that I'm not like most guys. I'm not a jock; you see, I'm not exactly exactly the biggest fan of physical activity. Not that I would've ever been able to get involved in any sports, with a mother like mine. Believe you me, when your mother doesn't let you leave for school until you've had your \"Flintstone's\" vitamins, and doesn't let you go to bed until she's checked your pulse, blood pressure, and temperature, sports are pretty much out of the question entirely. I've not really a nerd either, although Sam and maybe even Carly would disagree. Sure, I may obsess over videogames, but don't all teenage boys, to some degree? And yeah, I know a bit more about computers than the average person, but no were as near as much as Nevel. I'm smarter than Sam, but compared to me, Carly's a genius. I'd like to think I'm attractive. Maybe? In a dorky kind of way? But, at the same time, I know that I'm not really boyfriend material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence my friendship with Carly and Sam. Sam, she's the quirky one in our friendship. The girl guys want to ask out, but hold off because she kind of intimidates them. The comic relief. The main banana's second banana, the main banana being Carly, of course, the girl who could drop me and Sam like flies if she wanted too. I mean, she has it all. She's beautiful, seriously, just really take a good look at her and you'll know what I mean. She's intelligent, intelligent enough to go to Briarwood Prep if she wanted too. And she's funny and popular, or have you not seen iCarly? It's pretty much THE webshow to watch these days. Seriously, we even went to Japan and won a competition for it. But that's beside the point. Where am I left in our friendship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm the guy. You know, like Gordo from Lizzie McGuire or Eddie from That's so Raven. (Shut up. I can watch whatever I want.) The guys that never have girlfriends, or when they do, keep them for like only an episode. Destined, all of them, for lives as third bananas on mediocre Disney sitcomes that no one will remember five years from now, if only because Disney would just perish in flames - terrible, terrible, flames - if they didn't crank out, what? At least one new sitcom a year? I think they have some plans for Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers. Because, you know, they're rock stars and deserve their own sitcom. Really, they do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry for the sarcasm, it's just that some days, I swear my life feels like it's one of those sitcoms. Could you imagine that? Me, Carly, and Sam on some kid's network, in some poor emulation of a teenager's life, because no respectable network would EVER go so far as to properly represent a teenager's life. MTV doesn't count. Why? Because MTV takes everything over the top and...and that's a rant for another time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay we actually were a sitcom, though. Several things from our lives would be discreetly ommitted. Like the nights when Sam comes over, because her mom is drunk, too drunk to safely be around. One time, she came in with this nasty cut on her arm, Spencer, Carly's brother, wanted to call the police, but Sam wouldn't let him. Despite all the verbal abuse I get from her, I really don't see how Sam keeps it all together. I know it's one of those nights when I hear my cell ringing (Daft Punk ringtones are my fave) in the middle of the night. I throw on a robe, sneak across the hallway, and the four of us - Carly, Spencer, Sam, and Me - stay up until early morning, watching old movies or playing some cheesy boardgame. That's one thing the network would leave out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing? Hmm...oh, Carly's brother? Spencer? Yeah, he's bisexual. As in, he likes both men and women. The only ones who really know are me, Sam, and Carly, though. Being from a military family and all, I think that Spencer's afraid to tell his parents. They're really nice people, from what I've seen of them, but...yeah. I guess he's just scared of what they might do if they reacted all scary-like. Disown him maybe. Or even revoke his guradianship of Carly. Yeah, that's one other thing, Spencer is Carly's official guardian (and a pretty decent artist, I might add) since their parents are stationed...hmm. Come to think of it, I have no idea where they're stationed, but stationed they are. Somewhere. Apparently. Hoorah for unconventional families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Carly...well, earlier I was going on and on about how perfect Carly is. But, you know, everyone has a hidden weakness, or a tragic flaw in the case of Shakespeare's tragedies (So maybe I kind of like his stuff...a little bit). Carly's? She has this on and off again relationship with an eating disorder. Bulimia, specifically. Hey, hey, don't get me wrong...it's not an all the time thing, just a \"Ahh! My life is crashing, and crashing, and oh, there it went! It crashed and now it's burning!\" kind of thing. Between acing all of her AP classes, iCarly, and keeping her figure, Carly's life isn't exactly the easiest. And yeah, I'm a horrible friend for not telling Spencer...but even if I did, could either of us stop her from tip-toeing away to a bathroom after eating? The only reason I even knew her secret was because I'd been awake that night Sam had come over, when we'd pigged out on pizza, ice cream, and pretty much anything else of merit in the Shay family kitchen. She swore me to secrecy, and as much as I want to tell Spencer or Sam, she seems to know every time I even think about telling either of them. All it takes is a look from her, and I'm as good as mute. What can I say? I had a crush on her ever since I met her in kindergarten, up until halfway through freshman year, and even now she still has a way of wrapping me around her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, that would probably be different too, if we were all the main characters of a sitcom - our ages. Sam's actually the oldest, at 16, even though we don't start our junior year for another month. You wouldn't know it from looking at her, but she actually got held back a year. 3rd Grade, I think. Carly's next at 15, although she'll be sixteen before a lot of people in our grade since her birthday is in November. A few months earlier, and she would have been placed in Sam's class, actually. I'm the third banana yet again, because I'm actually the youngest. I, unfortunately, won't be sixteen until February of next year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh, there's that phrase again. Third banana. I termed it myself, I think. It really does apply to me...not that I don't value Carly and Sam's friendship, and I know they both value mine...yeah, even Sam. But those two, Sam and Carly, they're best friends. Lizzie and Miranda. Raven and Chelsea. Lucy and Ethel. Mac and Bloo. Tommy and Chuckie. I'm the \"other\" best friend. Gordo. Eddie. The nameless ladies that appear every other episode. The bird-plant-airplane thing, the busted basketball player, and the Hispanic fluffball. Susie Carmicheal, or Phil and Lil DeVille. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah, I'm different than most guys, I think as I lay in my bed, wide awake. The clock reads 3:45 A.M...3:46 A.M. Another minute passes by. I don't really fit into any distinct category, any high school stereotype. My two closest friends were girls. I was friendly with a few guys in my grade, like Gibby, but he, nor even Carly or Sam knew everything about me. Like my somewhat childish habit of watching today's popular sitcomes and cartoons, or at least watching them enough to be familiar with them. Or how I really like internet and videogame humor. You know, as in \"All your base are belong to us\" and the famous \"drama prairie dog\"? Ringing any bells? No? Well, I am kind of a dork. No one knows how much I secretly ship the Matt/Mimi pairing in Digimon, the fact that the one thing I want to do in my life before I die is go sky diving, despite the fact that I'm scared to death of heights, or that if Link, from the Legend of Zelda, were real, I would pretty much be gay for him, completely and totally. Me? A blond fetish? Noooo....well, maybe just a little bit. (Hey, I never said that Sam wasn't hot.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. So...you're thinking, maybe I'm being overdramatic? One of your friend's has parental issues, one of them has an eating disorder, and you're whining because you think you're left out. Actually, that sums the situation up quite nicely. I probably am being selfish. But would a best friend be asking so much? Someone who's a friend to me, like how Sam and Carly are friends with each other? Heck, a significant other would be nice too. I'm nearly a high school junior, and I've never even been kissed, family members excluded of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4:00 A.M exactly. I shift the comforter off of me as I stand, carefully stepping around anything on the floor that looks pointy as I head towards the full-length mirror attached to the front of my closet door. I stare at myself. Brown hair, brown eyes. My skin is pale, but not unhealthily so. I'd like to think it the shade of a pale pink rose, reflected on the surface of a pearl. But's that just me, I make my words all flowery sometimes, in my head. To most people, I'm just pale. No pimples, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile. It's a nice smile, I like to think. My mom's always ensured everything even remotely related to my health, so all of my teeth are perfectly white and perfectly straight. Slowly, I undress. My pyjama top I begin to unbutton, but soon lose my patience and toss is carelessly to the floor. Next comes my pyjama bottom, as I pull down and kick to the side the sky blue, cotton pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I stand before the mirror, completely unclothed. Hehe, yeah. At night, I usually go commando. If my mom ever found out, she'd probably die right there on the spot. Never you mind if she were to find her son appraising himself in the mirror at 4 in the morning. Again, I'd like to state that I think I'm at least mildy attractive. My body, like my face is a healthy pale, not a healthy tan. I'd lost most of my puppy fat over the course of last year, and had a small growth spurt as well, to come to stand at a decent 5'10\" and pretty lean overall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecent, I conclude. I'm decent. Suddenly, my stomach growls, and I place both of my hands on either side of my abdomen. I feel the slightest bit of abdominal muscles quiver at my touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wander out of my room and down the hallway towards the kitchen, not bothering to dress myself or to lighten my footsteps. I'd learned, through years of sneaking over to Carly's, that past one in the morning, it was nearly impossible to wake my mom up, but that she woke up like clockwork every day at 6:30 A.M. The kitchen was clean, like always, the hum of the refrigerator and my stomach the only sounds to be heard. Hmm....where, where, where to try first? Pantry maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhh....success. As I open the pantry, my eyes immediately zoom in on a jar of peanut butter. Chunky style. In an instant, I've a spoon in my right hand as I unscrew the lid with my lift. I dig the spoon deep into the peanut butter, and savor the taste as it hits my tongue, before gulping a large bit down all at once. I go in for another spoonfull, glance quickly at the spoon, then toss it into the sink. Peanut butter tastes so much better, I realize, when licked off one's fingers. A new jar, in a few minutes, I've polished off about half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, I'm thirsty. Wiping whatever peanut butter remains on my fingers onto my bare chest, I open the refrigerator, the sudden light blinding, but strangely comforting. Grabbing the milk, I drink straight from the jug, shivering as small rivulets dribble from my mouth, down my neck and onto my chest to join the peanut butter. I stop to catch my breath and notice the leftover Chinese that Mom brought home for dinner two nights ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh. Overprotective she may be, the one area Mom was flawed in was food. The one time she tried cooking, I somehow ended up having an allergic reation. Since then, it's been nothing but pre-made or takeout; really, whatever she could round up after putting in her long day at the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Chicken Lo Mein, and the noodles are still good despite being cold. I'm downing them fast, but manage not to spill anything on myself this time. With the rice, it's barely a box though, and I'm finished quicky. I pause to belch, running my hands over my tight stomach and down onto my hips, and then chuckle. If my mom did walk in, I would have no way of explaining this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I'm still hungry. And suddenly craving something sweet, I know just where to go. Ice cream was my mom's only weakness in terms of food, cookie dough ice cream to be exact. The day she didn't have at least two boxes in the freezer was the day Sam joined the cheerleading squad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAKA, never. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a box and the spoon I'd tossed into the sink earlier, I amble into the living room to the couch and turn on the television to find out exactly what does come on at 4:23 A.M. I place the ice cream on a cushion, which I in turn place on my stomach so as to be protected from the cold. I'm careful not to let any melting ice cream stain the couch or the cushion. My chest is already kind of a mess though. So I don't care as a few melted drops of cookie dough ice cream occasionally fall to join the other stains and one stray noodle on my chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoops. Guess I wasn't as careful with that lo mein as I thought I was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a litle after five in the morning when I wander back into my room. I catch my reflection in the mirror. From a distance, you can't make out the ice cream and peanut butter left on my mouth and cheest, but I notice that my stomach is noticeably pooched out. It's tight, and painful to the touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I'm not hungry anymore. And I feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotes to self: Sam dropped by and polished off the Chinese and made the dent in the peanut butter, as for the ice cream...if it comes down to it, Sam stole that too. Buy Mom a new box before she notices the empty box in the trash can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI collapsed into my bed, and wrapped myself in the sheets. I was still naked. Oh well. I'll just tell my mom that I got hot last night. Remember to smile and blush, that always gets you off the hook. If all else fails, have Carly run an intervention. As for now, sleep. Before I woke, I dreamt of us - us being me, Carly, Sam, and Spencer. In my dream, there were other people there. I think one of them was dating Spencer, and the other....I think the other one was my best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the scale the next morning, I'd notice that I'd gained two pounds, bringing me up to 157. But I didn't regret anything...in fact, I kinda wanted to do the same thing that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I forgot to introduce myself. My name's Freddie Benson. I think I just became a binge eater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I was entering a part of my life that I would NEVER forget.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Binge eating isn't exactly what you might think it is. Most people associate it with an emotional woman in a romantic comedy who eats a tub of ice cream to forget her troubles, or worse yet, the fat kid who just eats as much as possible because that is of course what fat people do: Eat for the sake of it. That;s not even true. The fact of the matter is that sometimes I get hungry, so I eat. But maybe that doesn't fill me up, so I eat some more, and so on. It really wasn't a big problem, except for the sticky mess I left all over myself. That required a shower to fix. Luckily, I get to shower more or less unsupervised, so I didn't have to worry about my mother piecing together my little midnight gorging session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day I had planned to watch movies with Sam and Carly in her studio. I donned a fresh polo and a pair of cargo shorts. I checked myself in the mirror: My hair was in place, my clothes were wrinkle-less and there was no evidence what I had eaten last night. Of course I was never muscular in the first place, but there was no more fat that the little bit that had been there before. I smiled to myself. I'd gotten away with it. I had enjoyed it, too. This would happen more often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbandoning the mirror, I headed out the door and into Carly's apartment. Sam was sitting at the computer, looking unamused, as per usual. Carly was plating nachos, smothered in cheese. My stomach rumbled. Carly glanced up and smiled warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Freddie. Happy Thursday.\" She said, grabbing a jar of salsa and dumping it into a bowl alongside the nachos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Nerd.\" Sam waved nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, Carly.\" I smiled back. \"Sam.\" and a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly busied herself with gathering the nachos and headed up to the studio. I followed after, throwing myself into a beanbag, facing the mounted television screen. Sam arrived moments later, punching me in the shoulder and ignoring my complaints. The lights dimmed and the DVD started, gracing our eyeballs with images of stars and starlets. Immediately I grabbed the bowl of nachos, and begin eating them. Sam, usually the big eater, took no notice, as she had brought her own food in the form of a ham sandwich. I sat on the far side, Next being Sam to my left, and finally Carly. In the low light, neither saw me stuff my face. I ate chip after chip, cheese oozing off of them and back into the bow. They were so good, I couldn't stop myself. As the movie progressed, I found I had devoured all of the chips, only gooey cheese remained. Still not sated, I dipped my fingers in and ate licked my hand clean. Over and over I repeated the process: Scoop, lick, repeat. As my supply of cheesy-goodness depleted, I began to lick my face in search of further nourishment. However, after a point, I was without any food. I was made to endure 45 more minutes of that sub-par romance before I could search for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights returned to full strength and the girls stood and began to talk about the movie. I wasn't paying attention to what they were saying, I was absently rubbing my hungry gut. Suddenly they were looking at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freddie?\" <br>\r\n\"Huh?\" I snapped to attention.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Carly asked<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, why?\" <br>\r\n\"Because, you're sitting there like a zombie all spaced out.\" Sam interjected. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm just... hungry.\" I said sheepishly, rubbing my slightly bulging midsection. <br>\r\n\"Really, because ya kinda ate all the nachos.\" Carly shook the thoroughly empty bowl at me.<br>\r\n\"Oh I didn't have breakfast.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'm hungry too, let's eat.\" Sam exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly had made a taco platter and lemonade in advance. She laid the wide dish on the table and gave each of us a plate. I calmly place a shell on my plate and began to fill it with meat, lettuce tomatoes and anything else I could stomach. I took my now bulging taco and shoved it into my mouth. It was delicious. I scarfed it down, carelessly dropping taco sauce on my shirt, which I hastily cleaned with my mouth. I prepared another taco and began to down it. About halfway through I noticed Sam and Carly staring at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked through a mouthful of taco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna slow down a little, champ?\" Carly chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a fatass.\" Sam sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, you eat twice as much as I do.\" I retorted. Sam's response was to stick her tongue out at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfazed, I returned to my food, finishing my second taco and moving on. I ate five tacos total. I was completely full at this point. My face was soiled with sauce, but I didn't care. My hands had retreated to the inside of my shirt, where they massaged my bloated belly. It felt so good, I was completely content. So maybe I had become a binge eater, I didn't actually care if this was how it felt. I could gain fifty pounds, I still wouldn't care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're okay? Is your mom feeding you?\" Carly prodded gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am perfectly fine, I was just really hungry. Besides you never comment when Sam eats everything in sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is what it is.\" Sam declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI agreed with Sam. Forget people's opinions, I'm content. I stood in front of my mirror at 4am, yet again. But this time, there was a noticeable layer of fat forming around my midsection. I poked it. It was soft, warm and squishy. I decided that I liked this new addition, and if it expanded, so be it. I rubbed my stomach lovingly, realizing I was feeling the pangs of hunger yet again. <i>I guess a snack won't hurt anyone</i>. I thought to myself. With that, I took to the kitchen, eating what I could. I made a massive sandwich from what supplies I could find and coupled it with a tub of cookie dough. The sandwich went fast but I savored the dough. They say eating it raw can give you salmonella, but this was too good to pass up. Chocolate chips and peanut butter made me smile to myself as I binged. When all was said and done, I buried the container at the bottom of the trash can, remnants of chocolate smeared on my chest. I ate as much of that as I could and returned to the mirror. My stomach was pleasantly distended, creating the most amiable curvature. I rubbed myself contentedly. I liked having a belly. Gaining weight wouldn't be too bad at all. </span></div></div>",

I poked my finger in my deepening belly button and stretched. I went to my closet and pulled out a pair of chinos my mom had bought for me. I looked at the my stomach, then the tag inside the pants. They had a 32 inch waist. They should fit. I slowly pulled them on and fastened the button. A small layer of flab  bulged over the waistband slightly, and they were tight on my butt. I grabbed a blue button up shirt from my closet and put my arms through. I buttoned it, leaving the top two buttons unfastened, as per usual. I went over to my full length mirror and examined my body. My shirt revealed my belly sticking out slightly, but only if you looked hard enough. The chinos, tight over my butt, made my butt look a lot bigger, but i didn't care. I went to my dresser and pulled out a belt. It was 2 inches wide, brown leather. I laced it slowly through my belt loops when spencer called and asked if i wanted to hang out with him and gibby today. I agreed, since carly and sam were off on a school field trip today. I know what you're thinking. A field trip on a saturday? Well it was one of those residential trips, where you go for a few days or a week. My mom wouldn't let me go. She said i'd forget all my ointments and get sick. Well that was my mother for you. Anyway, i fastened my belt on the middle hole, of five. When i bought this belt it was on the tightest hole. Wierd how a belt can show your growth so much, right? Anyway, i went to spencers apartment.</span></div></div>",

But then I register the sound of the AC kicking in and shudder, deciding that it's probably safest to withdraw said appendage. Mom (as per usual) had cranked the AC up to the max last night and, at the moment, my room was probably cold enough to serve as a penguin sanctuary. The combo of my covers and the July sunlight streaming in through my window, however, left me feeling clammy. I could feel a few miniscule beads of sweat form at my hairline...ugh. \"No use fighting it, I guess...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh and an unenthusiastic flourish, I throw the sheets off of my body. In an instant, I feel the goosebumps as they spread along my body due to the sudden rush of air. As I brush the sleep from my eyes, I swing my legs over the bed and rise into a sitting position. I scratch my stomach idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut let's not talk about my stomach. Actually, let's avoid talking about it... because lately, I've actually added a few pou-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.  .  .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhem. But moving on... (But my god, even I'll admit that recently my stomach's rivaled Godzilla's in terms of apatite. Which, all things considered...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of my feet brushes up against something plastic-y. I look down. It's a candy bar wrapper. 100 Grand, to be precise. Definitely in my top five favorite candy bars...maybe even top three? Standing, I yawn...and then stretch, a few errant joints popping as I arc my back forward. I kick the candy bar wrapper under the bed to be dealt with later (much later) and then, with the same foot, I pick up the underwear I'd discarded the night before. Yeah, before you ask, they're briefs. Thank my mom. (Can someone explain to me what the deal is with moms and briefs? I mean, my god, I've fought with her I dunno how many times to be able to buy my own freakin' underwear, but for whatever reason, she always wins out. And so she continues to buy me tightie whities. Ugh. What few pairs of boxers I possessed, I counted amongst my most treasured possessions.) Last night's heat, even despite the AC from hell (frozen over), had felt unbearable, sooo...I'd slept naked, with not even a fig leaf to shield me from night creepers. (Don't laugh; night creepers are <i>serious </i> business, but for last night, at least, the heat had won out over said creepers.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I slid the briefs up onto my waist - the elastic making a strangely satisfying snap as I do so - I felt the first pinpricks of hunger. Like clockwork, I head to the desk that houses my beloved laptop. After many a battle with my mother, I had finally had my desk declared as one of the few sacred grounds that I had to myself. Meaning, as much as she may have hated it, she never cleaned or \"organized\" it. Not that she would have needed to; I'm proud to say that I only very rarely let my desk get messy...although that standard doesn't always apply to my room as a whole. Up until a few weeks ago, I'd been using the various drawers for various purposes, for storing software, cables, and the like. But now...I open the top left drawer, my mouth already watering. A box of doughnuts stares back up at me. I'd got them at a resale bakery yesterday. They were a few days old, yeah, but they were just as good. And what's more, they had been cheap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift the box of doughnuts out of the drawer with a savage, yet mechanical, gesture. Balancing the box in my left hand, I quickly stuff one of the baked goodies into my mouth before rummaging through the other drawers to see what other treats may be hiding. A carton of cookies...empty, except for a sad handful of crumbs. \"Now why the heck did I keep this if it was empty...? Oh well.\" I mumble through a mouthful of doughnut. I used to hate the glazed crap that they put on...well, on glazed doughnuts, but it's slowly been growing on me. Licking the remnants of glaze from my fingertips, a belch overcomes me and I pat my stomach. What day was it...? Oh wait, duh. I obviously didn't go to school today, so that means....Saturday. Yeah, that sounds right. Mom had planned a girl's day out for herself today, if I remember right. First a book club meeting, then a trip to Office Depot, topped off with a sale at GNC...which explains why I hadn't been woken up this morning, anyway. Speaking of which, a glance to the clock reveals...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11:14 AM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet, it's not even noon yet. My mood brightening, I grab my remote from its tomb under my billow and turn on the television. It's still early enough to catch the tail end of the Saturday morning cartoons. I hadn't watched them in a few months now, but I'd kept up online, and if my facts were straight, things were finally starting to pick up speed in Pokemon. I, along with my doughnuts, had just settled down for what looked like a session of Saturday morning nerddom when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freddie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice from the living room! It sounds like...</span></div></div>",

Well, I say 'immediately', it took about 20 seconds to get off the couch actually. My new weight seems to prevent me from doing tasks that I would have previously found very easy to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally get to my feet and walk down the corridor to my bedroom. My steps are heavy, and rather than simply walk, I now have a slight <i>waddle</i> to my stroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the full length mirror in my room, I pull down my briefs and examine my body properly for the first time in a number of weeks. My 4am binges and absolute lack of exercise has taken its toll; my face is now looking much fuller than it has ever done before - my slight jaw line has been replaced by the first hints of a double chin forming. My chest, although never particularly toned anyway, has gained a pair of man boobs which are not very large, but are hanging very gently above my softening belly. Speaking of my belly, this is the area I am perhaps most fascinated with. Unlike some of the other big guys at school and around Seattle, my gut is not big, round and hard. It is soft, warm and squishy, with the odd roll as I stand - and many more when I sit. It makes me feel more like a proper 'man'. My arms and legs have also fell victim to my late night gorges, with my arms generally looking a little larger, and my thighs now touching quite considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am proud of my new look, but am still not content - much more food will be needed yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, down to business. I open the third draw of my dresser and begin to rummage for some swimming trunks. Eventually I find three pairs; a small and two mediums. Small was my usual size before the extra weight, but there wasn't a chance I'd fit into them now! I throw them under my bed, and hear them land on what sounds like (and probably is) multiple candy bar wrappers. The two mediums both look very similar, except one has an elastic waist, whilst the other does not. Naturally, I choose the elastic waist \"You're gonna need all the help you can get, aren't you buddy?\" I rhetorically ask my gut as I give it a shake with both hands, sending ripples through my chubby torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up the shorts, they pass easily up my calves and fairly easily passed my thighs too. The challenge however, came to my ass and waist. I ended up forcing the trunks up passed my ass in order to get them to fit, leaving me red in the face from my exertions. My belly is hanging over the waistband of the trunks somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, do I need to wear a shirt or something? It's a hot day and the pool is only two blocks away.</span></div></div>",

Carly and Sam turn around straight away and look at me, examining every inch of my body from head to food. Carly's facial expression is one of shock, but she quickly changes it to a smile as I waddle out the elevator towards them. Sam simply smirks, either with mischief or satisfaction - I can't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Off we head then peeps!\" Carly exclaims cheerfully as we all head out the doors of the lobby and walk towards the pool. Carly is engaging in small talk with Sam, but I'm not really listening - I'm too busy focusing on the jiggle of my belly every time my foot hits the sidewalk, the ripples of which are so strong, even my man boobs are bouncing somewhat as I walk along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt around half way to the pool, I find that I'm breathing very deeply and am quite red in the face - I'm out of breath.

This is the swimming pool - not a restaurant!\" The comment was followed by a series of short, deep laughs. It's some jocks from the grade above me at school. They too were all shirtless and wet, but sported toned six-packs and defined pecs - the complete contrast of me with my overhanging belly and moobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I went to get a locker to put my towel and pear phone in, the 'head' jock - Kevin, swaggered over to me from behind and wrapped his hands round my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Freddie!!!\" He exclaimed mockingly \"Eat anymore cake and you'll be needing a bra for these puppies!\" and with that gave my moobs a squeeze before releasing me. As taunted though I felt, I was also very turned on by having Kevin's biceps press into my soft sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jocks dried off quickly and headed out of the changing rooms, all patting my gut as they left.

It'd been about a month and I had about ten unopened boxes of cookies and a pile of the cakes. My mom wouldn't come in and bother me, she usually knew when my door was shut, not to come in. She'd stepped in at the wrong moment one time and it was awkward for the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I started on the cookies, eating the first box in about two minutes. I kept eating and eating until I'd eaten all of them. The other stuff was easy, I finished it in about five minutes. After I was done, my belly felt really tight, and I was really thirsty. I waited a few minutes until I heard my mom leave the kitchen and  made my move. I darted in, grabbing two big bottles of mountian dew as quickly as possible. I ran back to my room shut the door and hoped she hadn't noticed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed and not a word from her. I could only assume that it was safe and started chugging the first soda. I downed it in no time. I felt my belly stretching beyond it's normal limits, it felt great. I picked up the second soda and chugged it twice as fast, filling my belly to it's max. I threw the bottles under my bed, tossed off all my clothes, leaned back on my pillow, and fell asleep, rubbing my engorged gut.</span></div></div>",

A burger in each hand, Freddie contemplated the path his life was going down, as well as the other boy traveling that was traveling that path wth him. Knowing it could be a sensitive subject, Freddie turned to the larger boy and asked, \"how are we gonna get girls looking and working like this?\" Gibby stopped eating just long enough to laugh. \"I'be never been much of a fan of girls. None of them really get this, you know? The gaining, the letting go of it all, hell even the smell. No girl could get this like you do, Freddie\". Freddie blushed at this, for he had long felt the same way. Feeling emboldened, Freddie slid closer to the gorging boy, reveling at the waves of musk surrounding the other boy. \"I'm glad we're on the same page there, Gibby. Why even bother with girls? We're all we need, two fat boys keeping each other growing and pigging\" Gibby smiled and leaned in towards Freddie \"Definitely. Let's be pigs together!\" On impulse, Freddie leaned in and kissed Gibby full on the mouth. Hubby responded with equal enthusiasm, and the two quickly became locked in a fierce make-out session. The passionate connection was broken when Gibby released a gale-force of a fart, which enveloped the two boys. Freddie breathed in deep, finally allowing himself to enjoy what had aroused him for quite some time. Freddie said as much to Gibby, who agreed. Gibby turned away from Freddie and pulled down his underwear just in time to blast Freddie full-face. Freddie breathed it in recklessly as he reached across the table and crammed a burger in his facs, desperate to prove his gluttony and piggishness to his gaining partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few weeks passed in a blur, as slowly every other aspect of Freddie's life fell by the wayside in favor of more and more time spent with Gibby. The two became intimately familiar with each other's bodies; Gibby often loved to bury his face in Freddie's pits, covering his face with Freddie's scent. And of course, their appetites grew too. Freddie continued to notice how much softer his body was getting; his thighs were beginning to force the teen into a waddle, and his gut was beginning to develop a sagging overhang. Gibby on the other hand, had more of a ball shaped gut that held his weight very well. Freddie had taken to constantly grabbing his overhang, getting used to the weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the school year drew to a close, Freddie and Gibby were hanging out and eating when:</span></div></div>",

The prim and proper woman had remained oddly content with Freddie and Gibby's weight gain; she just seemed happy that Freddie was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreddie was leaning back across the sofa, an almost empty pizza box perched on top of the mound of flab that rolled out from the teen's midsection. The school year had ended a few days before, and Freddie was taking full advantage of the summer. The white t-shirt the boy wore was collecting an impressive set of food stains, and the area around the armpits was definitely tinged more yellow than it was yesterday, Gibby noted approvingly. Freddie's voluminous thighs and ass were encased in a pair of grey sweatpants that were rapidly drawing too tight on the growing teen's form. Freddie hardly took his eyes off the TV as he reached out a grease-stained hand towards Gibby, reaching for the last slice of pizza with the other. \"Lemme see it, Gibbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger boy handed over the letter and collapsed onto the couch next to Freddie, absentmindedly rummaging around for a snack or two while he examined the letter over Freddie's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Freddie opened the envelope, a few sheets of paper came out, folded around a set of brochures. Freddie muted the TV and read the top sheet out loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Freddie and Gibby,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour recent efforts in the physical department have not gone unnoticed. There are those out there that have been impressed with your work so far, and see potential in you to be so much more. The weight gain, the improved physiques, the appreciation for scents, and the willingness to put your accomplishments on display; all are things I believe should be encouraged in today's boys. I have no small amount of resources that I would like to dedicate to your continued improvement. Almost reaching 300 at your age is commendable for the both of you, but with the right assistance, the sky is the limit. I would like to invite the both of you to a place where your particular talents in gluttony, sloth, and slob, will be encouraged and furthered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understand that your parents would likely be apprehensive of such a situation for you. So, if you are interested, the remaining contents of this letter provide a front, of sorts: an exclusive summer camp to which you both have won scholarships to attend. Simply hide this page and present the letter to your parents. I am sure they will want the best for their sons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGibby and Freddie looked at each other. \"This person wants us to do more?\" Gibby questioned, rubbing his gut and appearing lost in thought. \"Yeah, can you imagine? I don't think we can give this up.\" Freddie replied, scanning through the additional contents, which were exactly as the letter had described. \"I don't think so either... We need this.\" The two boys looked at each other and nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------- ONE WEEK LATER -----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their parents easily convinced of the cover story, Freddie and Gibby set out to follow the mysterious letter to its source, and see what awaited them within. Where do the boys arrive?</span></div></div>",

Much, much bigger. The fat on his body made him feel warm, and soft. Looking over Gibby seemed to make him feel like the two were becoming closer as friends. Maybe even more than friends. Almost like a gainer relationship between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Gibby. You've been packing it on.\" Was all he could say at the moment. He seemed lost in staring at Gibby's girth. His jiggling belly and rotund ass were just sitting there, putting on a show for him. He tried to fight the very thought that he may be attracted to him, but he was losing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know!\" Gibby exclaimed, giving his gut a triumphant slap. \"It feels good to be fat, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah. You know we don't have to stop here, Gibs.\" Replied Freddie, biting into a piece of cake. \"I mean, why should we? We're big, soft, and sexy- er..!\" Freddy stopped, realizing he just let out his then-unknown attraction towards Gibby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Freddo?\" Gibby asked, plopping down on the sofa next to Freddy while scarfing down some spaghetti tacos. Freddy blushed with Gibby sitting so close, almost rubbing bellies together. He was trying to work up the nerve to say something, but he was too afraid to outright day it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said.. Oh, how do I put this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say it, dude. We're both men here, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think you're sexy, Gibby.

She could still fit in her clothes, she told herself- it would just require a little more time and effort than usual. She started with her shorts. She knew that any approach that involved bending over would result only in her getting out of breath, and tried to slide into the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She\u2019d had to contend with her big hips before when attempting to button the school skirt before, and had come up with an approach to get round that, by pulling the shirt up to her waist and then closing it there, but now, that usually successful plan now hit a new hitch. Her new jiggling paunch stuck out too far to allow for buttoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sucked it in, managing to take a few inches off it, but not enough to button the shorts. She struggled for a while, before she was forced to release the breath, and stood, panting. The skirt clung too tightly to her hips and thighs to fall down, but that was irrelevant, If she could not get these fastened. Still, the tightness of the shorts did allow her to keep her hands free, to wrestle with the shorts again. She sucked in for a second time, at the same time pulling with all her might to get the gap closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, puffing and panting, she managed it, but her satisfaction was dulled a little by the fact that, when she released her gut, the shorts cut deeply into it, causing another gasp of discomfort. Still, there was no help for it, she reasoned, as, with another grunt of effort, she pulled the zipper closed over the stacked folds of her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the shirt, she felt the bra about to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the shirt. She pulled it from her cupboard, and then began her struggle to get it on.<br>\r\n It wasn\u2019t too much of a struggle, but definitely an irritation. Buttoning the shirt was considerably more than that. Sam began to button it starting with the top button at her throat. Her jugs were enough of a bulwark to make that difficult, and sam was panting again in the time it took for her to get the first three buttons done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As sam worked down, things only grew more difficult- her belly jutted out further than her tits by a considerable margin, but at least it was easier to suck in. That did not mean that she was not breathing like a dog in heat by the time she had finished buttoning it, and, by the time sam had tucked her shirt in to her skirt, that it was looking considerably strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her troubles were not yet over, though. Now came the moment of truth. Sam breathed out, and the forward surge of her paunch untucked her shirt for her. Even as sam cursed and prepared to suck in her belly again, she felt a release of pressure as her top-button pinged open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made it!\" Said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you next time on I carly.\" Said Carly while correcting her now little snug jeans around her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnnnnnnnnnd Cut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice done Sam.\" Exclaimed Carly.<br>\r\n\"Thanks carl, it feels my clothes is about to burst.\" Confessed Sam.<br>\r\n\"yeah it looks like every part of you gonna crack.\" Said Freddie while operating the Computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShut up nerd, none ask for an comment. Said Sam to Freddy.<br>\r\n\"Just saying, but it\u00b4s certinly looks good on you.\" Said Freddy heartly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam is not sure how to respond, either thank him or shrugg, she secretly like freddy but cant handle feelings like that. So it always ends up that she\u00b4s not very nice to him, Verbaly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Fredd\". Snapped Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How may Views?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... 2501 Views\"! Shouted Freddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Holy s#it!\" Said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes was torn away by a silent boom.<br>\r\nStanding entirely nude, Sam just stodd there and put her hands on the belly and breathed out heavily.<br>\r\n\"aaahhh, Thats better!\" Said Sam.<br>\r\nCarly Stared in horror while her gut jutted out slightly.<br>\r\nFreddy stood there in between and Was in Heaven.

She even measured her waistline which was 37 inches, and not to mention her belly which was 42 around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe bulging flesh that was being pushed out from Sam's abdomen.
