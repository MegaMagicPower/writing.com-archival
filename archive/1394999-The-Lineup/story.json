You'd never forget that face, as long as you lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"  Pressed the detective.  \"Is he in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, remembering the robber's last words to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" the detective said.  \"The security camera in the store is broken.  The clerk filed a report, but we need you to corroborate his story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow hard... and make your choice.</span></div></div>",

There's a liquor store one block over and you quickly run down to grab a bottle.  You select a decent bottle and move to the register to pay for it when a man bursts in with a gun and holds up the clerk.  After getting the money from the register, he knocks out the clerk with the butt of his gun and turns to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe he notices you and your expensive jewelry.  He makes a move toward you, but sirens in the distance give him pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving, he glares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you tell anyone about this, I'll fuckin' kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, you receive a call from a detective.
