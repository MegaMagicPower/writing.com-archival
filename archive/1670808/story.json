They were outside of the nursery and the queen Droughtclaw's kits Ripplekit, Snowkit, and Pinekit were romping on the dusty ground. Those idiots, Skullkit thought as the three made utter fools of themselves. How was he even grouped in the same rank as them? Sure, he was a kit, but at least he didn't think that the fresh-kill fell from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Skullkit, come and join us,\" Ripplekit called. The little gray she-kit acted as the unofficial leader of the younger kits. Skullkit thought that Ripplekit was born thinking that she was the only one who is important in the Clan. Many a time, he had witnessed the kit deliberately disobey Coldstar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The tom shook his head, eyes revealing great scorn that went unnoticed by the subjects of his disgust. \"No,\" he said, uttering the one-word answer with a smooth, icy voice. \"I have more important things to do than that pointless game of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Snowkit, always loyal to his sister and with a thorn-sharp tongue, mewed, \"And what things do you have to go do? Eat mouse bile?\" Ripplekit and Pinekit burst into fits of laughter. Skullkit let a growl rise to his throat, deep and rumbling which was unnatural for such a kit. He couldn't stand then with their ever stupid thoughts and jibes. The tabby pounced onto Snowkit, pinning him down roughly. He ignored the wailing and yowling of the other two, telling him to get off their brother. That fluffball was going to pay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The silver and white tom stared at Skullkit with wide fearful eyes. \"Please, don't hurt me!\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Why should I?\" the brown and white tabby snarled. He lifted one paw, claws unsheathed, prepared to deal a blow to the helpless kit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sharp pain jolted through him as he landed in an uncomfortable position that jarred his bones. Groaning, he glanced upwards to discover the trio's mother Droughtclaw standing above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"How dare you attempt to harm my kits,\" the queen scolded furiously, her amber eyes glinting in fierce protection of her darling kits. Droughtclaw pinned the tabby kit down with her right forepaw. \"How can you, a kit, bother threatening another's life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Skullkit glared at the she-cat, a challenge evident in his green eyes. \"Because I could care less for Clanmates who are fools. Nobody should nurture their nature of pure cowardice.\" Once again, his actions and words revealed too much knowledge for one his age. As Droughtclaw gazed upon him, she wondered perhaps if this kit's spirit was immersed in shadow since birth. Then a voice, familiar to all Clan members, sounded from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Coldstar stood there, her frosty blue eyes narrowed in thought. Her fur was a dark golden color with pitch black tabby stripes. \"What do we have here, Droughtclaw?\" she asked, her tone sharp like the slice that comes from a cold wind. In fact her warrior name was Coldwind due to this tone. \"Will you mind explaining why you apparently are assaulting a kit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Droughtclaw narrowed her eyes, mirroring Coldstar's dark expression. \"This kit is surely an agent of the Dark Forest! He tried to do away Snowkit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yet you try to kill as he has done. I am disappointed in you,\" Coldstar replied. She turned a knowing look at Skullkit before returning her focus on Droughtclaw. \"Due to your actions, your kits' apprenticeship will be placed further back by one moon. That is fit since you have been boasting of your kits being higher in rank sooner or later. As for you, Skullkit...\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't instinct however... it was something more, like his paws were being controlled by a great force, launching him out of the way from the attacking warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be little...\" Tigerpaw said with a voice not quite his own. \"but I can still claw you to shreds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs rippled with newfound strength as Tigerpaw launched himself forward at the attacker. The Smirk on his face soon disappeared as he bowled the bigger cat over, and tore at his exposed belly with sharp claws. He tried to push you off, but his efforts were fruitless. All resistence was futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaagh!\" He screamed, \"Get him off of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPawsteps thundered behind Tigerpaw, and more forms streaked towards him, ready to attack. Angrily, he gave one last swipe at the first cat, and turned to face the new opponents. Two she-cats and a tom were all hissing and spitting at him as the first attacker slunk away with his tail between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Moonclaw! Defeated by an apprentice? You're pathetic!\" teased one of the she-cats. \"Lets show him what REAL Shadowclan can do, Pebbleeye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPebbleeye, the other she-cat, nodded and leapt at Tigerpaw, but he was ready. He jumped upward, and as she landed, he fell on top of her, and bit fiercely at her neck. Grabbing a nearby tree with his hind claws, he swung around, pulling the larger cat by her neck fur and sending her flying into the undergrowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first she-cat looked stunned, but only for a moment before she hissed and ran at him, claws glinting in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was over here!\" yelled Shinekit, full of fear for her older brother. A full patrol of Warriors followed her, rushing forth to face the enemy. They reached the hollow where Tigerpaw had been playing with Shinekit, and the whole patrol gasped at what they saw...</span></div></div>",

His adversaries had been bigger and more experienced probably than himself, but it had been quite clear to him that they didn't have the cunning that he had on his side. So now the apprentice just stared at motionless bodies, looked at their glazed eyes. Suddenly he heard a chorus of gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Shinekit stood among a patrol of warriors, her eyes widened at the sight of the scene she had come upon. Tigerpaw noticed one of warriors try to cover his little sister's eyes with his tail, but paused before deciding not to. She had already seen and now it would be imprinted on her mind forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What have you done?\" Fireheart demanded in surprise. He had come along with the patrol to make sure that his apprentice was okay. And he had discovered this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Tigerpaw, at unease, licked one of his forepaws. \"I defended my Clan,\" he said defensively. Those cats could have killed him had he not fought back. \"They were a threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Fireheart's eyes burned angrily. \"So you killed them! That is an outrage. You should've let the patrol do it or at least chase them off. Not to take their fate into your paws!\" He lashed his tail. \"Now what are we going to have to say to ShadowClan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Tigerpaw felt sickened by the deadly glares given by the warriors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Come on, we're going to Bluestar about this,\" Fireheart growled, moving him away toward the camp. He glanced over his shoulder at the patrol and Shinekit. \"Go with us Shinekit. The patrol will dispose of the corpses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     -----<br>\r\n     Tigerpaw stood trembling in front of Bluestar, his eyes downcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Fireheart told me all about your story,\" the leader said. And knowing him, Tigerpaw thought, he most definitely overexaggerated it. \"It was a ruthless thing to do Tigerpaw so your punishment is...\"</span></div></div>",

He imagined his name among the legends told by the elders, tales of him told to the kits later on. All of this could be his. The problem was that he wasn't a warrior or an apprentice yet so by standards he wasn't fit to train to battle and hunt. Oh, how he wanted to have his first battle so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Then, there was a racket outside of the nursery. With a thought of curiosity, Bloodkit squirmed from Falconfeather's grip and made a small leap outside. The camp was immense to him, not that he really cared right now. All he wanted was to know what was going on right then. He saw his Blackflame, his father, wrestling with an unfamiliar cat and wondered if he should ask to join what he thought was a play-fight. That was when he noticed the blood from the wounds in Blackflame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Bloodkit knew now that they were under attack, but by who he didn't really know. Possibly rogues were the attackers. Then a surge of happiness raced through Bloodkit. <i>Now I could prove I am worthy to be an apprentice by fighting,</i> he thought. But what about his mother? She wouldn't be pleased if he got himself killed in this fight. What could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     Bloodkit's face was shoved into the grass by the opposing she-cat. The apprentice raked her claws over one of the kit's ears. Bloodkit whimpered. She then proceeded to viciously bat him. Bloodkit was ruthlessly flung backwards into a large rock. Its jagged edges cut his flank. Rusty red spots took over the majority of his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The she-cat crooned with a mocking tone,\"Aww, the poor little kit decides to play with the big bad apprentice.\" She shoved her face up to his, just barely brushing his face with her whiskers. \"Honestly, I'm flattered. I haven't delivered a beating to one as stupid as you in a long while.\" The rancid smell of her breath gave Bloodkit a sense of nausea. Bloodkit's eyes were half-closed, weakness overwhelming his small body. His tiny mouth quivered in a fruitless attempt to try a snarl of defiance. He had seen his father demonstrate it a couple of times and he felt that it would give him confidence. Yet all hope faded for him when no sound came past his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"RiverClan retreat!\" came a distant cry that faintly pierced the sound of Bloodkit's pounding heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The she-cat pulled her lips back into a sharp-toothed grin. Bloodkit couldn't help but widen his eyes a bit. A shiver ran down his back, rattling his bones. \"See ya, wouldn't want to be ya.\" Then everything faded to black and Bloodkit couldn't help but silently embrace it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     When Bloodkit awoke, he saw the walls of the medicine den. A sharp jolt of pain racked him as he cranes his neck to see Rainshadow, the medicine cat. She blinked her light blue eyes at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Don't move, little one. You were battered badly in that battle, not that you should have been involved in the first place. Hopefully, I don't burden you more by saying...\"</span></div></div>",

She always was the one to be the bearer of bad news to some cat when their dear ones were killed. The small kit had always looked on curiously as Rainshadow delivered the news with a flat tone. He'd never thought anything truly of it and even supported her actions. After all, warriors needed to move on and continue to serve the Clan, not dwell on the past. However, Bloodkit felt otherwise now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStones weighed down his stomach. The air now felt toxic, searing giant holes into his throat. With just a couple of small words, Bloodkit's own world seemed to drop far beyond his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father died from severe wounds to the neck and throat. He served our Clan faithfully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodkit stared down at the ground, wishing for it to open up beneath him, swallow him whole. <i>I don't need to hear how great he was. I just- I just want him back. Now,</i> he thought. <i>I'm betting he's right outside, waiting for me to walk out. Then, he'll jump out and say, \"Haha, got you again!\" Like always.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloodkit? Bloodkit? You're all right, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I need to do something. I must.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathed in deeply, and tried to restore calmness within himself. The pain of his body was deep, seemingly neverending, but he had to move. Bloodkit forced himself up and limped out of the den, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloodkit!\"</span></div></div>",
