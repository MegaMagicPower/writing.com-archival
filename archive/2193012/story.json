Their new exhibit of priceless jewelry and ancient artifacts that was due to go on display the following day. She had made it to the hallway and was almost through removing the cover off the first display case when she heard footsteps and saw a beam of light. one of the guards had come to make her rounds. Kristi crouched tight against the display as the guard passed by. Just when she thought she was in the clear, the guard's handcuff pouch bumped the display case knocking loose the shim Kristi had used to pry it open. It fell to ground and the case slammed down with just enough force to trigger the anti-tampering sensor. Alarms started blaring in the hall and Kristi bolted. The guard was on her in a second. She chased Kristi down the hall and soon caught her by the arm. As Kristi struggled to break free, they crashed into a display of ritual and ceremonial masks, knocking over several in the process.  Kristi broke free of the woman's grasp, grabbed her bag, kicked the guard in the ribs and ran out the delivery entrance. She ran down the street, changing out of her burgling gear and headed toward the subway station.  As the train pulled away from the platform she was thankful that she had gotten away once again but still cursed herself mentally for losing out on over 12 million dollars in jewels. Kristi arrived at her rundown studio apartment, grabbed a water out of the fridge and collapsed in an arm chair. She dropped her bag next to her and heard an odd clattering sound come from it. She picked it up and opened the bag to find a faded, crude looking mask. Kristi turned it over and saw that it was just as plain and ugly on the face side as the back. It looked worthless. Kristi tossed the mask over in a corner in disgust and went in her bathroom to change. While she was brushing her teeth she thought back to when she was casing the museum in preparation for her robbery. She remembered hearing a curator say that the goddess mask was probably the most interesting and dangerous piece of history ever to pass through their doors. That crappy little mask couldn't be what she was talking about, could it?? Kristi picked up the mask, dusted it off and stared at it. She soon decided that the curator was talking about another mask and decided as a joke, she take a selfie of the cheap wooden mask on her face then take it to a fence to see if she could at least get a couple dollars for it in the morning. She pressed the mask on her face and was about to get her phone when her entire body went stiff.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only do I not know who you are. I can't see you! Are you a ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am no apparition, I can assure you. I just wish to thank you for freeing me from my prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prison? What prison??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not seek out my mask to release me and reestablish my cult of worshipers in the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...no... I was just trying to pull a job and this crappy mask fell in my bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, your \"job\" as it were. To try to steal a few measly baubles. Your methods were pathetic and your execution, laughable at best. It is a wonder you haven't caught or flayed alive as yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who are you to criticize me? I'm not the one who's stuck in a cheap, 99 cent store Halloween knockoff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche little one. And seeing as your little mishap DID result in my freedom, how about we begin anew? Starting with who I am. I am the goddess Shananda Reetik. The embodiment of evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is some sorta joke, right??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I sound like I am joking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(gulp) \"Not even a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to help me break free of this accursed prison. And in exchange, I will make you the most powerful woman on the planet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powerful. You mean like rich, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean like able to bend nations to our will. That theft you were attempting will seem insignificant in comparison\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!! What am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this moment, nothing. Tomorrow we will begin your education in the ways of evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm in. Care to give me an idea of what we will be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow you will go to the repository for your tomes of knowledge. You will search for anything concerning the removal of hexes, curses and spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the library....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Go there and begin researching what i have asked of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So after that you'll show me how to get rich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"All will be revealed in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She went to the counter and asked the librarian on duty where she could find books on ancient pagan rituals for a paper she was writing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian pointed her toward the right book stack and Kristi selected her first book. She immediately skeptical of what she was doing because she was a college dropout and was never all that fond of reading. She opened the first book and then her mind went blank.  She soon felt a tap on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss, but we need to close. Would you like to check out some of these books?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristi looked up and saw that the table she sat at was covered with 20-25 books.  Two legal pads were filled with notes she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you check out those books miss. Although you seem to have gotten a tremendous amount of work done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Yeah. Kinda surprised myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you get a good grade on your paper. You definitely did your research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristi smiled weakly as she thanked the librarian. She went home and immediately put on the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work Kristi. You have gathered much information. It should prove useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Now what do you expect me to do with it all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will need to sift through it further to find a way to break the spell. I see you also spent time using some sort of electro-mechanical apparatus during your research. What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The computer? It helps you do alot of things. I was using it to look up other places to find information on your mask and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this machine contain as much information as the library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A computer has as much information as ten thousand libraries. You can find out almost anything you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intriguing. So tell me, how would one acquire one of these devices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not that expensive. Could find one at the local electronics store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have the funds to purchase one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I believe it is time for you and I to work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
