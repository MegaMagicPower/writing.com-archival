Most human civilizations view nudity as shameful and practice modesty, believing the human form to be weak and vulnerable. But there are still a few who embrace their natural form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Orcs</b> of Nuderia live in the scorched desert, unlike most counterparts aren't raving ugly brutes. True, they are much large than the other species, standing over eight feet tall, with both genders being naturally muscled, and they are green skinned with a pair of viscous lower fangs...aside from that Orcs are quite appealing and very well endowed. Male Orcs have members that large and thick (anybody under ten inches is considered small), and female orcs have massive breasts that, while odd still remained proportionate to their muscles bodies. Because of this Orcs are known for ferocious sexual appetites, and also tend to toss modesty aside as they believe anyone who willing covers up their sexual gifts to be shameful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Elves</b> of Nuderia are beautiful, perfect being who occupy the vast forests of the land. Always at one with nature, lower-ranking elves tend to go about naked simply because modesty is something they do not believe in. Higher ranking elves however are taught to wear majestic clothes designed to cover their bodies to the fullest and for an elven noble to shed them in public it is considered improper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other</b> races also exist, but I'll let you decide who those are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: The second \"other\" option will be locked until needed.</span></div></div>",

Nor was he entirely average in appearance- a handsome young man, of lean build, slightly above average high, and slightly above average \"length\" (though he hadn't had much occasion to share that fact.) No, what was simple was Jack's life, the life of a simple commoner in one of the small villages out on the long stretches of nothing that characterized human-inhabited Nuderia. The village had the fixings of any simple settlement- farmers, butchers, medicine man, and all the others in between. In a village of about 120, everyone knew everyone else in at least some capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was bored with all of it. The most exciting thing about the village was the forest out to the West, which would occasionally churn out a rowdy bunch of goblins, a gaggle of pesky fairies, a handful of simple-minded slimes, or some other low-threat but notable diversion. But even that hadn't happened for weeks; Jack was beginning to feel complete boredom set in, stuck in the rut of  simple peasant's life as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut little could he guess the excitement that was in store for him on that day of days, as he would be spending most of it....</span></div></div>",

His job demanded that he get up rather early... but where does he work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Farm is the simplest, most peasanty job for a peasant to have. Not very exciting, and very stuck in routine, Jack can at least take solace in one thing- the Forest. With the farm he works on the outskirts of town, its right next to the thick trees that form the west border of the village. Meaning, of course, that if any oddity makes its way out from the Forest into the village, he'll be the first to get a good look at it. Of course, that usually meant he was the first to have to deal with it as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the Inn was a good source of things to sate his curiosity of the outside world- traveling merchants, foreigners, even the occasional adventurer: all were endless fonts of knowledge about things Jack had never even heard of! Of course, foreigners could often bring strange customs, merchants could bring objects and relics that were more trouble than they were worth and adventurers could, well.... Adventurers could be very rowdy after a few drinks, and as the one usually bringing those drinks, Jack sometimes caught the brunt of that rowdiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps some other facet of village life could be made more exciting for Jack today?</span></div></div>",

The thirty-something widow had lost her husband to a pack of goblins two years ago and ever since then Jack had been doing all the farm work for her. He hated being a farm hand, and he hated Mathilda. What should be a strong-featured beauty always had her face crunched in a scowl, and he long dark hair seemed to be in a constantly state of duress as it danced around her fact, and overly modest grey dress that covered her entire body.<br>\r\n\"The sun has barley risen.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n\"And you should be here before the light is visible!\" Mathilda snapped. \"Now chop that wood, snap to it you lazy boy!\"<br>\r\n<i>I'll chop you, you sexually repressed bitch.</i> Jack thought bitterly as he grabbed the wood axe and Mathilda went inside.<br>\r\nJacks morning proceeded as normal, the sun rose and he chopped log after log while Mathilda scowled at him from her kitchen. Little did either know however that there were other guests at the farm, in the form of pixies.<br>\r\nThe tiny, fairy-like creatures would, if you examined them closely look like human women, albeit naked, multi-colored and with butterfly wings. The male pixies were rarely seen and often regarded as recluses but the females are known of their mischief, powerful magic and a completely lack of understanding as to why humans wore the skin of animals and plants over their bodies.<br>\r\nThis particular group of five, two-inch tall pixies were fluttering about outside the farm, and took a keen interest in Jack and those pair of unsightly brown leggings...</span></div></div>",

Place log on chopping block, raise axe above your head and aim, and bring it down to chop the log in two. Place, raise, chop, place, raise, chop, over and over. Of course, the axe was far from new, and for Jack to sharpen it was only more work, so Jack was also no stranger to the axe sticking in the chopping block and throwing off the rhythm of the entire process. Muttering under his breath, Jack pulled and tugged and strained, but this axe was stuck much deeper and much tighter than he'd ever managed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you stupid thing... ah, forget it.\" Jack offered a final halfhearted try before deciding that he'd earned a break. However, when he went to let go of his axe, he found his hands unable to part with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" He tried flexing his fingers, opening his hands, slipping them off the end of the axe; still, they stuck fast. Was it sap from one of the logs? Wouldn't think it could get this adhesive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe!\" squeaked a high-pitch, bubbly voice from his shoulder. As the farmhand turned to look, his panic was mixed with confusion and wonder, as he found, glowing bright yellow against his drab working tunic, a pixie from the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Jack momentarily forgot his predicament and just stared at the magical little lady. \"You're a fairy, aren't you?\" The pixie nodded her head. Jack chuckled, not believing his luck, before frowning, starting to piece things together. He nodded towards his hand on the hatchet. \"This is, uh.... this one of your little 'tricks'?\" Again, the fairy eagerly nodded her head, smiling wide as she looked behind Jack at the four other multi-colored balls of light floating up to him from within the grass. Oblivious, Jack tried to force a smile in return. \"G-Good one! Really got me there.\" He paused for a moment, staring at the pixie expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n An awkward silence passed, before Jack asked, \"Do you... think you could unstick me now?\" The fairy shook her head in denial. \"Wh- listen, I really would like to get back to work now, so if you could just...\" The yellow pixie blew a rasberry at him, as she fluttered down from his shoulder to stand on the immobile axe. \"N-Now, listen to me, I need... you... too...\" He trailed off, as he heard the giggling of additional pixies. Glancing around, he counted four more; a tall (for a pixie) Green on his left shoulder, a plump Purple on his right, a full-figured Blue that fluttered in front of his nose for a moment before flying off somewhere behind him, and a spry looking Red that hung upside down from above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jack even got to speak, the Yellow pixie snapped her fingers and the little women went into a frenzy. Sparkling trials of different color swirled around him as the pixies poked and prodded him. He could feel one pulling his hair, another working its way down the back of his shirt. Two more of them started climbing up his pant legs, and one of them - Yellow- kept floating in front of his face, making funny faces and provocative poses and then delighting in how red and worked up he got. All Jack was able to do was shake and struggle as he was assaulted, trying harder and harder to pull himself free, when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Talking back just meant she'd stay longer to reprimand him, and he'd rather she left as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got all that? Good. Hop to it.\" Jack made a rude gesture as the woman turned, his eyes lingering downward as she walked away, before he chopped a few more pieces of wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was fairly sure Mathilda was out of earshot, Jack tossed the axe to the side. As if he was going to work like this when he could sneak in a break! She'd take forever at the shops, like she always did, so Jack saw no problem in putting the chores off until later.

His eyes darted from right to left, his hands quickly shooting below the water to cover himself from what he could only imagine were thieves. Slowly, with one arm still covering himself, he started brushing through the reeds, hoping they'd just slid into the mud or something; it'd suck, but it wouldn't be the worst possibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairies, meanwhile, were doing all they could to bust out laughing, hidden in the trees as they were.

Mages, Rogues, and Warriors adventuring across the land, priests and wizards on their pilgrimage, foreigners either venturing forth from their homeland, returning to it, and even some unsavory characters that Jack was all to glad to see leave. All things considered however, the night had not been to eventful. only two fights and broken loose and luckily Jack was not caught in the middle as the bartender/waiter normally was, most of the folk he met were friendly and even the shady looking characters never stayed long. Right now however, there were three particular tables of interest:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a very large, very loud, and very naked Orc shouting and bellowing with his equally large and naked wife. Both of them were challenging random  people to fights and the male Orc boasting about his rather distinctive member size (\"THIRTEEN INCHES PUNY HUMAN, YOUR ENVY IS OBVIOUS!\" ) his wife meanwhile kept giving Jack aside glances and her buxom, naked breasts on fully display made jack glad that his lower half was hidden by the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was a table near the entrance that was occupied by a small group of female Gnomes talking rapidly in their language while fussing over some mechanical contraption that kept coughing steam. Jack wasn't sure what it was-Gnome inventions always baffled him-but at one point he could have sworn that one of the Gnomes (hidden by steam) let out a squeal and when the air cleared was wearing a dirty rob instead of the outfit she walked in with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third and final table was also the strangest and it had several half-naked people around it. The sole fully clothed occupant was a strange person with a bandaged head, heavy robes, heavy gloves, and heavy boots. The only part of them visible was a singe, bright blue eye peeking out from under their head coverings. Evening the Strangers gender was a mystery, and their voice was muffled by the bandages. All the night the stranger had been challenging people to poker and kept winning everything almost instantly, reducing five men and four (soon to be five) women to their skimpy underthings. Every time it got to that point the Stranger offered them a choice: one more hand to win everything or lose their modesty. So far nobody had taken that risk and now their was a group of strangers in their underwear waiting for somebody, anybody to take the risk and win all their clothes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had just finished pouring the drinks and decided which table he would go to first...</span></div></div>",

The shouting Orc was very big, very boisterous, and <i>very</i> naked, while his female companion was just as large and nude, and somehow more intimidating. The Stranger, on the other hand, was at least humanoid... but the growing pile of garments and growing crowd of players missing said garments was making him more than a little uncomfortable. The gnomes, while slightly inconsiderate with their smoke-belching machine, weren't likely to assault and/or strip him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three little women didn't actually seem to notice him at all until he put down the drinks, actually. Even then, the reaction wasn't what he was expecting- the second his tray clinked against the wooden tabletop, he was being shoved away by a small pair of hand on his leg. It was all he could do not to spill the drinks on himself, the floor, or the irate gnome in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upupup!\" The gnome shook her head, and then slipped a pair of goggles off, wiping her brow, strands of her brown hair sticking to her sweaty forehead. The thick shirt, gloves, and trousers she was wearing made him slightly more uneasy about the machine, but not quite as uneasy as the screwdriver she was pointing at his face \"Absolutely no volatile substances on the same surface as the machine.\" Jack was having a hard time not telling her off, considering it was his job to put the drinks on the tables, but he bit his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sorry,\" he said after a second, playing the tray down on the next table over. \"Is here fine?\" he asked, slight edge to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, hon,\" said a blond gnome, the one who was in the raggedy robe for some reason. Her goggles apparently survived whatever happened to her clothes, and as she took them off Jack saw a much more gentle disposition in her eyes. \"Sorry about Lana. She gets antsy when she works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Hanna, if the kid wants to have what happened to you happen to him, he can feel free, but I'm not getting caught up in it.\" The brunette gnome scowled, and glanced over to the redheaded gnome, kneeling on the table over the machine with her face hovering close up to it. \"Ain't that right, Anna?\" The redhead waved noncommittally, not looking up from her work. As Lana muttered to herself and stormed back over to the machine, Hannah walked over to Jack to grab her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I'm really sorry about her, thank you very much....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack,\" he replied, \"and it's no problem. We've definitely had worse in here,\" he said, glancing over to the au naturale mountain of green on the other side of the room. The gnome stifled a giggle. \"So, what are you working on, anyway?\" Glancing over to the machine, Jack was feeling a little more curious than uneasy... until the machine sputtered and sparked again, coughing up another cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that little thing?\" Hanna replied, \"we've been working on that for a while, but it's still got a few kinks in it. It's...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack was just watching another game end, the fifth woman trembling as she removed her undershirt to reveal her underthings. The Stranger simply raked the garment in, making their usual offer to the woman, and when she got up after a moments hesitation, started to shuffle the deck of cards. He was startled out of spectating, almost spilling a tray of drinks, as a hand came to rest gently on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still here, huh?\" Gwen was Jack's boss at the tavern. She'd left to handle a dispute over one of the rooms upstairs in her usual stern-but-fair, and hand only just come back down. She was a pretty woman, if a little heavy set. With long red hair, freckles spread across her face, and a buxom chest, Jack often wound up staring at her a bit longer than was polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Jack said, easing up. \"Do you, uh, want me to send them out, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Gwen waved Jack off, \"whoever they are, they've been paying handsomely for drinks all night. I'm sure I'll get complaints from his opponents, but it's their collective arse on the line if they kept challenging him after the first three losers.\" Jack laughed, but still couldn't bring him to turn away, causing his boss to cock an eyebrow at him. \"You're not thinking of challenging him, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, give me some credit, I know better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded. \"Smart boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Jack to bristle. \"What,\" he said, a defensive edge creeping into his voice, \"you're so sure I'd lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen nodded again. \"And I'd make you get right back to work once you did, no matter how you were dressed.\" This caused Jack to deflate a bit. Sure, he'd take risks, but the other losers could at least go home whenever they wanted. An embarrassing walk through town, yes, but a quick one with clothes at the end. Jack wasn't too far into his shift; if he had to do his job near-naked, or worse, he'd never hear the end of it from the regulars. A clap on his back brought him back down to Earth, as Gwen chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reigned you in a bit, eh?\" she snickered, \"We'll don't dwell too much on it. Like you said, you've got more sense than that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Jack muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen set a drink down on his tray. \"Good, because you're bringing them their drink. Off you go!\" Jack sighed as he came over to the table. There was the blacksmith, the bookseller, the baker, and a few other regulars, along with a group of hunters breezing through town. All of them stood fumbling to cover themselves as Jack came closer. The blacksmith and a few of the hunters took some drinks from his tray, but the others seemed to have lost any desire to make any worse decisions. Of course, the one Jack couldn't stop staring at, and the one whose single blue eye Jack seemed to catch as well, was the Stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha,\" they said, setting the thoroughly shuffled deck down onto the table, \"I was wondering when you'd come by.\" They crooked a gloved finger, and Jack set a mug down in front of them. How the Stranger had been drinking them through the bandages Jack couldn't tell, but whenever anyone looked away the glass seemed to be a little bit more empty. Even muffled by the rags, Jack could hear the smirk creeping into the Stranger's voice. \"So, boy, care to try your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I think I'm alright,\" Jack said. The scantily clad crowd behind him huffed, but we're content to stay silent in their shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad. I haven't had a decent challenge in this town yet.\" The Strangers fingers played at the edge of the cards. \"I suppose that's what I get for coming out to some backwater pub...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pulled Jack back in. \"Hey now!\" he said, \"don't come in here thinking you get to act all high and mighty, just because you can win a card game. Doesn't make you better than us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes me better at the card game, at the very least, doesn't it?\" the Stranger pointed out as their fingers drummed the table, \"And from there, it's not hard to say I'd be better at any other given thing requiring a sense of strategy, an understanding of rules...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luck,\" Jack interrupted, and the Stranger chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's all you think it is, boy, come on and prove me wrong. Or are you just another hick who can't help but run their mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack frowned, the tray of drinks and Gwen's warning nearly forgotten in the indignant anger bubbling in his head. He looked at the Stranger, at the crowd of victims around them, and finally, Jack...</span></div></div>",

Of course, thanks to magic and such, their costumes dictate what happens to them, armor and weapons becoming real, staffs becoming magical, and not being able to read the local languages, or at least not the civilized ones (human, elf, dwarf).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur first lovely misadventurer is Heidi.

She's got black hair, a nice body, a little thin, but nice, somewhere between B and C cup, but a butt to die for, and keeps herself shaven down south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur second lovely lady is Amber.  Dressed up as a standard fantasy female warrior, she's wearing nothing but a chainmail loincloth, a chainmail bikini top, sandals and shin guards, armored bracers, and a hair tie.  She's considerably grumpy at her underwear getting vaporized as she fell through the pucker-hole, but at least she still has her greatsword.  She's a brunette, curves that she was intentionally flaunting at comic-con, <u>almost</u> D-size, but not quite, a perfectly rounded bottom that's the only thing really keeping her loincloth chainmail from sliding off, and a considerable bush down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's it gonna be?</span></div></div>",

Maybe an elven archer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi just humphed. \"Not my thing. I like being Hedelkus the Shadowy Sorceress,\" Heidi continued, gesturing with the free hand not holding her staff at her robe clad body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Heidi wore her robes because the twenty-year old was uncomfortable with her body.

So now she exercised and dieted obsessively, to the point she was a little on the thin side, though her body was firm and trim. Her hair she kept in a bob style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend just shook her head sadly, knowing the poor self image Heidi had of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi also hated her name, thinking it invoked a blue eyed blond Austrian girl, not the olive skinned girl that Heidi saw every time sh looked into the mirror. Heidi always suspected that her adoptive parents had named her Heidi because they had wanted to adopt a child from Northern Europe, not the Indian subcontinent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi had a lot of issues. Which is why she preferred being Hedelkus the Shadowy Sorceress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to go see if there's any slots open for the next tabletop demo,\" Heidi's friend told her. \"Back in ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi nodded as she looked around the convention floor. She found an odd looking photo booth and decided to spend the money to get a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she stepped into the booth, the world disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it reformed, she knew something was different. She still had her wizard's cloak and staff, but she could tell that there was nothing underneath that cloak. And her hair. A second ago, it was in the cute little bob cut she had always preferred. But now her hair was long, straight and lustrous, beautiful shining from being recently brushed. And by long, it was very long, reaching down to the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen an errant breeze parted her robes momentarily, a quick glimpse down showed there had been other changes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was still firm and trim, but she was now slim rather than thin, looking like a fitness model who wasn't overly muscled. Her stomach was flat without being defined. Her breasts...her breasts had gone up a cup size, perhaps two, but they looked gravity defying, with her reddish brown nipples, still unchanged in size, looking small as they capped her new assets. While Heidi normally shaved between her legs, she now had a dark narrow \"landing strip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Heidi's tight firm hip and slightly narrowish hips remained unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi hurriedly closed her cloak again, securing the ties. She didn't have a chance to wonder what had happened to her and where she was, though. Any potential musings were interrupted from a voicing remarking, \"Holy shit! It really worked.\" Heidi looked up from closing up her cloak to see herself being looked at by</span></div></div>",

She was tall for a human, enough to give most elves a run for their money. The bare, slightly scarred muscles of her arms accentuated her shield nicely, as well as the mace she had slung over her shoulder in gloved hands. Her armor, for ease of movement, and so as to fit over her generous, muscled hips, was mostly leather, with metal plating around the torso and legs. Her head was unobstructed, letting the crowd see her solid, though not unattractive face, and the long, brown, braided ponytail that hung comfortably down to the middle of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had come for one purpose- the bulletin board. In many cities of a certain size or more, troubles came up frequently enough that, with the just as frequent traffic of adventurers through them, people could hang up job offers on such boards and be reasonably assured that someone, in time, would give them a hand. For the past few months though, things seemed just peachy, with the only job offers available being menial labor (which Kali often found herself taking, despite hungering for more excitement) or tasks with far, FAR less pay offered than what was being asked. It didn't matter if she needed the money, goblins were right little bastards and Kali wasn't about to go wading through a group of them for just 40 gold coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combination of boredom, low pay, and lack of expectations made it all the more satisfying for Kali to find, smack in the middle of the board, a job that seemed.... actually decent?

Magebane was a rare plant, resistant to magic and capable of nullifying a caster's abilities if exposed to it. But if these roots were supposed to be Magebane, how was Auria controlling them?

Unlike the others, which came up from directly under her, and wrapped straight up her legs, these were coming up from the sides, and started working on, not around, her garmets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait!' shouted Vanessa, \"please!\" Her pleas were of no use; Auria simply watched and grinned at the sight. The new roots had thorns, and would spring forth, clinging to the hem of her robes and then tear away at them scrap by purple scrap.By the time they slowed down enough for Vanessa to stop panicking, they had already done a good deal of damage, and left Vanessa as quite the sight; the robes had been torn completely to shreds from the waist down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost adventurer's had some sort of muscle, but Vanessa had two things working against her in that regard. First, she was a mage. Mages were by nature less inclined towards physical fitness, with so much of their time spent training their mind rather then their muscles. It didn't help that sufficiently powerful mages had little need for physical aptitude- why sweat and labor over lifting a heavy load when it can be done with a bit of concentration and a flick of the wrist instead. Secondly, Vanessa hadn't been out and about on an adventure in some time- while she had gotten her start roaming through dungeons and gallivanting after bandits, most of her income now came from solving magic disputes for nobles, or sweeping away minor monsters from a village with a wave of her hand. Sure, occasionally she was called upon to kill a monster or two; but even then she found little need to climb up to a beast's lair when lighting could be called down from the heaven's above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was that, as the onlookers in the square had discovered, Vanessa's lower half was not a toned adventuress's hindquarters, but a pale pillowy posterior, smoothly curved hips, and thick, root-wrapped thighs. A matching purple silk undergarment currently acted as the only modesty Vanessa had below her waist, and was a sight very few could claim to have seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ms. Starsong,\" Auria called almost singsong to her captive, \"are you starting to understand? Are you enjoying this little taste of what you've done to so many others before?\" Vanessa, still shaken as she was, glared up at the Elven combatant. She could feel the roots still sliding up her legs, tightening just under her bottom, making the generous cheeks seem even moreso. Half ready to break down, but still hanging on to her pride, Vanessa didn't have the time to respond to the Elf's goading before....</span></div></div>",

Vanessa yanked upwards with all her might, but her struggles were fruitless. The roots retracted, pulling her arms down flat in front of her. As they kept retracting Vanessa's arms down and forwards, pulling her over. She grunted as she was yanked, legs trapped in place, arms  being pulled down in front of her.

The plants kept tightening until she found herself doubled over, legs locked straight, torso pulled flat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her robe destroyed from the waist down, she had no cover besides her undergarments from the waist down. Her purple silken underskirt was pulled tight over her large posterior. The remains of her robe inched their way up, threatening to slide up her torso and reveal her body above. She squirmed and struggled as the onlooking crowd watched gleefully. Here was a stuck up Mage loosing her clothing, bent in an uncomfortable and embarrassing pose! Who wouldn't enjoy such a show?

Much to her horror, she could feel the leafy appendages working their way under the tattered hem of her robes, and starting to pull them up her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as we'd all love to see what's under here,\" Auria said, a vine whipping itself across Vanessa's half-silk-covered cheeks as she flicked her wrist, \"I'm not one to leave things half finished. We'll deal with the first layer, then see if those frilly things come off any easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired half-bared mage winced and struggled against her constraints. She vines were working fast- already, her bare back was coming into view, her vision becoming obscured buy the violet remains of her own robes. The breeze was playing across the bare skin of her smoothe stomach, working its way up to the underside of her breasts. Vanessa's face grew red as she knew she was about to be exposed to the still growing crowd, powerless to free herself without her magic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait! That's it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa's own magic was drained by the Magebane, but magic items should still work! In theory. Probably. Vanessa had to admit, she wasn't too familiar with the plant beyond its principal abilities. Still, there was something she'd been saving for a tricky spot that she had tucked down the front of her robes. As the garment got pulled over her head, she might have a chance to grab it. Would it be enough to turn the tides? At this point probably not, but it might just get her out of the vines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her head popped free of her robes, her hands found the item in question. It was just a matter of using it before her elven tormentor could stop her. Then, after finding a new set of robes and building her mana back up, she could track down the sniveling little sadist and give her a taste of her own medicine, just like she probably did to whoever the elf's sister was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa grit her teeth, and spoke the words to activate...</span></div></div>",

The plants seem to bend and sway and thrash along to the elf's tantrum, tearing apart a mass of purple fabric-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Auria's attention. She breathed deeply, muttered a short prayer-for forgiveness for her tirade or for strength to remain calm, none of the onlookers could understand, and walked stiffly over to examine the mass of plant life. In seconds, she could feel her good mood returning. Still trapped by her botanical bounds was a mass of dark purple fabric, tattered and torn, along with a matching, smaller, lighter garment fashioned out of silk, and a pair of sturdy, but fashionable shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuria chuckled to herself, her imagination running wild. She ran through all her knowledge of magic and magic items; she had time but she had to act quickly. Gently picking the mage's underskirt out of the tangle, she held it aloft as she addressed the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People of Strippembare, if you would hear my call...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in another part of the city, there was a burst of light, and the bent over form of a woman fumbled unceremoniously to the floor. Breathing deeply, she looked at her arms and felt her legs, seeing that the vines were gone. Chuckles started to interrupt her ragged gasps, until it grew into a deep laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ooooh, that elf is in for it now!\"</i> Vanessa thought, already coming up with revenge scenarios, <i>\"When my mana builds back up, I'll show her what a real mage can do to humiliate someone! No more plants, no more surprises, just you, me, and a crowd to witness...\"</i> A shiver ran up her spine as a soft breeze blew past her, and it was enough to startle her into finally looking down at herself. Her internal monologueing was cut off as her mind filled with blind panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently the magebane had interfered with her Teleportation, hanging onto the remaining scraps of her clothes even as she vanished into thin air! As such, Vanessa had been left standing out in the open completely naked! Her bare breasts perked up after the breeze, goosebumps spreading across her body all the way down to her magnificent rear, and across her plush thighs, a shock of neat-but-noticeable raven hair nestled in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a short shriek, covering her front with the Scroll, but was swiftly reminded that it served her no further use when, spent, the Scroll crumbled away into dust. Left only with her hands, such a small amount of cover for so much beautiful skin, Vanessa nearly broke down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't. One doesn't get to be a mage without some degree of mental fortitude, and Vanessa's cockiness wasn't without talent to back it up. The Scroll was intended to get her back to her private Sanctum, and it obviously hadn't managed that, but she still couldn't have been sent too far. So, with one hand between her legs, another across her chest, and a few nervous glances over her shoulder to her coverless rear end, Vanessa ascertained that she was...</span></div></div>",

Judging from the smirks on their faces, this meager attempt at modesty was mostly just amusing to them. There were three people; a human woman in the middle with red-dyed leather armor and a nasty scar running across  her right eye, slightly obscured by brown bangs. To her left, a large Orc woman, endowments barely constrained in leather straps and assorted rags; not ramshackle, though dirty, but very carefully arranged, taunting any guard who might confront the giant woman about the modesty laws she only technically wasn't breaking. To her left, another human, shorter than the woman in the middle, but judging from the glow that burst to life in her eyes and on her hands, she was gifted in the magical arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stay back,\" Vanessa warned, \"Do you know who I am? One step closer and I'll-\" Vanessa was cut off as the trio in from of her started to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Starsong,\" said the one with the scar, \"I don't think I'd go around advertising who I am if I was in your position.\" She kicked a pile of rubble, and Vanessa flinched as a bottle clattered across the ground near her feet. \"Naked and scrounging through the trash, like a beggar. Pathetic, isn't it, O Great and Powerful Sorceress?\" Vanessa's stomach sank. She had put a lot of effort into making herself recognizable and building a reputation, but in this situation, she wished she would have done anything for the benefit of anonymity. Especially considering how she decidedly did not have friends among the Thieves' Guild...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as much fun as we could have with you,\" the woman in red continued, \"I think our boss would get a real kick out of you. Maybe even figure out how to make some coin out of this happy little meeting! So, don't try any magic now, and we'll just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa started to back up as the three advanced on her. The woman in red had pulled out a nasty looking dagger, while the orc was pounding her fist into the palm of her hand, and the mage had started muttering to herself as the arcane energies on her hands started swirling and pulsing. But wait- that gave Vanessa an idea. The bandit had warned her against using any magic, meaning they didn't know how low on mana Vanessa actually was! And if they had heard of her already, Vanessa reasoned, they had to know what Vanessa could actually accomplish with magic... With just a little bit of mana, she could create an illusion of a larger spell, a \"warning shot\", and maybe bluff her way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, running was always an option. The alley ways appeared empty, so hopefully few would see her streaking across the city, but they were the thieves' home turf. If she got out in the open, she might have a better shot of getting away... but who would be out there to see her running in the nude?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every step forward made by the three in front of her, and every step backwards by Vanessa herself, the distressed mage felt her pulse beating harder and faster.

There was fear, for a moment, nervousness, anger, little bit of fear again, more anger... Vanessa thought that \"acceptance\" was supposed to come next, but it looked like she was sticking with anger. The woman in red drew her knife once more, crouching into a combat stance. Her companions noticed her change in demeanor, and followed suit, the orc cracking her knuckles while the mage finished casting a spell- a glow came to life in her hands before briefly passing over the three of them. As far as Vanessa could tell it was a shield of some sort which meant two things: on the one hand, they still thought she could still put up <i>some</i> fight. On the other, any spell that she could actually cast right now probably wouldn't do much against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Starsong. You almost had us there,\" the bandit started, breaking Vanessa's assessment, \"but I think we're better off taking our chances against you.\" She motioned to her orc companion -Rel- with her free hand, and the big green woman started moving forward. \"When it comes down to us being naked with no captive mage versus getting scorched a bit with and <i>maybe</i> having a captive mage, I think it's a pretty clear choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry to hear you've come to that decision,\" Vanessa said, trying to keep her powerful demeanor even with the giant woman advancing on her, sneering. \"Don't say I didn't warn you...\" The orc woman huffed as she came to a stop in front of Vanessa, posturing and standing straight. If the effect was to intimidate the mage, then it was working. But Vanessa had some tricks up her non-existent sleeves too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breathe, Vanessa moved her arms away from her body, concentrating the glow even more intensely. As the orc started to reach for her, bracing against some attack, Vanessa let loose- closing her eyes, pointing her arms straight into Rel's face, she quickly fed more energy into the light, causing it to get brighter and brighter until it burst, a flash of light briefly illuminating the alleyway. A cheap parlor trick, really, but it seemed to have caught Rel off guard, and as the green woman reeled blinded in the narrow alley, Vanessa took off running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch her!\" she heard the woman in red cry out, almost inaudible over the orc's bellowing. All Vanessa could do was put more distance between them and her, and hope that her magic started to return a little faster. It wasn't easy to navigate the labyrinth between buildings, and her state of dress only made things worse. She kept one arm over her chest, keeping her breasts from bouncing painfully as she ran, but the other was swinging at her side. She would have loved to keep it as cover between her legs, but with the amount of times she'd already had to catch herself from slipping, or shove a pile of refuse out of the way, she knew she was better off keeping one free hand at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she came to a dead end, and her heart sank. With time, maybe, she could scale the brick wall before her. It'd be simpler to cast Levitate and float over it, or hell, burn through it with a blast of Acid, but... Vanessa didn't think she could do either of those right now. The sound of footsteps behind her made her blood freeze. As she slowly turned, she saw one of the bandits advancing on her. They must have split up, which was good for Vanessa, or at least better than before.

Vanessa squirmed, feeling her fair white skin on the grimy black ground. She reached down, grabbing each of Vanessa's wrists and twisting them painfully behind her back. Then she bound them together. Vanessa kicked her legs, which simply reminded the bandit to bind them as well. She tied her ankles together, then wrapped all four limbs tightly together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa was hog tied! She started to scream an objection, but the prepared bandit quickly gagged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time the other two bandits had found her.

Along the way she'd picked up many skills. She was a master with the dagger, thrown or in hand. She could move with grace and speed, being as silent as cat. She'd learned to pick pockets from a Gypsy, a skill she made her way by. Always she thirsted for new lands, new adventures! Careless, wild and fun loving Dianna loved her chosen life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Dianna was on her way via ship to Mordul, a mysterious land across the long sea. Little was known of the place: few made the long journey there, and almost none made it back. Since she'd heard of it Dianna had been fascinated. Now, she approached the shores, she knew she'd made the right choice. There was glittering pillars, ornate buildings. These people were obviously rich, he could steal a fortune here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat docked. Dianna joined the line of sailors, eager to leave the ship after three months at sea. To their surprise, at the base of the plank from their boat stood a man with two guards with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Mordul!\" He said, extending his arms. \"Though travelers are rare here we welcome them all! All we ask is that our traditions and ways be respected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The captain said, shaking the man's hand as they exited the boat. When Dianna reached the shore the man raised his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Madame, you are inappropriately attired.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDianna looked down. She wore a white, fluffy sleeved shirt with a black leather vest over it. Below she had black riding britches leading down to leather boots. On her head she had a black three cornered hat, with her auburn hair tucked under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inappropriate?

She was also amazed because the woman was impossible perfect. Tall, lean, yet curvy. She had a giant chest that stood erect and perky as though she was wearing a corset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, we were blessed by our city's founder, the Mage Mordul.\" the man explained. \"The women of our city are the most perfect in the world.

She wanted to refuse, but then they would strip her regardless! But to surrender her own clothes like that... it was so demeaning! Besides, apparently their women all looked like goddesses! Dianna knew she was pretty. Fit, with a nice face and slender body. But if that woman she'd just seen she couldn't hold a candle to these women! To be naked, before every man, with every woman her physical better was humiliating to even think about! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh what to do?</span></div></div>",

She was an experienced fighter, but wasn't prepared. One of the guards grasped her arms, pulling them behind her back. She kicked out at the other guard, but he easily side stepped her flailing feet. To Dianna's horror, the guard she'd tried to kick grasped the top of her leather vest with one burly hand. Then, with shocking ease he pulled down, ripping the latches open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No!\" Dianna exclaimed, struggling madly. These guards had done this before though. With shocking ease one guard restrained her while the other grabbed her blouse. He pulled, carelessly popping the buttons off. Dianna looked down as her corset came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could react the guard reached down, unlatching her belt. It fell to the ground, her sword and pouches falling with it.Then he grasped her tight leather riding pants. Not bothering to untie them he began forcing the leather down her legs. Dianna tried to kick but soon her legs were tangled in her pants as they slid down her thighs. Then, at her boots he simply pulled them off with the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDianna had been stripped to her underwear in seconds! She was now barefoot, bare legged, all that covered her was her ripped open shirt, corset and panties! Her pale, lithe and thinly muscled legs were visible to everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd had started to gather on the dock. They all stared blatantly at Dianna. To her shock there were women there. Naked women! All of them looked similar. Evenly tanned, tall statuesque women with perfect figures. She looked nothing like them! She was pretty, but somewhat boyish in figure. She'd never been ashamed of her body before now, but she couldn't compare to these goddesses! Maybe the women here really were blessed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople in the crowd were commenting. Dianna could hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's so skinny! Is she ill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like the sun has never touched her skin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the worst moment yet. The guard grasped her corset by the front, right between her breasts, his hand smoothing into her chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hey let go!\" Dianna yelped. The guard ignored her though. With shocking strength he ripped the corset from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dianna looked down in shock. Her breast swung into view. Her perky B cups swung out excitedly free from the confines of her top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDianna looked up, wide eyed and horrified. There were dozens of people staring at her breasts! Some were laughing, some pointing. Men, nude beautiful women, children! They all commented freely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're so small!\" Said one of the nude women. She, like all the others, had at least D cup breasts that seemed to defy gravity, pressed upwards perkily together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps she's a child!\" A man exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never seen anything like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDianna wished she could cover herself. But, the other guard still held her arms pinned back. So her breasts were being viewed and oogled and she could do NOTHING about it! She'd never thought they were small. They weren't! Well, not that small. Not that big either. But apparently on the island of naked bimbos, they were considered small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt shamed. She was being judged and coming up short. All her roguish bravado dissappeared, and she was completely helpless in her shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard grasped her panties. Dianna barely struggled as they were yanked down. She was now naked, except her shirt which hung uselessly from her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, I've never seen red hair down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDianna looked up. It was true, all the women here were brunette's and blondes. She was the only red head present, another way she stood out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard holding her arms released her, yanking her shirt off as he did. Now Dianna threw her arms over her body. It mattered little though. Everyone had already seen everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastards!\" She growled at the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the law.\" The guard shrugged. He scooped up her clothes. He gave her coin purse, which Dianna snatched before pressing it over her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your visit!\" The guard smirked as he left. Dianna looked around. She was now stuck in this strange land. Naked. Her boat was to be docked here for weeks! She was trapped. She'd planned to explore, to steal and to adventure while here. How could she do those things naked?</span></div></div>",

Besides, she could take care of herself, though she wished she had her rapier and daggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a tavern within seconds. This may be a strange new land, but sailors still craved strong drink when they got to shore! Cupping her body, she shuffled down the street. Almost everyone looked twice at her. It made sense. All the women here towered over her, with curvy, tan bodies. She was short, pale and skinny. Besides that she was the only one with bright red hair she'd seen her. To top it all off, all the other women walked around naked calmly, as though they were fully clothed. She had her hands clamped over her body, hunched over. She wished she could act like these other women, but years of ingrained modesty prevented her. So everyone stared as she shuffled through the crowd. She felt even more exposed every time her bare body brushed against a fully clothed man. Shuddering, she pushed her way to the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the salon style door open, but to her surprise, a large, meaty hand grasped her shoulder, pushing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" She asked, horrified to the unwelcome touch while she was bare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play games.\" A large, heavy set man said. \"Foreign red head or not, everyone knows that taverns or for adults.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I AM an adult!\" Dianna yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure kid.\" He laughed. \"Now get out of here or I'll flag down a guard to drag you up to school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDianna stumbled back, in shock. She'd never been banned from a tavern! She'd started drinking at bars when she was 15! She often made her living slipping drunk's purses at the bar! Apparently though, by the standards of this horrid place, she looked like a child? She was 22! Could it be true? She looked down at herself. She wasn't that boyish... was she?

Selena offered her services to those that could afford it, and knew how to contact her. Nobody knew much about the thief beyond the cant physical details already mentioned and her nefarious line of work. For the right price, Selena would destroy the reputation of anybody, most notably by stripping them bare and leaving them for all to see in some highly public area.

Cassandra was a bandit, plain and simple; robbing caravans, extorting peasants, and dodging the law were all regular aspects of the woman's life. Her heavy axe was her weapon of choice, the wicked tool proving just as effective at intimidating people as hacking through armor. Bandits might enjoy prosperity and wealth for a time, but they all know that they can't get complacent- the law will do anything it can to bring such a notorious bandit to justice.</span></div></div>",

Captain Henrietta Reinhardt was a mountain of a woman, tall and rugged, and she was cold as any mountain's peak. With her keenly honed talents of combat and tactics, and her domineering nature, she rose quickly through the ranks of the Queen's Guard, eventually taking command of it. Under her iron grip, crime was rapidly declining, with a new wave of authority spreading out from the capital, only losing sway as it spread out to the edges of the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, not everyone was happy about this. Most bandits, thieves, and any other given group of ne'er-do-wells were all having to watch their step more than they'd like to have to. Selena included, though she was skilled enough that it wasn't more than an inconvenience, but she had no  love for the Captain. Then of course were the common peasants and merchants, who in the past might have gotten away with a harmless bit of unsanctioned trading or gambling, but were now finding themselves subject to tariffs and fines. And of course, even among the Captain's immediate superiors and inferiors, there were doubtless people who had gotten sick of the woman, or who wanted to be where she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it didn't matter who wanted the woman taken down a peg; Selena was happy to go about her job either way. But, she could take a certain amount of pleasure in knowing that many other people would be happy to see her job finished as well. All that mattered is how she would  get the job done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Would it be while the Captain was sleeping? The barracks would obviously be crawling with trained Guards, but if she could pull it off, Selena would be humiliating Reinhardt in front of her troops. Alternatively, she could wait for the Captain to leave the city on business. Outside the city walls, with only a handful of guards as escort, Selena would have a much easier time, and the client would undoubtedly be satisfied if she sent Henrietta running back into the city buck naked. Or, if she really wanted to make Reinhardt squirm, it was no secret that the woman was uncomfortable at the high society celebrations in the palace that she was obligated to attend as security. Selena wasn't opposed to giving any visiting nobles a good show, and it was a good opportunity to scope the place out for future reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena set about preparing herself for her mission- black, light armor, covering every inch of her skin, with an accompanying mask that covered everything but her hair. A number of knives, good for throwing, threatening, and everything in between. Rope, hooks, a smoke bomb or two, even a vial of sedative if it came down to that. All would be in order when she set out to humiliate Captain Reinhardt...</span></div></div>",

And that was assuming Selena didn't figure out a way to expose the captain to a wider audience than was guaranteed at the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking into the ball itself was trivial, as it always was for an infiltrator of Selena's caliber. There were never enough guards to watch every vulnerability, and there were always windows in patrols where she could slip past without issue.

Music, mindless gossip among the gathered nobles, and the scurrying of serving staff all mingled into a dull roar that was easy enough to follow. Captain Reinhardt was exactly where Selena figured she'd be: by the Queen's side, prepared to defend her liege with her life. This was good; Reinhardt and the other guards were focused on protecting the Queen and guests, and would never have thought one of their own would need protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was the question of how to go about enacting the captain's humiliation.

Both needed to move deliberately from place to target to place, weaving through a variety of obstacles. Both needed to be able to predict the behavior of others, and be flexible when something unpredictable happened. Both needed to draw as little attention as possible, only showing themselves at crucial moments. There was a sort of unspoken kinship between Silena and the overworked waiters and waitresses that she could see running back and forth across the ballroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost felt sorry for the one who'd be giving her a disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing as a noble was too risky, too much potential for someone to recognize her as an impostor. And even with all of her skills, trying to approach the queen from any angle as she was would end badly for her; Reinhardt wasn't liked, but that didn't mean she was bad at her job. No, Reinhardt wouldn't be suspicious of a servant- at least, not more so than she was constantly of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the demand of the job, it was only a matter of time before one of the servants needed a break. This one was easy enough to pick out; a lean young woman with red curly hair, beads of sweat visible on her brow. She'd nearly spilled a glass as she poured one of the patrons fresh wine. Silena watched the woman, visibly shaken from the close call, unsteadily make her way over to the kitchen. Silena silently slipped into a covered cart that passed by her vantage point, and in a few short moments she was right there behind her quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping out from under the cloth, Silena followed the redhead through a servants exit. Lucky for her, the girl didn't think to look back until she opened the door to a set of servant's quarters. But by then, even as green eyes widened and freckled cheeks stretched back to scream, Silena was upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a bed in the servant's quarters lie the unconscious body of the servant. Silena had tried to be as gentle as possible, but the girl was still going to wake up with a headache. Not to mention a chill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoots hit the floor, leggings were peeled off, tunic pulled over uncooperative arms. Silena even took off the girls underclothes, revealing two pink nubs and a bush of orange hair. If she woke up anytime soon, her nudity would discourage her from escaping- if the underwear-turned- gag &amp; hogtie didn't keep her stuck in the nearby linen cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith disguise in hand, Silena started to change, knowing that she was already much closer to another successful job done...</span></div></div>",

She'd been more focused on isolating a servant to steal an outfit from than she was on singling out a servant that matched her figure.

With an apologetic kiss on the forehead of the unconscious servant, Selena slipped back into the ballroom and assumed her role as a lowly servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena hated nobles, and her experience within minutes of being in the ballroom dressed as a servant only helped remind her why she hated them so much. The ladies were dismissive and rude, and the men were blatantly lecherous, seeing nothing wrong with copping a feel on the shapely \"servant\" as she made her way through the crowd. If this kept up, Selena was going to need to start a list of people that deserved payback once this was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could wait, the contract was far more important. Reinhardt was on the other side of the ballroom, her eyes scanning the crowd for any sign of danger to her Queen. Selena had her vial of sedative hidden up one of her sleeves, and it wouldn't be difficult to relieve a fellow servant of a drink tray.

The woman who had stopped her was dressed in an elaborate dress, light purple with white trim, and a low cut bodice that showed off a generous amount of pale-skinned cleavage. If it wasn't for the amount of jewelry she was wearing, including am amethyst necklace that nearly dipped in between the woman's displayed breasts, one might call her trashy. As it was, she was gaudy and flashy- opulent enough to call her refined, if only barely restrained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry, your ladyship, but I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be!\" interrupted the woman. \"Drab, lowly girl like you wouldn't even have those simpering clothes if it wasn't for my kingdom's textiles.\" Ah, Selena knew who she was dealing with now. This must have been a member of the ruling family in Baredeth, a neighboring kingdom whose chief export was in textiles, the unique plants and animals living there producing high quality silks and tough, sturdy wool alike. Of course, this couldn't have been the Queen, or the Princess- likely a niece of the Queen, or a sister-in-law to one of the Princesses. High status? Certainly. Importance to the kingdom? Most likely negligible. Selena had no doubt that she was looking at a spoiled brat sent to the party to fulfill some sort of obligation to keep the kingdoms' relationship strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-HEM,\" the Lady coughed. \"My drink, <i>s'il vous pla\u00eet</i>?\" Selena knew that her temper wouldn't last long, but Selena still needed to keep her own in check. Or... certainly,  if something were to happen to dignitary of a foreign kingdom, something embarrassing that could damage relations, the Royal Guard would need to do something about it. If Selena slipped a bit of the sedative, escorted the suddenly dazed noble to a secluded room in a compromising position, and then informed the Captain that something was amiss, the captain would surely look into the matter herself to avoid publicizing the issue. Leaving the ballroom alone would open Reinhardt up to more options for Selena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that might be over-complicating things. She'd been hired to humiliate one target, without letting her own feelings getting in the way.

At the very least, a few young males of the family were finding themselves in an odd spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Rodrick has recently come of 21 years of age, and in the eyes of the aristocracy, is long overdue on finding a bride. Tall, lean, and handsome, he's attracted more than a few offers, even from non-human kingdoms, though for whatever reason none of them have seemed right to him. Between the pressure from his family, the frightening prospect of a diplomatic marriage, and the unwanted responsibility of ruling in general, Rodrick is finding his loyalty to his kin and kingdom shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis 3 years younger brother, Prince Callum feels similarly stifled behind castle walls, though unlike his older brother, he still gets away with most anything, and has little to worry about in life. His mind is a curious one, however, and he dreams of being allowed to roam free through the kingdom, no retainers or royal responsibilities fast enough catch him. The odds of him surviving outside the castle are somewhat skewed; while he does mean well, he is spoiled, though not quite rotten, meaning that his naivety can get the better of him at times. Not to mention, while he is an attractive young man, his is a body that hasn't known a day of work. Still, its his wits that let him get away with so much inside his family's castle, it's likely they'd serve him well on the outside as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir older brother, however, Prince Dalton, is nearing his time on the throne, with his father's health ailing - nothing deadly, but enough to convince him that his time is better spent relaxing and recuperating, and leave the troubles of the modern kingdom in the hands of a younger, more modern mind. However, while the King trusts his son dearly, he isn't quite ready to abdicate his throne. Dalton, be it through diplomacy, or great achievement in battle, is looking to prove himself to his father. His heart is true, but is single-minded devotion to his task might cause some problems to blindside him, especially considering not everyone approves of his headstrong nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will the victim be?</span></div></div>",

The word of a royal is law, and image is everything. No proper noble would dare be caught in anything other than exquisite garments of the highest quality and value, lest their vassal lords or the common peasants think less of them. Indeed, being caught naked might be one of the worst things that could possibly happen to a member of a royal family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree royal human women are destined to learn this fact the hard way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Arianne, the epitome of a proper royal lady. Educated in all the ways of etiquette and politics, Arianne possesses a sharp mind and looks befitting a woman of her station. Long golden hair compliments her clear blue eyes and flawless pale skin, while her well-maintained figure is clad in gowns and dresses that would put any other woman to shame. After all, one must be the spitting image of royal perfection when they are the heir to the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Sharon, on the other hand, is the opposite. A mere two years younger than Arianne, the nineteen year old princess chafes under the expectations placed upon her. Dresses feel awkward, and diplomacy seems boring and pointless. Far better to wear armor and settle matters with a sword, so far as Sharon is concerned. Thanks to some \"persuading\" of the captain of the guard, Sharon has learned how to handle a sword, and has started to fancy herself an adventurer. All she needs is a chance to slip away from the palace so she can prove herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Melody, mother to the princesses above, is a blend of her two daughters. Just as skilled with her wits as with an army, the Queen holds her realm together through shrewd political maneuvering and shows of force when necessary. While she is generally respected and loved by her people, there are plenty of scheming nobles and disgruntled peasants that see her as everything wrong with the land. Any sign of weakness from a queen is dangerous, and could be exploited by her enemies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, who is the unlucky lady?</span></div></div>",

Her only other option was to stay in the woods. At least no one would see her here, unless she encountered a hunter or some such person. She imagined the Druid was probably nearby.

She was startled b a voice speaking up from behind her. <br>\r\n\"Not so high and mighty now, are you?\" <br>\r\nReluctantly, Arianne turned around. Her jaw dropped at what she saw. <br>\r\nHer sister, Princess Sharon, was standing before her, completely naked. Her hands were on her hips, exposing her small breasts as well as the space between her legs. She sported a cocky grin. <br>\r\n\"Well, now your on our level,\" she said. \"At least have some fun for once.\" <br>\r\nBehind her, two guards appeared. They were the most handsome guard Arianne had ever seen. They were shirtless, with long hair and cute faces. They had chiseled abs that Arianne couldn't stop staring at. Her nipples hardened beneath her arms and she began to feel warm and wet between her legs. <br>\r\nCausally, Sharon turned around to face them. As she did, the guards reached for their pants and pulled down. <br>\r\nYes, thought Arianne. Show me more. <br>\r\nInstinctively, one hand began kneading her breasts while the other ran between her legs, rubbing up and down. She had never done anything like this before, but it felt so good. Sharon and the guards vanished, and soon it was only her. <br>\r\nShe felt the breeze run over every part of her body, reminding her of her nudity, but she only became more aroused. Her hand sped up and she began to moan. It was a small, quiet moan at first, but soon she couldn't hold it back. She began screaming. Never before had she felt such bliss. <br>\r\nShe was getting closer and closer with every second. To what, she had no clue. But it was feeling better and better all the time. <br>\r\nShe was feeling more and more moist between her legs. Soon, she...</span></div></div>",

Or was there someone there? The princess blushed at the thought of the second option - was someone hiding out there, spying on her in her undignified state? Were they even now staring at her naked form, bare before their prying eyes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth, prepared to demand that whoever was there to reveal themselves in her most intimidating royal voice (utterly ignoring that in her current condition, there was nothing intimidating about her), but only let out a surprised yelp as there was a sudden pain in the side of her neck. Her hands instinctively snapped up from covering her privates to grab at the object that she could feel now sticking out of her neck; pulling it out with an equal amount of pain, Arianne looked down at the offending object, and was shocked to see a wooden dart with some kind of red plumage on the dull end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was processing what had just happened, a numbness swept through Arianne's body, and her vision began to blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is thiii...\" Arianne started to exclaim, only for her words to slur out into nonsense, her tongue suddenly feeling like it was made of lead. Panicking, as she began to realize she'd been poisoned, the princess tried to flee, but her limbs felt like they'd turned to stone. She tripped over her own feet and hit the ground hard, all feeling leaving her body. And as her vision darkened completely, she heard the sound of feet approaching, but couldn't see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't this our lucky day?\" a voice asked, sounding far away, \"I mean, who'd expect to find <i>this?</i> out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the view later,\" a second voice admonished, \"The sleep potion I put on those darts only lasts a few hours.

As she tried to blink her fuzzy vision back to normal, her blurry mind tried to remember what had happened. Had she had too much to drink at the feast last night? She had been at a feast, hadn't she? She remembered being on her carriage back to her parents' palace for one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianne's eyes snapped open and her vision cleared as her nightmarish experience came back to her - the druid, ending up naked in the forest, being drugged... so, where had she ended up after that? Looking around, she felt her face pale at the sight that greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in a cage. A <i>cage</i>. Like an animal! And she wasn't alone, either. There was a group of other women, of various ages, in there with her, all as naked as she was. Most of them were huddled up to cover themselves as best as they could, with haunted looks in their eyes. They all also had iron collars wrapped around their necks, which caused the princess to realize that there was a weight around her own that she hadn't noticed in her dreariness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she muttered in shock, reaching up and realizing that she had a collar of her own, \"No, no, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she saw that the cage was one of several inside a small canyon, all likewise containing groups of men and women of several races who had been stripped and collared. Interspaced between the cages were tents, carriages, and fire pits, around which were milling more people of various races, all wearing dirty clothes and armor, and all heavily armed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlavers. She'd been caught by slavers, some of the most despicable of all criminals in any kingdom. She'd heard something about them having a growing presence in Nuderia, but she'd never actually cared to pay much attention to the issue. It had never been her problem, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, awake I see,\" a vaguely familiar voice spoke up. Turning, Arianne saw two men - one short and fat, the other fairly normal but with a scar over one eye - standing by the cage and leering at her. Arianne yelped as she remembered she still naked, and she quickly covered herself. This just caused the men to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late, sweetheart, we had plenty time to look you over on the way here,\" the fat one smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How dare you?!\" she screeched, blushing, \"Do you peasants know who I am?! I'm the crown princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men blinked, and then burst into uproarious laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you hear that Alek?\" the fat one asked, \"This mad girl thinks she's a princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, I heard her Rickard,\" the scarred one, Alek, replied, \"Didn't realize it was a royal past time to streak through the woods, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All hail the royal tits!\" Rickard shouted, sending himself and Alek into a fresh round of laughter, and making Arianne blush even harder.

To her mild surprise, what she saw was a bush covered in what appeared to be bright yellow berries. The princess was no expert, but even so, she couldn't tell what kind of berry these, and they seemed oddly out of place, especially since they only appeared to be growing on that one particular bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Arianne was just going to ignore the oddity and move on, when her stomach rumbled. She hadn't eaten much today, in preparation for the feast, and in addition to that, she always got hungry when stressed, and this was by far the most stressful day of her life. So, perhaps she should help herself, and at least not be hungry in addition to lost and naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what if these berries were poisonous? How would she know if they were?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArianne argued with herself back and forth for a few minutes, but ultimately decided to risk it and eat the berries. They couldn't possibly make the situation any worse than it already was, and her hunger was at least one problem she could resolve easily. So, she tentatively reached out with one hand (continuing to cover her breasts with the other, while keeping her legs clamped together) and plucked one of the berries. Popping it into her mouth and chewing, her eyes widened in delighted surprise at the highly pleasing taste that filled her mouth. Glad that something was finally going right for her, she plucked more berries and started eating them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a mistake, however. For while the berries were not in fact poisonous, they <i>were</i> in actuality a fruit of magical origin, and by consuming them, Arianne had exposed herself to that magic.

She was dressed in plain commoner clothing that well hid her bosom. Arianne watched the woman's breasts and saw that they were about the same size as her. Or rather, what they used to be. A pang of jealousy shot through her as she watched them. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" the woman asked as she drew nearer. <br>\r\n\"What?\" Arianne asked, looking up. She had been staring at the newcomer's breasts too long. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she asked again. <br>\r\nA breeze passed and Arianne felt as a leaf scraped her butt. She blushed as the sudden reminder of her state of dress, or lack there of, and looked down at her feet. \"Er... yes,\" she muttered, refusing to make eye contact. \"Why do you ask?\" <br>\r\n\"Well,\" the woman said looking her up and down. \"You're kind of... naked. Would you like clothes?\" <br>\r\nArianne's spirits lifted. She couldn't return to the kingdom like this. But if she had clothes - moreover, clothes that hid her flatness - she could return and figure out her problem without facing any laughter. Judging by the newcomer's appearance, she would have just the clothes she needed. Arianne just needed to find the proper stuffing. <br>\r\n\"That... would be lovely,\" Arianne said at last, forcing a smile and looking up at the newcomer. \"What is your name?\" <br>\r\n\"Susan,\" she answered. \"What's yours.\" <br>\r\nArianne opened her mouth to answer when Susan gasped. <br>\r\n\"I know who you are!\" she said. <br>\r\nArianne's heart skipped another beat. <br>\r\n\"N-no you don't,\" she said, but it was too late. <br>\r\n\"You're princess Arianne!\" Susan said excitedly. She grabbed Arianne by the arm and pulled her down the hill with her. This partially exposed Arianne's chest, forcing her to adjust her other arm. <br>\r\n\"Come along,\" Susan continued, not noticing Arianne's lack of a bust. \"My mother will be so excited to see you! She'll be happy to help the princess!\" <br>\r\n<i>No, no, no,</i> Arianne thought to herself. She was about to be exposed in front of an entire village. They were going to see her naked and flat. She could see it now, all the woman, who she had previously looked down on, giggling and what little she now had or else sticking out their chests in gloat. <br>\r\nBefore she could think of an excuse or a plan, she was already in front of Susan's house. Susan pulled the door open and ushered her inside. Arianne glanced up to see people were staring, apparently curious about the naked woman that had entered their village. She felt momentarily relieved to see no one had heard Susan's shrieking of her identity. <br>\r\nOnce inside, Arianne found herself face-to-face with Susan's mother. She looked just like her daughter, only with a few wrinkles and gray hairs. Even her breasts were the same size. Arianne flushed as she realized she had the smallest pair in the room. <br>\r\n\"Mother, mother,\" Susan was gasping. \"This is Princess Arianne! I found her just outside the village. She could use our help!\" <br>\r\nSusan's mother...</span></div></div>",

Nothing. Completely flat. I don't even think she can wear a bra. Princess Arianne has some of the biggest breasts in the kingdom.\" <br>\r\nSusan's face fell. Arianne began shaking, her face burning even more brightly if that were possible. She wasn't sure what to think. On one end, she was relieved that she hadn't been recognized. On the other, Susan's mother's words only strengthened her humiliation. She used to be one of the biggest in the kingdom. Now she couldn't wear a proper bra. <br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Susan's mother said, seeing Arianne's reaction. \"I'm sorry.That was rude of me. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll grow one day. Stay here just a second.\" <br>\r\nShe rushed out of the room. Susan didn't say anything and Arianne was glad of it. When her mother returned, she gave Arianne some ragged clothes. <br>\r\n\"This is all we have,\" she said. \"They might not fit properly.\" <br>\r\nArianne was tempted to scream. She was a princess. She shouldn't be made to wear commoner garments! But she had to play her part. Besides, commoner clothes were better than nothing. Especially given her predicament. She quickly pulled on the clothes, and was quickly disappointed when she found that the chest hung a little loose, allowing her to look inside. She just flattened it against her and looked up at Susan's mother. <br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said begrudgingly. <br>\r\n\"You can thank me by doing some of our chores for us,\" Susan's mother said. \"Those clothes aren't for free.\" <br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Arianne asked, ready to argue. Flat chest. Old commoner clothes. She had fallen tremendously, but she was not about to do chores. <br>\r\n\"It's either that or you give me our clothes back,\" Susan's mother said. \"I don't think you'd like to go naked given your... chest.\" <br>\r\nArianne's face burned again. <br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she said. \"What do you want?\" <br>\r\nShe spent the rest of the day cleaning clothes for Susan and her mother. Susan's mother thought it was a fitting price to pay. The whole time, Arianne kept her face down, not wanting anyone else to recognize her. At one point, she saw Susan stroll passed her and feed a horse that was tie up by their house. It must have been theirs, Arianne realized. She found her way home. <br>\r\nOnce she had finished hanging their underwear to dry, she entered their home for dinner. <br>\r\n\"I never got your name,\" Susan's mother said suddenly. <br>\r\n\"It's... Sharon...\" Arianne said, not being able to think of a name quick enough. <br>\r\nSusan's mother nodded and said nothing. When they were finished eating, she gathered their plates and washed them, before returning to bed herself. Susan started to say something to Arianne, but she didn't listen, her focus was on all of the bras hanging outside. They had to be dry by now. She would wear one and stuff the others inside. Then she would be able to return home as her old self. <br>\r\n\"Did you hear me?\" Susan asked. <br>\r\n\"Uh.. what?\" Arianne said, looking at her. <br>\r\n\"You can sleep with me,\" Susan offered. \"There's only one bed.\" <br>\r\n\"Oh... okay.\" <br>\r\nThe two stood by the window awkwardly, not knowing what to say. Then, without warning, Susan lunged at Arianne and kissed her on the lips. Arianne's heart beat quickened, her face started to burn, and she felt her nipples harden. What was this woman doing to her. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Susan pulled away, licking her lips. <br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry,\" she said. \"You just... you're so... I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\nShe turned and ran before Arianne could say anything. She ran into her room and slammed it behind her. Arianne simply stood there, dumbfounded. <br>\r\nThat was her first kiss. And it had been stolen by a woman. A woman whose breasts she heavily admired. Now that she thought about it, Susan was quite pretty. Maybe she could stay the night. Maybe she could see if there was anything physical that Susan could teach her. <br>\r\nArianne...</span></div></div>",

Reluctantly, she pulled off the dress and, standing naked, pulled on the bra. Sure enough, there was too much space between it and her chest for her to wear it properly. She began stuffing it with the other bras until stiffened. When she was done, she pulled on the dress and examined her reflection in the window. She resembled her old self. If she didn't know any better, she'd say that she was back to normal. <br>\r\nShe turned back to the clothes hanger and stole a pair of panties while she was at it. It felt so good to have underwear again - especially after a whole day of going commando - that she didn't care that it was commoners' clothes. <br>\r\nShe turned to the horse now. She had had plenty of horse riding lessons in her youth. This was going to be the easiest part of all. She untied the horse and jumped on. With a quick tug, she had the horse running through the village. As she reached the outskirts, she saw a sign pointing in the direction of her kingdom. She kicked the horse in the side and it began galloping down the road. <br>\r\nArianne was completely alone as she traveled. It made sense, as it was dark out. It gave her time to herself and her thoughts. She wondered what happened to her guards and where the druid was now. She also felt a twinge of guilt for stealing from people who had been so kind to her. As the thought entered her mind, she suddenly felt embarrassed. She was traveling with a stuffed bra now. She had normally considered such actions as beneath her, but there she was, doing it. <br>\r\nBefore long, the light of her castle came into vision. <br>\r\nShe slowed the horse to a stop just outside and climbed off. As she did, the horse turned and galloped away. She silently hoped that it would find its way back home. She turned and started for the gate now. As soon as Arianne appeared in the light, the guards exchanged glances. One turned and back into the castle. Within seconds, her mother returned with him, tears running down her cheeks. <br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" she asked. \"The guards said you disappeared when that druid appeared.\" <br>\r\n\"I did,\" Arianne said. She explained how she had been lost in the forest, but left out her nudity and breast deflation. When she was done, her mother looked her over. <br>\r\n\"You are filthy,\" she said. \"Come along now. I'll have the servants wash you.\" <br>\r\n\"I'm capable of washing myself, mother,\" Arianne said quickly. She didn't want anyone to know about her flat chest. Not now. <br>\r\nHer mother...</span></div></div>",

Once she was in, sure that the door was locked, she started up the water. Hot water poured into a massive pool. Commoner's would have been surprised that such a thing was called a bath tub, but for Arianne, it was the standard. When the tub was full of hot water, she stripped of her clothes, careful to conceal all the panties she had stolen, and dipped in. <br>\r\nThe whole time, she couldn't help but think of Susan. She wondered what Susan would have said if she could be here. She wondered what Susan looked like naked. With her breasts exposed and billowing. Slowly, she slid her hand between her legs and began rubbing herself. She had never done something so indecent before, but a lot of things had happened that had no precedent. <br>\r\nJust as she was beginning to feel settled, a voice said, \"Yeah, it's been pretty boring without you, sis.\" <br>\r\nArianne jerked up. She pulled her hand out, not wanting to be caught performing such a disgraceful activity, and looked up behind her. There was her tomboyish sister, Sharon, standing above her, completely naked, hands on her hips. She gave Arianne a cocky grin. Arianne lowered herself, praying that Sharon hadn't noticed her breasts. <br>\r\n\"I locked the door,\" she whispered. <br>\r\n\"And I picked it,\" Sharon said, lowering herself into the tub. She walked up to Arianne and Arianne pulled away. <br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Sharon asked, confused. <br>\r\n\"I'm naked.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, so am I. We're always naked in here. And you love to flaunt your breasts. Did something happen out there?\" <br>\r\nArianne didn't say anything. <br>\r\n\"Alright, how about a hug, then?\" <br>\r\nArianne's heart skipped a beat. <br>\r\n\"What are you-?\" <br>\r\nBefore she could finish, Sharon lunged at her, hugging her tightly from behind. Sharon's hands began groping the water in front of Arianne before resting on her chest. There was silence for a few seconds. <br>\r\n\"Arianne?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n\"Are you flat?\" <br>\r\nArianne didn't answer at first. This was the last thing she wanted to happen. And with the last person she wanted it to happen with, no less. <br>\r\nReluctantly, she said, \"Yes.\" <br>\r\n\"What happened?\" <br>\r\nArianne sighed and began telling the story. <br>\r\nWhen she finished, Sharon...</span></div></div>",

Arianne was tempted to reject it, but she couldn't keep walking around naked. Reluctantly, she stood up ad tugged it on. She chest of the dress stretched out a bit from her own, emphasizing the fact that the previous owner had a larger bust. Arianne pushed it against her own chest without comment. <br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that we don't have any bras of your size, Princess Arianne,\" Susan's mother finished. <br>\r\nArianne's face heated up again. <br>\r\n\"But-\" she began, but Susan's mother cut her off. <br>\r\n\"No need to say anything,\" she said. \"I understand exactly what's going on.\" <br>\r\n\"You...\" Arianne swallowed. \"You do?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes.

She quickly looked to the branch with her dress and released a sigh of relief as she saw it was still there. <br>\r\n\"Well, looks like I'm gonna have to go commando,\" she said to herself. She was giddy with excitement as she said it. Arianne always fussed about being proper, and that included wearing underwear. Well now she wasn't. <br>\r\nShe pulled herself out of the water to air dry. After a few minutes, when she seemed dry enough, she tugged the dress back on. Immediately, she felt the difference. She felt as the cloth rubbed up against her breasts. It was so exhilarating. <br>\r\nThe only feeling that rivaled it was the breeze that flew between her legs. She felt like was walking around without pants. She did a quick spin, allowing the dress to fly up and more wind to fly through her lower half. This was so fun! <br>\r\nShe fell on her back and giggled to herself. She was going to love the walk back. She was going to have to thank whoever stole her underwear. <br>\r\nAfter a few minutes lying there, she pulled herself to her feet. She really needed to get going now. Shaking her head to air dry her hair, she started off back to the castle again. <br>\r\nAs she walked, she enjoyed every minute of going commando. Was this how the guard felt? Did they have underwear? She made a note to check as she climbed over a log. Before she knew it, she was back home. She felt warm between her legs.

If anything happened, they'd all see her naked!  She had always made a habit of streaking, but she never liked being caught. It was always too embarrassing. <br>\r\n\"M-mother...\" she stammered. <br>\r\n\"Not now,\" Queen Melody said, running a hand through her hair. \"This is filthy.

I am this party's <u>Archer</u> and scout, I can shoot the wings off a fly at a hundred paces, and I enjoy a good wine with every meal!\"  He punctuated this by pulling out a wine flask and cups, pouring everyone a glass before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Redhead with the swirling blue tattoos stood up next, \"I am Gwynned, the <u>Ranger</u> of the party, I hail from the highland tribes of the west, and am on my spirit journey to discover the meaning of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc woman stood up, \"I am Jogoshib, the <u>Warrior</u> of this fair band of companions and adventurers, and I have sworn vengeance upon the Blackspine peak Goblins for destroying my tribes homeland.  I travel to grow strong enough to help my people reclaim our homes.\"  Sitting down, the three all looked at her, and Sharon stood up, not quite yet used to others seeing her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Sharon, I ran away from home because there was nothing there I wanted to live out the rest of my life doing.  I may go back home in a few years, but I wish to see the world and its inhabitants, and if you all are my companions for this new life,\" she raised her wine glass up in a toast, \"then by Jorila's thundering, it shall be a great journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im glad to make your acquaintance Sharon, but praytell, what role do you wish to fill in our merry band?\"  Luth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon thought about it, she wasn't skilled as a fighter, sure she knew a few sword moves, but they were mere tricks to what she'd seen at tournaments.  Perhaps a spellcaster?  Considering that they were called the Band of Nature's Own, perhaps she could be a Druid?  She already had a staff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <u>Druid</u>.\"  Sharon said calmly, \"Its clear that you have a full compliment of melee and ranged attack, and you said you need a spellcaster, so I will be the Druid.\"  As she said this, a faint blue glow slowly eminated from her staff, and swirling designs etched themselves into it, concluding with a blue oak leaf mark forming on the top of her right hand, and a blue Yggdrasil mark appear on her right butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJogoshib started laughing, \"I knew Druid marks were random,\" she laughed as she pointed at Sharon's behind, \"but I think you got the short end of the staff!\"  She continued to laugh until Gwynned nudged her in the side, getting her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Sharon on becoming an adventurer, but come, let us sleep and then resume our journey on the morrow.\"  Gwynned said, taking first watch as the other three bundled up in their bed rolls.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the party walked through the woods, Sharon was talking with Gwynned about their quest to stop the nexormancer and his evil machinations.  \"Alright,\" Sharon began, \"so this necormancer, Xun, has been raising graveyards of bodies and overrunning castles and nearby towns and cities, and just you three were sent to stop him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwynned shook her head, \"No, we are but one party en route to slay the necromancer, the prize of this quest is not only the gold, but the tower and surrounding lands.  If we have a proper base, then our band can recruit as many as we wish, not being limited to six members.\"  Gwynned looked around them, making sure that they were still safe, as Luth tended to get a bit too far ahead, before continuing to talk to Sharon.  \"Once we have the tower, our band will be akin to a knightly order, or school of wizardry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\"  Sharon said, surprised at how much she didn't know about the world, apparently adventurers took other forms of payment aside from gold.  She knew there were kind, generous ones who'd take small payment or refuse payment, like paladins, but to hear of the restrictions placed on adventurer guilds was new and interesting for her to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high pitched call sounded ahead of them, Jogoshib drew her axes and Gwynned readied her spear, \"C'mon Sharon!  Luth needs our aid!\"  Gwynned called out as she ran forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon gripped her staff tightly in both hands and ran after her companions, nervous about what she'd encounter up ahead.  After cresting the small hill, Sharon saw a skirmish between her companions and undead, some zombies and skeletons.  She stood still in fear until she heard Jogoshib cry out in pain from a cut on her thigh, snapping Sharon out of her fear induced paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her staff forward, she willed nature to act, and roots tore through the ground, grabbing the skeleton that'd harmed Jogoshib, pulling them to the ground, snapping their bones as the roots pulled them through the earth.  Her adrenaline flowing, Sharon repeated the gesture at a pack of zombies approaching the fight, watching as the vines dangling from the trees wrapped themselves around the zombies, absorbing the dark magic from them until they were empty corpses once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon was about to cast another spell when she was tackled by a skeleton, rolling back down the hill away from the battle, Sharon was dazed until she saw the skull mere inches from her face.  Then she started screaming.  She reached around for her staff, but she'd let go of it on the tumble downhill, watching as the Skelton raised a dagger in its hand, she tried to fight it off with her legs, and holding the arms back with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost on the verge of crying when she heard an eagle cry and the skeleton was thrown off her body.  Looking up, she saw a brown eagle flying above her, deciding not to question it, she reached her hands out and willed the roots to move, but nothing happened, looking around nervously, she spied her staff on the hillside, and scrambled as fast as she could up the hill.  Hearing the clanking and grinding of the Skelton behind her only made her climb faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had her staff in hand, she pointed it at the skeleton and the roots burst from the earth, ensnaring the undead abomination and slowly pulling it back into the dirt, the bones snapping from the strength of the roots wrapped around them.  Climbing back up to the top of the hill, she saw Luth bandaging Jogoshib's thigh, and Gwynned gathering whatever could be used for their journey off the undead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJogoshib looked up at Sharon as she descended to check on them and help with the looting of the dead undead, \"You have been blooded in this battle.  <i>Now</i>, you are an adventurer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon smiled and nodded, helping Gwynned with the looting.  Gwynned found a useful bandolier to hold her shortspear and buckler, while Sharon found a belt with several bags of leaves and herbs.  Apparently this undead had been a healer, and druids served as party healers as well, so she took the belt as well as a green scarf from a skeleton, wrapping it around her neck, the two ends draping off her back like tiny capes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next stop my companions,\" Luth said while posing dramatically, pointing at the ominous tower that stood above a burnt out village which had several visible parties already fighting against the undead, \"the necromancers tower.\"</span></div></div>",

Sharon was on edge the entire trek, she'd never seen so much violence or death...and undeath.  Another novelty for her was the amount of time she was spending naked, before joining this band on their adventures, the only times she'd been naked was whenever she had to bathe.  Now she was scouting around a battlefield naked, with only a scarf and belt on her person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*snap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twig snap sent the party into high alert,  and from the rustling bushes came out not undead or bandits, but Paladins of Textilia (goddess of progress), the enemy goddess of Naturisme (goddess of nature).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barbarians!\" The lead paladin cried out, her companions falling into formation beside her, shields lowered and swords at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Sharon yelled out, ignoring how her breasts bounced around when she raised her arm to get their attention.  \"We are the Band of Nature's Own, we too seek the end of the necromancer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladins looked amongst themselves, debating whether or not to believe them, while Sharon's companions drew their weapons, but did not get into battle formation.  Trusting their newest member to resolve this issue peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the lead Paladin sighed, the others sheathing their swords.  \"Then since we have a common goal, let's not interfere with the other, and let the gods determine who shall receive the tower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuth nodded, \"Very well.  Fair thee well on this battlefield fellow adventurers.\"  The paladins ignored him and walked off,  continuing their journey without the naked heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon was a little lost, not quite getting what was with all the suspicious glances where the paladins disappeared through the brush.  \"Are you rivals with them?\"  Sharon asked, \"I mean we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJogoshib sighed, running her fingers through her mane of dreadlocks, \"It's more theological than simple competition.  Worshippers and followers of Textilia believe that the body and nature must be hidden and controlled, where Naturisme says that the body and nature must be free so do as they please.\"  She laughed bitterly.  \"You can say we were made to be enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon nodded, and the four continued on their way, double checking to ensure that they weren't followed by the paladins, eventually they came up on a cowpen.  Looking around, Sharon couldn't see any clear way around it, and that mean the only way to continue was to go over almost ten acres of clear, open fields.  \"Gwynned,\" Luth asked, looking back, \"do you see any tracks in the fields?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwynned inched forward, Sharon tried to ignore how her breasts swayed and her butt jiggled with each step, and looked around the field.  \"I see no tracks, but we best make our run quickly, lest we run into hidden scouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group nodded and Sharon gripped her staff as tight as possible, before sprinting across the field with all her might, trying to keep up with her more seasoned companions.  Living the life of a princess wasn't physically demanding, and she was a bit soft compared to Gwynned or Jogoshib...especially Jogoshib, that she-orc was built like a solid wall of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce safely nestled on the other side in the bushes, they checked the surrounding areas, north would send them through a veritable maze of houses, but it would be quicker to the necromancers tower.  While west would take them through the open markets, more of a roundabout way to get to the tower, but reduced odds of an ambush.</span></div></div>",

To Sharon, this was eerie, just row upon row of empty houses, with only the background din of battle the only other noise aside from their footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJogoshib was taking point now instead of Luth since she'd be more likely to turn an ambush around if she was up front.  As they walked through the streets, they did spy a group of skeletons around a street corner, and Sharon stepped up to do her thing.  Willing nature to act, she watched as seaweed from the nearby river reached out and ensnared the skeletons, dragging them back down into the waters below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything went south from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom every building it seemed that the undead were pouring out, jogoshib and Gwynned were able to fend them off, giving breathing room to Luth and Sharon who needed it to perform their duties in the party.  Sharon was scared, she could see the amount of undead that they'd attracted the attention of, and there was no way that the four of them would be able to fend them off forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit there was a flash of silver at the back of the undead, something cutting its way through the zombies and skeletons, \"Luth!\" Sharon cried out, \"Who is there, at the back of this horde?\"  pointing to the sliver mess cutting its way through the rotted corpses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, luth recognized the silver, \"It's the paladins of Textilia!\" He called out, \"Jogo, Gwyn, work our way toward the east!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two melee fighters of their party nodded, and began to carve a way through the mob of undead to the paladins.</span></div></div>",

I will allow such an alliance, but only to the completion of this quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuth nodded, smiling, \"I wouldn't have it any other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain didn't respond, and began barking out orders to her paladins, \"Begin the push!

It was slow going, but Sharon eventually found a rhythm to the battle, cast spell, breathe, new target, repeat.  So long as the rhythm remained constant, she was sure that she'd be able to keep this up for a time, as spell casting wasn't physically draining, or if it was, she hadn't hit her limit just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grind was slow, but eventually they succeeded at pushing their way through the streets block by bloody block, until they got to the base of the necromancers tower.  While the paladins rested up and after Sharon had cast healing spells or made healing salve, whichever was required, Sharon looked up at the imposing structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tower of obsidian black, devoid of any marks on its sides, nor any patterns carved into its surface, the tower stood as a massive blot on the countryside.  Sharon began to feel anger a time the necromancer for creating such a thing, and wished to tear it down and allow many trees to replace it, and the village around it.  \"Where did that's come from?\"  Sharon asked herself, sure the tower needed to be dealt with, but the villagers did nothing wrong.  \"Maybe it's just the stress from the whole ordeal getting to me.\"  Sharon decided, fiddling with her scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the larger party was assembled and ready to enter the tower, Luth and the captain stood in front of the party and spoke to them.  \"As part of the prize for this quest was the tower itself, and only one party can truly succeed the quest,\" the captain began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we have decided that the party who's member lands the killing blow on the necromancer shall be the victorious party.\" Luth concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded, showing their consent and readiness to compete in a potentially lethal final duel.

Running up to her, Sharon saw that she was fine, if a bit dazed and disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\"  She asked as she rubbed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon looked around, shrugging, \"I don't know.

Sighing, she began to inch her way between the jelly and the wall, watching as her breastplate slowly dissolved, her under shirt and bra following suit.

Her cape had somehow survived, though it was now far to narrow to wrap around herself, and as for her armor, her pauldrons and full arm armor had survived, her upper torso section of armor had also (somewhat), survived, but now it wasn't nothing but a triangle that did nothing to hide either breast, and her leg armor from the knees down was all that remained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://raikou1.donmai.us/3a/1b/__knight_final_fantasy_tactics_and_etc_drawn_by_hiru_okita__3a1bbcd07629f2c043423d89b038c352.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://raikou1.donmai.us/3a/1b/__knight...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope we find more armor elsewhere,\" Ashley grumbled, glad that at least her sword was still usable, \"otherwise my captains going to kill me for this happening again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, again?\"  Sharon asked, but didn't get an answer, and she hurried to catch up to Ashley, not wanting to be left alone.

Meldona blinked, blinded by  the  bright sunlight. Unseeing she was dragged farther. Then she felt cold heavy steel clink around her wrists. She looked through the spots that danced in her vision. Her arms were in manacles! Each was chained, pulling her arms wide apart. Then, two more natives grasped her ankles and pulled them wide.Her ankles were chained as well, forcing her to stand wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeldona looked around. They were on the top of the pyramid, a large flat area. Thousands of natives were gathered, all chanting. she was above them all on a raised platform.

She pulled on the chains, wishing she could cover her pale, skinny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked nothing like the woman who'd entered the tunnel. The wise, robbed mage was gone. Instead it was a bikini clad woman, pale and skinny, surrounded by bronze and muscular people. Her black hair was a messy birds next around her head. Her cheeks were bright red from excretion and embarrassment. Her knees shook as the people looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeldona could guess what this was.

Everything seemed to be going smoothly until the unexpected murder. So, Daeril found herself, an Elf woman in her youth, traveling via carriage towards a kingdom of humans. The human King of Strippembare was growing old, but he was not without reason or wisdom.

Would you extend me the courtesy of doing the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaeril whimpered as she looked at the woman's face. She didn't see a trace of ill intent, but knew she was up to something. Of course, if she did want to kill her, she would have by now. Reluctantly, Daeril lowered her hands and lowered her eyes in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, milady. Now just stand still for a few moments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman began reciting an incantation, and Daeril suddenly felt a force around her. She tried to move, but was unable to. As the woman continued to chant, Daeril couldn't help but think of the precarious position she was in. She was a noble elf, standing stark naked in front of a naked human woman. If anyone happened upon them, her reputation would be ruined, not to mention the gossip that would be involved. Sure, the elves that lived in the woods were hardly ever seen clothed, but a noble elf always hid her charms under heavy cloaks and underclothes. To not only be seen nude in public, but displaying herself before a human was unthinkable. A blush rushed to her cheeks as thoughts of what her kingdom would do to her if that happened. A heat pulsated around her body, which Daeril thought was due to her embarrassment, but she realized too late that the changeling was adopting a new persona!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the heat around her dissipated, she looked towards the woman, and couldn't believe her eyes. Standing before her was...HERSELF! An exact copy, her twin. From her hair to her toes, she looked exactly like her! Daeril was speechless as she saw her doppleganger walk towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. Now no one will be the wiser when I waltz into Strippembare as Ambassador Daeril and declare war upon their kingdom.\" the changeling spoke, uncannily in Daeril's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I get there first!\" Daeril shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. I've already thought of that. Perhaps you should look in the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the changeling produced a small mirror from a saddlebag on her horse and pointed it at Daeril's face. The elf noble recoiled in shock. Staring back at her was the face of the changeling before she assumed her identity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so disgusted, I happen to think it's a very pretty face. Of course, it is my own. I left your body untouched for the most part. No one has seen me without my clothes, so no one would be able to tell the difference.\" The changeling stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" Daeril spoke, clutching her throat as the alien voice of the changeling escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure your kingdom has plans for the supposed outlaw who stole from the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria McGavin. The one and only. Well, not exactly anymore. You're her now. I wonder how what the reward will be when my men deliver you to Nuderia. Naked, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch! You can't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can. Oh, almost forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria snatched the amulet from Daeril's neck and tied it around her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now I look the part. I'll just help myself to your luggage to change into something appropriate for an ambassador before meeting with the strippembare king. Don't worry, if your kingdom doesn't kill you, I'll come back and get you out. Granted that I've survived the trip as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she entered the carriage and signaled her men to snatch Daeril. Since she was still unable to move, she couldn't stop the men from hoisting her atop a horse and splayed cross the lap of the largest horseman. With a swift kick, the horse began trotting off towards Nuderia, where Daeril would be punished as Victoria McGavin while the real criminal was impersonating her and will soon incite a war between the two kingdoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started out this story and chose the Princess option, didn't you? So what's with this Prince Charmful guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatience, dear reader. All will be revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as I was saying, our story begins with young Prince Charmful, riding out of the castle on his eighteenth birthday, to prove himself to his mother the Queen Dowager, his eight half-brothers, including King Fullofhimself, and to the people of the Kingdom of Wayouthere, one of those minor kingdoms in Nuderia that was on the edge of things, and that no one really bothered with, not even the Orcs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're asking what kind of elven names are Charmful, FullofHimself, and Wayoutthere. Because you're pretty sure you picked Elven and Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFine, I'll get to the backstory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, the story actually starts about nineteen years ago, when King Oldfart took a second wife, Lady Trophybride (Now Queen Trophybride). The old king was able to keep up with his young queen thanks to some special magic blue pills provided by the court magician. Still, the queen liked her dalliances. Including a dalliance with the Elven ambassador to the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive months into her pregnancy, the Queen became a widow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Charmful was born, the muted point to Charmful's ear let you know that there had been a dalliance between the Queen and the Elven ambassador.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, at this point, only the Queen and her midwife (a most trusted servant) knew that Charmful wasn't fully human, but a half-elf. And the midwife was mute, a loyal servant, and would die of natural causes within a month anyway. So no one who knew anything was going to say anything. Which was a good thing. Because right now, the Queen would be regent of the kingdom until the king's oldest son from his first wife turned twenty-five. And even when was no longer Regent, she would still be a Dowager, and highly respected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless it was discovered that her baby wasn't the old king's at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo a minor spell, and the points of the ears were permanently hid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why hide the fact that Charmful was a baby girl instead of a baby boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, oh yeah, Charmful was a princess. Okay, okay, a <b>half</b>-elven princess, but it still fits your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as to why Queen Trophywife decided to hide the fact that her daughter was a girl, that gets a little complicated. The young queen had no one to talk to when her daughter was born except her mute midwife. So all Trophywife could do was bounce ideas off the midwife, without any real feedback. And the young Queen got it in her head that if she didn't provide the kingdom a prince, instead of a princess, her own position would be at risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy Trophywife got this in her head...well, there's no telling. After all, if Charmful had been born a prince, he would be ninth in line. At least. There was some question about where some of his royal cousins stood in the line of succession, since Queen Trophywife had been the second wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question was moot. It would have taken a John Goodman movie for Charmful to even be considered as a successor to the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding the fact that Charmful was a girl took a little more work than hiding her ears. And since both her parents were attractive, Charmful was destined to grow up to be a beautiful woman. And, at age fourteen, thanks to her mother's genetic contribution, Charmful would learn that she was destined to grow up to be a beautiful bosomy woman. However, some magic, training Charmful never to undress in front of anyone ever, and the fact that Charmful was very physically active, always showing up at family meals with a dirty face, helped disguise the fact that Charmful wasn't a slightly androgynous prince, but a very beautiful princess. And Prince(ss) Charmful wasn't expected to show up at royal functions. His oldest stepbrother, King FullofHimself, was so focused on himself, he really didn't care which of his family members showed up at anything, as long as everyone was paying attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo our story begins with Prince Charmful (actually Princess Charmful) riding out on a horse on her eighteenth birthday, her thick, dark hair recently cut with the use of a bowl. She was wearing a helmet and chainmail, with magic and a chest wrap concealing the pointedness of her ears and the fullness of her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two days of her journey were fairly boring and tedious. However, on the third day of her journey, at the edge of her half-brother's kingdom, Charmful would encounter</span></div></div>",

Big, dominant both in battle and the bedroom, and bare, the little leather that covers her skin is there to secure her massive axe and any gold she may acquire. Those who think to cross her beware; she's not likely to let infractions slide, and men and women of all races have found themselves bared and beaten under her full frontal assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagni is another Orc woman, also very big, very strong, and very prone to nudity. Unlike Kalka, she restrains herself enough to cover her more private parts. Not out of any sense of modesty, but for the sake of her traveling companions. The dwarven cleric, in her stuffy robes, demanded it out of modesty. The elven rogue was fine if Ragni wanted to go uncovered, but had to admit that she'd rather Ragni  have some sort of protection against damage. And the scrawny human mage; he'd never confront Ragni over it, but she noticed how long it took him to cast spells while standing behind her when said behind was bare. No, she'd grown attached to her ragtag group, and if it kept them from falling apart in battle, she'd put in at least a bit of effort to cover herself. Not that they didn't still have clashes over this cultural difference...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNara, by comparison, keeps herself covered to a human standard of modesty. A runt by Orc standards, the nonetheless large woman would rather stay in her leather armor than run around in a loincloth, or less. Still, what she lacked in brute strength and size, she made up for in ingenuity and tactical knowledge. A big, green fish out of water among both Orcs and Humans, she was quite protective of her modesty.</span></div></div>",

Whether named so for the extreme heat that would set any bush alight or for some other purpose, it is unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe social ranks of the Orcs are based on prowess outside of the immediate royal bloodline, which must be descended from the first champion of the Orcs, but all other nobility is is earned in battle prowess. Unlike other civilizations, the inspiring tale of the peasant to general isn't so strange, it's actually common; if you're strong enough, you might even challenge the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome basics on Orcish society is it is well male dominated, but there are protections for the female sort as well. Women of the Orcs are powerful, able to fell many of the mightiest humans, but even their strength pales in comparison to their male counterparts with arms thick as tree trunks. The structure usually goes that the man runs the household, and the politics thereof, and to show subserviance to their husbands, the wife is to remain nude and be \"marked\", a laceration across the lower back similar to what might call the stamp of a whore, but fear not as it is a sign of respect. Males must win wives, strip them of their cloth, and then be able to force his name onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the story of Gramia, an Orcess challenged countless times for her breeding, and has never lost so much as a scrap of cloth. She is a powerful general, one many would like to over power to claim as theirs, but until that day, and even after (albeit remaining nude), she is widely respected. Her attributes are a full head of hair, crimson as the blood she's drawn from countless foes and suitors, a dark skin blazoned by the sun that despite it's battletested state, has an unnatural smoothness to it. She lumbers over most female Orcs, similar in height to the males, large breasts, even for the legendary mammaries of the Orcs. Underneath is a mystery, as I've stated before, none have seen her disrobed but from the way her tunic, emblazoned with countless symbols marking her bravery. The top it all off, she's quite young, only the age of 26 and having bested Great Warlords several decades more experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the fair Orc's quest in this land?</span></div></div>",

The sharp wind cut straight at Sardth, who turned in shock, just as she was blasted by wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadth gasped as a strong updraft blasted against her. To her shock and utter horror her clothes, including tunic, were blown straight up!  This revealed her tail and a lot, lot more. Due to the fact that all Demon Blood had tails, they couldn't wear conventional undergarments. Since Sandrth was wearing human clothes she hadn't been able to find any bloomers which fit comfortably over her tail. So, she had decided not to wear any, assuming no one would ever know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell now, not only did everyone now see her tail, they also could see her narrow, pale white butt, hips and crotch! Sandrth struggled to pull her tunic down, wind pushing it up around her chest. She looked in utter horror at her exposed crotch, white bony hips leading down to a thick mound of jet black hair. Blushing mightily (her embarrassment was even more embarrassing because it was considered weak for a Demon Blood to show shame) She finally managed to pull the front of her skirt down, though everything else was exposed. Her tail, her white butt. Her leggings stopped mid thigh, above that nothing but flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd pointed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Celestial was right!\" An old man yelled. \"She got a tail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of those cursed demon lovers!\" A crone yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at her butt!\" A little boy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd started circling around Sandrth, yelling, on the verge of a riot. The Celestial was coming, sword drawn. She felt panic building up in her. What could she do? As a Demon Born she possessed powerful dark magic, but she was no fighter.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As was said above, there are different types of faeries, each more marvelous than the next. Or, at least, that's how they view themselves anyway. So we have four fairy lasses whose story we can follow:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Danish Blossom</u>: Danish Blossom's people might have been one of those that Shakespeare had written about in his Midsummer play. Normally, they go about at six inches tall, though they can assume human size when they wish. They like to play small tricks from time to time on human folk, but mostly they like the Big People, as they call humans. They're very magical, but it is possible to capture one of Danish Blossom's people, if you make the right preparations and keep your wits about you. But get just one thing wrong, and you will soon seriously regret having made the attempt. It's better to appeal to their appetites for sweets and their vanity, if you want them to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a number of ways, the faerie people to whom Danish Blossom belonged to mirrored that of human society. And, except for their gossamer wings (which they could make appear and disappear at will) and the fact they stood only six inches high, they very much resembled human beings, save they were more lovely to gaze upon. Their society has peasants to grow things, artisans to build things, traders to trade things, and nobles to rule things. All of them clothed themselves, though what they clothed themselves in depended on where they stood in society. Peasants, for instance, clothed themselves in plant parts, though they might use actual cloth for special occasions. Nobles, on the other hand, always wore at least cloth, regardless of the menial task at hand. And as far as special occasions were concerned, they wore clothes magically woven from rainbows and moonbeams and dewdrops and other such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanish herself is from a minor noble family, that had recently elevated themselves up from the traders' class. So it was a point of honor with them that their daughter never wore anything but cloth, and that her dresses were the most glamorous at any ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as a warning to the reader, if you were to capture one of Danish's people, it would be best to make it one of the nobles. As a point of honor, a nobleman or noblewoman who found themselves caught will try to get out of it by themselves. But if you were to capture a poor peasant fairy lass, you'd have her whole clan to contend with. Or as the saying goes, a fairy in the hand means ten in the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Yelp</u> -- although human mages who conduct the taxonomy of magical creatures would classify Yelp's people as fairies, her own kind would fight to <i><b>your</b></i> death against being classified as such. For one thing, Yelp's people aren't bright and light. They're not dark, by any means. They're just sort of...not dirty, but earthy. Yelp dresses like most of her kind with a brown tunic, brown pants, brown boots, brown socks, brown cap...you're getting the picture, I trust? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelp stands about six inches tall, has no wings, can't fly, but can jump in such a way that you think she's flying. She has brown hair, brown eyes and light olive skin. She can talk to animals and convince most of them to do her bidding, save foxes or cats. Foxes have learned a long time ago,  however, not to cross Yelp and her kind, and give them a wide berth. Cats usually do as well, though once in a while they try to see if they can get the upper hand. They never do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelp's people can appear and disappear at will, and have other tricks. For the most part, they like people, but mostly if they can watch them from afar. They do love butter, though, and a good butter cookie with a little milk is heaven on earth to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Diagalilly</u> --  Diagalilly's people are six inches tall and have skins that come in many colors, from those seen on the skins of other beings, to bright oranges, deep blues and such. Their hair and wings (which appear as butterfly wings, and which they can make appear and disappear at will) are always colors that complement their skin color. They are curious about humans, but only from a distance. Very little is known about them or their 'powers', as it has been discovered to be very dangerous indeed to try to capture one. The great mage Doratimus once recorded four hundred years ago that when his colleague Jusexumus managed to capture one of Diagalilly's people, \"It was as if the whole world moved as one and turned against him. He found himself assaulted by both the natural world and the magical one until, out of desperation, he released the captured fairy and begged forgiveness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u> Hera Dawnfollower</u> -- Scholars debate whether it is proper to classify Hera's people as fairies or not. Although they stand six inches tall and have wings (which they can make appear and disappear at will), their wings resemble those of birds, rather than insects.. Indeed, Hera's people are not thought to have very many innate powers, like most fairies do. They are, however, considered more clever than the gnomes. Much more clever. Hera's people are known to come from beyond Nuderia, though where exactly they come from, and how they travel to Nuderia, no one exactly knows. In some ways it's easier to capture one of Hera's people than other fairies. If you do, however, you should know, that as far as Hera's people are concerned, there are no rules in recapturing one of their own. And make no mistake, Hera's people are deadly. They are fast and nimble and carry rapiers on their belt that, for all their small size, wield strange powers and are thus quite deadly. In addition, they carry other objects on their belt and about their person which most would prefer never to have demonstrated on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHera's people have been traveling to and from Nuderia for at least three hundred years now, and have established enclaves in a handful of coastal cities. They are renowned for the jewelry they offer, though here is the thing. They rarely, if ever, want to trade for material objects. They might pass up a trade for several bars of gold, for instance, but accept a painting. But they especially like a good song or story. A song they find praiseworthy might be reward with a human sized ruby ring, for instance, that is so finally crafted it would be worth to embrace a queen's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger who thinks about abducting a member of Hera's race should remember that the cities in which their enclaves exist will not appreciate someone trying to steal the goose that lays the golden egg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as dress is concerned, the men and women of Hera's people dress alike. Sturdy trousers and jackets made of some unknown material, shirts of a single bright color, sturdy boots, and a belt with the previously mentioned rapier and other objects on it. Objects that only respond to the touch of one of Hera's people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which six inch lass shall we follow? </span></div></div>",

This is false.  There are in fact three 'main' culture groups that a dwarf will belong to, depending on the region.  Female dwarves do, in fact have beards, just not on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first are the <b>Ironbeards</b>, wearing scale-mail and plate armor, these dwarves are fond of Warhammers and sturdy fortresses.  They never forgive a grudge unless they have repaid it seven times over, or if the offending party agrees to right the wrong, and then serve the dwarf for as long as they see fit.  But if you should gain their loyalty, there is no better ally to have.  They are in constant odds with the elves, believing that the body is something that only should be shared between spouses, and even then, with at least three remaining undergarments on both parties for modesties sake.  They are most often found along mountain passses and rivers, their massive fortresses evident on the rock face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, the <b>Firebrands</b>, with bright orange and red hair, favoring the axe as their weapon, they use magic gold to carve runes into their skin, allowing them to forgo conventional armor and go fairly undressed.  Usually all they will wear is their beard.  Unlike the Ironbeards, the Firebrands shave their heads into massive Mohawks, rather than elaborate braids.  The thickness and color of the beard is the pride of any good Firebrand, and damaging it is seen as a great shame.  They are most often found around volcanoes, their magma being rich in metals already liquidated for forging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the <b>Coldstone</b>, who are only found atop the coldest peaks, these dwarves are dark skinned, unlike their cousins, and rarely come down from their mountain homes.  Aside from the fact that none of them have beards, nor has a male been seen, few if any know anything about their culture...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich are you from?</span></div></div>",

In terms of clothing, they either wear nothing, or very little, their fur providing most protection that they need, otherwise they put on loincloths when dealing with outsiders if they demand it.

Before the new gods ruled, and nature wasn't a malevolent and destructive force keeping the races in check.  Fire and stone-knapping are the most advanced technologies amongst them, for nature provides for them all they'd require and more.  Their eyes can see in the dark, they have empathy with animals, not quite talking to them, but not quite controlling them either, more agile, stronger and faster than their human kin too.  They wear nothing but anklets, necklaces, bracelets, and occasionally body paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Teliqonae</b> are the gangsters of the world, skink-people out by the forests and coasts, they deal with the traders and serve as interpreters and negotiators for various parties and companies.  They are merchants and businessesmen at heart, willing to trade anything to come out on top.  One notable example is when a clan leader traded his daughter to secure a new trade deal within the human demesne.  They don't wear clothing so much as decorations and fancy scarfs and wraps across their body, and don't have a concept of indecency.  They often have their servants, regardless of race, dress in the same way or wear even less to retain control over them through embarrassment.</span></div></div>",

True, they are much large than the other species, standing over eight feet tall, with both genders being naturally muscled, and they are green skinned with a pair of viscous lower fangs...aside from that Orcs are quite appealing and very well endowed. Male Orcs have members that large and thick (anybody under ten inches is considered small), and female orcs have massive breasts that, while odd still remained proportionate to their muscles bodies. Because of this Orcs are known for ferocious sexual appetites, and also tend to toss modesty aside as they believe anyone who willing covers up their sexual gifts to be shameful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Elves</b> of Nuderia are beautiful, perfect being who occupy the vast forests of the land. Always at one with nature, lower-ranking elves tend to go about naked simply because modesty is something they do not believe in. Higher ranking elves however are taught to wear majestic clothes designed to cover their bodies to the fullest and for an elven noble to shed them in public it is considered improper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other</b> races also exist, but I'll let you decide who those are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules</b><br>\r\nNo vore, scat, diapering, anal, BDSM, or other extreme fetishes. Sex is allowed but keep it to the 18+ rating, the same goes for mastrubation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reserve the right to delete chapters as I see fit.</td>",
