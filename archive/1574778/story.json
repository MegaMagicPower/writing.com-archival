After the old toad shot a look at the perpertrator who knocked him, he looked at the bottle and was shocked to see the whole bottle's contents were in the meal. The concerned toad was about to say something but the princess looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong Toadsworth?\" asked Princess Peach in concern. The moustached toad was about to say something but he dropped it. It was for the princess' own good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing your highness, just that you look very beautiful today.\" he said. The princess beamed at his complement and kissed her caretaker on the head and began eatting her mushroom enhanced meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tastebuds exploded as she tasted the deliciousness of the professional toad's cooking and the mushroom powder. At first, she tried not to scarf down her meal but Toadsworth noticed that she was scarfing stuffed down her meal faster than usual, and was eagerly wanting more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's tastier than usual!\" she giggled, licking the few crumbs off her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert, princess?\" asked Toadsworth. The princess thought about it but shook her head which worried the old toad slightly. Usually the powder kicked in straight away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... I need to get seconds... you know... just to show the people that I don't hate these banquets.\" said the princess trying to disguise the starving feeling she was getting.

Last night was fantastic, she may have eaten more then she would have cared to admit, but the food was great and the people there were lovely. Feeling slow and sluggish the princess forced herself out of bed and gasped in surprise as her large pink bed made an unusually loud creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I must have eaten a bit too much ice cream.\" Peach said, her mouth threatening to water at the memory of the triple chocolate ice cream that Toadsworth continuously served her. The woman made her way towards her bathroom to have her usual morning shower. However, when she saw her form in front of the computer, her jaw dropped in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largest part of her was her royal rear end copping most of the damage from last night's binge and the enormous amounts of mushroom powder she had consumed. Her bum inflated to a massive size, flab from her excess confectionary and dairy intake showing on her fleshy cheeks making her underwear look like a g-string. Her butt was so big that it came halfway down her thighs and didn't even fit into the range of the mirror. Her hips widened as well, Peach not able to see ends of it in the mirror. She gave her ass a small slap and for a full twenty seconds, her body jiggled, making her moan in a mix of pleasure and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me this is a bad dream.\" Peach squeaked as she kept examining her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs were so much softer and larger, to the point where they were squished to each other without the blonde putting her legs together. Peach tried doing the splits she was so proud of doing through the Olympic games but found that she couldn't with out causing a serious strain to her muscles, already weak and unaccustomed to her new fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Peach's waist wasn't plump, it was enormous. Peach didn't realise that during the night her new love handles and her gigantic excercise ball- sized belly had ripped her night gown up so much that it looked like she was an escaped prisoner. Peach grabbed her sides and placed her fat sausage fingers through the various folds and gave them a hard shake up and down, to feel if they were real. It did hurt and her belly did vibrate. Finally, her tired legs gave in and Peach fell to her cushioning butt. She gave a cry of surprise as she rolled, near naked on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess sat their for a while to regain her energy before she forced herself up onto her knees by using her fat, lard filled arms. Her arms looked like her legs and they made her sleeves pop. They were weak as well, but not weak enough to not give Peach the leverage to try look down at herself. However, she couldn't see much as she couldn't see her thighs for herself, just a bit of her belly and her breasts that must have grown at least three cup sizes. Unable to keep her position, the woman fell over and had her face planted right in front of the skinny mirror, givng her a close up of her face. Her face was fattened up to the point where a new double chin was present. Peach frowned and exhaustedly lifted a heavy arm to stroke it, showing that she could feel a third chin. Her cheeks had puffed up like clouds making her look like a flabby chimpmunk. Now that she was fully awake, Peach found that a bit of her vision was restricted by her face fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\" Peach cried as she sat there in front of the mirror, forced to stare at her massive figure \"How... when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door was heard. Peach tried to yell out to tell them to not come in but it was to late. Someone was walking in. It was...</span></div></div>",

Polari assembled all the lumas of the Comet Observatory and began to scold them for fattening up Rosalina and began rambling on the importance of her health and fitness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the lumas didn't listen as they were only concerned about their mamma's happiness and as long as she was happy, everything would be alright to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rosalina rummaged through her drawers and pulled out her blue biker's outfit. The smaller version that she was too wear when she had lost weight. Still feeling full and cheery from breakfast, the woman of the stars decided to try it on for old times sake. After a tenacious struggle, she got her nighty off. Standing in her white underwear, Rosalina's plump derriere tested the limits of her panties. They were swallowed in the mass depth of her bum crack, with most of each round cheek left exposed. It looked like a thong. She stepped into her blue biker's outfit and tried to tug it up over her thighs to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly lumas... putting my outfits in the drier.\" sighed Rosalina as she kicked the tight body suit off and tried to put on her standard blue dress. Her butt was so round, it took some effort to pack it into the dress. It hugged the rounded dimensions of each bum cheek, and stuck to her softened waistline like a second skin. With the royal dress not offering the same support as her nighty did, Rosalina's fat bum cheeks were free to wobble and bounce with every movement. Her tummy jiggled too as it buldged foreward forcing the dress to ride up from it's low length. Her breasts also allowed this rise of the dress too and as a result the previously long dress now failed to cover her thighs and came up to a skirt's length, and even still you could see her bottom poking out below. Her flabby arms felt the tightness of the pressing sleeves and the princess' fat neck cut into her collar forcing her to rip it. At the sound of the ripping neck, Rosalina looked up suddenly and her well-rounded rump twitched and rolled as she began walking to...</span></div></div>",

She was delighted to find that her lumas had stocked up on food for her when she had gone into her angsty little mood a few weeks ago and there was plenty of things to eat. First she had a little bit of the chocolate cake that was oozing with fattening goodness and before she knew it, it was gone into her mouth. All of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star princess burped, loudly. Her stomach was already big, round and bloated but now it sloashed when she tried to move the tiniest bit. But as her tummy grumbled, she realized she was still hungry. Starving in fact. Sitting her fat exposed ass in front of the fridge Rosalina made a grab for one doughnut. Or at least she thought it was a doughnut because by the time she realsied it, she had eaten a whole box of the jam filled pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, she burped in satisfaction. Looking further in the fridge, she saw it was covered in mouthwatering cakes.  As she drooled, she scooted closer,  soshe was able to reach the cakes and then proceeded to stuffing them down her throat, completely whole. Her belly grew, her dress became tighter. She felt like she should stop but she couldn\u2019t. Everything tasted so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore---gotta\u2014\u201c She gulped.  \u201cEat---more.\u201d Rosalina then spied an open box of doughnuts. The box was at least as wide as three hot tubs and it was filled with delicious doughnuts.  Rosalina was still on the cakes, so she ignored it for now. Her dress ripping at the seams. Rosalina knew that she should stop but all those days of eating nothing but what the lumas had given her had increased her stomach capacity tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChocolate---vanilla\u2014carrot\u2014strawberry shortcake!\u201d  She managed between bites.  \u201cAll---so\u2014good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last piece of cake, her dress was slowly coming apart, especially to her hefty chest and but area...  She was about to go to sleep when she saw the doughnuts. A grin appeared on her face as she grabbed the doughnuts, tore up the box and began to devour them.  Grabbing all she could, she stuffed at least ten into her mouth and managed to swallow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina continued to gorge, now in nothing but her bra and pants that were getting together and tighter.  Her mind said to stop but her body told her to keep on going.  Everything was so good! She wanted more!  Just one more doughnut became two more and then it spiraled out of control.

Pook,\" Peach muttered to herself once he left, \"Something odd about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Bowser's Castle, Wendy was in no rush to rehearse for her role. She sneaked into the kitchen where she ordered one of the Koopa chefs to begin cooking dishes to her liking. She only had a few days to show up at the Mushroom Kingdom under her new alias without making anybody suspicious. The chef brought in a three-course dinner consisting of Caesar salad, roast beef and chocolate cake but Wendy could not be satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not enough,\" She ordered, \"A food critic would need to order one of everything on the menu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the chef ran back to make more food, Wendy began with the salad, taking a couple of forkfuls to analyze the texture before garnishing the rest of it with dressing and finishing it off.

Manners not being her specialty, she picked her teeth and belched loudly, knowing she could get away with it at home. She then rolled the cart over and looked at the other dishes the chef prepared just for her. She didn't know where to start, her mouth watering at each tasty meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Wendy had finished every last bite with a better understanding of her food critic role. She hopped from her chair and up into her bedroom where she drifted into a food-induced sleep. The next morning she woke up and crept out of bed but an unfamiliar sight stopped her. It was her reflection in one of the mirrors in her room but she couldn't help but notice it was different. Everything looked the same except for a noticeably fuller face, slightly wider hips and a protruding gut. Wendy was never self-conscious about her figure but a light bulb went off in her head when she put it into perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more weight I put on, the less they'll recognize me,\" She thought, \"It's a cinch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days passed and the Mushroom Kingdom's chefs along with Wendy's personal chef prepared for hours without rest. While Peach supervised the dining area, the food-critic-to-be kept running up Bowser's food bill. The night before Gwen A. Pook was to appear at the Mushroom Kingdom, Wendy called for a Koopa servant to help with her disguise. The servant's jaw dropped upon seeing her puffed out cheeks and double chin, along with her massive stomach, hips and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you ask, it's part of the disguise,\" She folded her flabby arms across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so,\" The servant told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to search any plus-size store for an outfit similar to this,\" She showed him a sketch, \"Get me the largest you can find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning at the Mushroom Kingdom, the grand hall was prepared for the food critic's arrival. Just outside, Wendy's servant parked the Koopa clown car and began to make a  well-dressed critic out of the only female Koopaling. He helped button down Wendy's tight-fitting shirt and fastened her belt while she put on a beehive hairdo wig, a pink hat and one of Iggy's extra pairs of glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here,\" Wendy instructed to the servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled toward the kingdom's gates where the two guards at the entrance recognized the visitor and opened the gate at once.

She put her hand on her sloshy belly and noticed it now felt soft and a bit saggy. Wendy tilted her head in confusion. \"What is happening in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her confusion turned to worry. Just by looking at her hands, she knew where this liquid was coming from. Her bracelets hung off what looked like trigs, and her heals were worn by two undernourished saplings.  All but her middle had become a dried pink, and fear had completely covered her gaunt face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a weak \"Oh no! That really was the wrong spell! I need to fix this!\" and ran toward the roof's one door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the castle's dingy kitchens was occupied by Iggy Koopa, who was gathering various sandwich-related items from the fridge. As he reached for the lettuce, the door behind him had swung open. His fellow koopaling was looking very sickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA call for help escaped her shriveled lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what was that, Wendy? I couldn't hear ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frustrated girl ran to the fridge and pushed Ludwig way, his would-be lunch now floored. She jumped for the large jug of cider on the top rack and quickly chugged away. The jug was emptied, but her thirst remained. She then grabbed the pitcher of cream and finished that off. Then a bottle of soda. Then a whole case of canned drinks. Iggy looked on in surprise at Wendy's constant guzzling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the last drink, she wiped any drops from her chin and gave a releived sigh. She closed the door, only for it to stop on something. A downward look revealed a large warm-coloured bag. All the liquid she downed had gathered around her lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OooooooOOH! That Kamek! Why can't he just write like a normal person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIggy laughed. \"Got a spell wrong, huh?

At that moment, something prodded her shell. Wendy looked back to see that, two globes had blown up from under her bloated middle. Her attempts to halt their further growth were also useless. The liquid in her was growing heavier and thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fearful Wendy hurried back out the kitchen. As she left the room, her wide behind needed pulling from the kitchen's grasp. Iggy remained behind to watch the folly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy knew this all needed reversing, but rushing down the enormous hallway was like a wade through a swamp. With every step, her middle rounded out and buried her legs more. The two mounds blossoming on top prompted a nervous smile from their owner. The bumps in the back were deepening with plumpness. The increase was rapid and slowdown was nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin only a matter of moments, the event had reached its end. The walls scraped her sides and the ceiling was just out of her reach. Wendy was stuck in place, held down by the five enormous bubbles of fat that made up her body. As she wondered what to do about it, one of her dome-like cheeks felt a hard kick. She looked back to see Iggy cackling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Wow, Wendy, you really screwed this one up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy fumed at Iggy. \"Ooh! You! Just go get my assistant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'll help ya this time!\" Iggy headed to get her assistant, and all the miffed Wendy could do to spend the time was think about her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is, your highness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, bring it up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magikoopa approached Wendy, holding a flask of green fluid. He vanished from the floor and reappeared on one of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly handed her the flask and jumped off the jiggling launchpad. Wendy spied the flask with .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this was fun and all...except it wasn't! Back to my pleasant old self!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy swallowed the green fluid without pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So from this point on, Wendy returns to her normal size...or does she? That small flask can't possibly remove all that fat, can it? Not even a bit left in her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd would you really want that, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...wanna keep going?</i></span></div></div>",

She thought there was a cauldron somewhere nearby, but she realized it was coming from her middle. She looked at her stomach and tilted her head in confusion. With each few seconds, the sound got a bit less quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's funny. It shouldn't be making this noise, should it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the bubbling stopped and her stomach became a bit rounder, causing her to raise an eyebrow. She placed both hands on her hips and tapped her heel, pondering about what had happened. Before an answer could be proposed,-BLUMP!-her pudge blew up a little more. She looked like she had swallowed a basketball, and the bubbling started up again. Now Wendy was really upset!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you!\" She held her wand sideways and pressed in her stomach-ball. \"Get back to your normal size, right--NNNNNH...now!\"  Her wand sank in, unable to shrink the sloshy bump. She hugged tighter and tighter-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLOOSH!-and her belly was smaller again! Not as small as she wanted and a bit soft, but smaller. She almost smirked, until she noticed that something else felt different. She looked behind her, and saw her behind looking like two small jiggling orange globes! Now Wendy was concerned! Some sort of fat had grown in her, and it wasn't leaving soon! And more may be on the way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbling started up again! But slower this time, at its deepest level yet! And her stomach slowly ballooned back to its basketball size! Wendy was worried about what would come next, so she held up her wand and twirled above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Petals scattered around-<b>UHN!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer torso and backside grew rounder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>-around Petey's feet!

Wendy crashed through the roof, landing in the center of banquet hall below. Her seat was planted in an imprint she left between the room's three long tables. The koopaling winced. \"D'ooh, that smarted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted each bloated leg at a time so that she would stand. A struggle it was, as every other part of Wendy wished to remain grounded. She turned her soft neck and gave her chunky arms a look of worry. \"Oh no! What am I to do! I thought I would get fit today, but now I'm just a-\" Her eyes turned to her chest. She gave an admired look to the head-sized hills, and cupped each one with each hand. \"Hello! Aren't you a pleasant surprise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a strange sensation filled her arms. A warm pulse passed through the veins of her arms. Her biceps were growing the hottest, and soon swelled to twice their previous widths. Wendy gave a wide-eyed grin, and triumphantly flexed the flabby pythons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>HNNN</b>-hnhnhnnn! Finally! This is more like what I wanted from the start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately her legs also pulsed, and grew from short pillowy bags into tight watermelons. Wendy wished to see the value of this change. She made large sweeps with each step, giggling as she made a full anticlockwise turn and her fat sloshed when each foot landed. She had grown to such an extreme flab, but finding she could move it around with ease made any worry in her evaporate. Her attention was then given to her backside, was her limited reach. She marveled at how round and deep her posterior had grown. Her hands slapped the small amount they could touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy found joy in her new form. The gain she gained was impressive, and her might was the one force that could move it! The enormous koopaling's giggling slowly grew into an enormous cackle! The bulk she once feared was now her greatest ally! At that moment, some guards peaked in from one of the large banquet doors, hollered at what they saw and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis commotion alerted Wendy. She turned to the door and approached with unhindered confidence. She placed her leg on the door, and threw the door open with a hard kick. Within the hallway the guards cowered, holding their spears toward the poorly lit beast. All the while, she gently stroked her rounded stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's no way to treat your king's one daw-tah, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards's fears turned to shock. \"Princess Wendy? Uh, sorry, we didn't know it was you. I mean...we saw your bow, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough with y babbling. I have important things to announce. There will be a meeting for everyone in the castle to attend, and every everyone will attend. I'll be waiting in the courtyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, madam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards ran off to give the announcement. Wendy walked down the hallway, her sides grazing the walls and her attention downward. She patted her belly, as if a brilliant plan had formed around it...</span></div></div>",

All servants and armsmen had gathered on the grass and on the walls, for the new announcement. Many wondered what it was. Some were happy to just have a small break from work. Bowser, Junior and the Koopalings were in the crowd, and were the most confused about this. They all surrounded the spot for the announcement of news, but whoever was bringing it was nowhere in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutters were broken as the courtyard's large backdoor creaked open. Everyone looked into the space behind the door, and saw a large orange blob with bulging limbs emerge from the darkness. It held a staff only worthy of the higher-ups. They say a pink bow adorn the top, so they soon realized who it was. The audience was filled with emotions...shock, awe, surprise, fear, fainting spells, and one Troopa's face matching his red shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob's family were the most surprised. \"Wendy, what happened to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks a MegaMushroom didn't agree with ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy waddled toward the large royal emblem in the center of the enclosure. She looked to the crowd with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Koopa Kingdom! As you see before you, I have gained a considerable heaviness, and have become the heaviest in the castle! And with it, I've received the muscle needed to transport it where ever I wish! This is because I cast two wonderful spells upon myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as you know, the Mushroom Kingdom has been our greatest enemy for the longest time! We've made countless attempts to overtake them, and all have been thwarted! My insides growl with anger and hatred, amongst other things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I have a plan that will very well bring us victory! The spells I cast on myself were great, but with more casters, I could become the greatest threat the Mushroom Kingdom has ev-ah known! With yours truly at a greater size, we would storm toward their land, and announce their surrender! And if they refuse...I will flatten their kingdom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underlings looked at each other with questioning looks, but they slowly showed approval for the plan. Soon, they were all for it, including the other royals. They all clapped and cheered for Wendy, bringing her joyful pride to its peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\nEveryone had gathered at the outskirts of their kingdom, keeping their distance from their commander. She faced the direction of the Mushroom Kingdom in the distance. Kamek read over his given sheet with a look of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, your highness, some of these copies read 'pebbles'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone with a wand is to read what's on the sheet they're given!

Their collective magic instruments shined with floating shapes. The reading soon finished, they all swung their wands toward Wendy's middle and her whole being shimmered with a rainbow glow. A deep rumbling in her gut alerted the crowd. Wendy giggled and placed one hand on her gut. The noise reached its peak and shook the soil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the moment arrived. Everyone witnessed a swelling in Wendy's curvy front and her tail-dwarfing backside. Any grass below was smothered by her paunch. Her legs were pushed outward as they pumped up, busting apart their bubblegum heals . Up high, her two bracelets sank into extending  bends of flab-wrapped vigour. From all this, a determined face with slowly filling cheeks reached higher storey levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all onlookers stepped back as their lone lady superior looked more dome-like with every passing moment. Questions and fears filled their minds. Even her equals and superior were worried about what would become of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the minute it started, the rumbling and event halted. The girl now rivaled her stone-brick home in her height and area. She once more took in what she had become. As she faced the fields ahead, her arms were readied as she gave her foot a lift. With one step, her mass tilted slightly as it carried forward. After a few more steps, the plan was underway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Koopas!\" Wendy pointed ahead. \"Let's get those guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered, and followed behind their enormous leader. They all had trouble walking with the tremors but were undeterred. Airships flew in and joined in the march. The Mushroom Kingdom's doom was surely at hand!</span></div></div>",

She's always been fighting off one of those blue overalled mustache men and-just recently-a couple of Toads that actually have nerves. Her dreams don't give much assurance, either, as she curled up under her sheets. Dreams of fireballs toasting her, bombs she planted herself roasting her, and an odd vision where Peach tried to clonk her too, haunted her head for many nights. She can't get any rest, even just now as Roy bounces on the end of her bed before breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, make us some breakfast for once! I made it the last five times!\" He continued yelping and whining. \"Get up and make it-MAKE IT-MAKE IT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the room were small boxes, containing all sorts of coins and jewels. Some were on top of the red dresser full of jeans and t-shirts she rarely wears. Some were piled under the posters for truck rallies and Ackman. One rested on her windowsill. All of them jingled as Roy's stomping continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrritated and tired, Wendy couldn't handle any more of Roy's complaining. She sat up and shrieked an uptight \"NO! GO AWAY!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy jumped off the bed and shook the ground below him all around the castle. \"C'mon, GET UP! GETUP-GETUP-GETUP-GETUP-GETUP-GETUP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorton's voice pipes in from behind the bedroom door. \"Are you getting her up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm getting her up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY SIS! GET UP, SLEEPY HEAD!\" Morton then causes the castle to quake from outside Wendy's room. Roy joins in to what he first started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both chimed \"GET!!\" with each jump and \"UP!!\" with each stomp. This continued, keeping Wendy awake despite her tired eyes. After their some-teenth \"GET!\", Lemmy crashes through her window-tipping over the box resting on the windowsill-with his ball following shortly behind. He lands on the floor while his colourful ball bounces around the room and thwaps her in the head. Before Roy and Morton could stomp one more time, they're <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninterrupted by \"ALLLLRRRRRRIIIIIIIGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHT! IIIII'LLLLLLLLLLL MAAAAAAAKE YOOOOOUUUUUUR FRRRRRRIIIIIGGGGGGGGIN' BREEEEEEEEEAKFAAAAAST!!\" She then leaves the room, thwapping Morton down to the ground and heading downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the male Koopalings sat down at their seats at the dining table.

Roy rubbed his ears, trying to get rid of the ringing. Iggy played with his fork, imagining it as a giant grater for Mario's demise. Morton rubbed his nose from the earlier bonking. And Larry sat there, tapping his fingers impatiently for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the kitchen next door, Wendy was preparing the spicy sugar oatmeal for the family with red, veiny eyes. She wanted nothing more than to get a \"good night's sleep\", whatever that was, but nothing made that possible. Her brothers annoyed her, and Mario haunted her dreams. She continued to swirl the oatmeal heated by caged Podoboos, staring into the warm, gooey mess and letting her mind ponder. What could I do about my predicament? How could I get my way all the time? She stopped stirring for a moment and shifted her eyes away. What does Kamek keep in his cabinet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what should Wendy do? Should she...</span></div></div>",

Her sleep was foreign, for it contained no dreams of any kind that she could recall. She jumped out of her bed toward the nearest dressing cabinet of two doors. As she approached it; she quickly rubbed one eye and, in turn, rid herself of looking the least bit tired. She opened the doors of the cabinet, revealing a mirror tall enough for her, clothes galore and a pink and polka-dotted ribbon on the inside of the right hand door. She took off her night gown, straightened it out, and swapped it with the ribbon. She put her ribbon behind her head and used both hands to tie her bow with a smile and a tune in her hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at her reflection to see if her bow was on right; before finishing the knot, she quickly glanced back at her reflection with a <br>\r\nslightly troubled brow. She tightened her bow and held her pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly brought both arms down, with her right hand coming close to her centre.<br>\r\nHer eyes dropped their glance to her belly's reflection. It looked a little bigger than usual. She placed the hand on her koopa shell belly, rubbing its surface on one small place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spot felt a little softer than Little Miss Koopaling remembered her shell had been before this day. This widened her eyes a little. Then she rubbed some more of her belly, which felt softer as well. She rubbed a slightly larger spot-soft as well. All of her belly was rubbed, and it was all a little softer than a koopa's shell would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy looked back up at her reflection's face. She thought back to yesterday morning and the mushrooms. Her eyebrows raised as high as they could go. Soon, a smile appeared on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be the mushrooms working, she thought. Maybe they have a slow effect, but it's working...and my shell well be hard again later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her clenched hands close to her face and bent her knees down like springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeee-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the bedroom door creaked opened with Roy peering in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy turns to him with a loud \"DON'T YOU EVER KNOCK!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis startled the big bonehead back, still holding the door knob and pulling the door closed. Sounds from the other side seem like Roy bumping into Morton and two large thuds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt breakfast time, all of the Koopalings were eating from their bowls of the Cheep-Cheep stew prepared for them; except  Iggy and Lemmy, who juggling eachother's soup from with their bowls.Wendy finished her soup and left her bowl in front of her. She lowered her eyes and eyelids and widened her mouth with a smile; as she rubbed her small hill-shaped stomach, slightly moving its position on her body. Ludwig notices this and pauses his stew-eating. He turns his head directly to Wendy and raises his left eyebrow a centimetre. Wendy sees this, loses her smile, and turns  her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph\" she scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a separate part of the castle not presently visible, a roaring and dominating voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUNG KOOPALINGS. IT IS TIME FOR A NEW PLAN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was left of the stew in the Koopaling's bowls was quickly finished, as the seven siblings ran out of the dining room and into the hall, one-by-one. Ludwig was in the lead, followed in order by Morton, Roy, Iggy, Wendy, Lemmy and Larry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hall was a giant red door, which Ludwig knocked on to open it. Roy and Morton shoved him out of the way, and went through when the doors were separate enough to enter. Ludwig stood back up and cut in front of Lemmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the door was a set of stairs which lead to many elevators and firebars leading down a round shaft of bricks. Morton, Lemmy, Larry and Ludwig retracted into their shells and spun past their other siblings down the obstacles; while Roy, Iggy and Wendy-with her subtle gut shaking in increments- jumped down behind <br>\r\nthem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom was a large green pipe, which they all jumped into in the order they went down. Soon enough, they all arrived in a giant chamber, where their father-the large and powerful Bowser-was waiting for them. They brought their attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kids.

However...we will take longer to prepare for Mario's 'rescue'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children were a little confused and looked at each other before turning back to their parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser continued. \"Yes. It will take weeks instead of days before the day we strike. We have made the defences against him too light. We must make it more than a chore for him. The ships shall be more armed, the castles will be taller, and the fields covered in spinies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLudwig steps forward. \"So we all guard castles as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but we shall wear him down more. You will all be in pairs to do the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children were in awe at this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLudwig asks, \"So who's with Junior?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's seven of us. Who's with Junior, and where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's lifting weights in his room to prepare. And I guess, umm...Wendy is gonna share an Airship with Junior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers look at Wendy in surprise. Most of them turn in jealousy, except for the confused Ludwig and Iggy. Wendy is pleasantly surprised at this announcement, believing that by taking Mario down by herself, she would earn the highest regard from her Daddy. They look back at their father in attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their father continues, Ludwig hears a faint, foreign sound coming from Wendy's shell. Tiny gurgles bubbling build up into a chorus inside of her, then distort into short \"bwas\" followed by crackling pops. He stares in confusion as the sound continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, however, is oblivious to these sounds, and notices Ludwig staring at her stomach. She responds with a confused and disgusted look, and a kick to his cheek.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eight days had passed after Bowser's big announcement. Many ships of differing forms are being prepared in Desert Land for the takeover of the Mushroom Kingdom. None of them were even close to completed; but Lakitus carried supplies in their clouds, and Hammer Bros. brought the planks and machines together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverseeing the operation was a Magikoopa holding stacked ship blueprints in his hands, standing feet away from a cliff to see the operation. Behind him was a arching black doorway with a copy of Bowser's face at the top. A red-lighted portal appears in the arch, with a smiling Bowser Jr. coming out of it. Junior approaches the blue-robed magician. The red portal vanishes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bub,\" said Junior, slapping the overseer hard on the back. \"How are the ships coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Magikoopa looked to Junior. \"Well, sir-ahem-only one cannon blew up, but so far, everything else has been all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunior smiled wider. \"That's great! Papa will love to hear that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is your sister coming here? I need to confirm where in which ship that you two are staying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm-hm,\" Junior laughed. \"I'll get her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back towards the doorway. He quickly knocked on the side three times, causing the arch to create a light-purple portal. He poked his head in through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sis,\" he said, snickering. \"Come here. We have a question for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly turned to and walked back to Magikoopa. He turned back to the door, and they both waited for Wendy's arrival, with Junior trying to control his chuckling and  Magikoopa looking at Junior before returning his sight to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being active for seconds, the portal revealed a small vertical hill of a orange hue-with a light peach cap of four horizontal segments-coming towards them. The visual surprises Magikoopa, now kn. The mass showed more of its lumpy soccer ball-size and revealed it self to be attached to a plump-legged, long armed, , Miss Wendy O Koopa; standing at twice Super Mario's height and with a  shell at double its size, while holding a quarter slice of a ham sandwich with tiny bites taken out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunior calmed himself down and crossed his arms as he faces her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem. So Sis,\u201d he said to her. \u201cHow did Bertha make you angry? PFFFFT! HAHAHAHA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis crossed arms held his stomach as he laughed uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wendy insincerely exclaimed, rolling her eyes. \u201cWhat a funny joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked towards the two and walked to them while her gut shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magikoopa says \u201cWell, uh, I want to be sure that you two are on the same ship and have your stations picked,\u201d and held out the blue prints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy looked over the prints as Magikoopa switched between them. Junior stopped laughing and stood up to walk over to the prints. Soon, a print of a long ship loaded with rotating cannons showed up. Wendy pointed to the center, where a large room with some Bob-omb cannons are placed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunior was annoyed. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly grabbed the blueprints from Magikoopa's hands and flipped through them. He stopped on a large, rounded ship loaded with Bullet Bill cannons, with many tiny rooms and spaces. He pointed to the only tall room, located at the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!\u201d Wendy shrieked at Junior. \u201cI want the long one, and I want the big room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want the tall room in the the big round ship!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLONG!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTALL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLONG!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTALL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took an extra day, but the large rounded ship became the tip of the long ship.</span></div></div>",
