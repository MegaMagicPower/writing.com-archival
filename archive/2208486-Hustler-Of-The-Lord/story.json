She got more dates, topped every class, has more friends, and was everybody's favorite. Even her father, Lord Tamara seemed to like her more. The only person who cared more about Tatiana than Tilly was late Lady Cinniana, the Twins' mother. Tatiana kept complaining about all this to her childhood best friend, Ardex. She felt invisible in her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, just like any other, Tatiana was ranting and ranting about Tilly to Ardex, when suddenly he said,\"I don't know how you haven't noticed this before, but there is this one person I know who certainly will always prioritize you more than Tilly.\"<br>\r\n\"Not possible. Everyone loves that bitch.\"<br>\r\n\"But you have been to oblivious to notice that I have always loved you. And Tilly, or anybody for that matter, cannot change how I feel about you, Nia.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
