You've never left the city before, but you've heard plenty about the areas around it. <br>\r\n     To the east and west is the Forest of Doubts, this city cuts the forest in half. The forest is the safest of the three areas surrounding it, but it is still dangerous to go there. To the south is the Marshland, a boggy area filled with man-eating plants and reptiles. Supposedly, the queen of nagas lives in a cave in there. Finally, to the north is the infamous Plain of Beasts, many travelers have lost their lives there. It is by far the most dangerous area you could go to, but no-one would think to look for you there.</span></div></div>",

Your tail flipped up as you let out a long-pent fart, fouling the air around you, and pushed out the remains of the amazon. She had put up a fight, but was no match for your speed and strength. Your stomach returned to normal as you released the load into the river, watching it wash downstream. It was out of sight, and your home was clean. Though it would not be fun for the town downstream. You grinned a little at this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your buisness done, you returned to your true form and stretched your arms above your head, yawning slightly. You were still a little tired, but a bit of fun would certainly shake it from your mind. Your tail flicked about as you headed to the exit of your den and stepped outside, looking across the plains around you. Everything within this part of the unknown regions was your domain, though most of the residents did not think of it as such. Suddenly, however, a strange scent caught your nose. You immediatly narrowed your eyes, looking about for the source.</span></div></div>",
