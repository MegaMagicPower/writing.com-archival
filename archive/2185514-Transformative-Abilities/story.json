In the past she's been a hands on deity, turning people into creatures of myth and legends but got bored of being worshiped. She's been a divine punisher, transforming the wicked and cruel, though there was never any shortage. She's been a wicked witch cursing entire towns, but that caused people to turn on each other and she detests violence. Now she prefers a quiet life where she transforms though who annoy her and blesses those who meet her crazy challenges. She doesn't kill and any time she transforms someone into an animal their lifespan is extended to what a human would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is known to the Governments of the world, though they have learnt to leave her alone after military personnel ended up in zoos or toys and a few government leaders vanished. Depending on where she lives the local law enforcement might also be aware of her as her changes to people do lead to some interesting reports and people tend to go missing around her. She will co-operate with the police stations that know about her but her patience does wear thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess lives in several locations, switching them up as she choices. Her main residence is in the suburbs of a large town called Limestone Hills. She also runs a hobby farm in a remote location. She has apartments in several big cities and a rundown old shack just off an interstate highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment the Goddess is in...</span></div></div>",

The reason she loved that so much is because it meant there was someone to annoy when she broke the rules and people to transform if they broke the rules. It depended on her mood really, but the home society did go through many chairmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town also saw a lot of out of visitors, being off a major travel route and out of town visitors were the kind of people the Goddess loved to mess with, some of them even came for her as she ran a blog about the strange and paranormal in regards to herself. Then there was the other blog she ran that also attracted visitors to her house, especially with the young adults reaching the end of their teens or early twenties, these were rewards she offered for meeting certain challenges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLimestone Hills was a place she could take things easier while still having her fun.

He was transferred to Limestone Hills police station after reporting his fellow officers for various breaches of conduct. The other officers caught wind of this and he was transferred to this quiet town as a form of exile. He didn't mind it though, however the station was a little weird, with two pigs that just roamed freely and the boar head mounted in the main office that looked like it was watching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis current assignment was in regards to missing people and there were a lot of them, more than what a town like this should have, some were locals, while some were passing through town when they went missing. He was instructed to take the list to this address in a nearby suburb though he didn't understand why he'd be taking the entire missing persons list here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled up to the plain looking house and knocked on the door. He averted his eyes when a naked woman opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, ma'am. I'm Officer Ford, I was told to consult you about some missing people?\" He tried so hard to look her in the eyes and not down at the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're new,\" the Goddess commented as she walked inside, smirking at the officer's reaction to her nudity. He had passed the first test, he was polite to look away. \"I like new, take a seat and I'll go put a robe on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you ma'am\" Ford said in regards to her hospitality and putting on something to cover herself up. When she returned he had the box of files on a coffee table. \"So um, what exactly am I suppose to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't briefed? Wow people must not like you, don't worry I'll sort them out for their rudeness later. You're here to ask me about the missing people in those files, I then tell you if it was me or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFord was baffled by what she just said. \"What do you mean if it was you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess sighed, she did not like explaining things. She sat down on her favorite chair and interlocked her fingers together. \"I'm responsible for a lot of missing people, something you'll learn if you stick around long enough. Your job is to ask me who I'm responsible for because there's been a few times, where I wasn't responsible and a murderer got away or something. So I've politely agreed to these meetings in my home to go through these lists every so often. Now what I don't like is telling people how to do their jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a joke?\" Ford stood up and glanced over at the Goddess, not knowing the danger he was in. He didn't know what to make of this, if she was telling the truth, why was she allowed not behind bars, if she was lying then what was he doing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess rolled her eyes. \"Who told you to come here?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Bates, he's my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess raised her hand, silencing Ford and then clicked her fingers. Bates was in the room in an instant. \"Officer Bates, I've been informed you assigned Officer Ford to the missing persons file yes?\" She didn't wait for him to answer and Ford saw the fear in his eyes. \"By not informing him of the complete nature of his job you have wasted all of our time. Now time might not mean much to me but I still hate it being wasted.\" She clicked her fingers. Ford stood their helplessly as the other Officer transformed into a grandfather clock before his eyes. The Goddess then returned her attention to Officer Ford. \"Now I hope that explains everything, now since I can't trust you to do your job I'm going to do it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess started going through the files:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes - Letter box<br>\r\nYes - Cat<br>\r\nYes - Frog<br>\r\nYes - Crush's breast<br>\r\nYes - Dick<br>\r\nYes - Jacket<br>\r\nYes - Mouse (the animal)<br>\r\nYes - Shrunk (being cared for)<br>\r\nYes - Head (gave her body away)<br>\r\nYes - Doll<br>\r\nNo<br>\r\nOfficer Bates - Clock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrote that last one on a piece of paper and put it in the box with the other files. \"Well it looks like you have a missing boy to find,\" the Goddess unfroze Officer Ford and returned the box to him. \"You may leave now but first, for wasting my time at the start I'm going to have to punish you. It'll only be a minor one, you can still carry out your duties\"</span></div></div>",

His pelvis crack and shuffled as his hips widened and his waist narrowed. He couldn't feel his penis anymore but felt the folds of his new vulva through the jeans of his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of the fetus position and was on his hands and knees. His hands began to shift and reform before his very eyes as the became more dainty. He felt the flesh on his chest begin to grow, as it pushed against his shirt and his face felt like it was on fire. His hair became softer and silkier, and long enough to cover his entire view as he stared down at the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was breathing deeply as his whole body broke out in sweat, leaving him drenched and smelling different from what he was use to. As he stood up his clothes felt very loose as they hadn't adjusted to his new body. He could see his new breasts clearly through his drenched white shirt and the gaps between the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" he said in a new feminine voice but the witch raised her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard this all before, you're either going to break down and cry, get all freaked out or abuse me and demand I turn you back. On the rare occasion some men like the change as soon as I make it. You seem the sort that'll go into shock and just ignore the changes for now, though I have been wrong before. Anyway if you're going to cry or start losing it, please do so in your car or back at home, tears bore me. If you're going to yell at and abuse me, you're getting changed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Ford looked at the Goddess with a burning hatred in his eyes as he touched the holster of his pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that wasn't an expected outcome, I'll tell you what I'll let you get a shot off then we'll decide what happens next.\"</span></div></div>",

Though she hesitated to fire her weapon, her training had kicked in, the Goddess was unarmed and seemed to pose no risk, however she was a being of immense power and had turned people into object among other things, she was a danger to the whole world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess just mused at Officer Ford, she didn't consider her a risk and she was generally curious if she'd be brave enough to take the shot. However after a minute of staring her down the Goddess bemusement turned to boredom, and if Officer Ford lowered her weapon now and walked away there would be consequences for wasting the Goddess's time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either shoot me or don't\" the Goddess demanded as she took a step to the right, the pistol staying locked on. \"Oh for my stake! Make up your damn mind already!.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Ford ignored her as he played out all the scenarios in her head. There was a strong chance that the Goddess would just survive the shot and she'd be made to suffer. If it worked would her changes even be undone, if not Ford could live with being a woman if it meant not another soul was changed. There was also the chance she could just fake being a normal person making it look like Ford had entered her home and shot her without cause, in which case how would that play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Officer Ford could make up her mind, the Goddess had disappeared from her view and was now behind her. \"I told you to make up your mind, so now we're going with option number three.\"</span></div></div>",

I didn't want to use my limited interactive items on each one so decided to include an interactive that involves these powerful beings and anyone else I might come up with later. I am someone with a lot of ideas and find many branching ideas in my head, which is why I created it as an interactive. Sometimes I have an idea of a different outcome though don't always know where it'll lead so I do encourage people to add to this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interactive contains several stories about beings with the ability to transform people in one form or another. Some of these people have limitations to their powers, while some can do practically anything they put their minds to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\nDeath of any of the characters are fine. Though that doesn't mean the story has to end, their can be new victims or the beings might be able to bring them back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dealing with characters under the age of 18, be mindful how you treat them, I will not tolerate any nudity or sex and these chapters will be deleted. I'd rather not have anyone under age but that does remove the possibilities certain changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe mindful of other people when writing, leaving as many options available as possible. If you can only add two paths I'd rather you do 'more options' as the second choice allowing for others to add their own ideas. On that note be careful how long you make your chapters, they shouldn't be too short however they should also leave room for choice. So don't write too many transformations or actions in a single chapter where another choice was available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am impulsive and do change my mind often so do except to see the occasional change in the structure of the interactive or some of my additions being edited. I will try not to delete chapters and if an idea I thought of gets taken I will use the more options or edit the choices so both out ideas for that choice can be expressed. (On that note, if anyone wanted to add to a particular option that was taken feel free to repeat that choice with your own idea).</td>",
