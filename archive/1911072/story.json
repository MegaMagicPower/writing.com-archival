So many storylines...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first storyline is the most obvious one; I shall start it first of all. <b>Ocarina of Time</b> is how Link and Ruto met, and the story of their relationship is one I wish to see come true. With so many possible meeting points, how can I not be satisfied?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, we have the sequels. There are multiple games in the series, games which Link will always star in. But how could things go, if Ruto were in the storyline? Four games are already available in that field, for you to pick from: <b>Majora's Mask</b>, <b>Oracle of Ages</b> and <b>Oracle of Seasons</b>, and <b>Twilight Princess</b>. But those are not the only Zelda games, not at all... there will always be space for more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe you don't feel satisfied with just these. Maybe you want to be creative. So there is a space just for you - the <b>original adventure</b>. Sole restriction is that Link must love Ruto and vice-versa - but if you wanted a harem, how am I to stop you? By deleting your post, that's how. So don't be an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Transformations</b> are a part of Zelda and these games have enough of it. So, if you just want to screw around with them, there's a section for you too. Just... try and add content and not just several pages of 'what will Link/Ruto turn into?!'. Nobody needs to see a superslow transformation for twelve chapters when it can happen in three... okay, <i>I</i> don't. Sorry, but I don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly, there's <b>the last option</b>. If you aren't satisfied by anything, five threads are available for you to screw around and be silly. You don't even need to be doing much about Link and Ruto, necessarily, but keep it to yourself. Also, only one storyline per thread, so be careful - I'll delete loose ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive paths for five stories. Now, how shall we begin?</span></div></div>",

You <i>fairy-less Kokiri</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose harsh words resounded through the forest, as a young boy ran out of the village he lived in, trying to hold back his tears. Part of him just wanted to cry out, already, as he was sick of such provocations... but another, quieter part was stronger. The blond-haired boy didn't cry once, even as he kept on running, desperate to get away from the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running as far as he could, he came to a sudden halt, slowly catching his breath. His green cap had nearly fallen off his head, and his green clothes were also pretty roughed up; he wasn't as skilled with walking in the forest as his... well, as the people who lived here were; it was hard for him to think of them as his friends when they kept mistreating him like that. And none of them were ever warned by their fairies, or otherwise told off... it was like the fairies <i>wanted</i> him to suffer, or something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was painful to think about. In fact... while he had managed to hold the tears at bay while running, now he couldn't help but feel like he should be crying. He was a lone Kokiri, disliked by his own race, with nearly no friends and definitely no fairy... it was heartbreaking for someone like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just started to cry when he heard something. \"Hey!\" a strange, new voice let out, surprising him. The boy looked around, for a few moments. \"Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in one direction. \"No, not <i>there</i>! Here! Can't you see me?\" the voice said, somewhat annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy kept looking around, for several moments. He even looked up, but didn't see anybody in that direction either. The voice's annoyance eventually turned into an amused laugh, as the boy simply did not seem to find it. Eventually, he approached the small lake in the clearing he had entered, in his race.</span></div></div>",

Are you that dense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink didn't know what to say to that, until he suddenly felt two cold, wet hands grasping him by the ankles and pulling hard. With a cry, he fell into the water, trying to swim up - and almost failing at that, he realized desperately, as his arms were not strong enough to pull him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until he was almost out of breath that he felt his legs loose again, and he quickly surfaced. For a few moments, he was quite scared, as he felt his heavy clothes drag him down. Why was he no good swimmer, like any other Kokiri?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter echoed through the lake, as he did his best to get to the bank, but there was no way for him to do so in this situation. Something jumped out of the water, at that point, splashing him completely again. His gaze was blurred enough to keep him from seeing who it was, but he could see at least some kind of blue shape...</span></div></div>",

The backdrop may change and people in the thick of it may vary, but these three beings are always at the center of it all. The story has been told in one manner through all however. The hero comes to the aid of the princess, fending off against the demonic Lord. This was the way for centuries...until that one day. The cursed day when the hearts of the Zora turned dark. Forming a pact with the leaderless Gerudo, the Zora began to fight against their former allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough bravely fought, the surprised Hyrule was unable to gather the necessary forces to fight back. Whay was even worse was that by casting a spell of dark magic, the green clad hero's fate was sealed to be the whim of the Zora. The royal family was slain in a matter of hours with the exception of the princess, who was never found. Stories claimed she was taken by the queen as a trophy, other rumors say she fled in before the halls were raised. This was slightly more likely as many villagers had fled before things became worse. What is known is that the balance of the world had been shifted, possibly forever. A millennia has passed, and the age of Hyrule was forgotten in the wake of the matriarch age of the Zorudo alliance. Within the halls of the central castle repurposed for the new ruling classes, a Zora princess by the name of Ruto lives with her queenly mother.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto smiled as she looked to the simple hyruleans that toiled within the town. She always did find watching the lower classes enjoyable, especially every now and again when a male would forget his place. However, today wasn't ment for just watching the lower class, she had someone to watch for. Sure enough, she could see the horse in the distance guided by the Zoran guards. Ruto sighed in happiness over what she knew to be her childhood crush Link coming to visit. Her mother and the Gerudo Chieftess had been thrilled on how easily the two grew close and encouraged them to interact. She was told it was about 'upholding the prophecy' Ruto just loved Link as it was. Wanting to be at the door upon his arrival, Ruto rushed to the water way and dove through. Sipping past stairs and turns, she got out right at the door. The stone/gold opened and there stood Ruto's dear Link.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruto smirked as she jumped into the waterways, preparing to beat Link again to their little spot. Ruto zoomed through the castle, many square feet of construction passing like nothing. Within a few seconds, Ruto jumped from the water and landed in the grass path of the gardens. Ruto stopped , taking in the fresh air and beautiful plants.

Compared to the mere gardens of old, it was a delicate mixture of plant life and water, as befit the Zora standard. She so enjoyed her wet feet against the soft grass. \"I hear you have only now reached maturity, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true; although one might have seen them as mere children, Link had already mastered the use of the weapons of the Gerudo, as well as their fighting skills, at least as far as they had allowed a male to. Perhaps he seemed a little too innocent, but as a male living with the Gerudo, this was more from them refusing his aid and letting him train only so he could protect himself - if that ever came to pass, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's so... then I suppose it's only time our mothers will give us the permission to live together. Wouldn't that be wonderful?\" Ruto as well had the recognition of maturity, as far as her family was concerned. Of course, her words were innocent - she hardly expected to start a family at the moment. But being able to live with Link, in a single building, no longer having to wait months for his visits, would be much more appealing to the young Zora princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as Link nodded, she frowned a little. <i>'You don't </i>have<i> to kneel, you know...'</i> she thought, a little bothered by this bit of distance between them. How she longed to be hugged and play with him, <i>without</i> her having to make him do it! But it was something her mother had said, that she needed to establish her dominance over Link if she wished to truly be equal with him. She didn't quite get it yet, but hoped it would at least truly make them equal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she pushed that thought away. \"Now, Link, if you don't mind...\"</span></div></div>",

His muscles were just the right size that it showed strength but didn't give the impression of arrogance.  Her mother always said it was a sign that \"they wish to be better for you, not for their own vanity.\" Yet another phrase that made little sense, but was nice to think about.  Ruto motioned a downward direction with her hands, silently telling the boy to continue. The silent command was followed as Link reached for his dark purple and green shorts.

For a moment the noises stopped, save for the sounds of rushing water. Ruto glanced to Link before turning back to the source of the noise.

She was shocked to be greeted by not only the sight of Link, but of a shrouded figure who had him by the neck. Before Ruto could even blink, Link had grabbed the stranger by the side and with an odd twist, pulled himself from the lock. Now separated from her lover, Ruto looked over the intruder. The being was covered in robes of light purple and white and a small vial of emerald green liquid hung around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards!!\" Ruto yelled out as the figure rushed towards them with blinding speed. Already the sounds of weapons echoed from the halls, but the figure jumped to a tree branch and made a sign with her hands. Her palms shot out two blue flames that covered both entrances to the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's out of the way....\" The figure's indistinguishable voice drove both Ruto and Link on further edges then they were already on. Link stood in front of Ruto, using his body as a shield as he reached into his vest and pulled out a small dagger. \"Concealed weaponry, even now you truly are a prepared warrior.\" The being dropped from the tree and pulled a dagger of their own. \"Please Link, don't make me have to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know his name you....you creep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\" The figure hissed as it hurled the dagger at Ruto, who jumped just in time to avoid it. \"Now my dear Link, I believe the time has come to fix you.....\" By this time, guards had already reached the blocked entrances and were trying to figure a way to open the path. As much as Ruto utterly hated to leave Link alone, she knew this intruder was too dangerous to fight alone. Besides, fire was fire and water was all around.</span></div></div>",

He had no idea how this being knew his name but the threat this being posed was more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Judge your opponent quickly, scan for weaknesses.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words from his teachers gave Link a clear head as his trained eyes glanced about his target. The figure was rather tall, about the size of the average Zora guard though the stance was neither Zora nor Gerudo. With magic in it's grasp, it was clear a simple rush wasn't going to work....at least not unless the figure's mind was elsewhere. Though the cloth seemed weak, it was impossible to see enough of the body to point out any physical weaknesses. What Link was able to see however was the thicker covering of the chest area. His mother had especially informed him that female warriors would sometimes cover the more sensitive areas with an extra lining. A female....the superior....no, female or not an attack of her caliber would not go unpunished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue' s hands glowed green as she made new gestures in an upwards motion. The earth beneath the two shook, moving like a snake towards the Gerudo-born. The earth curled about Link, who jumped out of the way before he could be constricted. Keeping his eyes to his target, Link hurled his dagger at the hidden woman's heart. The figure bent over backwards and caught the flying weapon, showing some of her curves in the process. Believing her to be distracted, the tan teen ran towards the woman with intent to strike. A flick of the wrist was all it took for the ground to shake again. Link prepared to jump away only for his feet to be halted. Glancing down, a strange pink substance was rising from the dirt and surrounding him. Rings of the unnatural slime were beginning to stack until they formed a Like-Like, covering all but Link's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I was wrong about my 'warrior' quip. No matter, the damage of the past shall soon be corrected.\" The figure slowly approached Link with an air of both satisfaction and seriousness. Although his struggling was powerful, Link was becoming more and more curious about this figure by the second. \"I don't expect it to be easy for you, but the least I can do is make you enjoy it.\" The cloth around the figures eyes was pulled down, revealing two glowing irises. With the Like-Like holding his neck, Link had no chance to avoid looking into the spheres of light. \"That's it Link, just relax and look into my eyes. Let this world fade away and become only you and me.\" The motions holding Link began to alter themselves from a forceful motion to a calmer, massaging gesture. \"Just relax dear boy....\" The figure was now against the enthralled Link and was uncorking the vial around her neck. \"Now...to begin the healing process. Drink my dear.\" The smell of the vial was indescribable to Link, who by now was almost in a drunken stupor. The vial was beginning to tip over,  a small drop slowing reaching the opening mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crash* Two Zora fins sliced through the bottle, thrown in such a curve leading to splattering it's contents only on the intruder. The fins swirled in the air as they made their way back to Ruto, who was now backed by tens of Zoran guards. The figure coughed and hacked at the liquid permeating her cloth and quickly uncovered herself revealing a taught face with blond hair and pointed ears. Without another word, the figure raised her arms to the air and with a striking motion created a smoke screen. The Like-Like was melting away into the ground, becoming nothing more than a discolored puddle. The sounds and smoke clearing his head, Link was down on the ground coughing his own storm. Ruto rushed to her lover and held him tightly, the tears saying all that needed to be said. Down on the ground, the cloth began to dissipate but not before Ruto saw an icon on it. An icon of an eye glass.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The intruder had vanished without a trace and the search ended quickly. Ruto held Link in her arms with no current intention of letting him go. She could feel his arms surround her and took solace in their strong grasp. Something was off though, Ruto couldn't quite tell but it was almost as if the hug had a faint uncertainty to it. \"Link, we need to tell my mother about this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zoran queen sat upon her towering throne as she listened to her daughter, her royal blue robes hiding her fidgeting hands. The guards had already informed her of the intruder's attack, but the details Ruto was giving her gave her a silent alarm. Word the the attack had spread fast along the waterways and already the Gerudo Chieftess was on her way. Guards were now posted on every entrance, window and rampart with no excuses wanted for loss of vigilance save only death. But the queen knew it wouldn't be enough, at least all on it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....the Like-Like just melted away and the guards showed up and thankfully we haven't seen her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zora royalty nodded her head and stood up. \"If I may my guards, I wish to speak to my daughter and her love alone.\" The guards nodded and all left the room in single file, leaving the two Zoras and Link. The queen stepped across the stone and seashell floor towards the them with a grave face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter, I'm afraid that I know exactly who the attacker was...or rather was attempting to be. You see my dear...\" The Zora began as she pointed to the kneeling Gerudo boy. \"This was not the first Gerudo born to be named Link. He is more than one person. His is a soul that is forever binded to our people, a spirit whom had transcended legends of centuries. You remember the stories of our uprising correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto nodded. \"Yes, how the hero defended the Zora against attackers and selflessly have his life to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hero....is Link's ancestor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, I'm in love with a living legend! Oh this just makes our love even sweeter, doesn't it my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..sorry mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Anyways, there is another being who shares a similar fate as his. She was the attacker who tried to take Link away. A person who through all timelines went by the name of Zelda. I was certain it was her when you described the symbol on her cloth. It was the symbol of a tribe thought to be long forgotten to history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well historical or not, no one tries to take away my dear Link and gets away with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She came close enough though, the substance you described was a mind control spell. It Link had ingested it all, he would have become a slave to Zelda's whim. Thankfully it seems he only had a small drop, nowhere near enough to control him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of angered yelling could be heard behind the door, drawing the trio's attention. The large door opened to show a tall Gerudo woman dressed in glittering purple and black attire flanked by several guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zorana, why have I been hear talk of our children being attacked? I allow Link to come here of his own will and what happens? He is attacked by some peasant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a peasant Nabooru, it was an enemy we both believed to be long dead. The point of the matter is that Ruto and Link are in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why not bring them to the desert fortress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we have no idea how far Zelda' s power is. She could be expecting it. No, I believe we must hide our children in plain sight.\" At the mention of Zelda, Nabooru froze for a moment. Her face now matching her fellow ruler, she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a ranch a ways from town, my sisters use it for breeding our 'out of desert' horses. They will surely be safe there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorana nodded, turning back to her daughter. \"It would appear you get your wish my daughter. I believe it is time for you and Link to begin your life together. You leave....</span></div></div>",

While Link has been trained in self-defense, not even he could imagine the swarms waiting to pounce on lone travelers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush came across Ruto's face while Link merely squinted to the ground. \"Very well...come on Link, the sooner we get to sleep, the sooner tomorrow and the beginning of our new life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much in the princess' bedroom, a few lights along the walls, a window facing the beautiful lake surrounding the castle town, two handcrafted beds and a life size portrait of Ruto herself. (Though if someone looked at it they could tell certain 'artistic liberties' were made; her breasts were not nearly as big at this time, nor did she have such a natural sultry look that contrasted with her own regal stance.) The Zora and Gerudo slept in separate beds still, much to the silent objection of Ruto. While she knew she had to show deference to Link, she had no clue why it had to go so far. Never the less, the two went to sleep quickly and their dreams overtook them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Time to fix you....</i><br>\r\nThose words just kept echoing as waves of colors spun around Link.<br>\r\n<i>Time to fix you....</i><br>\r\nThe colors were interrupted briefly by pictures of....Zelda. Her poses from battle and even just herself.<br>\r\n<i>Time to fix you....</i><br>\r\nSlowly the colors began to fade away with the images of Zelda being the dominant image, the words echoing farther and slower with each passing second.<br>\r\n<i>Time...to....fix..you.....</i><br>\r\nZelda began to approach the stone-still Link, her garments falling down all by themselves.<br>\r\n<i>Let it become just us....</i><br>\r\nThe new words began to play over the old as the nude Zelda began to reach down across Link's body. Her skin was becoming a shade of pink as it dripped around.<br>\r\n<i>Just us....</i><br>\r\nLink could feel her grasp as the slime began to build into the pink Like-Like from before. Her movements in time with the vibrations, Zelda leaned in closer and closer. <br>\r\n<i>Just us..my hero......Link.....Link.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!!\" Ruto yelled to Link for the third time as his body convulsions grew worse. As much as she lovedwhat she was about to do, she knew it was only for the moment. Gathering all of her strength, Ruto got down onto the bed and pressed her lips against Link's. The feeling of her scales and love did the trick as Link's eyes shot open. \"Good, you're awake. Oh Link, we have to get moving. Our entourage is ready to take us to our new home and it isn't waiting long. We don't want that Zelda freak catching us off guard.\" Link sat still in his bed as Ruto rushed about, worried about her looks. Something inside just told him to relax for a moment before getting up himself.</span></div></div>",

It is a rare pairing, that so many people dislike by virtue of their prejudice towards them, but that actually comes to its favor; after all, something with less fans can have more good writers on it. However, after a long while, he eventually chose to pull the plug on several of his stories and start anew. And that included the previous version of this Interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked him for permission and have received it. And now, let us bring to the world the love and adventures of Link and Ruto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Warning:</b> This story will have copious amounts of <u>nudity</u>, <u>transformations</u>, <u>transgenderism</u>, and <u>underage romance</u>. As such... this is not a story for the very young and very innocent. The rating is high because of that, but that is only for my own work. Those of you who choose to join do not need to write such things if you do not wish to, and may even write a less graphic story if you so wish. Still... viewer discretion.</td>",
