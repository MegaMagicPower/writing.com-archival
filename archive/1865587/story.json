Suddenly you hear a woman scream and feel hands grab hold of you and pull you.<br>\r\nYou can now open your eyes. You see you are being held by a giant pair of hands and are quickly passed to another pair. \"It's a beautiful girl Mrs. Lovato.\" you hear someone say and you turn to see what looks like a giant doctor.<br>\r\n\"Let's name her Demi.\" you hear a woman say and you realise you have become the baby version of Demi Lovato and somehow gone back in time to when she was born. You hate the way this feels mainly because you are unable to do anything and you dislike the feeling of being so small and helpless.<br>\r\nAfter some boring hours at the hospital you are forced into a car and taken to your new home.</span></div></div>",
