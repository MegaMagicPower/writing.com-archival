You feel wet sand under you, and the smell of salty air fills your nostrils as you breathe. You pick your head up and open your eyes slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An island?\" you ask nobody in particular. \"Oh great... I guess I should at least see what`s around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a look around, and besides noticing your clothes were sopping wet and torn a bit, you saw that there were a few trees on the beach as well as the remnants of easily more than one ship just off the coast near some rocks which led up to a tall cliff. There was also a jungle nearby that seemed to part open and form a path, like someone had been walking there for a long time, and to the left of that was a large field that seemed to go on for a long time and wrap around the other side of the island. And you could also see a column of smoke coming from more towards the center of the island. Someone had to have started a fire to get smoke like that. The island might have some other people on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can`t sit around all day, I have to find fresh water,\" you said to yourself, rubbing your head. \"Not only that, but I need a place to sleep and food. But water comes first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you had no choice but to explore. The question is, where to?</span></div></div>",

You jumped up to see what it was, but the flora around you blocked anything except moving leaves and the sun that shone down through the canopy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, I`m a sitting duck out here,\" you said, looking around for any sign of life. \"I have to move...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next?</span></div></div>",
