Oddly, he hit somethin solid with his feet, and his hands. Opening his eyes he looked around and saw in shock. His bare feet were across the room pressing against the door. His arms were touching the ceiling. He was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around for his clothes, but all he saw was a bunch of rags. His body had burst through his clothes while he was sleeping. His shoes were just rags hanging around his ever enlarging ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then someone walks into the Room...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lans foot is slightly bigger than him. Lan shifts his leg and pressis his foot against the door, forcing it shut. The impact of the Door made Chaud look up from his P.E.T.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit Lan, what Happened?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan just smiled and shifted his weight, so his left foot was covering the door, while the right was next to Chaud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so small. Look, my foot is almost as big as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan shifted his right foot and pushed Chaud up against the Wall. Chauds P.E.T fell to the floor, and Lan crushed it with his fingers. Smiling he watched as his toes expanded, covering the tiny boy. He laughed as the tiny Chaud squirmed, as Lans foot was growing so big, that he could not see any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all that could be seen was Chauds white hair between Lan's Big Toe and Second Toe. His face was crushed into the sweaty sole of Lans gigantic Foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lan, what are you doing?\" Chaud shouted, trying to get his face away from the Toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have always felt inferior to you.\" Lan replied. <br>\r\n\"But now I am superior, I am the one in control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the walls could not handel it. Lan's legs stretched out, from being cramped out for ages. They burst through the Hall and came to rest in the Spare Bedroom. Lans torso burt through the other wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had not yet burst the ceiling though. Lying on his back he was in several different rooms at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet were currently in the Spare Room, with Chaud trapped in their as the Window was locked and Lans Feet were covering the Exit. His legs extended through the hall and his waist was in his bedroom. His torso and head were currently in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud looked on in horror as he saw his only way out was blocked by the Gigantic Feet of Lan. A Pair of feet that were swelling and filling up the room. A Pair of feet that Chaud realised dictated his future. How would he survive?</span></div></div>",

The guest room had a lamp in it, the kind that stood were connected to a long metal pole. He reached out for it, his fingers inches away from the black metal...but it was in vain. Lan's right foot crashed into it, knocking it over and out of his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let it end like this!\" Chaud thought with determination. \"I won't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lan was enjoying the sensation of Chaud's small body, totally subdued just by his left foot. His head was soon pushing against the living room's far wall, a loud groaning filling the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost out...\" Lan thought, excited about the time when he would burst from his own house...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something interupted his enjoyement. Chaud was no longer pressed into his foot! Lan quested around the guest room with his huge feet but couldn't feel him anywhere! Then his left big toe caught in the open window!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow he escaped!\" Lan growled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened was Chaud had gotten stuck to Lan's foot as it expanded, and the growth had pushed him over from the wall to the window, which had shattered under the pressure. Chaud had a few minor scrapes, but was otherwise in good condition. He quickly pulled out his cellphone intending to call for help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house Lan felt his toes and knees break throught he ceiling and his arms were pressed tightly against his body. The house groaned again, even louder this time. Lan smiled as he felt the sensation of his house collapsing around him. Soon he'd be out and then the real fun would begin...</span></div></div>",

Chaud was hoisted up onto the skin between his big and second toe as his foot moved across the city. People ran and screamed as Lan's massive body began to outgrow even the city! Lan was ecstatic about what was happening, eagerly watching every part of his body enlarge bigger and bigger. Then his head smashed into a building, and while he was huge, he wasn't big enough to avoid getting knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Chaud looked down and saw it was a long drop from Lan's toe skin to the ground. Looking behind him, he also saw he was too small to climb up onto Lan's foot. So he was stuck for awhile, and he couldn't call for help since he had dropped his cellphone, which had smashed when Lan pinned him down.He sighed and leaned back, trying to think of a way to get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Lan had been knocked unconcious he continued to grow, his limbs moving around some buildings and obliterating others. When his growth finally slowed to a stop, his head extended out from the north side of town, while his legs extended from the south side and his arms from the east and west. People were being evacuated from the area and rescue teams were being sent in to help with this disaster.</span></div></div>",

Looking down at their scared and awed faces made Lan realize just how powerful he was. And not only that, he could make many others cower in fear of him, or obey him. The idea of thousands of tiny slaves to do with whatever he wanted excited him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud, still unknown on the toe, saw Lan grinning and knew what that meant. Chaud hated being so helpless, but trying to fight Lan would be like trying to fight a living mountain.

Their fear excited Lan even more, to the point where Lan got an erection. Lan let the power of being colossal and invincible go to his head. Lan smiled in a sinister then brought his is foot down and crushed all the kids into a bloody mess under his sole. Chaud was cowering in fear of what Lan just did and hope to god that Lan doesn't find him, thinking what cruel thing Lan would do to him. He get his answer soon. Lan was so excited from crushing the poor children that a few drops of precum fell from his erection on to Chaud's head and his toes. Lan couldn't wait to do that to the next city so he started walking over to one in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, Lan very slightly felt something on his toe and looked down to see someone on it. He looked closer to see it was Chaud, his bug-sized,(at least to him),friend. \" There you are Chaud. I've been looking everywhere for you\" Lan boomed. Chaud was too scared to move.\"wha--what are y-yo-ou g--gg-oing to do t-to me L-lan\" Chuad stutter with fear. Lan smiled and said,\"How about taking care of my boner to start with?\". Lan then grabbed his friend and lift and placed him on top of his piss slit. Lan then pushed Chaud in further,so far in that chaud couldn't talk without eating precum. Lan then laughed and then continued his walk until he reached the next city,(or playground in Lan's eyes).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan saw a lot of bugs he wanted to squish already when he looked down. Lan lifted his bloody sole and listened to the screams of panic.\"Ahh, music to my ears\" Lan thought. Their pleas meant nothing to him. Lan then brought his sole and flatten all the bugs and buildings under it . Blood and debree spewed everywhere and under his foot and Lan loved it. Lan then thought,\"I think I should share my gas with these people\". Lan then found a good 1000 people all in the city's central park. He made a sinister grin and then grabbed 500 in one hand and another 500 in his other. Lan then ate all of the people in his left hand and told the other people in his right worship and rub his naked butt if they don't want to end up like them. Lan held then on the floor and slowly sat down on them. Lan then remove his hand from his butt and let them get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan moaned at all the rubbing and worshiping he got from the bugs under him. They continued for 10-20 minutes, all gagging from it, until Lan was ready.\"Hope you like the smell of my gas cause I sure will, especially after eating all those bugs.\" Lan roared with laughter as he let loose gigantic fart on all of his worshipers. He sniffed it,\"aaaahhhh that smells so good that I think I do it a few more times\" Lan then laughed evilly at the people's pain and suffering as he continued farting on them with pleasure. After relieving himself of his gasses, he then cruelly said,\"I don't need you bugs anymore.\" as he lifted up his ass and plopped it down hard on the people below him, killing then all with mercy under his butt. Lan smiled at the pool of blood underneath his ass and licked it. To him, It was wonderful. Lan then searched for more people to abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan rampaged and destoryed almost the entire city with his foot and ass, licks his lips while doing so. All of the buildings were in ruins and their were only 100 people left. Lan found them and grabbed half of them and put them all over his penis. Lan moaned with pleasure and started jacking off with all the bugs clinging and hanging on his penis. He moans got louder and all the bugs were hit with precum. Lan lifted his foot and killed 25 of the people under him. Lan smiled and then jacked off for 5-10 minutes as he let loose the hugest cum explosion of his life. Lan roared so loud with pleasure that everything person on and under him,(except Chaud),went deaf. Lan let out so much load, that he drowned all of the remain bugs in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan kept spilling his load, to the point where Chaud came out and landed in the sea that was Lan's cum. Lan smiled and panted for a good 3 minutes and then ate some of his cum that was mixed with blood.\"I have never tasted anything sweeter than this in my whole life\" Lan moaned. He then found Chaud struggling to get out of Lan's cum. Lan grabbed him and stuck him up his asshole to have fun with him later. Lan then grinned evilly and farted on Chaud. Chaud was crying for someone to rescue him. Lan laughed and said,\"Forget it man, no one can help or save you from me. The world is now my bitch and there isn't anything any of you bugs can do about it\" Lan continued to torture Chaud with his farts for a few minutes to break his spirit before moving to to next city to destroy.</span></div></div>",

But this city was much larger then his own and he was going to have fun with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, down between Lan's toes, Chaud uncurled now that he was closer to the ground again. He noticed they were now in a different city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this ever going to end?\" he wondered as he saw Lan was growing even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery one of Lan's steps caused massive shockwaves that leveled buildings all around him. The shockwaves got worse and worse as he grew larger and larger. The military in Lan's home town had notified the neighboring cities about the giant menace and they now rolled in to stop him. Even they knew their efforts were futile as Lan's little toe alone towered above the highest buildings. They tried their best though and were destroyed as Lan's toes grew into them. Soon Lan was, standing, as big as the city is long. But he continued growing even larger! Nothing could stop his rampaging growth, it seemed, as his feet crushed the buildings and smashed the city to bits. Lan moved on, as the city could be covered with his big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud was once more getting cold as he was born ever higher by the increasing Lan. He curled up, pulled his jacket closed tight, and waited to see what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away, in a different area, the two men who had unloaded the truck were arriving at their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think the boss is going to be mad we dropped that box?\" one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, there's plenty of other boxes left.\" the other replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to worry, however, as they entered the building and a voice over the intercom said, \"Workers 1598634 and 158635 report to the CEO's office immediately. That is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hapless workers gulped as they took the elevator to the top floor. Once there, they walked down a long hallway to the CEO's office. They were about to knock when a voice said, \"Enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did so and the door slammed shut behind them. In front of them was a large desk with a high backed chair facing away from them. Several T.V sets were strung from the cieling in front of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you boys had an accident, eh?\" a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no sir! Whe did just what you said and delivered the boxes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then explain this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA T.V clicked on showing a ruin of what was once Lan's home town.

So big that he was starting to travel into the atmosphere. His feet were spreading out, crushing the countryside. Unknown to him, all over the country people were gathering to worship him. They would drive to his feet, and then before they could do anything, the expanding toes would have demolished another city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud was horrified at all of this destruction. His prison between Lans toes was massive, the size of a city. But Chaud had noticed that the toes were no longer growing. Looking out he saw the country shrink away, and then Chaud realised. It seems that he was growing with Lan. It must have been because he was sleeping between Lans godly toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lan grew too big for the planet, he took a breath, but finding nothing but the thin air of the atmosphere, he started to jump around trying to breath. His movements crushed many hundreds of miles. The shockwaves created earthquakes all over the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Lan realised that he was glowing gold. Looking at himself he saw his chest become more muscular, his body to become more buff. He was glowing like a god.<br>\r\nLan realised that the glow was protecting him. He didn't need to breath anymore, as his body expanded into space. His feet started to completely cover the globe, as all that was became crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan jumped and floated into space, and then turned around and looked at the earth. The earth was the size of a golfball, and getting smaller. Lan stretched out his large foot and the planet crashed into his sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny people who survived the destruction looked in horror, as all that could be seen was the sole of a massive teens foot as it crushed the earth into dust. They never had a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar down between Lans toes the tiny Chaud had managed to survive. His tiny body had also started to glow, and it protected him from the vacume of Space. Lan was massive. Chaud had not consumed enough foot sweat to overtake Lan in his growth.

The smaller planets crashed into him, but they were so small he didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud looked out into space, and he saw a collection of smaller planets being drawn into Lans toes. A collection of 5 planets zoomed in between Lans toes, crashing on the skin. Chaud walked over to the planets, (Each larger than earth) and was shocked. Each was the size of a Basketball, and quickly getting smaller. Picking one up he looked down through the atmosphere and saw a tiny society of people, all existing on the tiny planet shrinking in his hands. Chaud realised that he too was a giant, and these tiny people were at his mercy. Grinning, he walked over to another of the planets and lifted his foot up, crushing it. They were down to the size of marbles (Compared to Chaud). Chaud was turned on as he felt like a Giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking all of them up, he dropped them into his mouth. Swallowing the planets, chaud laughed. Until he realised that no matter how big he was, Lan will always be a million times bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Chaud looked around and saw the massive toes shrink. Chaud was growing faster than Lan. He grew until he was tall enough to climb onto Lans foot. But there it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud realised how to grow bigger than Lan. He needed to consume the energy of planets. Walking around the massive big toe he gathered all of the planets he could find. Looking around he noticed while he stopped growing, Lan kept. Soon the toe nail he was sitting on was stretching far into the distance in ever direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud swallowed them and grew as big as half of the big toe nail before he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might take a while...</span></div></div>",

Black holes in the universe had enough power to suck planets, stars, and even light into it's dark maw. So why couldn't Chaud do the same? He let all the air he could out of his lungs, and slowly pulled in his breath. Several planets got caught in the pull and quickly darted into his mouth. Chaud began to grow larger and larger, matching Lan's toe nail again. He drew in breath harder and faster pulling in more and more planets until he could reach Lan's lower leg. He was still too small to be a match for Lan, but he was now big enough to escape from Lan's gravity. He braced himself against Lan's leg and pushed as hard as he could.

However Megaman had no idea was was changing him. \"What is happening to me?\" Megaman said as he heard Lan's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mega-----man?-----are you-----there?\" It was Lan's voice. But something was blocking the transmissions. The strange energy was interrupting all forms of radiowaves, people all over the net were unable to transmit anything over the Net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lan!?\" Megaman shouted as he felt his muscles bulging, his spandex Navi Uniform. A rarity amongst Navi's, only a few wore actually clothes. Others were just armoredized. His blue spiky hair still stayed the same, bug his helmet began to grow tight. \"Lan!?\" He called out again as he pulled of his helmet. He didn't want his partner gone, he could never dream of something like this happening. His blue spiky hair fell free in the air as he started to cry tears. He didn't know why, but the bond that was lost between him and Lan seemed to be hurting him for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His body grew slowly at first but began to gain pace. His shoes grew along with him, made of the same cyber spandex as his clothes. Thankfully they grew with him. Soon his body was twice his height, then thrice his size. He stood fifteen feet tall. Making him one of the biggest class Navi's on the net. \"What is happening to me!?\" Megaman thought as his growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Meanwhile---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Heh heh heh!\" Said as evil voice in the darkness. He watched the battle and the beginning transformation take place. \"Now that Megaman has begun to ascend into a god I too have that power thanks to our connection! And soon I will take my rightful place as ruler of Navi's and Humans. And Lan shall stand by my side!\" Said the evil Navi. He had tight purple and black spandex. Purple spiky hair and blood red eyes. He looked exactly like Megaman. And there was a reason for this:He is Megaman's other half. Dark Megaman.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, his clothes were stretchy enough to grow with him, though depending on how big he got they might survive. He stopped growing when he was about thirty feet tall. He wasn't used to being so big and it took a little while for him to get his bearings. When he did, he started heading for the main are of the Net. He had to try and reconnect with Lan before something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman was surprised with how fast he was able to get there. There was no Navi that he knew of that was as big as he was now. He smiled at that. He'd be able to protect the Net from anything now! He thanked Dynamicman silently in his head for giving him this, no doubt, unintentional gift. Once he was in the main area of the Net he started checking connections to find the one that was Lan.

His muscles bulging, his spandex stretching, and the data inside  him absorbing all forms of data. It was like he is Gospel, the ravenous data absorbing Virus he had absorbed into himself and became the destroyer of the net(briefly). Megaman watched as Navi's shrunk smaller and smaller, becoming more insignificant to him. If he could get to Net City he'd be able to stop whatever it was that was causing him to change. He ran forth, with each second he grew and grew until he stood a towering 60ft. tall. He was the largest Navi to ever exist. And he had just started to get bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Megaman traveled the vast plain that is the net. Viruses appeared and were deleted simply by standing in front of Megamans feet. His feet crushing them easily as he walked. And whatever viruses that didn't die because of his feet logged out of the server to another, afraid of suffering the same fate. Navi's that were spread out amongs the net virusbusting or working would stand in awe and shock as Megaman walked by. Unable to hide how looking at this massive figure of power made them feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But Megaman simply ignored them. He had more important things to do. \"Now where's the nearest transporter to Net City?\" Megaman said as he walked on, ignoring the viruses and Navi's as they stared at  him. Megaman traveled across the entire server, searching for the transporter. Seeing a transporter that had large groups of Navi's coming in and out, Megaman smiled. \"I found it.\" He walked over, knocking out the new Navi's as they attempted to go off and hang out with their friends. Megaman stepped forth into the transporter and was sent off, to Net City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Net City was relatively peaceful today. No viruses were rampaging, Darkloids weren't trying to delete everything they see, and any evil organizations going for world domination were silent. Today was a great day for Navi's! As Megaman was teleported to the transporters, Navi's of every shape and size stared in awe as they saw him towering above the cyber buildings like a god. But Megaman ignored them. He was here on a mission, and that was to reach the center of Net City and communicate with Lan. He stepped forth, crushing and deleting a group of Navi's underneath him. But still they stared in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Megaman walked through the city streets, his feet destroying and deleting chunks of the ground. Megaman watched as the Navi's continued on with their normal day routines, even though they couldn't communicate with their Owner. Some were even taking the time to relax. There was no chaos or disorder like there might be outside the net. Megaman even walked by Higsbys shop. Numberman sat outside snoozing happily. He wasn't even trying to run the shop! 'Navi's can be so weird sometimes.' Megaman thought as he walked through the city. Soon he arrived at the intended spot:The Communications Tower. Grabbing it, Megaman began to send data through it. He hoped it was going to send out any data. But nothing happend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why won't this work? I want to talk to Lan!\" Megaman said in a rage. His impatience was growing, until finally he ripped out the communications tower. The giant tower was absorbed into his body, vanishing like it didn't even exist. That's when he felt something else. The data throughout the entire city was being absorbed into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Meanwhile---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dark Megaman watched with a evil smile. His body continued to grow like Megamans did, but he was able to interface with the system. He felt himself growing bigger, stronger, faster. Like Megaman, his spandex clothes and shoes had grown. His  helmet was tossed aside, deemed useless by him. His purple hair falling just like Megamans. He hated how he looked just like that inferior Navi. Were it not for his blood red eyes, purple and blue spandex, and his purple hair he would look just like him. But that would soon all change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Poor Megaman. Not realizing that by absorbing Dynamoman's evolvirus he would transform not only himself, but me as well. And soon I will enter the real world with flesh and blood. Just like Megaman will now that hes absorbed that. And then I'll take Lan as mine and absorb my former self!\" He laughed with a cackle. Things were working towards his favor. Soon, he would be bigger than the net. Then, when he enters the human world he'll grow bigger with Lan. Of course thats when he teaches Lan how to absorb the virus. He would of course, because by then he'll have absorbed Megaman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----In Lans Bedroom---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lan was getting worried. After waiting forever to hear from Megaman, he had tried to contact his mom and dad. His dad was working at Scilab while his mom was visiting with friends. Lan had tried everything he could to call Megaman or his parents. He phoned them, he sent e-mails,  and he even tried to mail them a letter. But as soon as he stepped outside, people who had lost contact with their Navi's were going beserk. They rampaged, burned buildings, homes, cars, tossed over objects and painted anywhere they could. Without the net, people were going insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Seeing this, Lan thought it was better to wait to see if anyone would get through to him. So he locked the doors and windows just to make sure no crazy came in and started rampaging. He went to his bedroom and sat on his bed, holding his PET. He face filled with worry as he looked at it. \"I wish Megaman was here. He would make sure nothing happend.\" Lan said as he sat there. \"Megaman.\"</span></div></div>",

He felt like he was going to explode from the amount of information coursing through his components. But he didn't of course. He merely grew more! It went faster and faster as the city's data entered him, pusing ever upwards. Navis from around the net looked up and up as Megaman towered hugely over everything. Net City was gone, all its data now inside Megaman. And he wasn't even close to being done! His body became like a data black hole, sucking in more and more data, making him bigger and bigger. Since the Net was an unlimited space full of data, Megaman couldn't absorb it all. But absorbed enough to reach the limits of the Net itself. All of the individual landmarks were lost to a seething roil of data. He felt himself pressing against the edges of the Net, like being inside a steadily shrinking box. Just when he didn't think he'd be able to take it anymore, he felt the walls giving way. He caught a glimpse of what looked like an inverted version of himself, grinning maliciously, before he was dumped out of the Net entirely, and into the Real World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Meanwhile--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan pressed button after button, trying his hardest to activate his dead PET. But nothing was working. He sighed, lonely and worried about what was happening. He wondered where Megaman could possibly be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his PET began to emit a huge bright light! Lan dropped the machine and covered his eyes, trying to see what was happening. His PET exploded, shards of the machine richocheting off the walls and clattering to the floor. The light disappeared and Lan could see. He was amazed at the sight that stood before him. His room was nine feet tall, meaning the Megaman that was standing in his room was at least eight feet tall. He looked around in surprise, then down at Lan. Lan jumped off his bed and said, \"Megaman! You're alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\" He said, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get out of the Net? There's not a scanner near here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I broke free. I'm not data anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan looked skeptical of that, but he moved across to Megaman and reached up to his chest. Megaman bent down slightly and Lan felt around for something. He found it. Megaman had a heart and it was beating. Lan looked surprised and said, \"How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman explained everything that happened from Dynamoman and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty crazy story.\" Lan said. \"But I'm just glad you're alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman smiled at his partner and said, \"Same here.

Lan fell back on his bed from the sudden movement. Megaman simply sat there shocked as wood dust started to cover the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your really big.\" Lan giggled as he got back on his feet. He looked at his bed and was surprised by how quickly the bed broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah. But forget this Lan.

Pondering on recent events. Megaman began to feel the tight spandex suit of his becoming uncomfortable to his new body. He pulled the right half of the spandex from his shoulder until it was down far enough to reveal his hands. Megaman pulled the ohter side down and then he pulled it from his chest to the lower half of his abs. Megamans body flexed with superhuman strength, but the suits were designed for any sort of damage. Even a growing titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Megaman!?

I want to be free of this useless suit for something better.\" Megaman said as he pulled the rest of it down. Finally he pulled the spandex off and tossed it aside, leaving him in his boots. Megaman sat down as he pulled of the boots, allowing his feet to be freed from their eternal prison. Megaman wiggled his toes, having never seen them before in his life. \"I feel perfect now.\" Megaman said happily as he turned to Lan, whose entire face was deep red as he looked away. \"Something wrong Lan?\" Megaman asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can you put on something else please!?\" Lan said as he tried not to look at the giant Net Navi. He was feeling excited by the sight of this giant, but he couldn't let Megaman know that. Looking a little over to where Megaman stood; he saw his blankets still laying on his bed. \"Please use that to cover yourself.\" Lan pointed over at the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Megaman looked over and saw how uncomfortable Lan was. \"Okay.\" He said as he grabbed the blanket and wrapped it around his body into a toga. \"This isn't as good as it was before. But its better than that suit.\" Megaman walked over and lifted Lan effortlessly by the armpits. He sat back down and put the small boy into his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lan yelped as he felt himself being carried easily by the giant. As he was placed in Megamans lap, he looked up and stuttered \"W-W-What are ya gonna do now Mega?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I plan on resting here with you proctected by my body in case any crazies appear and start attacking.\" Megaman said as he lowered himself down onto the ground. He yawned and stretched out. \"I feel so tired Lan, so please stay here in my sight.\" Megaman stroked Lans small cheek with a hand tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Even though he felt like gasping or screaming; Lan found himself unable to move away from this giant. The sight of this god so protective and warm towards him stopped any fear in Lans heart. \"Sure.\" He told him as he felt himself in the embrace of Megamans arms, laying out upon his chest as he felt a sleepiness also overcome him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he slept, Megaman began to slowly stretch in size. The toga slowly riding up his body as he grew in his sleep. His body soon hit both sides of the room, yet the two of them slept like nothing was happening</span></div></div>",

In his sleep, his mind was his own, and he was free to think whatever thoughts he wanted. He smiled slightly as he remembered the first time he saw Megaman. He had been dissapointed in such a small navi, but he had grown to like him more and more. Mutual respect was born between the two. Now he couldn't exactly complain that Megaman had a small body could he? His thoughts turned from Megaman to what was happening in the city. All the destruction...who could be behind it? Lan had fought many strong opponents but what could he do against an enemy he didn't even know existed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese troubling thoughts pestered him and he slowly woke up. Instantly, he knew something was wrong. His house was gone! He sat up and felt the ground around him. It was smooth, warm, and pinkish. He put his ear against it and heard a steady thumping, like a beating heart. Lan stood up and said, \"No way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was standing on the chest of a massive Megaman! The net navi had grown even more while they had both been sleeping! Judging by the houses next to him as well as the street, Lan estimated Megaman at thirty feet, give or take a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own heart was thumping fast as he looked around. Suddenly, his eyes locked on Megaman's huge equipment. His face shot red and he quickly looked away. He wondered what they could use to cover him now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt antsy, and so Lan walked up the silky chest and to Megaman's neck. Grabbing the fringes of his hair, he managed to climb to his face. He could heard Megaman breathing lightly through his nose. He walked over to his eyes and tried to lift the lid. That was a no go, so he moved to the lips. The air from the nose was brushing him constantly, but it was oddly comforting. Lan felt the lips, marveling at how soft they felt. He bent down and wondered how they'd feel against his own lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart started beating fast again, as he closed the distance between Megaman's lips and his own. Lan settled on the lower lip and kissed him lightly. Suddenly, the lips parted, and Megaman's voice issued forth, \"What are you doing Lan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan leapt up, blushing red again, and tried to stutter a response. Why oh why had he done this?</span></div></div>",

And seeing you as this big, powerful titan made me want to express my feelings. I'm sorry.\" Lan covered his face with his hands to show his further shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's alright Lan.\" Megaman spoke with a warmth in his voice. Lan turned towards Megaman, removing his hands from his face as he looked up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really Mega? Your not mad at me?\" He asked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes Lan. I could never be mad at you. Because\" He paused for a moment, then continued \"I love you too.\" Megaman said as he brought a finger down Lans back, stroking it gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mega.\" Lan spoke happily as he felt Megamans finger gliding softly over his back. He let out a moan, the good feeling of his finger sending chills up his spine.<br>\r\n Eventually Megaman stopped stroking Lans back and Lan moved closer to Megamans lips and pressed gently against them. Kissing him tenderly. As Lan sat there kissing his lips, he looked up at Megaman. \"So what should we do now Mega?\" Lan asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Megaman smiled as he looked down at Lan, thinking about what to do next. As he finished, he looked at him and said \"Lets relax for now. I want to spend some time with you.\" Lan nodded happily was moved from Megamans face to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Laying down on the hard abs Lan kissed the warm surface and layed across it, staring at the sky.</span></div></div>",

He had supressed the data flow that had given Megaman the size he needed to break free from the Net and was currently 60 feet tall. A size great enough to cause the denizens of the Net great harm and to finally be able to set his plans in motion. With his new found size he had the ability to access massive amounts of data for his own purposes. While he could easily use it to grow large enough to break free from the Net, he would be behind Megaman in size and stood a greater chance of getting deleted. However, if he had reinforcements of his own to help with, then Megaman wouldn't stand a chance! He crushed buildings and navis and viruses alike as he made his way through Net City to the Information Tower. It had rebuilt itself using data from the endless stream of the internet and could now be used again. dark Megaman grabbed the tower in his hands started to call his reinforcements. Within seconds several Darkloids appeared and stood ready for action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up! You are all under my command! I'm sending you to DenTech City where you will wreak as much havoc as possible! If anyone gets in your way, kill them! Let fires burn and no joyful voice be heard! Bring them to their knees and let no man look up at the sky with hope! Once they're begging for mercy, enslave them! Now go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Megaman downloaded the Darkloids using the information tower and they were scanned out into the real world. Dark Megaman sat down next to the tower. He would wait and see how well his Darkloids managed. He didn't expect them to kill Megaman. No, that pleasure was reserved for him. But using them he could gain a foothold in the Real World and more easily control it when the time came. Now, it was only a matter of waiting for the perfect time to make his entrance...</span></div></div>",

His massive muscles effortlessly destroying everything that was pressed against his body. Already he had grown beyond the house and had destroyed Mayl's house. Thankfully shes out in the Bahamas with her family. But Lan couldn't care. All he wanted was to embrace Megaman. After a while Lan's thoughts turned to something. 'What if something happens to Mega because he's this size?' Lan thought as he looked up at his face. Lan was scared that because of his size, people would want to destroy him. Even Nuke him if they couldn't stop him any other way. 'I don't want that to happen.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n So Lan spoke to Megaman \"Mega. We need to make you smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Megaman rose up, carefully moving Lan into his hands as he got up and sat out, his legs free. The surrounding debris and rubble that still stood fell as he carelessly moved. His massive muscles flexing easily with the smallest show of strength. He brought Lan up to his face and looked at him. \"Why should I get smaller Lan? At this size I can protect you from anyone. No one is ever gonna hurt you with me at this size!\" Megaman exclaimed, stroking Lan's head with his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But I'm still worried! I'm afraid someone might try to hurt you since you 60ft. tall! And what am I supposed to do when your gone!?\" Lan asked him with a sadness in his voice. He just didn't want to see Megaman get hurt for no reason. He just hoped he'd see that. He even thought Mega would be attacked simply because he's 60 ft. tall and completly nude since the toga couldn't cover his growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Megaman looked down and examined Lan as he spoke. With a sigh, Megaman spoke. \"Okay Lan. Let's go see Mr. Hikari and see if he can make me smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lan smiled as he hugged Megamans chest as wide as he could. \"Thank you Mega! I'm sure dad will be able to make you normal!\" Lan told him happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then Lan. Should we got to Scilab and see him?\" Megaman asked Lan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah! The sooner we see him about this the better!\" Lan told him. And so the two of them were off. Megaman walked through the city, carelessly destroying homes, offices, and vehicles as he headed north to Scilab. Lan layed happily in Megamans hand. Which had closed around him to protect him. Obliviously he was to the choas being caused by Megaman.</span></div></div>",

He was careful not to step on anyone or anything which was getting increasingly harder to do as the pandemonium got worse. He had actually crushed a few cars, that had been empty, and had been surprised by how easily they flattened under his bare feet. Finally, they got to Scilabs and Megaman plucked Lan off his shoulder and set him down on the ground. Lan ran inside the building up to a receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Lan! I'm guessing you're here to see your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's on the seventeenth floor running some experiment or other. Just take the--GET DOWN!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan instantly dropped to the ground as the receptionist pulled out a taser and blasted someone who had come running in.

What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew.\" Lan replied, heading for the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan ran down the hall of the seventeenth floor and started checking rooms looking for his father. Finally, he found him in a lab performing some experiment. He called out, \"Dad!\" and ran over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hikari pulled off the goggles he had been wearing and said, \"What's wrong Lan? You look worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to believe this but look outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hikari did so and was shocked to see the giant Megaman standing outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! He just burst out of my PET and then started growing! Can you shrink him back down to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hikari thought about it and said, \"There might be a way. But it's going to take some time to work. In the meantime, keep Megaman out of sight! With all these riots going on someone could get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan ran back outside and explained everything to Megaman.

His arms became cannonballs and his back took a perfect V-Shape. His body grew bigger and bigger, with Lan sitting in the palm of Mega's growing hand. By the time the growth spurt had stopped, Megaman grew bigger and bigger. Finally his growth stopped at a towering 120ft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lan stared up in awe, he felt his small naked body getting turned on by Megaman's size. This was beyond embarassing. \"Great! Now we can't hide you!\" Lan said angrily, though not because of Megaman. He knew it wasn't his fault. The problem was that EVERYONE could see them from this height. Within seconds the people in view screamed in terror of the mighty god before them. They ran off towards the distance, knowing that none of their technology worked thanks to the failure of the Net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they looked on, Lan looked up to Megaman with sorrow in his eyes. \"What are we gonna do now Mega!?\" Lan asked him desperately. Megaman looked down at Lan and thought it over for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nothing we can do Lan. This seems to be destined to happen. But don't worry. I'll protect you.\" Megaman cooed to Lan as he stroked the small boys body with his finger. Megaman loved the control he had over Lan. Especially when it reacted to him playing with his body. Lan's small erection grew larger as it excited Megaman. Megaman always wanted to be the supreme being in control. But he always would protect and shelter Lan first. Finally he got his wish. Sitting down upon the hillsides, Mega placed his lips against Lans. \"Let's enjoy the moment for now.\" Mega purred as he began to suck Lans small cock slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oooooh! Mega! Mega! Mega!\" Lan moaned as he felt his cock being sucked, his young juices being used by Mega's body for unknown purposes. Problem was that Lan was ENJOYING being used by his giant Navi. It felt good, even right. Finally after 10 minutes he felt himself ready to explode. \"MEGA!!!!!\" Lan screamed as his juices came forth, trying to fill Megaman's massive mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As they finished, Megaman looked down and smiled at Lan. \"Wasn't that good Lan?\" Mega asked. He enjoyed Lan's taste and was hoping to do this more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes.\" Lan said as he fell down on his palm, exhausted from the game. He began to fall asleep ontop of Mega's hand. \"Let me sleep on you chest Mega.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Megaman nodded and smiled \"Don't worry Lan. No matter how big or strong I get, I will always serve you.\" Megaman layed him on his chest, stroking Lan as he went to bed. Laying down on top of the hillside outside town, Megaman also went to sleep. Dreaming of growing bigger and stronger. But there was another stand next to him, just as big and strong as him as they swallowed all the living people in a town. How they crushed nations to dust, and how they made mankind worship them as gods. The two embraced and even made love above and over the cities they ruled. As he dreamed this strange dream. Megaman realized who is was alongside him. It was Lan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Meanwhile----<br>\r\n Dr. Hikari was experimenting with a small amount of data he obtained from Megaman before he had left. What he obtained shocked him. \"This can't be right! The Giga virus isn't suppose to merge with a Navi and make it huge!? It was part of the supersoldier program we worked on to make humans bigger, stronger, faster, and smarter than the rest of mankind. The fact it infected Mega means that...\" Dr. Hikari heard a deep rumble behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Turning around, he saw the person who had willingly submitted himself to test Megaman's dna standing at a towering height. Big, bulging muscles equal to Megamans filled his body. His stomach was perfectly a hard eight pack. And he stood as tall as 15ft. Which was as big as anyone who taken the Giga Virus ever got. Suddenly his growth stopped(And permanently) as he looked down at Hikari. And his manhood hung out nice and hard. No doubt ready to be released from years of wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hikari himself was getting turned on by how big the willing test subject and scientist was. Looking up at the giant man, he spoke. \"It seems my suspiscions about the formula stopping for a human was right Hikari. It seems since Megaman is a Navi his body reacted differently.\" Said the giant Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hikari looked up and licked his lips \"I thought so Famous. But did we really have to use it on a live test subject? Namely you?\" He asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No. But you have to admit you like this!\" Famous said as he flexed a arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your right.

A protective aura that grew with him as he reached 150ft. tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Megaman your glowing!\" Lan said in surprise. But Megaman could hardly hear him. He was now barely a inch tall and there was no way Megaman could hear him from this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'I have to stop this!' Megaman thought sadly 'If I don't then I will eventually grow big enough that I won't be able to see or hear Lan. I wish I was a hundred feet tall again!'

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The aura surrounded Lan who felt himself start growing almost instantly. Megaman looked excited as he made Lan bigger and bigger. He set Lan down on the ground as he grew too big to hold and getting bigger. Lan was mortified as his clothes ripped off and he was as naked as Megaman, but he quickly got over it as he reached Megaman's height. He grabbed Megaman in a hug and said, \"I'm so glad you can control this now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too Lan.\" Megaman said, rubbing his friend's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other parts of the city, the chaos that had been created by Dark Megaman was slowly disappearing. Without the mastermind, the entire plan was falling apart. The Darkloids that were under Dark Megaman's control lost their purpose and shut down, disappearing back into the Net with nothing to keep them anchored in the Real World. The people were stopping rioting and police were getting things back under control and Lan and Megaman watched it all happen from where they were. They broke their embrace and Lan said, \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Megaman said truthfully. \"And as long as we're together, I don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan smiled and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the next few days cleaning everything up Megaman using his new abilities to alter size to make himself and Lan big and small enough to do almost any job. If there was a huge pile of rubble that would've taken several people to move, Megaman would grow big enough to scoop it all up in one hand. If someone needed someone to hold a beam thirty feet up to attach to a building, Megaman would make Lan big enough to hold it. On and on, the jobs the two could perform together were endless. Soon, the entire city was back to normal, albeit they now had a giant boy and Net Navi in their midst.</span></div></div>",

Many had objected; but fearing the size and power of the giants quickly shut themselves up. The military had tried several times to force the giants to join them. Only for it to end with a huge chunk of the military destroyed. But that was not all that the giants did. The two of them went from their ordinary 50ft. size to 400ft. if necessary. Though the two had gone beyond 400ft. in height. They found they were much more destructive when they were even bigger than that. So they prefered a size between those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While the people at first feared the giants would be hungry and god forbid their wastes would be monumentous. But they had nothing to fear. Neither Lan or Megaman were hungry anymore nor did they have to use the bathroom. The only time the people worried was at night when the two would make love. The very earth shaked and crumbled as they did it over the city upon the hills. Sometimes buildings would crumble from their sex. However more people who admired and worshiped the two as gods moved in when other people were killed or moved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two did anything they could to help the town. From crushing criminals beneath their feet to grabbing and holding a falling building. They even used their love juices to stop a fire. The giants were found to be the perfect lords and masters. Eventually the town simply named itself \"The Democratic Union of the Two Gods\".  Lan and Megaman simply laughed over this. The two of them would visit the rest of Lan's family. Though it was found that Mr. Famous had become the \"unofficial\" new member and was known for making Mrs. and Mr. Hikari to moan all night long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This was another night. The two layed together as the very earth shaked beneath them. They had just made love and had produced their own lake not far off. Lan and Megaman snuggled into each other. \"I love you Mega.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And I love you Lan.\" And so they lived their lives for all eternity. But that was not the end. Eventually the Sun had depleted itself and had gone supernova within the next 10 billion years. Wiping out all life in the solar system. Except for the two of them. As they layed together, embracing each other in their new zone. The two of them comtemplated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know what Mega?\" Lan asked him as he made out with his lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What Lan?\" Mega asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've always wanted to rule my own planet.\" Lan purred<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Megaman smirked as he wrapped his hands around Lan tightly. \"Then let's go find us a planet to rule.\"</span></div></div>",

Like the name, or word, Megaman for instance.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman started to feel a HUGE surge of power inside him and he felt it flowing throughout his entire body. He felt like he was somehow changing. After a few seconds, Megaman felt a huge burst of power and the surge in his body stopped. He looked at himself and asked himself,\"What was that all about!?\" He didn't feel any different at first so he shrugged it off and continued patrolling the Cyberworld. Suddenly, he saw a few computer virus and the were coming straight for him. He readied his blaster again and shot a charge shot at the viruses, but when he did, it shot super quick at them and took a few of them out. Megaman was shocked by the incredible force of his charge shot and thought to himself,\"Maybe that power surge did change me somehow!\" As Megaman was distracted, one of the virus jumped up into air and tried attack him. Megaman saw the attack coming at the last second however, and quickly dodged the attack. He then saw that the other virus were behind him and they quickly attack him with their strongest attack. Megaman thought that he was gone for sure but somehow, he was still standing after the group attack. The virus continued to attack him but with every hit they landed, none of them hurt Megaman in anyway.\"WOW!! I don't what happened to me exactly, but I love it a lot!! I guess I should probably finish off these viruses though.\" Megaman then charged up his blaster and shot a really big and powerful shot at the viruses, wiping them all out at once! He then looked to make sure there wasn't any left and after looking around carefully, he didn't see anymore viruses. Megaman then decided that he'd figure out what happened to him exactly later from Lan and laid down on the digital floor beneath him, taking a short rest. He mumbled in his sleep a bit though, and said some weird and kind of evil things.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman woke up later, and was surprised that Lan didn't show up yet. He would usually call for him at about this time but he soon worried about something a little more concerning. He looked around and saw that he somehow grew to about 120 feet! Megaman stood  up tall and was really confused on how this could have happened to him. He thought of a way though, as he remember what he dreamed about. In his dream, he was the biggest Navi in the entire Net, standing somewhere at about the height that he is now. In his dream though, he was evil, and crushed a ton of his fellow Navi's under his bare foot, as his broke out of his armor and clothes while growing and was completely naked! He continued to destroy a lot of the Net with his massive size and just before he destroyed Net city completely, he woke up. Megaman then assumed that while dream, he must have grown himself to 120 feet tall with another of his strange powers. He thought back for a second though as he thought of something real concerning. He quickly looked at himself and sighed in relief that his armor and clothes somehow grew with him. He then looked around the surrounding area to make sure he didn't actually destroy or kill anyone in his sleep. Luckily for him, he didn't see anything around him destroyed and didn't see another Navi around for miles. He sighed in relief, but now focused on the current situation. He was still massive and needed to find a way to shrink back down to normal size in case he dream somehow becomes reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe consider going to Net city, but after that dream, he couldn't bring himself to go there for answers. He decided to search elsewhere in the Cyberworld for answers. He looked around for about a few hours, but he somehow got lost.\"I guess whatever happened to me earlier made me forget a few things about the Cyberworld. This isn't good.\" The giant Navi said to himself, as he started to worry a lot. He started losing faith in becoming normal size again and sighed. Heck, at this rate, he doubted getting back to Net city. He started thinking to himself in depression,\"I just wish that I could have at least seen Lan in the real world one last time, but with the bad luck going on for me, The whole Net will soon find me and think I'm some sort of monster. Then they'll try and get rid of me.\" He then wished that he could maybe grow big enough to escape the Net and upon wishing that, he felt something changing inside him. He suddenly grow and grow more massive by the second until eventually, he was too big for the entire Net to handle! He then broke through the walls and saw what looked like a human version of himself before he broke through the Net and was thrown into the real world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...in Lan's world at this time....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan's PET was off and Lan wasn't in his house. Instead, he was in detention because someone beat up a kid earlier and framed Lan for it when the teachers came. Lan was in his chair, sighing and thinking to himself,\"When can I go home? Megaman's probably worried sick about me, not to mention my parents.\" Luckily for Lan, as soon as he finished that thought, the teacher keep him in detention said,\"Alright Lan, you can go home now. But don't ever beat up someone ever again, or else you'll being seeing me everyday here! Got it!?\" Lan wanted to argue that he didn't do anything, but he really wanted to check on Megaman so he said,\"OK, I'll try really hard not to! Goodbye!!\", and ran out the door, running home as fast as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Lan, when Megaman broke through the Net, the PET turned on by itself and a flash of light filled his room. The Pet then exploded into a ton of pieces and Megaman came out, now in a human-like form! He was a little dizzy at first, but felt better after a few seconds. Megaman looked around and saw that he was in Lan's room. He could tell because of the drawing Lan made of him on his desk. He then looked at himself in the mirror and said to himself,\"I guess whenever I think about growing myself, I grow to what height I thought about. Maybe I can shrink myself and I'm go back into the---\" before looking down at his boots. He saw broken pieces of Lan's PET everywhere. He then realized tat there's no going back now. He's now stuck in Lan's world. He sighed and sat down on his bed to wait for Lan to get home so he could at least surprise him a bit by his visit. He then felt a strange feeling when sitting down on the bed and thought that it felt different somehow. He took over his armor and clothes real quick and saw that he somehow became human. He then put on his clothes and armor and thought to himself,\"I guess he'll also be surprised when he finds out that I'm now human, because I know I am!\" He then heard the door downstairs open and heard a voice shouting out loud for the entire house to hear,\"MOM! DAD! I'M HOME!\" Megaman recognized the voice as Lan's and smiled in excitement. Meanwhile, Lan was confused that his parents weren't home. He figured that they went out shopping maybe and would come back home later. He then said to himself,\"Well, nothing to do now except check on my PET and see if Megaman's OK.\", and then ran upstairs. He opened his door and just stood there, staring in complete shock of what, or who rather, was waiting for him on his bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another day, another viral outbreak. These things just can't be avoided or ignored. Chaud was currently heading towards main street where a viral program had been uploaded into the traffic lights. From there, it had spread to generators nearby and it would eventually, if given time, spread to the citys main power grid, giving control to the entire city over to whomever set the virus loose. It didn't take Chaud long to find the closest port to jack in his PET. He quickly downloaded Protoman into the traffic lights. He soon arrived in the digital battleground. He looked around, ready for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice called out, \"You dare come into Gigaman's domain?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtoman looked from left to right but couldn't see who was speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy! Down here ya big idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtoman looked down and saw a tiny robot by his left foot. It had long cord like arms with clamps on the end connected to his thin torso and hammer like legs. His head was like a pill with two orbs for eyes on either side of it.  His mouth was set into his head with sharp teeth like a garbage disposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've incurred the wrath of Gigaman!\" The creature declared, punching Protoman's foot feebly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtoman sweatdropped at his efforts and pushed the tiny robot over. Gigaman jumped back up and shouted up, \"Is that the best you've got? HA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtoman lifted his foot and stomped on Gigaman. He ground his foot into the ground for good measure and lifted his foot. He annoyedly scraped Gigaman off his boot and began exterminating other virus programs in the area. Gigaman, barely alive, pressed a button on his chest. His eyes began to flash like lamps on and off in some kind of signal. Protoman stopped as he heard a strange buzzing. A large black cloud was flying towards him! He tried to attack it, but it broke apart and avoided damage everytime. The cloud converged on Gigaman and began to attach to him. Protoman watched in amazement as the once tiny robot began to enlarge at a rapid rate, his thin arms bulkking up and his torso widening. His teeth jutted from his mouth into sinister daggers. Talons erupted from the flat surface of his feet as he continued to enlarge. Soon each toe talon soared over Protoman's head in a sinister arc as Gigaman stopped growing. His rumbling laughter filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised? Each speck in that black cloud was a virus manufactured in my body. When they return to my body, they activate a program that stimulates growth in my own programing causing this spectacular transformation! Now prepare to be crushed, puny robot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigaman was gigantic, but also slow. Protoman easily dodged each of his attacks and began scaling Gigaman's body. Soon, he reached his head and struck a weak joint in his neck. Sparks exploded from the wound and Gigaman dwindled down to his normal puny size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\" He said, looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtoman stomped Gigaman again, harder, making sure he was scrapped. The viruses began disappearing until the area was clean and functioning normally. But even now, Gigaman was still alive! With his last strength, he sent a virus program to hit Protoman. But it missed and travelled down the link out of this digital domain and into Chaud's PET. A shock made Chaud jump in surprise. He stared at the small red welts on his fingers and palms. He began to feel woozy and faint. Little did he know, a dangerous virus had entered his body.</span></div></div>",

But this thought was quickly overshadowed by this thought: How big would he grow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan was thinking that very same question. But first he needed to know what caused this. He pulled out his PET and called up Megaman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appeared on the screen and said, \"Yo Lan! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have time to explain.

Finally, he burst through the door on the top of the building and, gasping for breath, looked for a place to escape. Within minutes Chaud's toes peaked over the edge of the building. He had grown so large, his big toe alone was almost as wide as the building. But the growth stopped. Lan breathed a sigh of relief as Chaud wasn't getting any bigger. His relief was short lived as the building began to shake. Lan watched in horrified amazement as Chaud's foot expanded, twice the size of the building, then three times its size! The building no longer reached the top of his heel it was so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was blocked out, from Lan's perspective, as the massive sole of his foot rose into the sky. Chaud laughed as he felt whatever had tried to stop his growth disappear and his growth continued steadily onward. This was the second time his growth had come in a burst. The first had been in his mansion. But when these hiccups came they seemed to stop the growth for a period of time then, when the growth came back, it was stronger than ever! Chaud shifted his foot and saw Lan had passed out. He reached out and picked him up. What to do with his little friend now...</span></div></div>",

Here he found a problem with being so big. When he was growing in his house, he expanded out of his clothing, so now there were no pockets to keep Lan in. It also was unwise to put him in the city, because the City was currently being demolished by Chaud's expanding body parts. Chaud looked at his feet, but decided he couldn't put Lan between his toes, not yet anyway. He looked up his body, and noticed that along with his growth, his body had developed into a toned muscular figure. Staring at his beautiful Abdominal muscles, Chaud decided on a Location for Lan. Holding the dimishing boy with his fingers, Chaud stuck Lan in a lock of hair above his eyes in his fringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Lan was safe, Chaud could turn his attention back to the city below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed that while he was busy with Lan, the army had been setting up their forces, and they were advancing a few miles from the sole of his right foot. They had taken advantage of him being distracted, and also because his growth had stopped to get ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortuately for them, the periods of not growing were always followed by a period of rapid growth. Chaud could feel it coming, and quickly he expanded again and again and again in bursts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny army men watched as the massive foot that was several miles away suddenly doubled in size and stopped for a few seconds, the sole of the foot only a few feet from the front men. In these few seconds they looked up, but the foot had surpassed the higest skyscrapers many times. The heel alone was many times taller than the tallest of the buildings that used to exist. And its width was scary. It was just a wall of flesh infront of them. One soldier reached out a hand and touched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that took less than a couple of seconds. With the second burst of growth, the army was totally gone, completely destroyed by the foot.</span></div></div>",

He grinned down at the tiny construct now only a crater big enough for his foot to cover. And as the growth continued, his foot soon covered it entirely like it had never existed. And really, to anyone who mattered, it didn't exist. Chaud could only wonder how big he would grow before he stopped. Looking up he realized, if he didn't stop, he'd eventually pass into space. That worried him for a few minutes, but since his body had somehow developed muscles on its own, he was sure it could cope with the complications of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lan snoozed on, trapped on the follice of growing hair.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cosmos itself seemed to shudder as Lan and Chaud began absorbing the Sun-- the golden aura of their bodies intensified into a brilliant iridescence, and the great ball of gas began to slowly shrink, its energies draining into the two growing gods with each second. The feeling was incredible, and both of them moaned out in sheer pleasure as solar power suffused into every cell of their bodies...and all the while, they grew, their bodies stretching bigger in all directions while their muscles swelled and bloated, and their throbbing members pulsed thicker and harder. They held hands all the way, watching as planets, stars, and nebulae shrank smaller and smaller around them, and as the sun offered up its last reserves of energy, the lovers felt that true godhood was at last upon them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan's eyes suddenly shot open as a twinge of something resembling fear went down his spine. All around him was darkness...not the comforting, calm darkness of the void, but a tense, frightening cloak of stygian black filled with unknown threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...hey, Chaud, something's wrong!\" he said, trying to shake his companion out of his pleasant reverie. \"I think we're lost or something...we need to stop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other giant seemed annoyed, opening one eye and glaring at Lan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you backing out now? When we stand on the precipice of true godhood?! Nothing can stand in our way, all will be consumed by--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude-- snap OUT of it, okay?! I think we're in trouble-- aaaahh!!\" At that moment, both boys suddenly found themselves yanked downward by the cruel hold of gravity, and as they fell from an incomprehensible height, the darkness around them gave way to the blinding light of twin suns...the two were being drawn toward a mysterious, gargantuan planet, seemingly bigger than entire star systems and situated in a strange realm beyond known space. The land around them was a vast desert, and as the two lovers fell from orbit they began to catch fire-- they were unharmed, of course, thanks to their new powers, but the feeling of going from \"ascension\" to being at the mercy of Newton's laws was a humbling experience, at best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they landed with meteoric force in the centre of a vast series of dunes, creating a giant mushroom cloud of sand and digging themselves into a deep crater. Lan was the first to get back up, pulling himself out of the crater and looking out across the desert, shaken but no worse for the wear. Both had seemed to stop growing for the time being, though their eyes and skin still glowed faintly with golden power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...what IS this place?\" the brunette asked out loud, while Chaud slowly pulled himself to his own feet, spitting out a mouthful of alien sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's-- ptuh!-- an insult, is what it is! We were so close...I could FEEL godhood within our grasp, but then this...this...PLACE appeared. Mocking us, tearing the promise of ultimate power away from our deserving-- !\" At this point, Lan reached out and placed a finger over Chaud's mouth, clearly having had just about enough of his tantrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, dude...I admit the whole 'godly' act is a HUGE turn-on, but maybe stow it for now? Whatever we were doing, we're stuck here now, and we gotta figure out what's going on...\" Chaud's face fell, but Lan reached out a hand to his cheek and looked him in the eye, his expression one of pure love. \"It's okay...I still want to ascend together with you-- it just looks like we gotta work a little harder for it, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...well, okay,\" he replied after a short pause, leaning in to peck his boyfriend on the lips. \"I guess there's no way to go but forward from here...\" And that they did, setting out in a random direction across the strange desert...it was a small consolation, at least, that Chaud was able to admire Lan's inhumanly sexy body the whole way-- both were, of course, completely naked, sporting muscles that would put the biggest of bodybuilders to shame, and immense, swinging cocks that hung past their knees and flopped about with each powerful step. Intentionally hanging back to the rear, he was also able to get a good look at Lan's tight, shapely, round ass...maybe a little more time on this mortal plane wouldn't be <i>so</i> bad.</span></div></div>",

Then it became apparent to him, that even though the ground was still getting farther and farther away, Chaud didn't seem to be getting any bigger.

So even if they grew at the same exponential rate (As in Triple the size every so often) since Chaud's size was immensely more massive, Chaud would continue to grow out of range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan decided that he had enough of being at Chauds feet.

Things had settled down considerabley this spring. There had been hardly any viral outbreaks or evil NetNavis attacks. This gave Lan time enough to concentrate on his studies...if he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd we all know he didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, the final bell rang and the students were let free. Lan quickly slipped on his rollerblades and dashed home. He closed his eyes and sighed a sigh of relief. It was the weekend. No school for three days! He was lookking forward to having some fun with his friends. He opened his eyes and shouted in surprise. Chaud was standing right in his path! He quickly hit the brakes and skidded to a stop. Unfortunatley, he couldn't do it fast enough and the two boys ended up colliding in a none too favorable position. They quickly extricated themselves and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Lan said, putting a hand behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud brushed his arms and said, \"You should watch where you're going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" Lan said, turning away slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began to walk together. Lan had already taken off his rollerblades and slung them over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are your plans for the weekend?\" Lan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud shrugged and said, \"Yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan began to rattle off everything he planned to do this weeked. Chaud listened in disbelief. There was no way anyone could do that much in such a short time. Lan's babbling was cut short as a man in a trenchcoat suddenly came running up to them. He wasn't watching where he was going and collided into Lan. The man stumbled but kept running as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch where you're going!\" Lan yelled out, shaking a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud wasn't listening. The man had apparently dropped some kind of gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nerve of some people!\" Lan said, mostly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over and saw Chaud holding the strange looking gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that thing?\" Lan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud shook his head and examined it. It had a trigger like most guns, but on the side was a switch. There was an S on one side and a G on the other. Chaud flicked the switch to G and and then S and back to G to see if anything would happen. Nothing did. He set it back to G. Lan got up behind him and said, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud jumped and turned around, accidently pulling the trigger. Lan was bathed in a strange green aura of light that faded as soon as Chaud let go of the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Lan yelled out. \"What did you do that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, you just surprised me. You shouldn't sneak up on people like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Lan grabbed the gun and fired it at Chaud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud was unhurt but jumped and covered himself anyway. Lan stopped quickly and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're even!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud looked at his watch and exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I've got to go. I've got something important to do that I nearly forgot about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. See you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys went their seperate ways.</span></div></div>",

His back was pressed against one wall, while his legs, bent at the knee were pressing against the other wall. He was packed like a sardine in his room!

Trying to twist around to his side, his toe created a large dent in the back wall. The slightest tap of it damaged the wall alot. Even though he was cramped, this made him smile.<br>\r\nLeaning back, he pressed his left foot against the wall, and sent it through into the next room. Lan sighed as he stretched his left leg out. He then turned and pressed his right leg through the wall, stretching it out as well. Finally he leaned back, and his torso burst through the wall behind him and into the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Lan noticed he was sitting outside, and was even bigger. His legs were still in the house, at least from below his knees. Lan could feel his toes brushing the celing inside. Looking over the roof, he saw as his toes slowly pushed through the roof, taking up all of the space inside. Finally Lan stood up, and raised his foot over his home. It was just covered by his sole, and he let it drop, crushing his once home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he spied something big over at Chauds mansion. He turned and walked down the street towards Chaud's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*-*-*-*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe highschool swim team had just finished their training. Leaving the pool the ground walked down the street. Suddenly there was a boom and the ground shook.<br>\r\n\"What the fuck was that\" one exclaimed.<br>\r\nThey turned and looked up the street, and were shocked. Walking towards them was an immense boy, he was massive that his foot was the size of a house. Each step he took shook the ground, and he was wearing nothing but a tight pair of briefs. They team turned and ran, but they couldn't run fast enough. Within two steps the giant was near. The team kept sprinting, but suddenly a dark shadow covered the road. Freezing on the spot they looked up. As if in slow motion, a gigantic dirty foot covered their sky. It lowered itself closer and closer. They could see the individual valleys of the foot, and smell it as well.<br>\r\nWith a single crunch, the team was flattened under the massive weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*-*-*-*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLan carried on walking, turned on by his own power. The insects he crushed were meaningless to him, but they did do one thing. His large cock in his briefs was getting hard from the power.</span></div></div>",

He then forced his way through Lan's virgin hole. Chaud started hump Lan. Lan tried to protest but all that came out were crys of pleasure. Lan than couldn't help but start to rub his own penis and it didn't take long for that to get hard. However the pleasure became too much for the two of them.

Before he could take his shoes off, he realized that his shoes were pinching his feet and making his toes hurt. Chaud took of his shoes and knew exactly what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, could you come and give me a foot rub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as he said it, James walked in, ready to give Chaud his \"Well deserved\" foot rub. He lied down on his bed, and James started rubbing. But, James noticed something strange. Chaud's foot seemed to be bigger than usual, and he would know, having to rub his feet every once in a while. Though, he believed that it was just a small<br>\r\ngrowth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done, just as you wished Sir Chaud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames left the room, and Chaud tried to get comfortable on his bed, But couldn't. He rolled around on his bed for a few minutes, and still couldn't get comfortable. That is when he noticed that his feet were hanging about two inches off of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud stood up, and looked himself over in the mirror. He was completely shocked. He was about a foot taller, and noticed that aasix-pack of abs was forming. His once baggy pants were getting very tight, and were slightly ripped at the edges. It was then when he realized that the beam that Lan had shot at him, and that the beam that he had shot at Lan was causing him to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Chaud decides to do is....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Chaud stood in front of his mirror, a cocky grin formed on his face as he flexed his bicep and watched is slow rise up, and up, and up! Now taller than most adults, he jumped on his bed, sitting cross-legged on it, his entire body trembling in excitement. He loved the feeling of his clothes slowly straining more and more against his slowly growing, young, muscular body. He took in a slight breath, causing the buttons on his pajama shirt to all pop off, revealing his slowly developing pecs and six-pack, his thighs causing his pants to rip at the seams slightly, his calves slowly bulging out more and more. His manhood was barely being contained by his boxers, the young man excited in more than one way. Chaud looked down at his feet to see that his toes had popped throught the front of his socks, while many other holes had formed, each one slowly growing larger as his feet continued to ever so slowly expand. Not liking how tight his socks felt, Chaud ripped each one off, allowing his big feet to breath. He wiggled his large toes in delight, knowing that, even though it wasn't very noticeable, he was still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as he sat, relaxed, and admired himself, Chaud couldn't help but get bored. Sure, he was big, and surely getting bigger, but he needed something to occupy himself with, or he'd fall asleep! And who knows, he could wake up tomorrow, stuck in his room! The thought made Chaud giggle with excitement. How big would he get? He really didn't care, he just wanted to be awake for every minute of his massive growth spurt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... what to do...\" Chaud muttered to himself, yawning right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaud was answered as he heard his stomach rumble, his hunger becoming apparent. He gently rubbed his abs as he decided he'd get something to eat! He unfolded his legs, his huge feet landing on the floor with a loud slapping sound. As he stood up, his head still a few feet away from his higher than average ceilling, a series of snapping and ripping sounds flooded the room. Chaud could only watch as him standing up caused his pants to literally burst off, his calves and thighs bulging outwards on his longer legs, the scraps falling to the floor. His shirt was next, ripping completely down Chaud's back, his lats now visible, his body now free of any clothes besides his boxers, which were, at this point, being strained to the point where his manhood was clearly outlined on the skin tight material. Chaud smirked as he slightly bounced his larger pecs, his joy of getting bigger clear. He looked down at his shoes, and put his right foot next to them. At this point, his foot was nearly two times bigger than his shoe! Now a little taller than seven feet tall, and still getting bigger, Chaud walked down stairs towards the kitchen, his huge feet sending loud thumping sounds throughout the house, causing his smile to grow larger.</span></div></div>",

As Chaud was about to knock, he could feel himself grow again. His arms had completely ripped out of his selves, his tight pants were now tight shorts with a little groin problems with his shirt getting tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man this is getting worse. LAN!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one knock, Chaud had completely demolished the door. Chaud wasn't all that worried and was more concerned about what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LAN!!

We barely fit in your room anymore and not to mention we're totally naked. We have to find that gun and figure out how to get back to normal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Lan said.
